michael haneke is known for his disturbing movies like "funny games". this time he adopted elfriede jelineks "die klavierspielerin", which is probably her best work so far. jelinek always writes about abusive behaviour in families, and especially of the suppression of women in a patriarchal society.erika kohut (isabelle huppert) works as a piano teacher at the viennese consevatory. she still lives with her mother (annie giradot), they even sleep in the same bed (already a hint of something strange). erika bullies her students the same way she's bullied by her mother and secretly watches porn movies and plays sadomasochistic games with herself. a student, walter (benoit magimel), falls in love with her, but she refuses to simply sleep with him. she wants to play her games with him, but he's disgusted. he reluctantly follows her rules, which means disaster for both of them.haneke has a very clear picture language, everything is filmed in a almost spartanic way, so the complex characters and story are enhanced.people who don't know austria very well may be don't realize how essential the setting is for the story. jelinek (as well as other great austrian writers like thomas bernhard) suffers from the coldness and casualness in austrian families and society. austrians (at least viennese people) are often unable to articulate their pains, wishes, they suppress their emotions, so there often enough is no real love, affection and nearness in their families. in a society, where it's more important to show a perfect facade to society (even if this means to protect crimes within families as erika and her mother protect walters rape of erika to avoid a scandal) than to deal with your emotional problems it's probably no wonder that sigmund freud founded the psychoanalysis in vienna. erika has a cold and distant relationship with her mother, they only time they share some emotions is very violent and not at all loving. erika replaces her hidden emotions with wishes for violence, so that she can finally release some feelings. but she has nobody who really wants to speak about her emotions so in the end she has to stab herself to ease her inner pain.isabelle huppert shows her best performance of her career (as well of most other actresses). with a unsmiling face you often see only a hint of emotion in her face, a quick smile, a glance with her eyes. and in the end her pain is masterly displayed without a single tear. benoit magimel and annie giradot also turn in powerful performances, but the movie belongs to huppert.

isabelle huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation. "la pianiste" truly confirms it. as if that wasn't enough, annie girardot plays her mother and annie girardot is one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation. so, as you may well imagine, those pieces of casting are worth the horror we're put through. isabelle and annie play characters we've never seen before on the screen. a mother and daughter yes but with such virulent fearlessness that sometimes i was unable even to blink or to breath. personally, i don't believe in the director's intentions, i don't believe they (the intentions that is) go beyond the shocking anecdote and the ending made me scream with frustration but i was riveted by the story written in the face of the sensational huppert and the fierceness of girardot's strength. i highly recommend it to cinema lovers anywhere and to the collectors of great performances like me, you can't afford to miss "la pianiste"

i saw this film at the 2001 toronto international film festival. la pianiste reinforces the "austrians=grim" thesis i'm formulating. isabelle huppert won a well-deserved best actress award at cannes for her portrayal of a woman who, in her efforts to attain the artistic ideal, loses her humanity. trapped by her talent, she suppresses her emotions and her sexuality until they can only be expressed in twisted and terrifying ways. when a younger student falls in love with her, our hopes rise, but are soon dashed by the realization that she cannot experience love the way others can. it is too late for her, and the film's final 30 harrowing minutes are, tellingly, devoid of the beautiful music that carried the first 90 minutes. the message seems to be that the music itself is not enough without the life and beauty it's describing.

if you think piano teacher erika kohut (isabelle huppert) in michael haneke's film "la pianiste" is the ultimate degree in the personification of derangement, perversion and darkness, i've got news for you: the piano teacher in elfriede jellinek's novel "la pianiste" (on which the film was based) is twice as "repulsive", "disgusting", "deranged" and even more fascinating -- though there can't be words enough to translate the level of artistic proficiency that isabelle huppert has reached here, above all other mortal actresses in activity today. and who else could have played this character with such emotional power, complete with the best piano playing/dubbing an actor could deliver?in the novel as in the film, there are two big antagonists to the "heroine" kohut: her own mother (wonderful, wreck-voiced annie girardot, in a part originally intended for jeanne moreau) and austria itself. the mother personifies jellinek's perception of her native austria as a country that deceptively and perversely encourages racist/fascist (or at least authoritarian) behavior, sexual and emotional repression, and, let's say, übermensch ideals which are impossible to keep today without the danger of a mental breakdown."la pianiste" also deals with a very powerful and delicate issue: how dangerous it is to reveal your innermost fantasies to the one (you think) you love. we tend to think our own sexual fantasies must be as exciting to others as they are to ourselves, which may turn out to be a huge, embarrassing and sometimes tragic mistake. here, kohut learns (?) the lesson in the most painful and humiliating of ways.it must be mentioned that elfriede jellinek is one of the best-known and praised authors in austria and europe (well, now she's got a nobel prize!) and that autobiographical passages can be inferred in her novel, as she herself was a pianist and had a reportedly difficult relationship with her mother. the novel also includes long passages about kohut's childhood and adolescence so you kind of understand how she turned into who she is now. haneke chose to hide this information in the film, forcing us to wonder how she got to be that way (don't we all know a erika kohut out there?). but he very much preserves the fabric of the book in his film: unbearable honesty, to the point where most secretive, "horrendous" feelings painfully emerge -- envy, cruelty, violence, jealousy, hate, misery, sadism, masochism, selfishness, perversion etc. all of them unmistakably human.i thought "la pianiste" was a deeply moving film, very disturbing and thought-provoking, with a handful of unforgettable scenes, and that's just all i ask of movies. it also made me buy and be thrilled by the book, discover a fantastic author i hadn't read before, and listen again and again to schubert - so, my thanks to haneke, jellinek and isabelle!!! on the other hand, if you're looking for light entertainment, please stay away. my vote: 9 out of 10

i just got the dvd for hardware wars, in a shiny new package, looking irresistable. stuck it in my dvd player to find a slew of extra fun stuff. the extra content on the dvd is even longer than the movie. for those of you that have (shame!) never seen hardware wars, it one fantastically silly star wars spoof (of episode iv, of course). household appliances (such as irons, toasters, vacuums, and a waffle maker) stand in for ty-fighters, x-wings, r2d2, and the death star. instead of princess leia, we have princess ann-droid, complete with cinnabon hairdo. you get the point, i'm sure. mad silliness, and a fun ride for any star wars geek (like me!)now, the dvd - wow! a director's commentary where he basically goes off on the movie, making fun of himself and the project throughout. an interview with fosselius on creature features (remember that?!) and hilarious "director's cut" and "foreign version" of the movie (all jokes of course). anyway, this is great. i loved hardware wars in the theater, and am so glad for having the dvd in my collection - wedged in between mst3k: the movie and thumb wars!

undoubtedly the funniest movie i have ever seen. it's definitely worth the fourteen minutes it takes to watch. i will never look at my kitchen appliances the same way again. bob knickerbocker deserves an oscar. "relax, kid. it's only a movie"

i caught this little gem totally by accident back in 1980 or '81. i was at a revival theatre to see two old silly sci-fi movies. the theatre was packed full and (with no warning) they showed a bunch of sci-fi short spoofs (to get us in the mood). most were somewhat amusing but this came on and, within seconds, the audience was in hysterics! the biggest laugh came when they showed "princess laia" having huge cinnamon buns instead of hair on her head. she looks at the camera, gives a grim smile and nods. that made it even funnier! you gotta see "chewabacca" played by what looks like a muppet! it was extremely silly and stupid...but i couldn't stop laughing. most of the dialogue was drowned out because of all the laughter. also if you know "star wars" pretty well it's even funnier--they deliberately poke fun at some of the dialogue. this really works with an audience! a definite 10!

done on a spare change budget of twenty bucks tops, this cheapie thirteen minute short cheerfully parodies george lucas' legendary '77 sci-fi blockbuster "star wars" in the most infectiously dumb way imaginable. writer/director ernie fosselius delivers a winning and often gut-busting blend of ludicrous sound effects, ineptly staged action scenes, cruddy (far from) special effects (you just gotta love the cheesy scratched-on-film lasers, tinfoil asteroids, and household appliances ... eer, i mean spaceships being swung around on obvious wires), badly dubbed in dialogue, shamelessly hammy acting, and richard wagner's rousing piece of classical music "ride of the valkyries." the characters are presented in suitably broad strokes; my favorites are whiny wimp fluke starbucker, venerable jedi knight auggie "ben" doggie, and hateful arch villain darph nader (who spouts nothing but incomprehensible gibberish). moreover, 4-q-3 is clearly based on the tin man from "the wizard of oz" while artie deco is definitely a cheap vacuum cleaner. this film's true masterstroke is casting legendary voice actor supreme paul frees as the narrator; frees' deliciously rich and plummy histrionic tones add immensely to the considerable silly, yet sidesplitting tongue-in-cheek merriment (choice lines: "you'll laugh! you'll cry! you'll kiss three bucks goodbye!"). a total hoot.

the hysterical hardware wars is finally out on dvd. hw has earned its niche among parody classics and is not only a riotous little 20 minute short but a staple in low budget film production classes, which is where a lot of the film's cult status is derived from and resides. with the dvd, not only do we get a chance to revisit the original parody (4q2, cinnamon-bun head, ballistic toast, et al) that ernie f. did in 1978, but there is a lot of additional material showcasing the fosselius wit. antique sideshow is a dead-on parody that is very funny but makes a statement about the confluence of ignorance and greed at the same time. the director's commentary is also hysterical, as is the creature feature which parodies taking a film out on the talk-show circuit and actually is based on taking hw out on the talk show circuit, albeit the public access circuit. i'd love to see ernie, michael wiese and crew take on some other, contemporary overblown and overbudgeted targets to parody -- like just about any film that hollywood churns out at $100 million a pop these days -- not so much the crafty films like spider man or men in black (actually parodies themselves!) but any number of overblown, overhyped, overwrought and overpriced features.

out of all the parodies of star wars i've seen, this is probably the funniest. not because of the premise, star wars with simple electronics instead of spaceships, but because of how poorly acted it is. this is purposely overacted, and it makes it hilarious, and since everyone knows its purposely overacted, no one complains. the special effects were also purposely as awful as can be, and include a toaster on a visible string that shoots toast, and an egg beater on a string. this short is funny for any fan of star wars (which i'm not), or anyone that has 15 minutes to kill. great short!! my rating: *** out of ****. 13 mins. not rated.

this is, without a doubt, one of my favorite columbo episodes ever. the acting is very well done, the music is very catchy, the script is ingenious, and the direction is fabulous.peter falk, who acts brilliantly in every columbo episodes, acts particularly well in this episode.also, great performances from stephen caffrey, gary hershberger, alan fudge and robert culp.the ending is absolutely brilliant and i love the way columbo describes it.this is a columbo movie that won't, go amiss.

at the end, it is clear that the murderers planted the murder weapon in mrs. columbo's car and it was at the police ballistics lab. but where did the gun under the hood, used in the demonstration, come from? wouldn't the murderers have cleared out the stuff under the hood? they had a whole week? or did columbo's cops replicate the camera/gun under the hood used in the demonstration? how did they do that without breaking and entering the car? perhaps this is why the murders seemed surprised at the end. but how could columbo have replicated their camera/gun device and gotten it calibrated to their key fob? columbo must have gotten the gun back from ballistics and had it re-planted under the hood of the car, and been very lucky that the rest of the device with camera was still there and transmitting.this was a 10/10 show until this glaring plot error at the end.

sorry to repeat myself over and over, but here's another great columbo episode. i guess that's why i'm such a fan - most episodes really are great! the best episodes always have a standout feature of some sort, and in this case the murderer and his accomplice are possibly the youngest ever columbo villains.after watching a lot of episodes where columbo and his adversary act like close friends, it's good to see an episode where tempers fray and bad feelings rise to the surface. it just gives an episode a bit more drama and bite. columbo is rapidly onto the fact that the two students who claim to be helping him are not very secretly laughing at him and feeding him false clues. he happily plays along, deliberately turning up the bumbling in front of them to make them underestimate him! but of course he knows instantly when they are talking baloney.the murder itself is another complicated one, along the lines of the bye bye sky high iq episode, with a sophisticated chain reaction of events that manages to kill the intended target while providing the assassins with a seemingly watertight alibi. in the intervening years between 1978 and 1990, the technology has moved on from record players and firecrackers to remote control car locking systems and hidden cameras.stephen caffrey puts in a great performance as justin rowe, the obnoxious, spoilt student. gary hershberger is low-key but good as his "yes-man" friend cooper redman. and it's nice to see robert culp as mr rowe, justin's dad.a very satisfying episode in all ways.

or any stories reminiscent of the leopold and loeb case, you may find this movie entertaining. the cast includes robert culp,with stephen caffrey and garrison hershberger as the college students.peter falk is his usual self, pretending to be tricked by the precocious students. caffrey ("longtime companion", "buried alive") is excellent, and should do more of these menacing roles. basically the two frat buddies become tired of their demanding parents, who expect nothing less than academic perfection, attendance at the best schools will only be financed if they conform. there is an excellent scene wherein culp rakes caffrey over the coals after he gets a low grade, threatens to cut off his trust funds and caffrey later says to his friend: "i hate him, i want him dead"...all is not well in beverly hills. this is always an excellent theme. i believe this film came out in 1990 right after the menendez killings. if you watch "menedez, a killing in beverly hills" and then compare it to this film, you may find some interesting parallels.

after all these years of solving crimes, you would've expected criminals to know that they can't afford making mistakes with him, especially not with regards to talking much. this timecolumbo goes to college, and actually explains his entire technique, but for some reason the murderer still doesn't pay enough attention. however, this still creates wonderful scenes and delightful dialogues.

columbo is guest lecturer for a criminology class. the students invite him along for their after-class get-together. transiting the nearby parking garage, they discover their regular teacher, next to his car, dead from a gunshot wound. (no, columbo was not after the man's job.) as a class project, columbo involves the students in his sleuthing.two students, tentatively identified by the viewer as culprits, were in the lecture hall for the entire class. furthermore, surveillance camera tapes of the parking garage show that no one other than the professor entered or left after he was last seen unexpectedly departing the lecture hall.reversing the normal routine, columbo is the one that is pestered by the evil (?) duo, eager for progress reports and an ear for their theories. forensic evidence is almost nonexistent. solution of the case hinges on some eventual and interesting good luck.on first viewing, it seemed that columbo had swallowed whole the culprits' misdirection; however, on repeat viewing, small details revealed that not to have been the case at all.this reviewer has yet to tire of "columbo goes to college."

i felt that way when i saw the episode in its original run and still agree when i watch it on reruns. you had the culprits totally mocking columbo throughout the episode and treating him like he has down syndrome. and in the end you see their shock when columbo gets them dead to rights and arrest them. you also get a realistic reaction from the arrogant preppy killers. they stillcouldn't give columbo his props and say he just got lucky. i like the formula where there is an elaborate crime, the killer(s) totally underestimate columbo, and then you get their realization that columbo was totally playing the criminals. i recall in the first few episodes of the post 1989 episodes they weren't following that formula and this was the first episode that i was pleased with.

and i do. peter falk has created a role that will live on forever in tv land! and i'm grateful for that. this isn't one of his finest hours, though. columbo goes to college and basically teaches how he solves a crime, and yet there are bad guys who go ahead and think they're smarter than he is. what all us fans know is that columbo needs a worthy opponent. without a great enemy, how can he be the hero in the wrinkled coat? still, it's better than no columbo, and i'll wait and watch the next one as well.

probably grossly underrated by all who never experienced the hell of living under communist regime. although, it seems hard to believe, all of it happened, actually the reality was even worse than the movie. it resembles orwellian fiction, only this is no fiction. john hurt is excellent as always. yes, the screenplay is not full of action, but life is not either. plot is breathtaking. yes, people were shot, yes thousands of them. their 'crime' was that they wanted to leave communist 'paradise' without government authorization. at times the movie drives tears in your eyes. we need more movies like this to really appreciate what america provides for us. excellent movie, highly recommend! god bless our country, usa!

fun movie! the script is awful but the quality of actors saves the day. john hurt is perfect, as is jane alexander. beau bridges is fair and the actress who plays his wife is very weak. the story is the true star. based on a true story, the pace moves well and the whole concept of escaping east germany sucks you in and holds you. joyous ending provides enough elation to compensate for script. don't expect academy award quality but it's a great ride for the whole family.

what can i say about this film other than the narrative is one of the most exciting in film history...and based on a true story! being old enough to remember the berlin wall when it was still used to contain a country, this film gives you a dark insight into the grim incarceration of east berliners, and their desperate attempts to escape, no matter what the cost. the film follows the lives of two families , who decide to escape using a hot-air balloon manufactured by themselves. forever fearing arrest by the authorities, under scrutiny by neighbours, they have to calculate a plan to reach the other side of the wall. a tense & thrilling story of courage and determination which truly pays homage to all those who succeeded and failed the treacherous journey to west berlin and freedom.

i grew up outside of naila germany(where they landed),every detail of the film was 100% authentic,the power lines that they flew over,the nosy neighbors,the grandmother telling the kids that they cant watch west german tv,etc..this movie brings back lots of good memories to those that are european,a great production from disney...the same movie in german has klaus lowitsch and gunter meisner using their own voices for translating the english version into german...for the german version they also use cookoo birds ,a bird that is native to germany as background noise to let you know that you are in germany..i showed this move to many of my german relative and they really liked this movie.(these people made made a prototype balloon which they had to give up because the materials that they used was too porous and the other 2 balloons that they used for the escape.the burner problem was solved when they turned the propane cylinders upside down.)

i was surprised as i watched this movie, how much it had 'encaptured' me. no the actors didn't act like typical 'hollywood' actors, but that's not always bad either, as this film proves. quite different from the disney standard, it is a refreshing turn none-the-less! they also give you a taste of what it was probably like without being 'educational'. a movie everyone should both see and enjoy. many people love arguing over 'accuracies' in any movie of this type, but just getting the basic idea has plenty to offer. mild gripe; east and west germany, viewed on any map, would have west germany on the left side, east to the right. the movie at times, sets you back slightly, because about half of the scenes have west germany on the right side of the screen, and other times on the left side. even during the same events, they shift back and forth. perhaps, just a little more consistency would have avoided this mild distraction. go see it!

i think that this film has become an important record of the most horrifying aspect of the east german regime - the imprisonment of its people by what the regime called its anti-fascist protective wall. it is a document of desperation and courage not to be missed. i would however like to comment on the actual location of this escape. it did not happen in or around berlin as supposed by some respondents and was nothing to do directly with the berlin wall. the escape balloon was flown over the iron curtain which not only divided germany but it divided the whole of europe at that time. the balloon took off from pössneck, 170 miles south-west of berlin in the german democratic republic (east germany) and flew 14 miles to naila in bavaria and freedom in west germany. the opening of the iron curtain in hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the berlin wall later that year. whilst the balloon flight created entertaining suspense cinema, it should remain as a monument to those who lost their lives whilst attempting to escape from east berlin, other parts of the gdr or other soviet-controlled states.

this movie accurately portrays the struggle life was for the typical east german. watched by the secret police, friends and coworkers, most easterners simply existed.the strelzyk's and the wetzel's were two families that decided they weren't going to take it anymore. despite the extreme danger involved in escaping to the west, they feel the rewards far outweighed the risks. john hurt and beau bridges, portraying the respective family heads hit upon the idea of flying over east germany's heavily fortified border. there are tense moments as they gather and jimmy-rig the necessary materials for the flight. they work their day jobs and construct the balloon at night, right under the noses of the authorities, one of whom is strelzyk's neighbor (klaus loewitsch). the first attempt, involving only the strelzyks, ends in failure when the balloon crashes just a few yards from the border. the crashed balloon is discovered by border guards and an relentless search begins for the conspirators who are determined to try again. with sales of materials being closely monitored peter and guenter still manage to procure bits and pieces of cloth with which to construct a second balloon for their nail biting escape to freedom. the film also features a heartwarming and effective soundtrack by the late jerry goldsmith.

a real surprise. not exactly family entertainment from "disney". some violence, lots of tense moments, and a great story, based on fact. the theme of "night crossing" is, determination wins. never losing sight of their objective, two east german families risk it all, in their daring balloon escape to freedom. the story is both harrowing and heartwarming. time is not on their side. the east german police are closing in and the outcome far from certain, until the very end. if you are looking for a good evenings entertainment, that contains no nudity, and limited violence, then i highly recommend "night crossing". it is pure entertainment. - merk

the movie night crossing captures the feelings experienced by the vast majority of east germans during the period 1961-89. i lived in west berlin during most of 1967 and travelled through the wall into east berlin on a weekly basis. why? excitement, crossing a border into a soviet governed country, experiencing the smells and the feel of east germany, which is why night crossing is excellent, it captures that very feeling, and it is exciting. i was arrested by the vopos in checkpoint charlie and accosted by a man in his leather coat and dark glasses i am led to believe was stasi. when i watch the movie i can smell cheap diesel and cooking oil, i can see the outdated vehicles, the drab clothing the public wore and the lacklustre produce in shop windows. it brings back memories of realising just how lucky i was to live in a free country. in 1988, i toured the ddr from east to west, north to south. east germany had changed little since 1967. the trabants, constantly breaking down, were still the main mode of private motorised transport, the shops still featured nothing much to tempt me, uniforms were still commonplace, but the people, the ordinary people were open and nice once you had gained their trust. watch night crossing, it's as close to the truth as any movie you will see on divided germany, even closer than two other favourites the spy who came in from the cold and funeral in berlin.

this is the most difficult movie i have ever seen...the emotional content is horrific, yet unforgetable. a woman who is accused of being a political activist is brought in for questioning. the whole movie revolves around her interrogation. alan rickman and madeline stowe have intense and powerful roles for which they deserve oscars for their performances.

the film deals with universal themes, mentioning no specific country as its context: it could happen anywhere--and has, in substance if not form. those concerned about 1st amendment issues, censorship, et al--but don't want to be bored with lectures--need art such as this to illustrate, dramatize, teach, inspire.rickman is certainly an under appreciated character actor; he shines in this film, showing off multiple acting talents that you must see (i have yet to see him give a bad performance, though, even in not-so-great films). stowe gives perhaps her best performance (and proves that she possesses one of the most striking pair of eyes in hollywood)--in two words: stunning, convincing.the set design perfectly matches the situation, in function and mood. the sound editing heightens to appropriate effect. the total contrast conveyed through the animation sequences is a perfect symbolic device-and the welcome and only respite to the bulk of the story's necessary venue. the script is tight and essential, with engagingly dramatic-yet realistic-dialogue (i.e., as it might be and ought to be). perhaps the most amazing aspect to contend with is the fact that 1) this is the director's first time out; and 2) he is the writer. in one phrase: a tour de force--with three recommendations: see it, own a copy, see it repeatedly to fathom all its secrets and grasp all it genius.

this little two-person movie is actually much bigger than it looks. it has so many layers. i've watched it over and over, and always pick up on something new. i am amazed at the depth of the acting, and i feel if this movie had gotten wider release that there would be no question that alan rickman is a major star

the good news: the director is reportedly committed to the cause of amnesty international and eager to deliver a solid message about the freedom of expression and the evil of oppression. the plot is distinctly original and the actors are two of my absolute favourites. the not-so-good news: 'original' is not everybody's buzzword when visiting the movies or video stores. also, noted critics like mr maltin and roger ebert have dismissed the film as a genuinely failed attempt to convert a play from stage into cinematic form. if i remember correctly, the title is taken from the fairy tale stowe's character has written and which has made her a possible subversive and suspect person in the fictitious place where the story takes place. her dreams are dangerous to the government, represented here by rickman as the intense, manipulative interrogator. since those two people are virtually the only ones appearing in the film altogether, the director is in for a real challenge in keeping the viewer's attention. in the end, i found the whole thing fascinating. not flawless and definitely not for everyone, but rewarding. it's nowhere near a masterpiece like kieslowski's 'a short film about killing' or as explanatory as 'dead man walking'. but if you're into those films or any of costa-gavras political thrillers, you may appreciate this one as well. just don't expect any overexplicit sermons or eyefilling action sequences.

this is an amazing movie and is very clever at using the few actors and sets. it is also very shocking - the physical and psychological torture (both explicit and implied) is mixed with calm and even humourous stretches. so the horror is always unexpected, and brutal. i'm not soft, but this would have to be the most shocking film i have ever seen. the message of this film is definitely delivered with a sledgehammer. this is the film i will always remember both actors for.

rachel and chuck yoman (valerie harper, gerald mcraney), decided the city is too busy and dangerous for their family, so they packed up their reluctant son (gregory togel) and daughter (tammy lauren) and moved back to a lake like the one rachel lived at as a child.they say you can not go home again but this is an ideal rural home with what at first seems like a mayberry feel. later the residence seems to be more like the people in deliverance. soon bodies start turning up and everybody looks suspect with the exception of a few friendly faces. this does not keep the family from enjoying running around and messing around in the woods.we find that they have to be super ignorant to find the secrets and not tell anyone until they get ax-cepted as the antagonists. can the ignored young stevie save his parents or will their pursuer(s) put his/her foot in it?this film is more than most parodies as it was played with strait faces. they could not have chosen better actors and daryl anderson was exceptionally creepy. an added plus is that they let us know what is happening before the characters find out, instead of pulling a clue out of the hat after the fact. anyway this made for tv movie is good for a few laughs.

the premise of the story is common enough; average family wants out of the rat race; wants to find the simple life....so they move from sherman oaks,california to lake tomahawk; kids in tow.the lake is beautiful, they have leased an old house....but wait; there may be something in the lake; people are being murdered, and no one knows how (never mind why). gerald mcraney is excellent, a familiar face for lifetime viewers; valerie harper is also good; since this film was made in '88 maybe the writer should produce a sequel!.you will also enjoy barry corbin as the town eccentric, and darryl anderson as a bruce dern-lookalike/crazed military man.while the story plot is a bit over the top; if you are a movie buff you will be reminded of similar scenarios from ""psycho""; ""deliverance""; as well as other horror stories of that genre. several camera shots and sequences will give you a sense of deja vu.sit back and enjoy; if you don't take it too seriously it is very entertaining; and better than, for example the more recent movie:""i know what you did last summer""; it seems they made better movies in the good old 80's!.

this is one of those classic american made for tv movies that are just made for watching on a rainy afternoon. although the script is highly implausible it never takes itself too seriously and neither do the cast which leads to a great tongue in cheek murder mystery / horror film best enjoyed with a bid bag of popcorn or box of chocolates. a big bonus of this film is the fantastic location filming and despite the strange goings on and even stranger residents round lake tommahawk i for one would not mind living there!all in all a great film to watch over and over again.

not a film of entertainment, but of real lives & limited ambition for the working class in 60's. enjoyable because of my upbringing, not sure it'd work for most people. typical loach. full of tv actors/actresses of 70's/80's/90's.

recently released on british dvd, this is a good movie (as long as you have an attention span and iq of more than a fruit fly). not as depressing as it could have been, this is kitchen-sink at its most dirty. terrance stamp is great in it, the music is sweet, carol white is very believeable as the single mum tart who can't stop loving criminals.my favourite scene is where carol and her friend who works in the pub with her (the one with the enormous beehive hairdo which comes down over one eye) sit outisde and gossip about all the men who walk past.the only thing that marred this was the shakey acting of carol's first husband, but if you can get past that, you're ok. and donovan provides some of the most languid, mellow, bittersweet lyrics to come out of the 60s.

one of the best of the 'kitchen-sinks'. fantastic views of london and invaluable snippets of working class life of the 60's. loach's eye seems to capture everything, yet makes no judgment - a taste of things to come. as with 'kes', 'riff-raff' and 'sweet sixteen', it serves as a cinematic social history of britain. carol white is completely convincing, you love her, fancy her, want to take care of her, but hold your head at her self-destructive decisions and still follow her in some vain hope. well backed up by terence stamp, ( fresh off 'the collector', also catch 'the hit' ) and a plethora of english faces ( all looking very young ). pefectly set to donovan's dulcet tones. stamp sings 'yellow is the color', in a lovely scene, ending with him saying, " getting better, ain't i " ( song also used in 'the rules of attraction' - i think ) watch carol whites screen mum getting ready to 'go out and get a bloke', putting on her false eye-lashes to the sound of 'rosie' on the radio - priceless. a treasure for anyone who was around at the time and a reminder of how good life is now in england. incidentally soderburgh used clips from 'poor cow' in 'the limey'.

ken loach showed the world the down-and-out flip side of swinging london with "poor cow", about london woman joy (carol white) hooking up with a thief and having a son with him, only to see the man end up in the slammer. while his friend (terence stamp) manages to help her out some, he proves to be little better in what a loser he is. it soon becomes clear to joy that she's going to have to make a serious decision about where she's going in her life.one thing that i determined - i don't know whether or not this is accurate - was a use of irony in the movie. her name is joy, but she experiences no joy in her life. even if that wasn't intended, it's still a movie that i recommend to everyone. featuring songs by donovan (one of which - "colors" - appeared in another terence stamp movie: "the limey" (which, incidentally, came out in 1999, when i was as old as my parents were when "poor cow" came out)).

back in the 60's, this grim study of joy, a young proletarian wife, was the introduction to the career of ken loach, who became one of the most distinguished and respected british filmmakers of all time. by then i knew very little about brecht, politics or the reality of the under-privileged, and i was quite impressed by the aesthetic of the film, its free style, its austere color cinematography, and joy's monologues in front of the camera. i was also much surprised to find that terence stamp (who had become a celebrity, thanks to "billy budd", "the collector" and "modesty blaise") had so little screen time. although 20th century fox distributed "poor cow" in panama, loach did not stay in mainstream cinema (which this film hardly is) and i lost contact with his films. i just heard of his successes, "kes", "family life", "black jack". until i caught up in the 80's. the beautiful title song by donovan, by the way, is available in his anthology "troubadour".

i sort of liked this columbo movie its atmosphere, which was real thriller like and its approach even at times reminded me of film-noir, in the movie its first 30 minutes or so. it's really nice and done in a good old fashioned way, with the right camera angles and use of light. it doesn't mean instantly that this movie is a brilliant one though but its solid enough to consider this a good late columbo movie entry. it's definitely a better movie than the average 'later' columbo movie entry.26 years after his previous columbo movie appearance, george hamilton returns once again to play the main lead opposite peter falk, again as the murderer, in a total different and new role of course. i liked him in his role and he was a good columbo 'villain', who gave the good old lieutenant some good competition. they had some nice sequences together. problem with the 'modern' new columbo movies always sort of had been that it didn't feature a good well known actor opposite peter falk. this movie obviously doesn't suffer from this problem. but i must say though that this movie doesn't feature peter falk at this best. he has certainly played the character better and his performance isn't quite consistent enough within this movie, which is probably also due to he movie its director daryl duke, who also directed the really dreadful movie "tai-pan", among many other projects.it has a rather good and enjoyable story but the fact that the same sort of plot to cover up the murder had been used before in an earlier columbo movie also doesn't help of course. it got used before in the 1975 movie "columbo: playback". nevertheless it of course also still has plenty enough 'original' moments of its own with its story, even though of course in essence every columbo movie is more or less the same. but oh well, that is what made the columbo series so great and consistent. if it ain't broke don't fix it.it also is true that within this movie more clues than usual are left out for the lieutenant, which doesn't mean that the movie its murderer is more stupid or sloppy but i more see it as the writers being more overly enthusiastic than others. it doesn't make the movie or story bad and it in fact perhaps even makes it more enjoyable, to see columbo hard at work and discovering all kind of small but important clues. luckily the movie is also filled with some enjoyable effective relieving columbo-comedy.simply a good late columbo movie entry.7/10

after being off the air for a while, columbo returned with some new made-for-tv mysteries that, while not being as good as the original series, are better than the shows that were done in the later '90s."murder can be hazardous to your health" used the then (and i guess now, if you think about it) true crime shows as the situation for a murder. the murder is committed by a very successful, egomaniacal true crime show host, george hamilton (in a nice bit of casting). his chain-smoking nemesis, who lost the job to him, played by peter haskell, attempts to blackmail hamilton when he discovers a porno video hamilton made with an underage actress in his salad days. hamilton uses haskell's cigarettes to deliver the death blow via poison, giving himself an alibi as well.columbo is brought in to find out what happened. you know the rest. highly entertaining.

this movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths. well written by shane black, the film is executed phenomenally by the cast under the watchful eye of director jack swanstrom. clearly, swanstrom is a director that we should look out for in the future. his strength lies in his adaptation of personal experiences both on screen and in the classroom.this thought-provoking film is a must see for anyone who can appreciate action, drama, suspense, and mystery. as with all good films, the viewer goes on a journey of their own to find their individual interpretation of the movie. the mystical aspect of the film is intriguing and adds to the suspense. you find your self looking for the answers along with marquette. audiences have liked the movie on the festival circuit - with many awards received, they must have agreed that a.w.o.l. (2006) is well worth watching. i'd love to own a copy - how do i go about getting one?

if you're into alternate realities, contemplating what's real and what's just a fantasy, this is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that'll keep you guessing and really make you think. try to get a copy of it and see for yourself! i watched it at an l.a. film festival recently and it was by far the best one in the group that i saw. it helped that it was actually about something, unlike the others that were screened. it's very well directed and the production value is top notch. i would compare it to jacob's ladder in that it keeps you guessing as to what the true reality is of the world that we're in. you should definitely try to hunt this film down and if it's screening at any festivals near you, try to check it out.

i too saw this film at a film festival, but unlike the previous poster i found it both interesting and original. in a sea of terrible features, shorts are often twice as bad do to small budgets and poor acting, a.w.o.l however is a taut little thriller that hearkens back to "the outer limits." the performances are solid, not that one would expect otherwise from morse or mcginley, and the directing is sharp and on the money. i personally find it difficult to reconcile the previous poster's comments with the film i saw. a.w.o.l is quite aptly written by shane black, who, as is usually the case, plays with the genre both paying homage to the stories pulp sensibilities, while simultaneously winking at the audience and never taking itself too seriously. all in all a.w.o.l proves to be an extremely well executed and fun film.

excellent story, wonderful acting, amazing production values and a cool, action-packed short with a perfect twist at the end. what a great short film! i saw this film in vail or aspen at a film festival and was wowed by it. then i saw it again at another festival (where it won again) and i was even more impressed because subtle touches become evident the second time around - for a short film, this packs a lot of clever layers into a short time.awol is not for the faint of heart, but it is very well done and completely impressive for a short film - for any film actually. it's an interesting story told very well, and every scene moves the story, which reveals good film-making instincts went into making this film. the film looks gorgeous and david morse is also stunning, with a dynamic performance delivered in every scene. watching his character attempt to defeat the curveballs life is throwing him makes a great viewing experience.it also should be noted, that when tortures of war are in the headlines everyday, the lines between reality, good and evil, can get very gray while the rhetoric gets loud and attempts to make things black and white. awol smartly allows the audience to decide for themselves what they think the message is, what is real and what is not, which adds to the mystery.both times i've seen it, the audience was way more into this movie than the others playing with it, which is saying a lot. there are a lot of shorts out there right now, but few deliver the kind of all around excellence and complex subject matter that awol does.it sounds to me like the previous reviewer is off his or her rocker, or has some personal agenda, because this really is a great example of short independent film-making. i see a lot of short films, and i must say if only all the shorts making the festival rounds were this good, then the shorts business would have some serious legs.

i gave this 9 stars out of a possible 10. if it had had just a teensy weensy bit more plot line i would have given it 10.nonetheless it is a highly interesting film.judith ivey, playing a likable old floozy, should have been given the oscar for her performance.emily grace (portraying alice), whom i had never seen before, also does an excellent job and has the sexiest body i think i've ever seen on film.in a beat to heck old car, alice has lit out from the n.e. for florida where she has a friend (or maybe it's her sister, i'm not sure, and that's my fault, not the film's), and high hopes of going to college, which she and her family can't really afford.she seems rather vulnerable out there on the road alone, and sure enough she encounters some slightly rough looking characters and shortly after that it's discovered there's a hole in one of her tires.she is at a rest stop at the time and is assisted by a woman named sandra and her husband, bill, an older couple who are traveling in an rv.they're going south, to florida, and take her under their wing, but is everyone quite the way they're presenting themselves? flashbacks and paranoia enter the story as our young heroine learns some new lessons about life.

this 1955 heist film follows tony le stephanois, recently released from prison for theft, as he undertakes the robbery of his life. he teams up with his old heist buddies and they bring in an expert safe-cracker, cesar from milan (played by jules dassin, who also directed. he only directed because he had been blacklisted as a communist in the u.s. and couldn't work in hollywood.) the brilliance of this film is the 1/2 hour during the robbery. during all this time, there is no dialogue and no music, only the muted sounds of digging through the floor or drilling the safe. this increases the suspense and draws you in. they get away with several hundred million francs worth of jewels, but a jewel offered to a dancer by cesar brings their haul to the attention of a trio of brutal brothers. they set out to get the stash for themselves and bring misfortune in their wake. great heist/gangster movie, but i prefer j.-p. melville's films in this genre.this movie is like some lemonade i had last night. i had gone to a caribbean restaurant and the lemonade was made with sugar cane juice instead of sugar. it also had a lot of ice and was heavy on the lemons, leaving it fairly sour (which i like). the sugar cane juice imparted a subtle, slightly more mellow taste to it than actual sugar, and the ice made sure it was cold and refreshing as i sucked it down. 7.5/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies

american expatriate jules dassin makes an award-winning french gangster film. the plot involves tony the stephanois, a hoodlum just out of prison, who takes his band of thieves on a $240 million jewel heist. unfortunately, his ex-wife's relationship with a notorious gangster named grutter, an italian safe-cracker named cesar with a weakness for women, and the missteps of his own friend jo cause the successful heist to turn into a bloody race against time as grutter holds jo's son hostage for the cash in typical "crime never pays" tragedy fashion.the "rififi" in the title is explained in a song to mean slang for basically violence and sex, and the full title, "du rififi chez les hommes" means roughly "some naughty in the house of men", which is pretty much where the fatal flaw of the characters take place. leave it to a gangster film to place most of the emphasis on the missteps on the women, but this time jo's wife gets the last laugh (if you could call it a laugh) when she predicts "all of you are just going to kill each other." the characters aren't the most sympathetic and the women are mostly weak, but dassin still builds an extremely well-crafted suspense film out of them as they pull off a heist that requires the utmost quiet, hide the goods, and then attempt to survive what basically becomes a cross-country cat and mouse game. in the mix are some very amazing photography and a fine attention to detail in editing, leading to a pacing and visual experience that well overstates the otherwise generic plot. it's not only easy to see why this is held as a classic, it's also easy to see why it's among the top 250 on the imdb: it's suspenseful, visually magnificent, full of sex and violence, and maintains that classy gangster attitude we film buffs like so much.

there are not many films which i would describe as perfect, but rififi definitely fits the bill. no other heist film has come close to it, before or after. the plot is simple, but engrosses you. it never ceases to amaze me how absolutely gripping the film is every time you view it. you care for all the characters, even though they are bank robbers, because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and flaws. it's hard to imagine any other actor besides jean servais in the role of tony le stéphanois. when the members of the crew are each talking about what they are going to do with their money and finally get to tony, his answer and the expression on his face says it all. while the 30 minute heist sequence is the most famous part of the movie(and rightfully so)the film actually gets better afterward.the director jules dassin knew what he was doing when he decided to not have any music during the heist scene or the final shootout, but instead inserted a great climactic score during tony's final ride towards his destiny. to think that if dassin, an american director, had not been blacklisted in hollywood and forced to work in france, this masterpiece of cinema would never have been made the way it was. it certainly wouldn't have been as good if it was made as an american film during that time. it was absolutely horrible what dassin had to go through, but he did achieve his greatest work because of it, to the benefit of all of us. i'm just cringing at the thought of the upcoming al pacino remake. most heist films since rififi have already borrowed from it in some way or another. there's no reason to remake this masterpiece other than money. leave the classics alone!

you can take the crook out of the joint, but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint out of the crook. we've seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before (and since): in movies like bob le flambeur, elevator to the gallows, touchez pas au grisbi, the anderson tapes, etc. too many times to mention. what helps make this one one of the more notable is (of course) the heist itself, which plays out wordlessly in real time, and the demeanor of the lead. bogart would think twice before crossing this guy. the ironic ending is perfectly suited to this story (it almost demands it). all around, one of the better films noir.

it's a mystery to me as to why i haven't caught up to this masterful 50s caper film  turned brooding noir until now, but i'm certainly glad to report that it didn't disappoint. i haven't seen any of jules dassin's american films for several years but based on this i'll probably be going back and re-watching "brute force" and "night and the city" quite soon.jean servais, a name unknown to me but a face rather familiar in its world-weariness and coldness, has recently completed a lengthy stay in prison and as is the way in these films (hey, there wouldn't be a story otherwise) isn't coping well with the straight life. an opportunity presents itself: an easy multi-million-dollar jewel heist that can be done at night with no fear of discovery by a few men. the taut filming of the robbery, half an hour of total silence, is what people most remember about the film of course, and indeed it's pretty remarkable; but i liked the half-completed location of the final shootout, once the robbery has gone sour thanks to the big mouth of one of the thieves; the excellent portrayal gritty sides of paris in stark black and white; and servais' channeling of both eddie constantine and humphrey bogart in his spare but brutal performance.perhaps it's a bit too sentimental in the end, but this is one of those classics that really does live up to its reputation just as pure entertainment even if what it has to say about the human condition isn't exactly deep or thought-provoking; george auric's at turns modernist, romantic, and jazzy score is another highlight.

i have been wanting to see this since my french teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago. perhaps the long wait was worth it, since the criterion collection dvd restoration is impressive.in its outline this movie follows the time-worn script: a quartet of men diligently plot a difficult heist of a bank vault, the heist takes place, a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all. even though the heist footage is transfixing, it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film. this film separates itself from the typical heist movie by giving us insights into the personalities of the characters and their motivations - its plays as much as a drama as it does a thriller. relationships play a big role and a kidnapping is tacked on, giving us two movies for the price of one.john servais plays the idea man tony le stéphanois (always referred to as "le stéphanois") with such world-weariness that he could have just stepped out of a camus novel. tony has just recently gotten out of jail and resists re-entering the life of crime until he has a highly unpleasant interaction with his ex-lover (who has taken up with another man) where, as punishment, he physically whips her with a belt. thankfully that scene occurs off camera, but you are not likely to forget it. after that sobering event, since there seems little hope of reviving that relationship, tony meets with two of his old partners in crime, jo and mario, and decides to join them in one last big heist. they enlist the services of cesar, an italian safe cracker - played by director dassin himself - and we are off to the heist.the heist goes off without a hitch. but cesar's womanizing bent is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal for all concerned. however, we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer he has fallen for, since there is a brilliant set piece where she performs a sexy and cinematically inspired nightclub act - it has to be one of the most memorable scenes from any noir film.it is established early on that tony has a close relationship with jo and his family; in fact jo's son refers to him as uncle. i think it is partly to help jo's family that tony agrees to the heist. the ending scenes, where tony saves the life of jo's kidnapped son, partially redeems his more brutal and amoral actions. but only partially.

the fact that after 50 years, it is still a highly watchable movie, says a lot about it. it is more intelligent and interesting than almost all recent movies of the same genre you can find, and has a certain endearing feeling of innocence to it. i am not a big fan of this type of movies, but i could watch the whole thing without being bored, which makes it a good movie to watch with someone who does not necessarily share your taste in films. i liked the black and white palette, the excellent casting, the clever heist scene that keeps you guessing about what trick they will pull next, and the ending like everyone else. watching the heist sequence makes one realize the power of silence, which is unfortunately so underused in today's cinema.

i heard they were going to remake this french classic in 2007, and i see it is in development for 2011. this will be a shame, as hollywood kicked writer/director jules dassin out because of the infamous blacklist. they should not have the right to remake any of his films.i love "caper" films and "film noir," and this combines the best of both.tony (jean servais) gets out after doing a nickle, and after he beats up his old girlfriend (marie sabouret), he plans a big score with his friends mario (robert manuel) and jo (carl möhner), what makes this a great caper flick is the attention to detail in planning the robbery. you see that reflected in the george clooney vegas capers. nothing is left to chance.the caper goes off great but grutter (marcel lupovici) sends his sons, robert hossein and pierre grasset after tony and the gang. after blowing it with mario, they kidnap jo's son. lots of bullets fly before it is over.a great film by a great director. the standard by which other caper films are measured.

in order to pull off a job like this caper in rififi (e.g. the score and its opines), one has to have nerves of steel. this one apparently demands and commands it. jules dassin is the master.i was on the edge of my seat throughout. it deserves to be better known, even though it was not at the time of its release in 1954, due, one supposes, to the director being blacklisted in the hypocritical hollywood of its day.i would recommend this film to anyone who has not has the pleasure of seeing it.i cannot give it enough stars.

after seeing naked city and night and the city (which is still my favorite dassin) i was more than excited to watch his "masterpiece" (o-word criterion) rififi.now i am a little bit disappointed about the story.so i have at least these five questions in my mind:1. in the final countdown louis grutter shot from the inside a house the main character tony le stéphanois. he couldn't know if he is still alive or not, but he didn't care about it and ran directly after it outside the house (with the money) to reach his car. so of course tony wasn't dead and shot him. big questionmark.2. in another important scene the specialist in safes cesar gave directly after the robbery as a present a diamond ring (which was a part of the robbery) a woman which was working for louis grutter in a night bar. stupid, because before this character wasn't that stupid. and of course louis knew directly that tony planned the jewel robbery. small questionmark.3.after the gangsters behind louis grutter murder mario ferrati and his wife,tony and his best friend joe planned a revenge against louis gang. at the same time they don't care for the security of joe's wife and his five years old child. of course louis gang kidnapped the son. cheap and simple.4. the perfect heist: of course this is the best 30min. long scene in the whole plot, without any word spoken in the whole time, but was this a perfect heist?? comparing with other movies which handle with this theme i could only smile when for example tony was taken a fire-extinguisher to banned the alarm. also too simple.5. the grutter gang went to the house of mario, because they knew (however....) the jewels will be there. then they murder mario and his wife. and then? they are not searching for it! no. they ran directly out of the apartment. and more. they not observing the apartment after it so tony can go after a while (which was the same day) inside to take the jewels. big questionmark.over all: it's a good movie. because of the brilliant 30min silent heist scene. because of the very good cut (the end scene in the car through paris is stunning) . because of a very good actor called jean servais. because of this black/white fever you will get while watching it. because of some other reasons too other user wrote about, but please don't tell me this is a stunning story.

a recent re-issue of the french crime film (original title 'du rififi chez les hommes'), with its famous 20-minute silent jewel heist sequence, now comes in the us in a gorgeous new print from the criterion collection with improved subtitles and some extras. jules dassin was an american (born julius dassin in middletown connecticut) who was forced to make films in europe because he was blacklisted. rififi was well publicized in the us and did well in art houses. later dassin became a lot more famous in the us for 'never on sunday' (1960) starring his wife, the greek actress and political activist melina mercouri. (greece was again glamorized and popularized for americans and others with anthony quinn in mihalis kakogiannis' 1964 'zorba the greek', which was even a big hit in cairo.) the new rififi dvd includes a recent interview with dassin. i did not previously realize that one of the main robbers, cesar the milanese, was played by dassin, who stepped in when the original actor became unavailable. he's one of the most memorable characters, a dandified italian safe cracker who speaks no french.although this classic has all the trappings of french film noir--the black and white twilight world of well lit apartments, shiny black cars, men in suits, the nightclub scenes, including a dramatically filmed and lit title song performed at the club, the stony faces and the gauloises in hand or mouth--i don't think it's as atmospheric or has quite as distinctive a style as melville's films do. but there's the mesmerizing robbery, which still holds up today as a tour de force. it goes like clockwork, with a fine sense of craft and teamwork among the robbers. some nosy cops are efficiently dealt with. things quickly go wrong after they go home and distribute the loot when one of the players gets sloppy and gives a dame a ring with a million-dollar bangle in it. has there ever been a heist film whose perps lived happily ever after? it's the wordless heist sequence that guarantees this a special place, and dassin, an american director who had an unusually varied and exotic career, deserves full credit for that. he took a novel so conventional he was going to reject it, and added some key elements that make it special. in the event, he couldn't pass on doing the adaptation: he needed the money too much. jean servais, who plays the lead character tony le stephanois, was an actor rather down on his luck. his grim face is perfect for the role. he was later to play the lead in dassin's he who must die (1957), which used french actors in greece for a political tale. 'topkapi' is a somewhat disappointing 1964 caper film (it pales compared to 'rififi') that also got us distribution. it does have a good setting, but it's wasted, gone all bland and bright and prettified. of dassin's post-hollywood oeuvre, 'never on sunday,' with its catchy theme song and charismatic heroine, is the popular choice (and won best film at cannes 1960); 'he who must die' the political choice; 'rififi' the genre choice. an odd piece is his 'phaedra' with mercouri and tony perkins (1962). purists of tough-guy hollywood genre work would eschew these and favor dassin's early films, which include a prison drama, 'brute force' (1947);a cop flick, 'the naked city' (1948); and two hard core noirs, 'thieves' highway' (1949), and 'night and the city' (1950). personally i tend to like french noir and american neo-noir spinoffs better than the original american noir source material--hence my enduring fascination with 'rififi'. but dassin is rather unique in having not only made hollywood noir but then going over to paris and producing a memorable example of its fifties french derivative.

as a fan of the old doctor who, and after the mediocre fox movie, i was dubious of this new series of doctor who. i gave it a chance though, and am so glad i did.yes, some episodes aren't as brilliant as others, but they are all enjoyable, and yes, eccleston's doctor is far from any we've had before but... eccleston's doctor is just about the best there is. his performance is at times comical, at others dramatic, sometimes completely crazy but always fantastic.this, and bille piper as rose make this series a cut above the rest (camille coduri is also fantastic as rose's mum), and there is a depth to this series not present previously. this series is incredibly powerful, especially considering its sci-fi. i mean who'd have thought you could ever have felt sorry or even cried for a dalek prior to this, how many times in this series' history have we had moments like those with rose's dad, the emergency doctor and the 'you were fantastic...so was i' final speech? i advise anyone, whether a fan of doctor who or even tv drama to buy this set on dvd, it truly is "fantastic!".now only 4 episodes through the latest series (and looking forward to the new cybermen) i have to say that david tennant's doctor is just not as good, of course you may disagree, but i don't think his doctor is capable of those emotional moments seen in the previous series. i also have to say that in my opinion so far this series has not been as good as the last, however the return of sarah jane & k9 was a fantastic episode, a true gem. not to say this series is not good, just not quite as good.so whether you like it or not, and whether you prefer tennant or eccleston, the doctor is back, and he's here to stay. "fantastic!" - almost as many "fantastic!"'s as the doctor! -

i have some of the older videos and dvds of dr. who. i've played them over and over. i adore each of the "doctors" for different reasons. but due to a man in the bbc hierarchy, dr. who was canceled, even though it was still one of the mainstays of the bbc line-up. with the departure of sylvester mccoy, the doctor stayed alive through the fans. bbc graciously allowed fans to write books, and cartoons. the momentum of dr. who has been steady even after 1989. then they took a chance with paul mcgann. the movie was flawed, but it gave the bbc an idea of what we wanted. in 1999, the "man" was gone and the newbies at the bbc felt it was time to bring the doctor back. it was a complete success. here in america, the sci-fi channel took a chance and it has become a complete success as well, although the writers were having to start over and explain the dr. who mythology for new viewers. it is incredible to me that they have done it. in season 1, staring christopher eccleston with russell t. davis as lead writer, and phil collinson as producer, the doctor has come back to us and in each episode we learn more about who the doctor is. the doctor who universe has always been about "choice", "love" and "sacrifice". this is what they provided. it makes me want more and it saddens me that mr. eccleston has chosen to leave the show. my first doctor was doctor no. 3, jon pertwee's doctor. mr. eccleston needn't worry about his position in the dr. who universe. it is as solid as the rest. he is the 9th doctor. i didn't know of mr. eccleston prior to his performance in dr. who, but i do now. i wish there was some way, he could know, there is push out in the dr. who fan community to find his other work and enjoy it. we have already seen that he is a great actor.

i love pop culture, but i was a little apprehensive when i first heard about this. then, i seen an episode, and i love it! i was a little upset when i found out that christopher eccelson would no longer be playing doctor who. he was probably the best one they've had. he fits the character so well. it's sad to see him go. i really don't think that the new guy is going to pull off the doctor as well as eccelson.i think everyone can overlook the cheesy effects in some spots and the creatures, such as the darleks. the story lines and characters can more than make up for that. i'm currently waiting for season two and i will review that as well, in case, for any reason, quality goes down.anyways, i think everyone should try to see one episode. i did, and i have been loving it ever since. well written, well casted, and well produced, this show is worth the hour of viewing. doctor who gets a 10/10

first off, i have been a fan of the show back when my pbs station started showing it back in 1981. i learned many things about the show and the people who were in or contributed to the show.this latest installment of doctor who made a great impression on me. the original series, aka classic series, was made fun of by the bad special effects and/or wobbly sets. well, this is no more true. the special effects are awesome, but what is even better is the writing. you get a chance to learn more about our beloved doctor and maybe a bit of a reason why he loves the planet earth so much. without giving too much away, it is a very worthwhile series to watch. christopher eccelston brought a side of the doctor that we never get to see, a bitter and angry one but yet lovable at the same time.a must see!

i love dr who so much! i believe that david tennant is the best dr the show has ever had and billie piper the best companion! i liked the way the dr and rose had such a connection and a great relationship and the dr came close a few times to expressing his love for rose! it sadly came to an end after only 2 seasons. i will miss watching rose heaps and think that the show will not be the same without rose! but david is still there to make me laugh and make me happy to watch him play this fantastic role! i rate this show 110% it is fantastic! the graphics and monsters in this show are wonderful and every storyline is different but somewhat connected and i have actually learned somethings about love, the world and relationships from this show. therefore it must be one of the most fantastic shows of all time!

i was like watching it right and i was all like oh this is so totally awesome-full and then i was all like ya quite good indeed so i really enjoyed all the amazing dangers and all the british people and i think that the doctor is very a good doctor in his way of doing such wonderful doctor-y things and he was a very strange man and i was like maybe i won't like this guy because hes a new doctor and i like the old doctor thats not this guy but then i watched him and i was like oh this is awesome and i liked it so then i watched and enjoyed the great evil enemies and the great conquering of the evil guys and the happy doctor who is quite scary and happy looking

i write this after just seeing the latest episode broadcast in the uk, and to me it must be a tough job to keep up the standard. the last episode shown called "blink" has elements of gothic horror all to do with statues that aren't quite what they seem. the doctor and martha don't appear much, but that doesn't detract from a well crafted episode. the general standard has built to a high level and the last three episodes, the two parter with "the family" and the latest have to me been the best that the current team have ever done.it's not just david tennant holding it together, the whole supporting cast week in, week out are helping as well. for those awaiting series 3 abroad, the wait is is well worth it.

i'm a next generation person...i've never saw the original doctor who but i have heard about the series that sparked a great fan base in the past and still making its mark in the 21'st century; the new "doctor who" started in 2005 but for those that live here in the states like myself we pretty much see it as new episodes on sci-fi channel or bbc america; from season one we are introduce to a new player rose tyler (billie piper) and a pretty cool new doctor played by christopher eccelson (misspelled last name sorry). these two go on some many amazing and very extremely dangerous missions to save the world...every now and then they have companions from rose's ex-boyfriend mickey to the now ever present jack harkness (who can now be seen on the spin off "torchwood"). from season one to season two the pace is just about right...the stories can be from the outlandishly weird to the most action packed paced driven but either way its one rollercoster ride from the start of the theme song which is very catchy.in season two he becomes different and changes and now the new doctor (david tennant) continues the fight to save the world with rose and from this point there can be some that say some of the season wasn't as good but i have to disagree and it was sad to see rose and the doctor part ways but it leaves the opening "companion" role to martha (played by the very sexy freema agyeman) who helps continue the fight to save mankind...season three now is more on the action/adventure level and sometimes on the emotional but not as much as the first two seasons; here the relationship between the doctor and martha is fitting but the attractiveness can be rushed into at times and the obviousness comes into play that she's not rose tyler being that you experienced her company in the first two seasons and not in the third season it can be a bit awkward it was for me cause you get use to rose and her ways and now to see someone who at times don't really question the doctor on an emotional level but all the same makes the pace very exciting for viewers which keeps you at the edge of your seat.all in all this is one thrill ride of a television show i would give it more but there are some flaws to this show as well that i can't mention cause its sometimes hard to pick up but just one does which is the doctor and martha's relationship is rushed and not leveled on the get to know you base; i've seen good shows on british tv but this is by far one of the coolest sci-fi adventures for the old and new generation to experience but you don't have to take my world for it...step into the tardis and join the adventure.

unlike most people who've commented, i was born after the last sylvester mccoy episode and so couldn't have compared the two centuries of doctor who at first. i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series. i have, since then, seen old episodes of doctor who and some where great, but, like the doctor, the series needed to regenerate to continue. the 21st century doctor who's are great, i thought martha was great, almost a match for the doctor and if jack's appearance is anything to go by, she's going to be brilliant when she cameos in series 4 or 5.speaking of jack, the spin of, torchwood is also brilliant and you should watch both of these programmes (though this is definitely more suitable for kids). however, if you insist that this isn't the same and just isn't doctor who, please, just stay in your basement.10/10

as soon as the credits rolled on saturday night you could feel it in the air that the doctor was most definitely back!watching those iconic moments where christopher eccelston met billie piper was the beginning of a huge long adventure.with this new series it brings with it substences in which the previous version of the show lacked. for instence, the emotion between the doctor and his companion which they seemed to dismiss in the old series, as well as the doctor actually falling in love with a companion and receiving her love in return. yet as we know, the doctor shall forever remain lonely as the end of season 2 proved, he could not stay with a companion forever. watching those moments, your eyes filling with tears as the doctor says his final farewell to the only companion he has ever loved, were moments beautifully written and acted.this show however proved it can live on as the doctor meets many other companions along his lonely yet exciting journey through his never ending life.openeing new doors and secrets every episode it's a sure show for the family to enjoy...as christopher eccelston once described the show... "the journey of a lifetime."

honestly, i don't really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show. it embraces the elements of the original, while expanding on them. the storytelling has been updated and, while some of the episodes seem to be a bit "fast", that is a good thing.christopher eccleston is perfect in the role. easily as good as tom baker.rose is one of the best companions, on par with sarah jane smith or leela.i like the concept that the timelords have been destroyed - no more politicking with the doctor acting as president emeritus. and it adds something to the character to be the only one left.the sfx are outstanding - especially in comparison to the original.take it from me (and i was a huge dr who geek - i actually took notes while watching the show all the way from dr number 1 to dr number 8. i tossed the horrible movie out of cannon, personally) this is the best sci fi show on tv right now, possibly ever. watch it and buy the dvd.

okay, i grew up on who, but haven't loved a doctor since tom baker. christopher eccleston made me love who again and i'll be furious with him forever for leaving. the writing is grand, the acting superb, the directing (which was dreadful in the old days) is just fantastic. i was very skeptical about this programme, and watched it merely out of being forced, but am now a huge fan and love it (i have a ringtone of a dalek screaming "exterminate" then). a few of the things i love about the new programme -- 1) people actually notice when rose (billie piper) disappears off the planet. some of the old shows an assistant would drop off for a while, and then come home like nothing has happened, no one noticed. 2) chris eccleston's doc loves rose -- romantic or not will be debated, but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares about his companion. he'd destroy the world if he had to to save her, which the old show was lacking -- often a doctor wouldn't care if he never saw his assistants again. 3) they talk and think like real people -- when rose is shown something outlandish or new (such as aliens) she acts like a real person would -- gobsmacked. i never liked it when an assistant from the old show, who never saw anything alien, would just fit right in and adapt instantly. i want to see the surprise on rose's face when she sees a plastic dummy come to life. she gives that to me. the few things i don't like about this series: 1)nearly everything happens on earth (london or cardiff) and i was sort of hoping for a more off-world sort of show. 2) that eccleston left so quickly, he really made the show brilliant. but i can let those few things go -- i far more enjoy the series than i ever expected to, so i don't mind if they have stuff set on earth. just don't take this show seriously -- it's fun, it's smart, it's entertaining, but it's not a super-serious heavy duty show. it's pure fun, and pure british, and i can't get enough. watch it with an open mind, and just put your brain into neutral and enjoy!ps -- don't watch series 2 or later. series 1 was brilliant, the first few episodes of series 2 were good, but don't watch it once it gets to love and monsters. utter rubbish, completely destroys the show.

i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local pbs station played while growing up.(got introduced to the doctor by way of john pertwee)as well as "camera copies" of doctor who sent to america by uk fans to their us counterparts. i had a great time w/ the show, but it never seemed to take itself seriously - i mean as seriously as a sci-fi show about a time traveler could be. i went to the cons, did the costume bit (doctor#5,6 and tegan were my costume characters), loved it. then it all came to a sudden halt. program politics and lack of interest and funding turned doctor who into a 25year old antique that drifted into the ethos.when i heard that the sci-fi channel had picked up the new doctor, my first thought was, "cool, now my 11 year old son can see what i've been babbling on about all these years, and know what the heck a tardis is" (i have several phone boxes and tardises of various sizes around the house)i didn't expect the excellent quality of story, character development and f/x. i was to say the least - pleased. for the first time, i found a doctor that wasn't a curmudgeon, a clown, a fop, a trip-head, a pussy, or a jerk. christopher eccleston is by far the most believable doctor to date.now, now, calm down tom baker fans! don't get me wrong, i loved almost every doctor and his quirks, but christopher gave something to the doctor that he'd never had before - real word believability. i'm just sad that he decided against another season. i'll try out david tennant as i would any other doctor, but now the bar has risen...bad wolf rules!!!!!2008 update - i love david tennant! his "mod" persona is something that my generation remembers, my son's generation can deal with, and fashion gestapo can relax! he's a little more human than christopher, but not as humas as other former doctors. i miss rose, i dig martha, and what were they thinking with donna noble!?!? it's still the best ride on tv

being an israeli jew of naturally sarcastic nature as well as a lover of different and independent cinema, it always gives me pleasure to see a film that takes a view on the holocaust that's sensitive and respectful while also being original and unusual. while i haven't read the book  or, for that matter, heard of its existence prior to watching the film  and therefore cannot, like some other reviewers, comment on how they stack up in comparison, everything is illuminated gave me great pleasure, and i can certainly comment on that.to label everything is illuminated a holocaust film would be to do it great injustice, even though it is undeniably about the holocaust. so would labeling it as a comedy or a travel film, although it's about a journey and is as exceptionally funny as it is moving. everything is illuminated is about jonathan safran foer  played to minimalist perfection by elijah wood, in the most impressive dramatic performance i've seen him in yet, with a poker face that shows nothing and reveals all  a young american jew, and an obsessive collector of family heirlooms and historical artifacts, who travels to the ukraine on a journey to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the nazis. it's also about alex, his tour guide through the ukraine, and alex's grandfather. what's fascinating about these characters is that in the beginning of the film they look like comic relief to balance out the melancholy nature of wood's character; but both alex and his grandfather go through fascinating changes throughout the film, and turn out to be at least as important as jonathan. in fact, boris leskin's as the grumpy, self-declared blind grandfather turns out to be the finest dramatic performance in the film.aside from the surreal nature of the film and the characters, the beautiful mix of original acoustic music and russian folk music, the sensitive cinematography and the chilling contrast between the beauty of the landscapes and the horrors of history, what made everything is illuminated a powerful and moving experience for me was the fact that from alex and his grandfather we get a very different and original viewpoint on this painful subject; several excellent films, such as the grey zone and downfall, have already given us the point of view of the lower-rank nazis who are presented as human beings who aren't necessarily fully aware of the moral implications of their actions but are caught up in the reality of the war. everything is illuminated presents a point of view rarely treated before: alex's point of view is that of a young man who was born many years after the war, who sees it as hardly more than cold historical fact, who finds himself having to face up to the horrors his own people  and maybe his own family as well  were capable of. the change in alex's attitude  and his grandfather's  towards jonathan, towards the holocaust, and towards the jewish people in general, makes the film a fascinating and original study in character development.everything is illuminated is a terrific directorial debut for actor liev schreiber, and one of the most original and unique films of 2005. it's a highly recommended viewing experience, especially or anyone interested in the holocaust and world war ii.

let me start by saying that liev has gained a ton of respect from me after seeing his directorial debut "everything is illuminated". anyone who has read the book knows how saturated the story is with nonsensical and hilarious vocabulary by alex along with countless flashback scenes and crazy dreamlike sequences. liev took all of this and made it work. the movie itself is great - the soundtrack, the performances, the cinematography - it all works. there is a lot of story missing about the town and its inhabitants, but there's only so much you can do with an indie, so this part of it didn't bother me too much. it's just disappointing that not a lot of people will see this movie or even know that it exists because of the lack of promotion that came with it. i didn't even know it was in theatres. i didn't know when the dvd came out. you'd think that since frodo baggins was one of the main characters, somebody wouldve at least released a commercial for it. i had to see the trailer on my "paradise now" dvd (released on dvd in the spring of '06) to even know that it had a "fall of 2005" theatrical release date. haha - sad really.anyhow, if you stumble across this review somehow because one of your friends read the book and loved it or saw the movie and are recommending that you see it - take my advice and watch it. it's a very good experience.8 out of 10.

excellence seems to come rare in hollwood today. many consider just two out of the year's best picture nominees to display sense to the movie industry. and in 'everything is illuminated,' the mark is hit directly.the film initiates its brilliance with the beautiful setting-the-scene entry. from the beginning, you receive a sense of warmth and true family connections and relations between one and another. and also, the cast is introduced perfectly. for elijah wood's character, jonathon, his sensibility is expressed through holding his dying grandmother's hand. and for the character entitled alex, it is easy to see his life in his perspective - the true ukrainian rock star. with the cast illuminated at first, the story slowly eases into our minds as jonathon decides to venture to ukraine to meet the woman believed to save his grandfather, thus the entire family. and from there, the story movies slowly, yet kept at a fast pace from the contrast of tear-dripping drama and laugh-out-loud humor included in scene-by-scene, every scene.although the movie itself is rather awarding, there are several complaints from other sources commenting about liev schrieber's inaccurate adaptation of the jonathon safron foer novel. personally, i have never read the novel. but any movie, especially this movie in particular should not be graded on whether the storyboard of the film matches the storyline of the book, but rather how the major concepts from the novel were expressed and exploited through the film. just because it may be far-fetched from the novel does not mean that this film is no longer a must-see - it still is.throughout the film, new information inundates the audience's mind very slowly. some of these thoughts are never answered; and in fact, the second half of the movie refocuses its entire topic and reason of travel through ukraine onto something different, yet rather similar to the original intentions of this film. the film does however leave you on a satisfied note - yet to the weak-hearted souls, a tear may be dropped. and throughout the film. to the saneful people with common sense of humor may just have to laugh from alex and john's fun and ongoing conversations.i would recommend this film to several different types of people: to those whom enjoy movies that share the genre drama-comedy, for those who have an interest in family connections, and to those whom have an interest in holocaustic subjects. and to those insane people who find slapstick as hilarious comedy, this movie is not for you. and for you whom think that this is a seriously funny and absolutely ingeniously funny film, you are wrong; this film shares comedic moments and dramatic sequences. and to those whom judge a movie based on their likeliness with its corresponding novel, you may or may not enjoy this film, but this film should be taken for much more than whether or not it was close to the book.all in all, 'everything is illuminated' is an ingenious piece of work that will enlighten anyones' hearts.

i went to see this because i have some friends in the ukraine. but the film moved me beyond what i expected by turning out to be a perfect blend of belly holding laughs (alex's strange use of english) situational comedy and heaviness bordering on depressing. i loved the range. it made me want to jump in to an old car and hit the road for the ukraine. alex (hutz) plays his guide part perfectly and provides a great counterpoint to elijah woods' poker faced earnestness. the film shows the positive side of humanity when ppl of differing cultures can bond and do the right thing when they feel the sincerity of the situation, even when they went into it with preconceived notions and prejudices, and how this can open up doorways into deeply buried memories. there is a lot in this film.

"everything is illuminated" is like viewing a fine piece of museum quality artwork. it absolutely inundates the emotions through a very broad spectrum. jonathan safran foer is played with candor by elijah wood. he is in search of his paternal heritage in the ukraine. his travels bring him in contact with alex, played very well and with extreme humor by eugene hutz. his grandfather is the most emotional tie to this film and he is aptly portrayed by boris leskin. if one finds little humor in the human characters in this cinema, then one has only to turn to mikke, a real dog who is called sammy davis jr. jr. by alex and his grandfather. they also call him the "seeing eye bitch". the cinematography is spectacular. the colors are a very important part of the patchwork of the film. it is a film worth the time and emotional investment.

the movie "everything is illuminated" comes from first-time writer-director liev schreiber, adapting jonathan safran foer's first novel. the book was ambitious and sprawling, its magical-realist elements and vivid use of language seemingly impossible to represent on screen. the movie, wisely, attempts less. while the end result is not as wildly original as the novel, it's still an accomplished movie about a strange eastern european road trip, or, as one of the characters would have it, "a very rigid search."that character is alex (eugene hutz), a young ukrainian man who loves american pop culture but can't seem to get the english language straight. nevertheless, his grandfather (russian actor boris leskin), who runs a tour company catering to american jews, convinces him to serve as a translator for jonathan (elijah wood). jonathan is investigating his family history, and specifically trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the nazis. more than one family secret gets revealed during their quest.the movie's jonathan (not to be confused with the author of the novel) is a semi- kleptomaniacal weirdo who steals his own grandmother's dentures to add to his collection of "family things". wood's quiet, wide-eyed, earnest manner works very well in this role. hutz makes an impressive debut as the loose-limbed, easygoing alex. his malapropisms are hilarious, but he is also able to pull off the character's growing self-awareness. the dog mikki is very funny as the demented sammy davis jr. jr., and one of the few movie dogs i've ever seen that isn't cloyingly cute and precocious."everything is illuminated" eventually puts the holocaust on a human scale, asking us to remember it not as a general event, but as millions of specific, small tragedies. reminiscent of a european movie, it also ponders the effect of past events on present-day young people like jonathan and alex. with its original perspective, strong performances and some very striking visuals, "everything is illuminated" is great work for a first-timer, and hopefully schreiber will continue to direct movies.

dear readers, 2001: a space odyssey is kubrick at his best...although i really can't say that as space odyssey is his only film i've ever watched. but still, it's a good film. strange, but good.the movie is in three acts, much like the novel...which is unsurprising since the author wrote the screenplay. anyhow, we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with also sparach zarathustra blaring on the speakers. then comes the boring beyond belief 'dawn of man' sequence. then there's the odd 'finding of the monolith' sequence on the moon, played to strauss's blue danube. finally things get good with the spaceship scenes and hal going berserk and killing people. after that things die down and we have the 'entering the monolith' sequence which was way too long and the ultra-strange ending. even though, 2001: a space odyssey is a good film. it's not star wars, stargate, terminator, or the abyss, but it rocks. my compliments to the chef, mr. kubrick.signed, the constant dvd collector

this movie used to be played constantly on the disney channel when i was a bit younger, and i really remember liking it. however, i didn't have great taste back then (not to say that i do now) so i can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. the movie was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so i gave it an extra point. yeah, worth watching. i know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash. the song is "play a love song" by the jaguars and it is very hard to find and obtain. in fact, this movie is, too. i can't find it anywhere online or on dvd or on vhs. i'd like to see it again so i can gauge if it was actually a good movie. oh well.

this movie is very good and the whole family would enjoy watching it.when susie q is of to her big night at prom she dies in a fatal car crash on her way to prom by kids who are drunk and high.as the years go by susie's house gets sold and a family moves into the house that she loves.as the boy who now lives in the house sees susie and is the only one who can.the two team together with his little little sister and try to save susie's parents from being broke.staring amy jo johnson as susie q.this movie will fell your heart with comedy,sadness and laughter.i hope that you see this movie because it is very good.but no one seems to have it on dvd or vh's and it no longer comes on tv.

i love this movie. and disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. i think they should definitely put susie q back on the air at least one night so we can record it!!! but if not does anyone know where i can find it?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. online, or anywhere. i told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also. all these disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring. i need susie q back!! it was a great movie and had great actors and i don't see why it was taken off the air. if everyone loves this movie so much why was it taken off the air. please take my comment into consideration and along with all of the other comments made to this movie. thank you, have a nice day.

i'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold. all who love this movie should email disney and increase the demand for it. they'd eventually have to sell it then. i'd buy copies for everybody i know. everything and everybody in this movie did a good job, and i haven't figured out why disney hasn't put this movie on dvd or on vhs in rental stores. at least i haven't seen any copies. this is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all. the kids in the new generation don't get to see it and i think they should. it should at least be put back on the channel. this movie doesn't deserve a cheap download. it deserves the real thing. i'm emailing them now. this movie will be on dvd.

does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this. i have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made the dvd or vhs or idk.i saw this right off disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie. also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie. if anyone knows how to get a copy of this movie or has a copy and willing to sell it to me for like 50 bucks or something, please call 201-566-0148. thank you

i love this movie. is it on air anymore? what can i do to get it on air again because i miss this movie when does this movie air again? i love this movie so much. does anyone know how long it has been since it was last on disney?it has been a very very long time and i am so sick of waiting!i want to see susie q again. i swear, they take all the good movies off air and play new stupid gay ones that are fake and retarded. i miss this movie, wish upon a star, kazaam with shaquille o'neil, and a bunch more. where did all the good movies go? i want them back.i miss all the good movies and they don't have them anymore. if anybody finds out if susie q or any good old disney movie comes out will you please let me know, my email is girlygirl148@aol.com girlygirl(no blank space)148. thank you and i hope you want this movie back too. have a great day

my kids loved this movie. we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie. we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. that amy jo johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys had crushes on her. they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with. (as you can tell i am rambling a bit to fill lines lol). but seriously it is a fun movie and worth watching. disney please give us a dvd or replay!

don't you ever miss the good old days when disney actually made great movies that really moved you? growing up with disney i always found myself being captivated by the characters. every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. i remember friday nights and running to turn on the tv just to watch their newest movies. susie q was one of my all time favorites. i never forgot this movie. even till this day when one mentions the song "susie q" i always remember the movie. if anyone is thinking of watching this movie i promise you, you will fall in love with it. i don't think i will ever be able to forget it. you will not regret watching it. unfortunately it's sad to see disney movies such as "the hannah montana movie" come out. what ever happened to disney?

susie q is an original and isn't like those other bad disney film, ***spoiler*** a boy named zach moves to a new town and has trouble at school, he is good basketball. a girl in the 1950's died with her boyfriend, when their car was crashed off a bridge. susie (amy jo johnson) from the power rangers - pink ranger- is helping zach as a ghost to get a necklace along the way he must explain to his sister about her ghost, and finally getting this necklace, susie returns to the bridge she died on and then she gets in the ghostly car of her boyfriend and they float up. later as he misses her he finds a girl who looks just like her. (do you believe in reincarnation?)susie q is a good movie to see now and then but they barely give because disney needs to fill everything up with stupid movies and shows i give it a7/10

susie q. is one of those rare, and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling. it's bittersweet, but wholesome, and it's characters are fun, and captivating. at first, i thought the movie would be the cliché cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes, but was i wrong. it made me tear up at times, and it's plot was enticing, making me root for the good guys. i loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!! i recommend it highly to anyone, and the movie is family oriented, so you won't have to worry about unsuitable content. truly, if disney would show more movies that are up to par as susie q., it would be the most popular family oriented channel in the world. now if only disney would show it just one more time!^_^ go susie q.!!

although not the most technically advanced film i have seen, this was a fun and enjoyable couple of hours. the main characters are sweet and you really get to like them, and feel something when susie q. has to go, but feel good again when she returns as maggie.lots of stock dialogue, and a contrived plot-line, but most of all, lots of fun.

i saw conrack on a night i couldn't sleep and i was never so glad to have insomnia ! this story of a young white teacher who takes a position teaching poor black kids on an island in the carolina's is a great advertisement for teaching , and for simply helping each other .set in the early 60s , with the civil rights issues , viet nam and all that came with the 60s ,it is forgotten that the peace corps and many young people struck out to make a difference helping the unprivileged .conrack with his open style of teaching is interested in these kids as people , and encourages an honest interaction in his class that scares the power's that be .the greatest part was that jon voight said they had a 20 year reunion and 18 of those kids became teachers !! its enough to make you think we as humans may have a chance to survive ourselves ,maybe , hopefully .see this film .

i'm going to make this short and sweet. it's not surprising that you had no use for this film. this is a story about the power, beauty and possibilities inherent in a meaningful education. based on your pathetically composed comments i can see that your own education has been woefully neglected... or worse... completely wasted. your comments are those of a truly ignorant person. i would advise you to do something about this condition... but in your case i feel it's probably too late. my hope is that you yourself don't intend to go into the teaching profession ( especially in film studies) because you could only do damage. oh... one last bit of advice. in the future, if you intend to write more opinion pieces, you should really proofread your work. it will make people take you more seriously.

our america is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. this movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. it is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. generally, a good movie. it entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. should be seen by all. having lived in the u.s. all my life, i had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens. this movie helps illustrate the diversity of our country by showing this small part of a southern state. the obvious conclusion: if this is really for real, then what else is out there that we know nothing of?

this movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... realistic. movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. the producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. the lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. at least that's how it seemed at the time. in today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. there would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic. the sad fact is that the movie depicted a situation which could not be improved upon without action from the improvement of the relationship between the white southern traditional thinking and the progressive movements of that time.

i not only consider this to be the best film that jon voight (midnight cowboy, coming home) has ever done, but a real tribute to teachers.despite incredible odds, pat conroy (voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. his methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like mr. skeffington (hume cronyn), but teachers like conroy will always be winners.voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him. he didn't overplay the role, and i found him to be totally believable. voight is conrack.besides a love of teaching, we also see another important point in this film. no matter how good you are at your job, if you rock the boat, the bureaucrats will get you.

just watched conrack for the first time. although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. as an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded. the thread concerning the vietnam war rings true even today. well worth a look.

john voight plays the title character in this movie based on author pat conroy's (prince of tides) autobiography. a fine teacher film, it tells the story of a naive pat conroy, a young english teacher whose first assignment is in an elementary school on a rural island. the only white man on the island, he must battle internal and external pressures as he attempts to instill education and values in children who for generations have been systematically denied such things. a solid performance that really makes you think.

i saw this film on tv in the uk some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. my interest has recently been rekindled by visiting hilton head - the next island over from "yamacraw" (daufuskie actually), and reading pat conroy's excellent "the water is wide". with the benefit of knowledge i have reappraised conrack and consider it a masterpiece. jon voight captures the spirit of conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a hollywood rarity. three things still strike me about this tale: 1. the issues of educating the poor and disenfranchised and being inclusive remain the same. 2. education is about more than reading and writing. 3.. these kids were my peers, i was 6 in 1969 when pat conroy spent his year on daufuskie.why this has not made it on to dvd yet?

i remember seeing this film when i was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it. i found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. one in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. they also bound him and shaved his private parts. this was all because he was unpopular. why was he unpopular? because he was bad at games. i have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular. to me, he is the type of person who would always be picked on because that's how children operate. popular children are popular because they are in some way 'cool'. popularity is a hard thing to define. so, even at the end when he is successful in his career it makes no difference & he is still left feeling tormented. i found the ending quite distressing as there was no resolution.

thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow imdb member i've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years, and i can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its kick. i can't believe that channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. it focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other. as events from both the past and present unfold the tension gradually thickens, not dissimilar to shane meadows' excellent revenge-chiller dead man's shoes. the acting, writing and direction are very bold for 1983 and still pack a wallop today in spite of the upper crust accents of the central characters. yes, it might be set in public school but it's worlds apart from anything put out by merchant ivory; i got a state education and can still draw countless parables from the story. this is a film that you'll remember for a long time if you see it - except you probably won't, because channel 4 (or filmfour) have chosen to bury it. on their own official website they describe it as "an inexplicably overlooked gem from the early days of channel 4" - overlooked by who? this was one of the very first channel 4 films (which would later go on to become filmfour thanks to the success of films like trainspotting), so somewhere someone must still have the master print. in these days where you can get extended collector's issue dvds of more or less anything it's a bit moody that they can't give a film this good the promotion it deserves. so, if one of the channel 4 production flunkies is reading this, stop making programmes that showcase people humiliating themselves in the hope of securing a tabloid deal, chase up this film and sort out a nice special anniversary edition disc or something, please!

i've only seen this film once when it was shown on tv but i can still remember it 15 years later so that must say something about it. i thought it was an intelligent look into schooling, friendship, bullying and the influence it can have leading into adult life.the title really refers to how being good or bad at sports can either make you the lowest of the low or you will be tolerated by the cliques within school and even later on into adulthood if you're good at it- this is set in a private school in england but it could be anywhere.the main character is bad at games, seeks revenge in later life which all culminates in a climactic confrontation on a cricket pitch. i must admit i was gutted by the ending - it was powerful and saddening.

this is a funny, clever film and well worth your time. in my opinion it is much better than american pie and other films of the same genre that seem to get knocked out all the time. i hadn't heard of this film, so i guess it didn't get much press, which is kind of a shame. it doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time delivers a serious message to people about life and life experiences and what is important...as opposed to a film about a bunch of desperate guys trying to get laid for the first time and one dude sticking his d**k in a pie, but in the end everyone gets laid and whoop-de-do... one thing that impressed me was that the soundtrack was pretty awesome and not the usual cheesy american pop-punk...they actually had real punk from back in the day like the ramones...that in itself made the film better! to be honest i wasn't expecting much from this film and i was pleasantly surprised at how good a comedy it is.

this movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not: intelligence and good messages. accepted, is the story of a kid named bartleby (justin long) who gets rejected by every college he applies to. his parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. so, bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids. not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. but behind this plot which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the american educational system. the college they create "south harmon institute of technology" accepts those who did not get accepted anywhere else. the message is that you do not need "money, tradition, or fancy books- you just need a desire to better yourself." they are a completely unorthodox school, but what the movie teaches is that thats still ok- and different (whether its a person or a school) is not necessarily bad, and that every one no matter should be given the chance to better themselves- despite whether they are 'weird.' its a message of non-comformity and has traces of anti-authority sprinkled in as well. but not only are messages great- its hilarious! haha i laughed very hard. the humor can be subtle but can also be blatant as well, and is a great mix. fraternities beware.

when the trailer for accepted first came up, many people began to get excited about seeing it... really excited. who could blame them, it looked like fun. but that's exactly the thing. people went into accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie. it's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given. that being said, for those of you who expected a great film, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one. think that, and you will truly enjoy the film (because you'll rid yourself of your idea that the movie will be fantastic.) bottom line: watch the movie, and have fun, but don't look for anything groundbreaking.

if i had watched this movie when i hit rock bottom i probably would have sunk into the deepest depression of my life, and may have been nearly desperate enough to try it, the only thing is in the real world, when you rob millions of dollars from unsuspecting individuals, everything doesn't come up roses (unless you are an investment banker or government affiliated) so how does that matter? i had been rejected from school after school, and it stings, so it is a brilliant topic for a movie, and when you give yourself over to the imaginary to let yourself watch this movie without applying real world ramifications, it can truly touch someone in that situation, and let them know they are not alone. overdone soliloquy completely tears apart the established educational system as we know it. really, all i can say is that as i am in college now, looking back on where i was, and watching this movie, i can truly appreciate it in a way i never would have been able to otherwise. it is juvenile and contrite yes, but it is an emotional and uplifting fantasy about freedom, and i cant think of a better way to end my night.

accepted...let's see. the only reason why i had chosen to see that movie was the hot dog shown in commercials when shrader(sp?) said, "ask me about my weiner". after that i had to see that movie and i watched it with a couple of my friends...and wow amazing. one of the best films of the year. the entire movie i was laughing like crazy! the plot in this story is that bartleby (justin long) doesn't get accepted into any of the schools he applied, so he makes another fake college for him and his friends so that he can fool his parents that he did make it into college. so he makes the finishing touches and he fools his parents...until, more students look at the website and see the clicker (acceptance is one click away) and all these rejects come to this school. they face many problems and they just cant seem to get anything right 10/10 loved it now watch it

diora baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. but really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch.(minor spoilers) as per usual, the main character, b, is the sane one of the bunch. b has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to. he's known for making fake ids. so an acceptance letter is no problem.because b's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he's never heard of, b gets his friend sherman to design a website for the university. sherman has been accepted to a great college and is in fear of being arrested for fraud. he's very quick with witty lines but his flaw is he wants to be accepted socially too much.glen, hands, and rory are the three stooges that follow b along. glen got a zero on his sats and has no thought process. he's constantly proposing battle royals, but he's very good at making smoothies, which gets him a lot of hot girls, somehow. hands was a great football player who didn't receive the scholarship he was counting on, and turns to crafts to cover his lack of athletics. rory was preparing to go to yale since the 1st grade, and was not accepted. she spends her time meditating.uncle ben was my favorite character. picture lewis black playing himself. if you have no reason to see this movie, then see it for lewis black and jonah hill. they're amazing.monica is a b's love interest. as most of these stories go, she's more popular than him and doesn't even notice him until half way through the movie. unlike many other stories though, b actually gets her and keeps her until the end. monica is actually a good character on her own, but of course she's primarily there for b to adore.there are more supporting students at the made-up college who are fun to watch. a.d.d.'s name is self explanatory, and funny enough he ends up in the meditation class. kiki is a hot ex-stripper who falls head over heels for a chance to go to school and eventually gets a crush on glen. maurice is an ex-military idiot who got his g.i. bill and wants to study rock n' roll in college. the final guy is only known as freaky student, who thinks he can blow things up with his mind. ye who have little faith in him wait until the end of the movie.of course the villains are the dean of an opposing university, his university's student body president, the president's girlfriend, and their circle of friends.every character is lovable. i believe this movie has a good plot and is well done, despite what a lot of people say. even thought the overall story is predictable, the characters keep you guessing and make the movie great. go see this film. i give it 9 out of 10.

when i saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy american movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. i was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. the movie centres around bartely or b who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play b is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. however loads of people see his fake website and join. feeling their sorrows b can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate. the college is the ideal place with you learning what you want or doing nothing. the school faces opposition from the proper college which ends up closing it down. the film ends on a high and i recommend you watching it. its does have it flaws but it is a feel good cheerful film with a few unpredictable twists.

accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and pc ads. the movie is about bartelby .b. gaines a guy who has rejected from all the colleges he has applied for so decides to make his own college and invites all the other people who did not make it, problem is hundreds of people sign up to his school. the movie is hilarious and i was lucky enough to buy it for $5.00 at a sale and i have always watched it since. overall this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy as it is funny, witty and just a good movie all up. i rate this movie a very fair 78%. go accepted make a sequel guys but make sure it is not crap.

accepted is one of the best teenage comedies i have seen in a long time. it has an original script, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun.it tells the story of a high school graduate bartleby "b" gains (justin long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied to, so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional collage. in the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school. everything goes smoothly until a lot of other "accepted" students turn up on his doorstep. now he and his friend have to figure that collage thing out not only for themselves but for the others too.justin long as a lead man is absolutely brilliant, his character is as natural as he can be and the supporting acts are outstanding- jonah hill as sherman schrader, columbus short as hands, maria thayer as rory, adam herschman as glen and lewis black as uncle ben.the humour is fresh and simple and most importantly funny, right from the start to after the credits .the plot develops so easy that by the time you stop laughing at the last joke you start giggling at next other. along with all the fun the movie brings a very common subject to our attention i.e. the collage education. if usually the students in the movie are united against the school government, in this case they are united by the mutual desire to go to school and learn.yet the movie doesn't brand all other schools as wrong, it just shows that there is another way. you what they say "if there is a will there is a way.and may be sometimes the children know better what they need than their parents.this movie is an unmissable little story about the great opportunities in life wrapped up in the best format possible.

on the face of it, any teen comedy runs the risk of being sophomoric and obvious, and fair enough, most of them are. there are a few that have risen above the usual banality of the source material (bring it on, eurotrip), and they give me hope that others can join that depressingly rare crowd of teen comedies that are actually funny and not just an excuse to flash some starlet's boobs or be a vehicle for some never-was like tom green.enter accepted, directed by john cusack pal steve pink and led by the likable justin long (the smart nerdy kid in galaxy quest and more recently featured in apple computer ads), about a bunch of kids who don't get accepted to college and decide, as disclosed in the trailer, to fake a bogus one to get their parents off their backs. when they go a little too far with the website and other kids end up enrolling, the kids have a few problems to solve.okay, the set-up is obviously preposterous, but most comedy lives or dies in the execution, and here, accepted does pretty well. long's bartleby gaines (mostly shortened to 'b') is accompanied by enough well-meaning comically acceptable friends to help him share the load, but probably the best supporting character is 'dean' lewis (no doubt named as an homage to rodney dangerfield's dean martin), aka uncle ben, lewis black, who is wisely restricted to short spurts where he can rapid fire his unique brand of cranky observational humor. black is terrific here, frankly telling the kids what life is really like (his expletive-laden final line is hysterical) and providing the adult face to the bogus university for the parents.but long has to carry most of the film, and he does so, in spades; bartleby is easily identified with and we take to him almost immediately. a nice twist was provided by columbus short's character hands, an athlete who loses his scholarship due to an injury and ends up becoming the de facto art faculty at the fake college. also noteworthy as bartleby's hyper-intelligent and sarcastic little sister is hannah marks.yes, the film does feel familiar in some spots; there's a debt here owed, of all places, to revenge of the nerds. those who are rejected by everyone else find a home with bartleby and his cohorts, and of course the villains are steroid-enhanced conformist master race types who run a fraternity (well, okay, frats are evil) and seek to humiliate and bury the oddballs for the  gasp  crime of being different. but that aside, accepted has fun with the material, and even asks a few decent questions about the expectations on college kids and the course of higher education. not that it's a brain teaser by any means, but accepted isn't just another mindless teen comedy (or owen wilson vehicle). it's a funny, clever 90 minutes that, while not a great departure from its genre, is intelligent and creative enough to be very enjoyable.there is at least one moment of unadulterated brilliance in the film, when bartleby checks out a nearby college in an attempt to harvest ideas for his own school's curriculum. when he sees that the kids are all stressed out at the other school (several refuse to even talk to him during class for fear of missing something), he shakes his head, thinking that there must be a better way. as he moves to leave he is met by a stream of kids going the other way, one person moving against a human tide, while in the background, the opening lines of eleanor rigby play. perhaps an unplanned moment of brilliance, but brilliance none the less.

from the creators of bruce almighty and liar liar! the film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as i expected this was a run-along america pie flick. but it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his own college, running it accordingly. as you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. bartleby gaines (justin long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.' the humour was varied which i loved. all the cast delivered fantastic performances-- hire this one out with a friend, it's a bloody crack up!

i went in to this thinking another gross movie with gross humor. telling from my first sentence i don't like that humor and this movie had it's moments but i loved it. justin long has really never done comedy like this, where he's sarcastic and clever and i loved it. lewis black....enough said. the ending i really did love because it had to take itself seriously i mean how else would you end it? yes it's another underdog story but not in your typical format and the movie wasn't their ups and downs, it was people coming together for one common goal, to go to college where they were accepted. the cast was amazing and yes i did laugh at loud when i didn't think i would and the laughter lasted longer then i thought to. the parents and sister played their roles well but their characters are put in when necessary. the movie was not focused around them but at the same time they showed up when you expect and not expect them to. they played in to the story very well, and i loved the familiar faces anthony heald(boston public), jeremy howard (i) (galaxy quest with justin long) ross patterson (the new guy)and sam horrigan (brink). blake lively added her certain something to the movie which made it even more enjoyable, as well as b's friends. i recommend this movie to whoever hated those gross comedies of the last 4 years and really want something with humor and an actually story line!~!

complete entertainment! although there are many strange things in the movie that the fairy tale itself doesn't have them including the autumn characters (mother and daughter) the general concept rocks.

this is possibly one of my favorite films. it tells the tale of a girl named gerda (chelsea hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father. she falls in love with the bell boy named kai. however, on her birthday the snow queen (bridget fonda) comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps kai. gurda then goes after kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.i thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast. it has wonderful special effects and the story fits together very well and is easy to follow. i think that it is a great film for all the family to enjoy. i have watched it every time t has been on since it came out and have never tired of it which is why i have given it a 10!

i have probably watched the movie 4 or 5 times. every time, i get more and more impressed by how far the wish of a young heart can go, and the strenght of both kai and gertha to struggle for what they believe in.and the whole story is presented in such a way, you just get transfered into the plot and before you know it, you are there. you can see... yeah, there's kai... working hard on the mirror... a little jump.... there's gertha, fighting for her love..... and there's the snow queen...it's just a wonderful mix of love, adventure, tension.it's brilliant 10 out of 10

this is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's, and this one is even better. sylia, nene, linna, and priss are all back as the knight sabers in their hard-suits battling the robotic boomers. the animation is crisp, the characters are well-developed, and the action rocks. priss is a singer in her regular job, so the series features some wonderful songs as well. there is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too racy. the dvds also have many extras, including commentaries, which really enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the show. a must-have for any anime fan.also recommended: burst angel, armitage iii

when i started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the action channel,i have to say out of all the shows that i've seen that adv released,this one is one of the best shows of all time. i had to see it again,and that's when i got my chance. i bought the entire box set of this series at best buy for my 20th birthday. and i got to enjoy it,and see more of the episodes that i missed on action channel,and the same 3 episodes that i've seen. my favorite characters in this show are: sylvia,leon,and nigel. the animation in this series was the best,and the hard suits were cool as well. but the show also has a great voice cast like:chris patton,jason douglas,christine auten,and hillary haag,and more. so if you like this show on action channel,then you have to own it on dvd. it's the best,and you will see what i mean.

back in the mid/late 80s, an oav anime by title of "bubblegum crisis" (which i think is a military slang term for when technical equipment goes haywire) made its debut on video, taking inspiration from "blade runner", "the terminator" and maybe even "robocop", with a little dash of batman/bruce wayne - iron man/tony stark and charlie's angel's girl power thrown in for good measure. 8 episodes long, the overall story was that in 21st century tokyo, japan, year 2032-2033, living machines called boomers were doing manual labor and sometimes cause problems. a special, swat like branch of law enforcers, the advanced police (ad police for short) were formed to handle the boomers, but were mostly ineffective, prompting millionaire scientist sylia stingray, the daughter of the scientist who made the boomers, to create four powered combat armor (hard suits) to be worn by women to fight the boomers and fight the evil corporation that produced the boomers, genom. that group becomes known as the knight sabers, and in addition to ring leader sylia, her rag-tag band of rebel women included priss asagiri, a struggling rock and roll gal with a passion for motorcycles and a disdain for cops, linna yamazaki, an aerobics instructor with an eye for money and a tendency to blow through boyfriends, and nene romanova, a young officer of the adp and expert computer hacker (the first in a long line). genom, meanwhile, is represented by quincy, a tall, gaunt old guy who happens to own the company, his younger assistant brian j. mason (killed in episode 3) and an annoying boomer man named largo. other characters included leon mcnichol and daley wong, two ad police detectives (leon appeared in a spin-off/prequel anime, "ad police files" which i heard was very dark), their balding, overweight boss chief todo, sylia's younger brother mackey, and a funny little mechanic known as dr. raven, who apparently helps sylia with maintaining the suits. aside from the overall knight sabers & ad police vs genom storyline, there was also another storyline involving a friend of linna's who was apparently a daughter in a big crime family, the annoying largo trying to usurp genom, and various priss-wants-revenge-for-a-minor-character story. oh and did i mention that there were hints that sylia herself might have been a boomer?well, it was a great watch, full of chaos and mayhem and even some very nice pop songs, but it was not without its flaws, some of which, unfortunately, were due to the fact that the series was discontinued after episode 8 when it was originally planned for 13 episodes in all. so some of the storylines, like largo's scheme (or schemes), the family of linna's ill-fated friend, and sylia's origins, were never resolved. another problem with the series was that at the time priss was the most popular character, so a good portion of the series focused on her, and unfortunately, most of the priss oriented episodes basically focused on priss self-righteously seeking justice/revenge for some secondary character who had never appeared before but happened to be a friend of hers, yet she rarely went out of her way for her the knight sabers, who were always bailing her out of trouble and for some reason cared a great deal about her well-being (just to be fair though, she did go to rescue linna in episode 7, and her boyfriend got killed by a boomer and the adp acted wrongly in the investigation). this meant we didn't really get to focus on the more interesting back story of sylia, or even the day-to-day antics of nene and linna. linna had two episodes oriented around her, which pertained to her friend with the mafia family, while nene managed to snag the last episode for herself, which showed her eternal good cheer was genuinely good spirits and not ditziness. nene also got to put her computer skills to good use quite a bit, or she sometimes just acted like a lovable goof, which put her screen time and character development a few notches above poor linna, who was often thrust into the background with only her greed and her tendency to eat up boyfriends to get her any attention. don't get me wrong, i like it and i love the overall concept of it all, but it did irk me a little bit. also this is one of those runner-ups for "worst english voice dubbing of all time" features, meaning you'd better stick to the japanese. some of the voices were okay (some really did match their characters personas) but others were just flat and passionless or, in the case of priss, really overacted.well, tokyo 2040 comes along and pretty much tosses all that out the window. set a few years ahead, the story here is that after earthquakes shattered tokyo, genom's boomers rebuilt the city into a big old paradise, except the boomers still have a tendency to fly off the handle, which prompts the ad police to be formed followed by the knight sabers being formed. so the overall story is the same, but the backstories of the characters and the look and attitudes of the characters have changed a lot.1) originally sylia had short purplish black hair and brown eyes, was usually dressed like a stern, proper business woman and was distant from others. 2040 sylia has more of a super-model look to her, dressing more provocatively and possessing white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color depending on the light (runs the gamut from blue to purple to silver and eyes occasionally looking purple or gray), and also 2040 sylia is more of an emotionally unstable woman who flies off the handle when she's not in public, and possibly keeps even more secrets than before. sylia also doesn't take as much risk on the battlefield, as she is more of a stay-in-the-mobile-pit type here, but she does do battle when she has to.2) originally priss was a short woman with an afro and a really bad temper, always picking fights with people who offended her, always biting off more than she could chew, etc. 2040 priss, however, has gone the way of the clint eastwood loner - very cold, very stoic and emotionally distant (more like the original sylia you might say), so she's not really attached to anyone. also her hair is more stingry and cat-like (a big improvement) and she is clad in leather like trinity from "the matrix" (although much less annoying than before, unfortunately, the writers screw her in the end when revealing her reasons for hating the adp).3) originally linna had this big black hair going for her, but now her hair is shorter, browner, and, well, more 90s like. 2040 linna is also an office lady who has bad luck with being sexually harrassed. as if to apologize for the way she was treated by the oav writers, the 2040 writers actually dedicated the first 6 episodes to linna, writing her as a country girl new to the city but determined to meet the knight sabers and win a spot with them, which she eventually does.4) originally a short red haired girl who was often the victim of ridicule and ate a lot of candy, nene is now a short blonde haired girl who likes to tease and take pot shots at adp detective leon mcnichol (revenge for him toying with her in the oav?) and other characters, even her surrogate big sister linna and mackey, sylia's "brother", whom she becomes infatuated with. cockey and arrogant, she still eats a lot of candy and is a master hacker, but she is eventually deflated and grows beyond her comic relief status.5) nigel kirkland is a new character, a tall, stoic, ruggedly handsome man with long black hair (he looks like adrian paul from tv's highlander), he replaces dr. raven from the old series and now serves as the man who gives maitenance to sylia's hard suits. nigel is also sylia's lover, but you wouldn't know it by his demeanor. he's kind of the father/big brother/mentor figure to mackey.6) leon and daley are back, but of course differently. the original leon was a tall pretty boy built like a baseball player with slicked back brown hair, blue eyes, a black leather jacket, tight blue jeans, and always carrying a revolver that could magically pack more whallop than a howitzer if necessary; while he wasn't really a bad guy deep down, he was kind of a jerk, but he served mostly as comic relief, as he tried to pursue priss romantically (exactly what he saw in her is a mystery) but occasionally he and daley served as information guides to important plot points. also the original daley was a fairly muscular red head who dressed in pink/purple suits as he was a flamboyantly homosexual character who was always hitting on leon when not providing important information. in 2040, leon is no longer a pretty boy but more your typical rugged tough guy type, with spiked black hair, brown eyes, tall and sporting big muscles, a brown leather jacket and blue dockers (he actually looks like arnold schwarzenegger a little bit, or maybe a pumped up colin farrell, or hugh jackman), and he still carries a revolver, a big one, but it's not as powerful as before. although 2040 leon still has a bit of an attitude probelm (especially in approaching priss), he's not nearly as much of a jerk as he was in the old series, but he does have a bad temper and he is easily annoyed by nene and daley (also he drinks way too much coffee). oh, and leon is still after priss, but he has a lot more luck this time around. daley, meanwhile, is now a taller (but not as tall as leon) more pretty boyish looking guy with red rimmed glasses, a white suit, green eyes, and light brown hair, and he carries a big machine gun (he actually looks like james marsden from the x-men films); daley is a lot smarter and more assertive in 2040 than the oav and, although it's not completely clear, his homosexual tendencies have been almost totally disappeared, save a moment of what appears to be jealousy when he hears about leon inquiring about priss's e-mail.7) brian j. mason (what does that "j" stand for?) is back, and so is quincy, but mason is much more the main villain here, with quincy as co-villain, as he is no longer a towering figure of terror but a vegetable with a bunch of batteries and wires plugged into him. mason now sports slicked back brown hair instead of black hair as he did in the oav (he actually looks like oav leon in a suit) and he is very much from the alan rickman school of villains.8) though a pervert in the first series, mackey is no longer a pervert in 2040. of course, there are lots of things different about mackey in 2040, but they won't be revealed here.9) sylia now has a companion, an alfred-the-butler type named henderson, who worries about her and the gang.10) in the original series, boomers were like the replicants in "blade runner", armed with their own thoughts and feelings and ambitions, but in 2040, they're more of the dumb-monsters-on-the-rampage type. most of the time they're just big robots who do whatever they're programmed to do (heavy labor, combat, clean up, etc) and they have this tendency to "go rogue", which means try to evolve and become a monster in the process.what does stay the same is the theme of humanity vs technology (do machines have souls?). sadly, this series, though well animated and well written, only runs 26 episodes, so it moves by faster than one might like, especially those of us who are used to more than one season of our most beloved characters, and unfortunately it still ends on a cliff hanger with unresolved storyline bits (which i will not discuss here. what saves this show and makes it what it is, however, is the characters, a colorful cast of screwballs they are, ranging from stoic loners, psycho women, genocidal mad men, rough neck cops, sardonic intellectuals, wise old sages, and loveable innocents, much more diverse than before and with a lot more to play off of, they're enough to make you wish this show had gone longer.it's not great, but it's a good watch. also the english dub (by adv) is quite good, though not without a few flat spots, but certainly better than the dub on the original.

a boat builder in a sleepy town in maine is going out of business, and the lives of all of the (soon to be ex-)workers and families are disrupted. the biggest disappointment is that the two stars--bates and bridges--have only bit parts.interesting, but not something you would see twice.

legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star conrad radzoff (splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by ferdy mayne) dies of a heart attack. a bunch of drama school students steal radzoff's corpse from its crypt and take it to a rundown mansion so they can party with it. radzoff comes back to life and picks off the rude youths for desecrating his grave. writer/director norman thaddeus vane concocts a fresh, original, and even pretty stylish spin on the usual body count premise, offers a neat evocation of the glitzy hollywood milieu, and does a sturdy job of maintaining a pleasingly misty and spooky ooga-booga atmosphere. the kill set pieces deliver the grisly goods, with a gal being set on fire, a juicy decapitation (the severed head rolls right down the stairs and onto the lawn so a raven can peck away at it!), and another poor lass being crushed with a levitating coffin rating as the definite gruesome highlights. kudos are also in order for the stellar cast of familiar b-flick faces: mayne has a deliciously eye-rolling ball with his flashy role, leon askin contributes an amusing cameo as bitter washed-up director wolfgang, nita talbot adds some class as flaky psychic medium mrs. rohmer, plus there are nice turns by luca bercovici as jerky drama student ringleader saint, jennifer starrett as the sweet meg, jeffrey combs as the geeky stu, and scott thomson as the nerdy bobo. popping up in cool bits are chuck "porky" mitchell as a detective, patrick wright in one of his customary policeman parts, and tallie cochrane as a corpse. joel king's polished cinematography gives the film an attractive glossy look. the moody score by jerry mosely likewise hits the shuddery spot. a fun little fright flick.

ugh, what an embarrassing episode last night! it was either a failed script for "abc afterschool special", or the product of an earnest rookie writer, just out of college, making an homage to that classic pc anti-gun homily from 1974, "the gun". in fact hubby & were disappointed that the closing shot wasn't of the gun being melted down like in the movie!no, i'm not some nra shill. it's just that when the producer of an intelligent & nuanced series gets it in his head that i should be subjected to a didactic dramatization of his personal cause, i'd appreciate it if the lecture at least wasn't delivered via 2-by-4. geez!ok, the sociology lesson is over. the message has been delivered. the important episode has been aired. now let's get back to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence.

i have never missed an episode. david morse is a wonderful actor and i am hoping that this show can survive. it certainly beats out that csi crap. i love the storyline and would actually like to see him as a cop again someday. i give the show a 10.

"ahh...i didn't order no amazing hit show"....."we'll you got one" hack is simply the greatest television show ever made. a little bit of me died when i flicked on the t.v. one friday night to catch a little hack and it wasn't on. the show dug deep into key social issues of our culture. i found that at the end of any episode i watched; i walked away having been both entertained and informed. i am actually dumber now that hack is gone. i no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate. since hack has been gone i see them as eyesore's and an unneeded strain on taxpayers. so for the love of god we need to bring back hack!

he's not your conventional cab driver.this guys got issues. with his wife, with his son, a priest, all his fares, his ex-partner and most of all himself. and the greatest thing is they just throw us all into it. so we have to keep watching to find out more about his past.the idea may not be original but david morse makes it so. i think this is a great show, and i hope people catch-on before the season's over. watch this show!!!!!!!!!

this is not your run-of-the mill police story where the characters were only secondary to the gun battles and car chases. the episodes, so far, are more realistic and intelligent.if you are looking for something with a lot of butt-kicking rambo-style cop story, you will not find it here.i gave it a 9. i wish this series lives long. morse is excellent!

everywhere i hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched....well maybe a do-good cab driver in philly is pushing it a little (at least the cab drivers ive met), but that's what makes the show great.the fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun. its highly watchable and even though u know mike wins out in the end he never wins in life. david morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role. his supporting cast is great and i must say the location of the show is especially great!all in all i watch this show not because im looking for a good dose of reality or a show with lots of action, i watch this show because its got great acting, a good premise, and a great story-line every week. it's also a plus when i can pick out the landmarks he drives by, or know what intersection he's at. i love this show and i love philly!! give this show a shot!

it is nice to see a show that has a little more content than just blood and guts for a change! as an added bonus, it is nice to see some local home boys from massachusetts making good in l.a. i hope this show will be a keeper.

an extremely dark and brooding show with an excellent cast. one of the few shows that i try to watch on a regular basis. glad to see bebe neuwirth in a recurring role, but feel andre braugher is underutilized. he is one intense actor! hope cbs gives it a better time slot next season.

okay, so this series kind of takes the route of 'here we go again!' week in, week out david morse's character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle - but what's wrong with that!? david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there, and certainly the coolest, and to have him in a series created by david koepp - a great writer - is heaven!!due to the lack of love for this show by many, i can't see it going to a season series - but you never know? the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me - let's hope something good can make it past a first series!!!

i consider this a breathtaking but deceptive film because it seems so simple and straightforward: a vietnam survivor tells his harrowing tale and some of the story is reenacted on location. reviewers sometimes even claim that herzog's presence in the film is minimal, but how wrong they are. we know that all documentaries are "mediated" to some extent and this one has herzog's subtle hand all over it, most notably in the stunning music, the unbelievably expert selection of archival footage, and the management of cascading images. the evocative power of this film is astounding, starting with its title, the opening title card from the book of "revelation," and the initial voice-over. this is a movie that one can watch repeatedly with increasing wonder, not a simple commodity that is gulped down with one's favorite beverage on the way to the evening news. this is one of those movies that can resonate with you for a lifetime.

(some spoilers) early 1930's educational movie about the horrors of contracting a social disease and the consequences that come along with it: blindness madness loss of ones abilities to function as well as infecting other people with it, even one's unborn children, and finally death. "damaged lives" is far ahead of it's times in educating it's viewers about the dangers venereal deasise. viewed now over 70 years after it's release back in 1933 is as good, if not better, then the many films about that subject made back in the 1940's 1950's and even 1960's.donald bradley, lyman williams, is a top executive of a major shipping company who's been going study with his girlfriend joan, diane sinclair, for some time. both are finally planing to get married and raise a family. out at a party one evening donald meets elsie cooper, charlotte merriam, and together they have one drink too many and before you know it end up spending the night together in elsie's home. thinking nothing of his one night stand with elsie donald later marries his long time love joan and they both plan to have a child, or so they thought. at the office donald get a panicked call from elsie telling him to come over to her place right away about something very important. rushing over donald finds out, to his horror, that elsie has a sexual infection that she got from her boyfriend nat, harry myers, and that she may have given it to donald, and he in turn may have infected his wife joan. telling elsie that she's wrong about him being infected and that she should seek medical attention elsie shoots herself as donald is just about to leave. getting over elsie's tragic death donald gets another surprise later when his doctor dr. bill hill, jason robards sr, comes over to his office telling him to immediately come with him to the hospital to talk to infectious disease specialist dr. vincent leonard, murray kinnell, about his wife joan who's just been admitted there. the terrible truth about donald and his wife joan hits him like a bolt out of the blue and leaves him speechless, just like it did joan earlier. both have been infected and the infection is the dreaded and unspeakable,back in the 1930's, infection called venereal disease. told by dr. leonard that it would take some two years of treatment for both donald and joan to be completely cured it leaves joan in a state of dangerous suicidal thoughts. later in the film joan, feeling that she has nothing to live for, closes all the windows in her and donald's apartment and turns on the gas stove, full blast, in order to kill herself and donald who was asleep at the time. honest film about the ravages of venereal disease and the damage that it does to those who are infected by it, both psychically as well as mentally, and how it could be cured if given immediate medical care instead of hiding it from one's doctor and keeping it hidden, for fear of shame and embarrassment, until it's too late.

yes, this movie was just hilarious and the acting was top notch from the whole cast. except shelley winters german accent wasn't that great but then that doesn't matter as she is hardly in the film. so if you're a fan of hers beware! the two main stars of this film are laurence harvey and julie harris. now before this film, i'd only see miss harris in east of eden with james dean and i own an audio tape of the glass menagerie that she did on stage with monty clift and jessica tandy, so i wasn't sure how she'd be in this role and boy, did she impress me. how hammy was she? i love ham! ;-) mr. harvey, he tickled my fancy! i am now a full time laurence harvey fan! that hair!!! *cackles* omg! it's almost like burt lancasters, that crazy messy look, it doesn't get better than that. he is young and so innocent in this film. see it now! it's definitely in my top ten! :) i am so glad i found a copy that is all mine! unfortunately this movie is out of print and very hard to find on video. :(btw, watch out for the hospital hotel room scene!!!!! it's one of the best parts! or when mr. harvey has convinced himself he's ill and he's trying to get his knee to kick, you know how doctors do with that little rubber hammer ;-) well he does it himself and his leg kicks and it kicks the table *squeals* check out the look on his face, so innocent!!!! i can't describe it but to all those people who say he couldn't act very well and other cockamamie comments, see this film and you will see what a great actor he really was. you'll be bowled over! if you aren't, then i'm afraid there is nothing i can do for you, you're hopeless. ;-)

turning isherwood's somewhat dark and utterly brilliant novel into light comedic romp could easily have been a recipe for disaster, but somewhow it wasn't . the story moves at a zanily rapid pace and the black and white imagery is gorgeous, as are harvey and harris as they ham their way through a wacky weimar berlin. fun!

this british film version of the stage play i am a camera is based on christopher isherwood's "berlin stories." this is the source material for the famous musical cabaret.julie harris, a major stage actress of her day, reprises her 1951 tony award winning role as sally bowles. she's a far cry from the liza minnelli character but the basic "sally" is all here despite the various film codes that would have blocked this story from being filmed in hollywood. harris is perhaps stagy but she's also quite good as the madcap and maddening sally. her singing number is obviously dubbed (by marlene dietrich no less) although harris apparently sings for herself in other moments.laurence harvey (with the very ugly hair) plays isherwood with zero charm and can't even make the character interesting. shelley winters does little with the role of natalia (marian winters won a supporting tony for the play), and anton diffring is ok as fritz. ron randell plays the caddish clive but seems a tad loud. lee seidl is funny as the landlady.yet despite the overall staginess and cheap look, harris takes center stage and she is amazing. this film was released the same year as east of eden in which harris gives a glowing performance as abra. comparing the two performances gives a good look at the talent miss harris possesses. these two characters couldn't be more unalike. harris' sally preens and prances about and growls out a very lascivious laugh. she also acts circles around the boring harvey.without the music and with a familiar storyline, many viewers may find little here to recommend this film, but it's a great chance to see the great julie harris repeating what was probably a very shocking role in 1951.

i have just seen this delightful classic again after many years, the next to last film directed by henry cornelius, who died three years later at the age of only 45 (the same age at which the film's male star larry harvey was also to die in 1973). three future directors were in the crew: jack clayton (associate producer), guy green (cinematographer), and clive donner (editor). this film is based upon the autobiographical story 'goodbye to berlin' by the well-known british author christopher isherwood, which was first turned into a play by john van druten, then made into this film, then turned into a musical, 'cabaret', and finally filmed as 'cabaret', which brought the amazing liza minelli to world attention, with her voice which can shatter a glass at the distance of a mile. isherwood appears as a character in the film under his own name. he was gay, but in those days that was illegal and could land him in prison, so he disguises his proclivities under the description of being what he calls 'a confirmed bachelor'. this is the key to his platonic relationship with the wildly eccentric, wacky, promiscuous, ever-cheerful and thoroughly unique character whom he calls sally bowles. the portrait of sally bowles in this film is a tour-de-force by the young julie harris, who sweeps every scene into a magical and captivating web of sparkling personal charm. what a vehicle for an actress with plenty of charm of her own! it is one of the great cinematic performances of the 1950s. isherwood is played to perfection by the young lawrence harvey, in a finely-judged performance which never allows the comedy to go over the edge, and even the moments of farce bordering on slapstick remain somehow 'almost believable'. larry is so funny at portraying a wimpish hypochondriac. what an irony, considering the total lack of hypochondria shown by his bravery and stoicism in the last year of his life as he died from terminal stomach cancer and behaved with such dignity and lack of complaint. i knew him well in the last three years or so, and he was a generous, warm, and modest person. he adored his little girl domino, now alas also tragically dead.this film was his finest early performance, to be followed by his spectacular work in 'room at the top' (1959), 'summer and smoke' (1961) and 'the manchurian candidate' (1962). larry was often undervalued in his lifetime because he was too handsome, was often cast as a cad, and glamour boys are not always accepted as good actors, but many of the finest actresses played opposite him, and they were in no doubt of his abilities, and he was a strong lead in many of the most important films of his time. if he had lived beyond middle age, he would have gone from strength to strength and become a 'grand old man' of the screen. sitting in his house in hampstead one day, he gave me a glass of his usual white wine from a huge barrel which he had brought from some foreign cellar. i said he always gave me such delicious wine, what was it? he proudly answered that it was a sancerre which he had chosen himself at the vineyard in france and had shipped over specially. he then added with extreme wistfulness: 'you know, i've been waiting for four years for someone to comment on it and ask me what it is, and you are the first person who has ever done so.' what mattered to him was to be recognised for having taste in wine,and his more glamorous friends had denied him that satisfaction. in this film, anton diffring gives a touching early performance as an earnest young man (later he was to have to play nazi officers far too much, poor fellow), and the young shelley winters plays a rich german jewish girl, in her usual noisy but effective manner, but it was not too difficult, as she was a noisy jewish girl herself anyway. this film has such an air of joie de vivre about it, that it is pure delight.

hindsight is a wonderful thing. much reviled when it first appeared, (inspiring the famous review 'me no leica'), this precursor of "cabaret" can now be looked at in comparison and it's not half bad. it's certainly no classic but it has its own wayward charm, (the film version of "cabaret" follows this plot whereas the stage version changed the plot somewhat). one should, of course, resist the temptation to snicker when laurence harvey's christopher isherwood, (it keeps the original author's real name; god knows what isherwood thought of it), describes himself as 'a confirmed bachelor' and while harvey is an utterly inadequate 'hero', (he's virtually asexual), and shelly winters woefully miscast as fraulien landauer, (the part marisa berenson played in "cabaret"), julie harris is a perfectly marvellous sally, (it's a lovely piece of comic acting), and anton diffring is first-rate as fritz, the german-jew in love with shelly's character. of course, if "cabaret" had never come along you might ask yourself would this ever have seen the light of day again. that it has been revived may not quite be cause for celebration but it's perfectly acceptable all the same.

george carlin is probably my favorite comedian. i have seen so many of his specials and even had the opportunity to see him perform live. he had a certain cynicism that always appealed to me. his last 2 specials (life is worth losing especially and complaints and grievances) have lacked a certain spirit and content. george appeared overweight, old and tired (not to mention coming out of rehab). "i said not to mention it"! anyway. life is worth losing was especially tragic as he was overweight, disgruntled, coming off of rehab (there we go again...) and extremely unfunny. if there was a way to feel sorry for a comedian without heckling him off stage, george achieved it with life is worth losing. it is as if the new millennium and post 9/11 america was trampling george's spirit. the bs had become too large to manage.the comeback is partially successful with it's bad for ya! this special is the transmutation completed. george is no longer trying to rekindle his glory days. he is in full acceptance of his age, being old and dealing with the looming prospects of death. he has accepted being a crusty old sob and is relishing in it. this is better than his previous specials, yet far from jammin' in new york. it is a little tragic. his observations are not cutting edge anymore and seem more andy rooney than lenny bruce. george isn't george anymore. he is no longer criticizing us but is the man in the high castle pointing out how things were and how dissimilar modern life is. this is an improvement over the previous two specials, but george does not, as of yet, recoup his old glory (if ever). he has been reduced from critical social and political stinging commentary to mostly personal peeves. when he goes political, he still has something to say. it is heavily derived (especially if you have seen any of his previous work), but it still works somehow, as opposed to his random rantings which lack a certain relevance outside of the baby boom generation. the last 25 minutes is the best this special has to offer.for now i will worship the sun and pray to joe pesci that george can recreate himself as a cutting edge septuagenarian. it's a 50/50 chance. life seems to have become more tedious for george and his "art" is now his life. this is a step in the right direction from his previous 2 specials, but is far from his old self. where does he go from here? he may never recoup but maybe he can further metamorphosing/refine this new ornery old man routine. heres to hoping for 7 more words you can't say on tv or at least a windmill he can handle.

for those of you who like stand-up comedians you must have heard about george carlin. he is really one of the best comedians alive so you must know him.but he died already, god rest him in peace. or hell. he didn't believe too much in religion so he might as well chose hell to live eternity. haha, just joking, don't take it serious!it's bad for ya!, it's one of the latest works of george carlin, before his death--believe me, one of his best works, a must for any fan and an almost best-of of all george carlin's jokes. it's not a best-of... but it's really amusing.it has less political and religious jokes. it's only to have a great time!editing is very good. it's not a concert, so, it shouldn't have quick changing of shots... the slow fading to other shot was well done. fading is the best option in terms of editing!

my brother got me hooked on carlin back in the 70s. i always loved his observational humor. that is, looking at every day things and finding the humor in it, like asking the question,"have you ever tried to throw away an old waste basket? you can't do it! they keep bringing back to you!" and asking questions like why is the word kill more acceptable then the "f" word, while making prefect sense with the discussion.however, during the 90s his stuff was less funny, and more angry. what he seemed to be doing was holding a mirror to society's face and say 'take a look!' at this point, his shows were less of a comedy show, and more of a gripe session. but in all fairness he always made a tremendous amount of sense. he really made you think.here was carlin old and new. he starts out about the fun one could have by getting old, and later slamming the the state of the world. again making perfect sense.this was his best since "jammin' in new york", and as it turns out his last.i think what 'the shootist' was to john wayne, or 'a prairie home companion' to robert altman, 'it's bad for ya' is to george carlin. a fond farewell to a true great icon. love him, or hate him, i think he will be remembered.

this is unfortunately carlin's last recorded hbo concert, from a series that lasted over 30 years. though this may not be his "best" work, it is excellent, funny, and thought provoking. this recording is also a bit different from most of his other concerts that it is a bit lengthier than most of his other concerts.throughout his long, prolific, and influential career, carlin has moved from the more observational humor and fart jokes, towards a more 'humanitarian' viewpoint of society and culture. his focus on the english language and euphemisms increased throughout the years, and culminates in this performance. though, i would argue that his audio book "when will jesus bring the pork chops?" best displays his vast wit with regards to language, euphemisms, and the breakdown of our values. it's bad for ya is quite indicative of his long transformation from a comedian to a writer.if you are offended by foul language or the disparagement of the church, you will probably not like any of carlin's stand up material. however, if you enjoy being mentally stimulated and can tolerate the language and blasphemy, you would probably greatly enjoy this concert.

mr. carlin left our common forum in june of 2008, shortly after going to the hospital for pains in the chest (he had a history of heart trouble). the media, and comics everywhere covered the loss more than i or he would have ever expected ... but, he was the grandfather of observational comedy.this recording was his last production and contains a large section dedicated to the topic of death and the prospects of life thereafter. filming of the project occurred shortly after his seventieth birthday, which he was happy to have attained (observed?). i have followed carlin's career from the days of fuzzy black and white television, and enjoyed his topical record albums.it is a privilege for any carlin fan to at least see (if not own a copy) of this particular show. he was still fast moving, and with great timing, even at 70! as he would say,,, he is not "smiling down from heaven on you". if he's doing anything at all it's not taking harp lessons; perhaps he's looking up!!!

it's bad for ya really showcases more of george carlin's talents. he really is still as sharp as a tack. it is a shame that we lost him this past year, but his comedy will forever live on. this stand-up special is literally one of the funniest i have ever heard a comedian perform. even though he is making fun of small children, it just makes you laugh the way he says some of the stuff. it is true that carlin can literally make something that seems unfunny and turn it into one of the funniest things you have ever and will ever hear. i really enjoyed this stand-up particularly from carlin and recommend that those that liked this check out more of george carlin's stand-up.

it might be a stretch saying this as a die-hard carlin fan, but the material, both written and as performed, in it's bad for ya is some of the best late-era material yet. at 70 carlin bounces back from the level of despair (and some of the stumbles in the act itself) from life is worth losing to a special that is firmly structured but loose and playful- or as much as the "old f***" can get- and is continuously, ceaselessly, funny. and funny as in reminiscent of what some of us had going on when watching back in town or 'diseased' the first time. the material, even if sounding at times a tinge of the previously done (i.e. the whole bit on children in school and camp like the children segment in diseased), is always fresh and with such a sting of truth to everything that it scalds the mind while (here goes) tickling the funny bone.going from the topic of death (how long to wait to scratch off a name from the book? six weeks, unless if on the computer scheduler), the facets of communication, looking down from heaven, spots of god (naturally), kids, and just troublesome gestures involving hats in religion and if people really have "rights" make up the bulk of the special, centered around the premise that what's bad for you, plain and simple, is bs. total, complete bs, which as we also learn (or if you've really learned it you're like the kid waiting at the street corner for a week following dropped off not-quite randomly by the parent) holds the country together. carlin isn't necessarily angry though, even if disdain seems to spout out at most turns, even just to observe how horrifying children's teeth coming in look. it's skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything is not going to be "fine".what it comes down to is this: carlin is to dirty, witty, cautionary stand-up comedy what yoda is to jedis everywhere, which is a small spark of hope via crystal clear wisdom in a world where it's pretty damn hard to get any. at the least, we get classic gc - outrageous lines and bits from the man's 13th (or is it 14th) comedy special, including as far as an eyebrow-raising observation on people who play mozart music during a birth!

i can't say i enjoyed this as much as "the big lebowski" or "raising arizona," and felt a little slighted, but "o brother" is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens' brisk, twisted sense of creativity. the dvd edition contains the featurette, and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques. that surprised me! of course, this movie is not the best example (and i'm only saying this in comparison) and it wasn't worthy of any oscars (many feel it was robbed), but maybe it depends on the appeal. though i enjoyed the coens' previous work, i've never been a fan of old westerns or "the dukes of hazzard" or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn. i guess that's why i didn't feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie, seeing that it revolves around southern folk. for all those from the south who are reading this, i don't mean to offend any of your people! i'm sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like "a bronx tale." when you live in the city all your life, it's hard to get accustomed to films of this nature. but all apologies aside, i found the characters fun and quirky. i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly, and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing. tim blake nelson was also good. of course, george clooney--who i assume is not the best at feigning accents, judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for "the perfect storm"--naturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent. his performance was good, though. you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter (in a short but sweet role) and john goodman (also on screen for a short time, but steals every minute of it).though i don't normally dig country music, i liked the title song "a man of constant sorrow." the dvd also contains the music video for that song. overall, i found the film entertaining and original, but it doesn't have that in-your-face quality that the coens have shown to us in the past. it's a slighter effort, but a good one. i still suggest you check it out. my score: 7 (out of 10)

this movie was sooooooo good! it was hilarious! there are so many jokes that you can just watch the movie over and over and not get tired of it. john turturro and tim blake nelson were awesome as pete hogwallop and delmar! i love those guys! i love the adventures they went on, too. i definitely recommend this movie.also, the music in this movie is terrific! i love singing along with all of the songs!

it takes a rare movie to get better each time you see it. o brother does that and then some. the first time i saw it, i have to admit i had never seen anything like it. then i wanted to see it again, and now i'm up to double digits with this great movie, the coen brothers' finest movie they've ever done, with fargo and hudsucker proxy coming in a tight second and third for me.george clooney gives the performance of his career playing ulysses everett mcgee, a fast-talking know-it-all escaped convict who really doesn't know that much at all. tim blake nelson and john turturro are the perfect sidekicks for clooney, particularly nelson and his portrayal of delmar, a loyal albeit uneducated fellow escapee. john goodman is my favorite bit character as big dan, perfect. it reminds me of his part in raising arizona, he's just a perfect actor for this role. coen brothers' favorites holly hunter and charles durning also provide memorable performances. joel and ethan coen are masters of their trade. it's not like they try to win academy awards every time they make a film, they just try and tell a story that they want to tell, and it's entertaining. it's a loose adaptation of the odyssey, and i mean loose for all of you homer fanatics. it's just great.the most amazing part of this movie though is the coloring. i've watched how they got the dusty feel to the movie and i am still in awe just thinking about it. the coloring does become an important part of the movie. great great movie.

it started off weird, the middle was weird, and the ending was weird, but i really, really liked it. a modern day version of homer's odyessy but that is really irrelevant. interesting story and casting. clooney was great and i applaud him for taking on such an adverterous role - so unlike anything he has done or ever will do again. lots of surprise stars - why isn't holly hunter in more. do something different tonight and watch this really different and unexpected flick.

after seeing the 'oh so acclaimed' fargo and thinking it was nothing more than average, i was wandering if it would be a good idea to rent another coen 'masterpiece'. this time i was much less disappointed than i was with fargo and i must say that most of the credit for that goes to the good jokes and the good acting of george clooney. well done mr. clooney, make more of these and less 'perfect stormish' movies. you can act and you showed it here.7 out of 10

this has got to be the best movie i've seen. you definately have to watch it more than once to find all of the humor and twists. i'm no fan of george clooney, but he shines here. the real performance comes from tim blake nelson and john turturro as pete and delmar. one of the few movies that i own.

'o brother, where art thou' is a gleeful retelling of homer's 'odyssey', set in 1930s mississippi and rampant with splendid quirkiness that is the trademark of the brothers coen. three hapless convicts make their escape to find treasure--and more than their share of adventure--in this delightful film. george clooney is in fine, ingenuous form as the chatty, amiable leader of the trio; but the real acting kudos go to john turturro and tim blake nelson as his goofy but lovable cohorts, dubbed the 'soggy bottom boys' by clooney's character after they receive baptism by full immersion in a river. the three cut a record under that homespun nom-de-plume for the cash, and unwittingly become overnight sensations with veritable 'rock star' status. the film is accompanied by enough music and songs to almost qualify it as a musical. and there are some incredible feats of film-making here: the scene at the kkk rally is a real doozy, and is so similar to the scene when dorothy's friends rescue her from the witch's castle in 'the wizard of oz' that it almost amounts to cinematic plagiarism. and what an amazing work of plagiarism it is! without giving away the ending, i must say the climax of the movie is one of the most breathtaking sequences put to film in recent memory (on a par with the spectacular finale of 'magnolia', another one of my favorites). 'o brother' is a must-see, a perfect 10!

the coen's strike again. i had no presuppositions going in and i was amazed at the bizarre telling of a good-bad guy story. although clooney is easily replaceable in this, his cornball style is welcome. turturro and nelson are dead ringers. and i loved "i am a man of constant sorrow" as performed by the "soggy bottom boys". catchy tune...8 of 10

i've seen just about all of the coen brothers' films now, and i have to say this is one of their better films. i wouldn't dare say it's better than "the big lebowski", but it was very good in it's own right.i thought the story was very interesting and hilarious at times. i loved all the characters, especially tim blake nelson (delmar) and john turturro's (pete).there really isn't anything bad i can say about this movie, but this movie isn't for everyone. it might be safe to say that if you liked the other coen brothers' films, then you'll hopefully like this one too. and if you liked what you saw in the trailer, i think you'll like the film, but don't hold me to it.anyhow, i hope that you like(d) the film as much as i do. thanks for reading,-chris

great movie, great actors, great soundtrack! i loved it! settings are perfect, dialogues, situations, storyline... all together mixed to give this masterpiece! clooney and turturro are magnificent and the soggy bottom boys are simply charming and contagious with their music! :)

this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous. one of the actors is george clooney and i'm not a fan but this roll is not bad. another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack (the man of constant sorrow). i recommand this movie to everybody. greetings bart

they loved him up and turned him into a horny toad! god, that gets to me every time.this is a great movie. memorable lines, from "thank god your momma died given birth; she'da seen ya she'da died of shame" to "i don't understand, big dan." great scenes, from the opening train scene (laughed so hard i cried) to the bluegrass.watch it. it's good, it's great, it's funny, and it's based on a famous story. worth your while, believe me. don't watch this if you have a weak bladder, for you will definitely wet your pants laughing.

loved today's show!!! it was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. she is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too. i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things, but she did it and by golly i'll be writing those recipes down. saving time in the kitchen means more time with family. those who haven't tuned in yet, find out what channel and the time, i assure you that you won't be disappointed.

ok, so i loved rachael ray before, but now, i adore her! how innovative. i love that she has a cooking section- i admit that occasionally i skip that part, only because it makes me waaay too hungry! but i also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website. i love that she has regular helpers and that she's made some of her viewers become her regulars. i love how personable she is and how creative she is. i also like how she does her mystery guests. she just seems so much more genuine than so many other talk show hosts. she still gets a little starstruck occasionally and i love that. i love that she talks about her personal life on there and reminds people how happy she is. she's even mentioned tabloids before and it's so funny! she also has the funniest stories! anyway, i'm a fan for life. even my 2 year old knows who rachael ray is and he loves her too!

rachael ray appeals to viewers of all ages and backgrounds, beginner cooks or "seasoned" veterans. you'll be dazzled with a variegated presentation of delectable yet time-efficient dishes, jazzed up with her unique brand of spunk and candor. most importantly, this hip chic keeps her audience drawn in by stimulating all five senses. let me explain. her program provides enlightenment to your visual sense, auditory sense, and sense of feeling through a rich, luminous ambient backdrop, light-hearted, casual, yet engaging topics, eye-pleasing, appetite wrenching meals, and her hearty smile and laugh, which will simmer down anyone's nerves.(sense of smell and taste are rewarded when you test out the recipes in your own kitchen and among your own family and friends). check out her show guys.

i've been a fan of rachael's since the beginning of 30mm on the food network, so i have seen her grow over the years. the minute i saw her interact with oprah, i predicted that this show would happen, because i saw how taken oprah is with her, and with good reason: she comes across as very natural, and willing to laugh at herself, which is very engaging. the set is appealing, and there are some fresh ideas (i love the lazy susan that the audience sits on). there's just enough of a celebrity segment, and she stays away from controversy and debate (there's enough of that on daytime tv). the show is a lighthearted escape, and she hasn't moved away from her strength (cooking), which is very good planning. i know there are people who hate her and hate her show; that's ok, you can't please everybody. and somehow, i think rachael knows and accepts that. so just turn the channel; i don't think she'd mind.

then again, i like rachael ray. she is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch. i have to alter just about everything she makes as i am a vegetarian...but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. after all, she is a television personality. i think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down-to-earth. the studio audience appears to be rather small, but that just makes for a cozier environment. some people have posted that the show sucks. i guess it depends on your own interpretation of it and of her. if you notice the early episodes of 30 minute meals you will see a completely different personality than in those of the past few years. i'm sure she will find her comfort zone with this show as well. good luck rachael!

i just returned from viewing this academy award-nominated doc, and i was thoroughly touched and interested in exploring the works of this fellow i'd never heard of before. of course i'm someone who's captivated with beautiful architecture, so i realize others won't care.we can only imagine if there had been a couple more visionaries in philadelphia back in the late 60's when kahn's plans were a possibility, what a wonderful city center there would be. if you wonder whether you'll see more about the bangladesh building at the beginning of the movie, be patient, for there it will provide the climax of the film at the end. his son's personal discoveries in the process of making this film are quite interesting, sometimes touching, and even funny at times. there is one of the most comical anti-visionary rants ever captured on camera.rounding out the good points of this doc is a touching musical score with some excellent expressive string music. and expressiveness is a major point to be found in kahn's architecture. the points made by other architects about the spiritual nature of matter, and how kahn's buildings brought that out tie together the overall experience of this movie.

video vault by shawn k. inlowmy architect: a son's journey 2003 - nathaniel kahn not rated: 116minutes vault rating: 7what a thing to be fatherless. "my architect: a son's journey" follows philadelphia filmmaker, nathaniel kahn, as he desperately seeks answers from his father, the renowned architect, louis i. kahn, dead these 30 years.louis kahn died in a train station in 1974 and left behind more than one family. the funeral service, when the filmmaker was just a boy, was, shall we say, an unpleasant surprise.we find that nathaniel only knew his father en passant, from his sporadic visits with his mother, whom, we are told, he loved deeply. this movie is about a boy seeking his father and perhaps himself by visiting his work, as if the magnificent structures hold some secret. to be sure, louis kahn was a gifted architect, but "architect" is a cold word. the man was a sculptor on a grand scale who spoke of his craft in airy terms of silence and art.among his notable works, explored lovingly in the film, are the salk institute (1965), the kimball art museum (1972) and the monumental capitol complex in bangladesh (1983). the portion of the film where nathaniel first visits dhaka, bangladesh, finds the work, but not the man.the film benefits greatly from having much footage of the very public man as he worked in new york city and as a professor at yale and the university of pennsylvania. many of khan's contemporaries and collaborators also help flesh out the filmmaker's ghost- father.even so, the viewer seems not to come to a particularly satisfying place. the answers nathaniel khan is looking for seem hollow. not good enough.in scenes where the director meets with his half sisters, both from different mothers, one can feel the tensions of the years, the slights and hurts. one might expect them to burst into anger, but only the camera saves them from hostilities. each of these children has visibly lost something.it might be pointed out that khan, who seemed a driven perfectionist, never became rich. instead, he became noteworthy. it was as if he sacrificed his family for his art. this is a crushingly sad and great thing.april 28, 2005

an absoloutely wonderful film that works on several levels. it's a story about a great architect, a son seeking his father, about very loving relationships, and about loss. it's also a great flm about architecture.very intelligent and very moving. a real treat.

i think the title of the movie describes it well. if you are looking for a documentary on louis kahn and his work, you'll have to look somewhere else. although some of that is covered in this film.of course, i eat up pretty much anything i'm fed, and i don't know much of the family history revolving around this case. so i believed what i was told about nathaniel and his father, etc.for what this movie was, i thought it was pretty good. a little slow and grabbing for attention at time, i wish that nathaniel would have focused a little more on his father's work than his family drama (although much of the history was interesting, louis was a bit of a player).this really is a journey through someone's life, and i was happy to tag along for the experience. a learning experience for me, and so it seems, for the filmmaker as well. oh, and the footage of some of kahn's work is *stunning*

i rented this film because it was a documentary and highly rated. it's more a study of a bastard son trying to find out who his biological father was, than anything about architecture.more than anything else, the underlying theme of the movie is that we have an eccentric, highly praised, possibly genius architect who had little regard for anything or anyone outside is profession.the tragedy of the film is the broken families he left. his baby-mothers came across more as scorned fans than irresponsible women, which can only have negative results on the children.that said, nathaniel, the producer of the film and son of louis khan, came across as fairly stable and curious, if not bitter. the people he interviewed were of course more interested in talking about louis khan's buildings than his personal problems, but i find the mix of themes made the film interesting.as for his buildings, i found them like abstract art - strange, non-practical, and usually only appreciated by so-called critics.

louis khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. his son's desire to find out who, and more importantly what he was is moving, and emotional.this film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about, what good design is, and the emotional price that is paid for it. equally haunting is the sound track. if you see the film, and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening. as a practicing architect of over 30 years, my heart ached and rejoiced over the film and its very straight forward, albeit emotional honesty and sincerity.i had the honor of seeing this film previewed in chicago at the national convention of the american institute of architects. the film was introduced by daniel, and he was kind enough to do a question and answer session afterward. during the entire presentation of the film, not a sound, not a cough, not one distraction took place. the entire audience sat mesmerized, and the real treat, was daniel's mother was present during the showing of the film.i will always remember the film, and play it over constantly in my mind every time i listen to the soundtrack...

i never heard of architect, louis kahn, until this documentary. in this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, nathaniel kahn, explores his father's life from estonia to the slums of north philadelphia to the university of pennsylvania in west philadelphia where he studied and taught. he travels to bangladesh, israel, connecticut, trenton, and la jolla, california as well as new york city to explore his father's creative genius. personally, louis kahn had three families including his wife, esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter sue ann. nathaniel includes his family members. louis also has another half-sister alexandra tynge from his father's previous relationship with anne tyne, a fellow architect. louis' passion was his art.

running out of time is probably as close to a perfect film as you're ever likely to see out of hong kong. all the elements click: a terrific script (by french writers julien carbon and laurent courtiaud) that even manages to subvert the odd cliché, reliably imaginative direction by johnnie to, and excellent central performances by andy lau and lau ching wan, the latter displaying his great comic timing to wonderful effect without ever crossing the line into parody (especially in his exasperated reactions to his superior's abysmal negotiating skills). the supporting cast is fine too, with yo yo mung making a strong impression in a tiny role, and even the often histrionic waise lee (looking remarkably, and very aptly, like a bald andy lau) reining it in to good effect. it's best not to know too much about the plot going in beyond the basic set-up  with only a few weeks to live, lau engages in a criminal game with wan's cop with no easily apparent motive  and just sit back and enjoy the ride: it's certainly worth the fare. it also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent movies, and played in a mere three scenes (the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of film-making i've seen in ages). there's also a fine score by raymond wong as well. the most fun playing cat and mouse at the movies in years.

the one thing that can be said about running out of time is that it's an immensely clever film. it's interesting to note that the film's writers are french, which may explain the movie's "out of the norm" vibe, as it doesn't really fit in with what is commonly called "hong kong cinema".the movie concerns a thief who plans revenge on some criminal types using the assistance of an equally clever cop. but first he has to convince the cop to join his personal crusade, and so begins a series of games where the thief manuevers the cop into his plan.quite a clever movie.7 out of 10(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie or full-length reviews of other foreign films)

terrific, deeply moving crime thriller starring andy lau and lau ching wan.from the dizzying opening sequence to the extremely satisfying conclusion, this cat and mouser hardly misses a beat.johnny to, again working with ace composer arthur wong, constructs another operatic actioner that grots in the face of its contemporaries.to's images are strong and moving. his cutting, combined with the extraordinary music cues, is exemplary. you are in the hands of a master cinematician.the two sequences in which andy lau "hides" from the cops on a bus by pretending to accompany a lithe beauty (ruby wong) are testament to to's unique directorial skills.lau ching wan is strong and commanding as the harassed cop while andy lau is dynamic as a dying man avenging his father's death.this is superb movie-making, only mildly compromised by some bad english dubbing in one scene with criminal waise lee.

andy lau and lau ching-wan are both superb in johnny to's tautly directed crime thriller which puts most western efforts to shame. think of it as the hong kong 'heat', only better! everything about the film screams class; from the performances to the soundtrack, the cinematography to the script. the tone remains serious throughout, but the film has a nice line in black-humour, friendship and romance at it's heart. sure, it gets a little preposterous later on, but it would be a hard-hearted viewer who didn't find something to love about this movie. thank god, hollywood hasn't (yet) re-made and ruined a classic. do yourself a favour and see this film!

having seen 'only' about 200 hong kong films in my time, i have to say this film is among my very top favorites. not only is the plot engaging (and in some ways surprising, which these days is rare for any movie), but the chemistry between the two lead actors is superb. top notch casting! and while often even the most serious hk films tend to insert quite a bit of humor in between all the drama and action, often spoiling the mood a bit, here the jokes are kept subtle and woven into the plot, even improving character relations. the music is also very well done, and the two main themes are very beautiful. with the release of the hk special edition, they've even cleaned the picture (first release was grainy) and the subtitles, even if the quality of the translation is still lacking (nothing new there). all in all, if you have to see a hk film that isn't directed by john woo or have chow yun fat in it, this should be at least on your short list! a truly fascinating and entertaining watch!

running out of time rests somewhere in the middle of johnny to's cannon, in the "solid good" category. as a crime thriller it's not terribly original or overwhelming and the action scenes will not blow you away but it has something else going for it. it's a johnny to film after all, it has to.andy lau has 72 hours to live. he decides to play a strange cat-and-mouse game with a hostage negotiator of the hk police, played by lau ching wan. that's the plot in a nutshell. on top of that to piles layers of twists and turns that keep proceedings interesting throughout. it occasionally becomes too convoluted for its own sake but never lets it get the best of it. however, just as johnny to is about to hand over a slick and well-made crime flick (which, let's face it, are dime-a-dozen), he slips in bits and pieces that bring running out of time alive as a full emotional experience, providing the soul and heart to the well-oiled skeleton.the concepts of synchronism and minimalism (staples in his work) are explored in great effect here. always subtle, letting the images speak for themselves, giving them time to develop with long takes and slow tracking shots, exemplary cutting to the score, it's all here. a small love story in a bus between andy lau and a girl is among the highlights of the film and part of the "heart" i'm talking about. so simple yet so powerful. ditto for lau's and lau ching wan's car scenes and the bowling-room showdown.however something stops me from claiming running out of time is a masterpiece. to has all the ability and craftmanship down to a notch but he can also be too workmanlike or bland at times. when he's good, he's real good. there are even isolated moment of pure brilliance that are just too good for their own sake, leaving a bittersweet aftertaste for the rest of the movie. i'm convinced that if he puts his heart to it, he can make a really great film. as it is, this is another one of his films that is flawed but enjoyable. underneath the slick hk style, it's the black humour and heartfelt drama that makes this a compelling film. worth watching, definitely.

i just purchased an zhan (running out of time) on dvd and it was an excellent film i must say. not really action-packed, in terms of gun play, but definitely exciting and witty. i do not think i have seen andy lau in better form. and the editing on this film was very well executed. go watch this now if you are a fan of lau or hk thiller/action film!

this film is a refreshing change of pace from the mindless hong kong triad movies i have grown so tired of. there are no spectacular gun fights. no car chases. and practically minimal action to speak of. the audience is kept in suspense for the most part, though certain aspects of the so called "ploy" by andy lau are quite obvious.the film has been hailed as a departure from the genre of violent triad films, and as an "intelligent" crime film. to an extent, it is. but, to some extent, it still fails the "believability" test. one can hardly picture any triad member to be dumb enough to not see through the female disguise of andy lau in a second. it also seemed to have fallen for the "if someone was seriously ill, the said someone will be coughing up copious amounts of blood regularly" thing chinese films seem to go for all the time.the subtle relationship between the two lead characters is a refreshing change.all in all an enjoyable film, even though the concept is not new and there are few surprises. >

i've recently seen an zhan. not because it was a hong kong film, but because i was looking for a change from the films being produced here in the us. in my humble opinion, i believe the film could easily compete against the action thrillers being produced here, except for the traditional idiocyncracies of hong kong film. the one that still bothers me was the chief inspector character. i still don't understand why there has to be a complete-idiot-comic-relief-type character even in the serious films that come out of hong kong, but i can live with it when the movie is this good. the characters are believable even if the situations they are in are not. the story is fast paced and really sucks you in to it. the real cincher scenes for me were the two bus rides that the thief character takes. overall, a really solid film.

if you're familiar with the work of auteur johnny to and his band of filmmaking cronies over at milky way, you know what to expect with this latest production. all the familiar elements are in place: the strong camaraderie between two characters: usually a cop and a baddie, the coincidences and chances that turn on a dime and pay off handsomely in the end, and the humor that arises even in the most dire of situations.andy lau plays a man who has 72 hours to live and decides to rob an insurance company. lau ching-wan (also brilliant in other milky way films like "longest nite," "a hero never dies," and "where a good man goes") portrays a hostage negotiator/cop who is on the robber's tail, even as the robber sets up a series of tricks and clues that he must follow in order to get his man.funny, poignant, and cool while being subtle, "running" is actually one of the most entertaining milky way films to date. don't miss the performances by the two leads, esp. andy lau, usually considered an average actor who has rarely been this natural and fun to watch. this film is one to go out of your way to see.

not high art, not even exceptionally innovative, but a thoroughly enjoyable movie. funny, fresh, intelligent - there are still people out there who don't need millions of dollars to hide that they're out of ideas.when you compare this to your average hollywood action flick, you're comparing a homemade meal with a big mac.

the late director john frankenheimer directed his first feature film, the young stranger, after starting out directing live television dramas in new york city. this film came on the heels of the success of rebel without a cause in 1955. james macarthur made his feature film debut as a troubled teen with a movie producer father, played by james daly, who doesn't establish enough of a relationship with his son. kim hunter plays the mother, who tries to bridge the gap between her husband and her son. the film uses the popular juvenile delinquent angle of the time to tell its story. macarthur gets in trouble at a movie theater with an overzealous theater manager played by whit bissell. macarthur, in turn, has to deal with a police sergeant, james gregory, bent on teaching him a lesson. the material could easily have turned exploitative, laughable, and sensational, like any number of others of the period did. however, under the sure-handed direction of frankenheimer, the film is a sensitive portrayal of teenage and parental dynamics. the dialog is realistic and most of the scenes hold up surprisingly well. some of the scenes with bissell, as the theater manager, and gregory, as the police sergeant, are a bit heavy-handed and dated. the performances are uniformly good though, which is necessary for a film of this nature and about this topic to succeed. this is an impressive feature film debut both for macarthur and frankenheimer. *** of 4 stars.

***spoilers*** well made and interesting film about the alienated youth of america back in the 1950's. back in those days many parents caught up with making big bucks and living high on the hog forget that their children, especially teen-agers, needed a lot more then a car and and hefty allowance in order to feel part of the family. they also needed love and attention, to their growing up problems, which is what 16 year-old hal ditmar, james macarthur never got from his successful movie producer dad mr.tom ditmar, james daly.never really connecting with his dad hal grows more and more distant from both him and his caring mom helen ditmar, kim hunter, as well as from society. after his dad put hal down about him wanting to borrow his car, a late model luxury sedan, he and his friend jerry, jeffery silver, drive in hal's beat up and barley operational 1930's jalopy to the local treater to catch the latest western flick.feeling like striking out at the world hal acts like a real first-class jerk sticking his smelly feet almost into the faces of a couple, eddie ryder & jean corbett, sitting in front of him and jerry trying to watch the movie. this leads hal, as well as his friend jerry, to not only be kicked out of the theater but with him belting the theater manager mr. grebbs, whit bissell. it turned out that at least hal was willing to leave the theater, without even getting his money back, but when grebbs tries to grab him hal wheeled around and belted him right in the kisser.hal now in real hot water, he's charged with assault and battery, put's on his "james dean" act, at the local police station, making like he's either too cool or just plain stupid to realize what he's done; almost knocked mr. grebbs teeth out. it's when sgt.shipley, james gergory, tells hal that his dad is coming to pick him up when he finally sobers up to the fact of what he's done.the rest of the film has hal try to straighten himself out but is unable to do that because the low esteem that his dad has of him. begging his father to understand that what he did, in belting mr. grebbs, was in self-defense hal's father acts as if he's been there, at the theater, and saw the whole incident with his son hal acting like a street thug instead of of a young man being grabbed and pushed without provocation.not excusing what hal did, in laying out mr. grebbs, he in fact was willing to admit his hooligan behavior but he wanted both mr. grebbs and his dad to at least treat him with an iota of consideration; gebbs in the fact that he provoked hal and mr. ditmas in not even bothering to hear him out! feeling like a wanted criminal without anyone, but his mom, to really turn too hal slowly loses it only to later have both sgt. shipley and mr. grabbs agree to drop the assault charge. you would think that by now hal's has finally learned his lesson but the real lesson, more then a stretch behind bars, that hal's so desperately needed was a lesson that his father totally ignored! being there when his son needed him most and in that mr. ditmar failed with flying colors.things do in fact straighten out for everyone in the movie only after mr. grebbs gets belted, ending up with a butte of a shiner, again by hal who, going back to grebbs theater, tries to get him to phone his dad and tell him that hal was only defending himself when he first, not the second time around, clobbered him. in the end hal learned a real lesson in getting along with people an not letting his problems become other peoples problems. but most of all hal's father mr. ditmar learned the most valuable lesson of all in how to understand his frustrated and alienated son and act like a father toward him instead of a combination jail-keeper and a sugar daddy. like the song says "all you need s love" to get things on the right track and it was both love and understanding for his son hal that mr. ditmar, until the very end of the movie, lacked the most off.

this eloquent, simple film makes a remarkably clear statement about a teenager and his father. though a theatrical release, it has a "made-for-tv" quality. we can attribute this to the director, john frankenheimer, who learned his craft in the early days of live television in new york city. indeed, he directed the teleplay on which the film is based, "deal a blow," on the cbs drama series "climax." "young stranger" represents his hollywood debut. after a hiatus of four years, during which he would do more television, he returned to direct "the young savages" with burt lancaster and, a year after that, "all fall down" with warren beatty and angela lansbury.the casting is competent with james daly and kim hunter (particularly good) playing the parents of the title character performed by james macarthur (his first theatrical film) who played the same role in the television version which was his first appearance on the small screen. look for james gregory and whit bissell in supporting roles.

the world is going to miss john frankenheimer. this was his first feature film and it was four years before he directed his second, but don't let that dissuade you from seeking it out. frankenheimer's direction is assured, and he gets some compelling performances out of his cast.someone else has already pointed them out, but i also want to talk up james gregory and whit bissell in two key supporting roles. both would work for frankenheimer again -- gregory most notably as the bumbling senator in "the manchurian candidate" -- and they do good work for him here.if the whole thing seems too simple in the end, that's merely because frankenheimer and writer robert dozier chose to tell a simple story, and they do it well. keep a lookout for it -- turner classic movies just might show it again.

riding high on the success of "rebel without a cause", came a tidal wave of 'teen' movies. arguably this is one of the best. a very young mcarthur excels here as the not really too troubled teen. the story concentrates more on perceptions of delinquency, than any traumatic occurrence. the supporting cast is memorable, frankenheimer directs like an old pro. just a story of a young man that finds others take his actions much too seriously.

what often threatens to turn into a soppy and soft-headed drama about misunderstood middle-class youth ends up a surprisingly shaded and subdued movie by john frankenheimer (his first, though he had started in television, directing among other things an earlier version of this script).we are still in those semi-mythic 50s when teenagers drove jalopies and jeans were still dungarees. james macarthur (adoptive son of playwright charles and actress helen hayes, and later to enter pop culture as hawaii 5-0's danno) gets involved in a minor incident in a movie theater which escalates to his throwing a punch at the manager (whit bissell) and being booked down at the police station. his dad (james daly), a big-shot movie producer gets the call, doesn't listen to his son's version of the story, and pulls strings to get him off.but macarthur keeps carrying a chip on his shoulder, which even his sympathetic mom (kim hunter) can't knock off. things worsen in the coldwater canyon homestead until macarthur, trying to vindicate himself, stages a reprise of the original incident....the movie doesn't quite avoid the attitudes  and cliches  of its time, but presents them with considerable nuance: every character gets an honorable hearing; every point of view has its merits (and reactions to the movie will depend on what viewers bring to it). there are flaws (the word `crummy,' a standard rebellious euphemism of the era, is used about 30 times too often) but they're outweighed by strengths. the movie benefits from a strong cast (most notable among them the excellent character actor james gregory, as a police detective) and a resolutely non-exploitative way of telling its story. from a vantage point in the new millennium, the hot water macarthur finds himself in may seem a little tepid, but the young stranger remains honest and honorable.

this film is really, really full of sex. hot sex. i watched it (of course) on cinemax; and i liked it of course; those virtual fantasies are played out so much in great style, and i kind of enjoyed the story line. but one must know that when a soft porn film director sets out to make another soft porn film; all he/she wants to do is film good sex scenes. and i got nice sex scenes, full of skin. yet another reason some people call soft porn cinemax films "skinemax."

seldom is seen a film sequel that surpasses or even equalls the greatness of it's original predecessor. such a film is virtual encounters 2.it's about a couple guys in college who sell virtual sex to the entire campus. if you like seeing naked chicks, this one delivers. six-foot tall chrissy styler is an amazing specimen and you will be dreaming about her for days if you ever have the good fortune to catch the unrated version. she wears just the right amount of body glitter in her multiple nude scenes and her giant cans appear to be real. ( = giddyup!!w/the exception of james cameron's "aliens," francis for coppola's "the godfather part ii" and - of course - the zuckers' "airplane 2," this is the only sequel in movie history that takes a classic film and improves upon it. it's criminal the way this film was ignored by the academy. nikki fritz and that broad who gets tied up in the beginning (as well as the brunette who gets a rubdown towards the end) all deserved best supporting actress nods. shame on you, hollywood!!!

this has no relationship to virtual encounters 1, so it's not really a sequel. the two videos just share the general concept of people having simulated sex through a virtual reality machine. so if you were really blown away by the story and dialog in vc 1 (yeah, right), and expecting a continuation in vc 2, just be warned. all the actors and actresses are new, but it has the same excellent director, sybil richards.but like vc 1, you get lots of beautiful women and a lot of great sex scenes that push the envelope of soft core just about as far as it can go.if you have vc 1 and you liked it, you'll like vc 2. if you don't have either, but like really good softcore sex, get both.

i honestly found wicked little things to be a very cool and fun horror film.my friend had given this to me, and i really saw it as nothing but a crappy low class gory horror film.then after i watched this i was wrong it was very cool and very good and while ill say it seemed a bit unnecessary at times, and while it may not be the best horror film ever its still good.i thought the acting was very good especially from the girl who plays the mother(she seemed very believable and to me very likable).and while it is a little cliché'e and over the top its good.overall i gotta say if the afterdark horror fest films are not your style then you should have no business watching this, but if you like horror films, or a wicked little time than check out wicked little things. 8.0 out of 10 stars

i saw part of this film on the sci-fi channel, but missed the ending. i bought the dvd to see the whole movie, and i'm glad i did.a young mother and her two daughters move into a house out in a backwoods area that they inherited from the husband, who died from an illness. it's very run down, but the three women make the best of it. the teen daughter (scout taylor-compton) is warned by a local boy about the zombies that come out at night. she ignores him, but since he has a cute friend, she joins his group. meanwhile, the younger daughter (chloe grace moretz) makes a friend in a zombie girl her age named mary. it turns out that mary and several other kids died in a mine in 1913 while working as child labor. now that they are zombies, they attack and kill anyone who's not a blood relative. this movie was directed by j.s. cardone, whose previous films include the slayer (1981) and shadowzone (1990), two movies i didn't like in the slightest bit. this is why i was surprised that i actually enjoyed this movie. the film is deliberately paced, which i liked. this allows you to get to know the main characters, most of whom are likable. child zombies have been used at least since george romero's 1968 classic night of the living dead. still, i found the tool-using child zombies in this movie interesting. it would seem that cardone finally found the right script and cast. only the stereotypical scenes of the teens smoking, drinking and making out in a parked car were boring to me.taylor-compton also appears in the halloween remake. moretz appeared in the amityville horror (2005) and the horror film room 6 (2006).

from the acting to cardone's direction, this new twist on the familiar ghost's been-done-wrong theme, will keep you glued to your seat. slow at times because it builds this 'what's gonna happen' tension. medium-well on gore but what there is nicely nasty. spoiler: the death of the jockhole and subsequent feast is a highlight for gore hounds.the writers crafted an old story but added twists and re-imagined you typical haunting. cardone brings it to life . . . er . . uh death.lori heuring, scout taylor-compton and the ever fabulous ben cross are real, no signs of acting here. everyone in the cast is committed and truly isn't that what any director strives for. the actors believe, so we believe.along with the traditional ghost story surprises the film is loaded with tons of atmosphere, from the mine, hank's house and the tunny home, there's a creeping fear from the first frame to the last.horror fans, do yourself a favor and enjoy what amounts to be one of the true horror movies out there today.i end with a big kudo to boaz davidson (story) ben nedivi (screenplay)for without inventive writers hollywood would be nothing but an ugly reality tv party.

i have to say i was pleasantly surprised by this movie. other than the mother being a complete moron on a few occasions and the youngest daughter being idiotic enough to go out at night, into woods that scared her in the daytime, this movie was pretty good. had the director had the sense to treat us as if we had brains, maybe he'd have given us a movie where the people didn't have to behave idiotically, but still manage to get into danger. it worked for the plumber and the fellow in the trailer, but apparently the teenagers and the mother needed to be idiots, for the director to get closure in ending this film.atmosphere was great, scenery was awesome and the undead kids scared the crap out of me... i live in a wooded area, so taking out the trash will creep me out for quite a while. the movie works for me accept for what i already mentioned. raise the mom's iq a bit and i'd give it a ten...

may contain spoilers!!! in no way, shape or form does this movie break the horror movie mold. not by a long shot. however, it does deliver a creepy atmosphere, believable enough characters and gore.the story is simple and doesn't bother to unfurl itself anymore than it needs to. a bunch of kids are killed in a mining accident back in the early 1900's. since then, they have stalked and killed the residence of their sleepy little pa town in the mountains.simple: they want revenge on the man that caused their death years and years ago. naturally, his great, great, great grandson is in town and he's a real prick.along with that, a mother and her two daughters inherit a run old house after the husband dies. the eldest daughter is rebellious, obnoxious...a typical teen. the younger is curious, bright-eyed and gets in with the ghost children.the creepiest part of this flick is the sheer emotionlessness of the children and they hack their way through victim after victim. excellent acting. it was so spooky! i mean, the children of the corn flicks are one thing...but this topped any of those (as for the creepy kids).worht a look. i bought it before seeing it and i was not unhappy. but i'm a horror fan through and through.

this work is pretty atmospheric, with a couple of surprises a few really creepy elements. i found this work more rewarding than i first expected, given the rotten reviews this receives here at imdb. the dialog comes across as natural and honest (given the circumstances), although the overall run of the film goes from predictable to cliché with the heroines falling down when they should be running, and investigating strange noises when they should be locking their doors. typical horror movie fare.the local characters are some of the worst clichés, depicting appalachian natives as in-bred developmentally challenged freaks. the characters of the children and the principals are great! the development given is adequate, and scout taylor-compton seems to be developing her talents quite well.now, i'm not going to say that this is entirely original or the best thing since sliced bread (which isn't all that great by the way), but this is interesting and i do not long for my 107 minutes back. i would not say this is an awesome movie by any means, but there are some really good horror elements herein. but there are also some really slow spots where plot/character development seem superfluous to the director's (or the film editor's) whim.all in all, this is good for a rainy night, but not so good for a friday/saturday night's viewing.it rates a 7.6/10 from...the fiend :.

'wicked little things' really separates itself from other zombie movies.first off, all of the zombies in the movie don't exactly starting biting at you and tearing your flesh apart with their bare hands.they kill you with either a pickax or shovel and eat you after wards.second, they can't die.in most zombie movies, you can shoot a zombie in the head and kill them, but these simply won't die.third, which is the biggest reason why this movie separates itself, all of the zombies are children.how did they die exactly to become zombies? they were working in a coal mine when suddenly they were all killed in a collapse.now they wander the forest carrying their pickaxes and shovels, waiting for someone to come by so they can kill them and eat them.oh, they also come out at night.yep, only at night.that makes the movie even more fun then it would be if they came out in the morning.despite all of the violent and gory mayhem in this movie, 'wicked little things' is a great choice if you're looking for a movie about zombie children.don't expect anything great like 'dawn of the dead' or 'land of the dead', but do expect lots of gore and violence that makes this movie a real zombie fan pleaser.everyone give scout taylor-compton from rob zombie's 'halloween' a big hand for delivering a great performance like the one she did in 'halloween'.she really needs to start starring in more horror movies.

this is definitely the biggest surprise of the festival so far and without a doubt the best the festival has had to offer. i went into this film with little to no expectations after learning that the director was responsible for the awful vampire flick the forsaken. and i left pleasantly surprised. the film stars lori heuring of in crowd fame as a young mother whose husband has just passed. she moves into an old family home in the mountains with her two daughters next to a mine that is a gravesite to overworked children back in the day. unlucky for them the children return with a vengeance killing and eating everyone in their path. the film works on many levels. it's well done, suspenseful, it has spots of good cinematography and capable performances by compton especially. the atmosphere is spooky yet slightly underwhelming, the score is decent and the makeup effects are gruesome and simplistic. the film keeps up a creepy and unsettling tone and the kids themselves with pale skin, torn up lips and hollow eyes are pretty scary and unrelenting. the film is original and inventive without being to artsy or complicated. i can't see this film making it into a wide release without some trimming and slight fine tuning. but they definitely have a good product on there hands and should pursue some type of theatrical distribution. however the theatre in which i saw it in was horrible. the sound was dreadfully messed up which i felt took away from the film majorly and it stopped in the middle because they couldn't center it on the screen which killed the mood a bit. all in all though it was the most satisfying of horrorfests entries maybe because it had the least expectations but nonetheless was a welcome addition to genre films.

wicked little things was a really good movie.i will say at some parts it seemed really unbelievable, and others it seemed as if there just wasn't enough thought put into the actions of the characters, but overall it was exciting and entertaining.i don't understand why this movie's rating is so low.nor do i not understand why all the afterdark horrorfest film's ratings are so low.these are b-movies people, and nothing more.they provide great entertainment and most of them don't have many flaws at all.this is definitely worth a look, because you won't be disappointed with the outcome.wicked little things is one of the best 1st annual afterdark horrorfest films, and compared to a lot of other films in the series, this is one of the best overall.

having finally been able to get the dvd of this 1997 hbo film, is at down to watch it. by the time i finished it the old saying "those who can not learn from the past are doomed to relive it" was echoing in the mind. first shown four years after the first bombing of the twin towers (and four years before the events of 9/11) path to paradise reveals the series of close encounters, blunders and official in-decisions that led to the first bombing of the twin towers and the lessons we should have learned from them.path to paradise features a nice cast of believable actors. peter gallagher and marcia gay harden lead the cast as fbi agents john anticev and nancy floyd who face not only the threats of terrorism but the lack of official interest from their superiors along with their nypd counterpart lou napoli (paul guilfoyle). art malik, andreas katsulas, shaun toub and tony gillan are among those who plan and carry out the attack all of whom play their roles not as potential clichés but as real living people and make the film all the better for it. of special mention is ned eisenberg as emad salem the man whom, if it had not been for skeptical fbi officials, could have potentially informed on the plot.the film is also well produced. despite being made for cable this film doesn't feel like a low-budget film at all with its production values particularly in its sets and new york city locations. the film's fascinating cinematography gives the film an almost documentary style at times. when all of these elements are combined with the script it all helps to give the film a sense of reality which makes the events taking place all the more disturbing.the most disturbing thing about he film is its script. the events of the film are true (minus some dramatic license which is always necessary) and in hindsight are made even more shocking then they must have been when the film was first shown twelve years ago. the film reveals just how a group of men were able to smuggle a bomb into the world trade center. they did so thanks to the lack of arabic translators, government agencies failing to pass information to each other, the fbi ignoring leads from a source and police departments being unable to pick up on clues. worse then investigators inabilities to connect dots is the fact that many of these same things not only allowed the 9.11 attacks to take place but in some cases (such as the lack of translators) are issues that continue even today. even more chilling is the ending which really did happen and looks all too prophetic today.path to paradise is a film that should be essential viewing today. the film is not only well acted and produced but teaches us a lesson we should have learned sooner. the lesson of the film? that those who can not learn from the past are doomed to relive it. if you can find this film then watch it and learn from it.

this film is bone chilling in a way that is hard to describe. while it is fairly accurate in its description of the events leading up to and the subsequent investigation regarding the first attempt to destroy the world trade center in 1993, seen now post 9/11, it is almost unbearable.it would be a mistake to call this film prophetic, but it certainly makes the common playground wisdom of "fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me" come alive.our government learned nothing from the 1993 attempt on the world trade center and subsequent readings of the 9/11 report show that many of the mistakes that led to the bombing in 1993 were repeated.some people have criticized the first and fourth amendments of the us constitution as being partly responsible for the islamic terrorists being able to carry out their evil plans, but that is wrong headed in every possible way.surely the people making this argument are not supporting a ban on free speech, a free press or freedom of religion? i certainly hope they are not supporting our government officials being able to break into any person's home or office to search without cause or without a warrant.the fact is, the fbi, the ins and even the local police could have gotten warrants based on the information they had in their possession, but they chose not to for a variety of reasons. besides, no matter how distasteful or ignorant it is, it is not illegal to speak badly about america or its leaders. likewise, it is not illegal to either own guns or to pray toward mecca.consider this, until lee harvey oswald actually fired his rifle at president john kennedy, he wasn't really breaking any laws. living in a free society has its drawbacks.still, path to paradise is a must see film that i am afraid will never be seen by that many people. as far as i know, it is not on dvd and 2007 is its tenth anniversary and there are no known revivals of it.i'm not really surprised, people don't like to document their failures and this film certainly shows that the various agencies that were supposed to protect us did not do their jobs right and for the pettiest of reasons, like jurisdictional squabbles and a refusal to share information.this is a shame as path to paradise is well done and gripping and as many have stated before, the final scene where ramzi yousef (played by art malik), the bomber who built the truck bomb that was used in the first attempt at destroying the two towers is flying past the world trade center after his capture and extradition simply says "next time we will bring them both down", is a film moment that froze me in place for several minutes.

based on the true story of the fbis hunt for those who were responsible for the bombing of the world trade center building. a very good film that delves into the fbis use of informants and how, possibly, the tragedy could have been avoided 7 of 10

i watched the premiere of "path to paradise" way back and was stunned by it, dramatic license and all. i lived in nyc (brooklyn) a few years and kept in mind. today, given the links to groups such as al-queda, hamas, and the islamic jihad, i see it as a warning not recognized by our government. for that i place the blame on our bureaucracy and leaders. 9.11.01 was a new tactic to behead two of our branches of gov't and there is no excuse for our gov't to prevent it, period. "path to paradise" was but a dramatic view of the '93 preview, and no one cared. now, nearly 3,000 deaths later, and years behind, we struggle to find an answer that is decades to resolve.

i first saw this movie about 3 years ago. i was shocked at how stupid the fbi was not to prevent such a tragedy. it could have been easily prevented. this movie was just unbelievable.now seeing it after september 11th, i am appalled and can say that this could have been prevented more easily that most people would want to know.this film is 100% truein the final scene of the film, when the mastermind of the 1st attack is being taken to prison by helicopter and flies over the towers, he makes a spine chilling remark, that was laughed at when he said it. "next time we'll bring them *both* down." this was actually said by ramzi yousef after his arrest.this movie reveals the shocking truth about how the first attacks were carried out right under the noses of the fbi and nypd. it shows how the 1st and 4th amendments are partially to blame for the attacks.i watch this movie now and know that both attacks could have been prevented.

we'll never see this movie broadcast by hbo in the near future if at all. if anyone somehow comes across it in a video store just grab it before someone else does, because i doubt if it ever will be re-released again. an unbelievable and timely movie about the first attack on the world trade center on february 26, 1993 and how the government agencies who's job it is to identify and stop terrorists from doing harm and damage to american citizens and american property completely fell down on the job and unwittingly allowed it to happen.bone chilling since we all know now that the terrorists who were apprehended at the end of the movie weren't going to be the end of our nightmare that resurfaced on september 11, 2001. the film brought out everything that went wrong back in 1992-93 that allowed that first tragedy at the wtc to happen. still it took another eight years to realize that we should have learned from that first wtc attack to be more vigilant and ready to prevent the second and far more devastating assault on the world trade center to happen. i found this movie harder to watch after the events of 9/11 then the video of the attacks of 9/11 themselves. all i can say about this film is don't watch it alone. the very ending itself is so powerful as well as prophetic that it would leave you in a state of shock in knowing what we know today and possibly in need to have someone who's with you, but not watching the movie, to call for medical attention.

my family (two 40-somethings, an 8 year old and my 71 yr old mother) saw this at a sneak preview on april 29th. we all enjoyed the movie very much. the story was a good one, and knowing it was based on real-life events made it that much more enjoyable. luke wilson was a hoot (pun intended) to watch as was tim blake nelson. and seeing neil flynn play something other than "the mean janitor from scrubs" was nice. the kids in movie did well and i'm sure they will all appeal to a certain demographic on the heartthrob level. the visuals were just lovely and the jimmy buffet music added to the "florida feel". ok, maybe the story was a little too neat and well packaged for some adults, but hey, who cares? i can't compare it to the book, i honestly hadn't heard of it until the movie came out. it was just a nice movie and it had a good message. plain and simple.

this surrealistic, absurdist movie is the first film i have seen of cult swedish director roy andersson. he is a veteran filmmaker who has made his living filming commercials, directing only four feature films in the last forty years. this background shows: the film seems like a collection of fifty 2 minute arty commercials. there is no story interconnecting these vignettes, though some characters appear in more than one vignette (there is a theme throughout underneath them, though: the absurdity of modern life). some of the film's mannerisms (having the actors appear in light white makeup) are more irritating than illuminating. some of the skits amount to very little (a man unsure in which queue to stand?). other skits are better, though. the best is the one about the rock chick dreaming that she goes on honeymoon with her rock guitarist bride on a house that turns on something akin to a train (you have to watch it to get it). a film worth seeing, even if comparisons made by some film critics with such great filmmakers as keaton, tati and kaurismaki seems overwrought: andersson lacks the vision of them and the lack of a story interconnecting the vignettes is fatal to this film's pretension of being a masterpiece.

i saw this at the 2008 palm springs international film festival. there are some wonderful descriptions of this film from other commenter's here and they seemed to have really enjoyed it so i won't too far into giving a film synopsis but you could see a little of woody allen and maybe a little of federico fellini in this film's collection of some 50 short sketches or vignettes strung together with no real singular plot. a few of the vignettes are related to each other in their character and plot lines however and a a corner bar is used frequently as a central scene where they are always giving last call. the beginning and ending scenes have a common theme too that bookends the film. it took three years to film this and much of the time must have been spent on finding the plainest and homeliest looking people in all of sweden to make the cast. this is sweden's official submission for best foreign language film for the 2007 academy awards. it's a nice movie but hardly worthy of an official submission for best foreign film. last year sweden's official submission was the very weak farväl falkenberg and the year before it was expensive looking but dull zozo, so once again sweden will have no chance in picking up the oscar. this film has it's moments and would have made a good 20-25 minute short film but it gets a little old and cold for a full length feature film. roy andersson directs. gustav danielsson is the cinematographer. editor anna märta waern deserves a lot of credit for the work she must have put into this. benny andersson of abba fame provides an entertaining music score. it's an interesting film with a lot of dry humor and i did like it but it's nothing really special and could only give it a 7.0 out of 10.

roy andersson has managed to craft something that defies nearly all conventions of what a film should be, a piece of art that is both beautiful, funny and evocative at the same time. the end result is a moving, if somewhat fractured tale about humanity in its simplest and most honest forms.this is unlikely to appeal to everyone, in fact the humour is so finely tuned that many are unlikely to get on its wavelength. the almost absurdly long takes, awkward silences and consistent medium shots will most definitely put off even the most willing of audiences. but it is within these disjointed tales and unconventional thinking that andersson shapes a world where every character seems to take centre stage in their own absurd way. each scene is absorbed by the desolate environments, with the characters seemingly left alone in their own oddity its a difficult piece to watch at times, not least because like many of its scenes, it requires patience. but whilst some may hail it upon an artistic throne, others will simply look on in confusion. its a film that blends understated humour with own brand of heart

i enjoy the national anthem. i enjoy the national anthem if for nothing else then, just before the midnight news, i imagine i'm playing the cymbals in the band. not as easy as you may think! one, two, three, four; one, two three, four; but then what? so i have sympathy with the practising bass drum player in roy andersson's wonderful film, patiently waiting for his cue listening to a very 70s cassette player.the 70s motif seems to continue throughout, with some classic, soulless furniture. moreover, every scene has an eerie jade wash which emphasises the minute nuances of the subtlest of acting.which brings me to jessika lundberg's outstanding purple boots. boots which otherwise would have inspired a silk cult advertising campaign.but then the difficult bit. someone asked me what it was about. well there is a scene where the opening line as "i don't have that length in green" brilliant. straight out of a gary larson carton.i can't say what it's about. go see yourself.ron plasmahmm. larson! sounds swedish(viewed 15apr08)

this, which was shown dubbed in italian at a rome cinema (not as bad as it sounds) after being presented at the rome film festival, is very much an art film and a festival film, guaranteed to charm and delight such audiences for its distinctive style, droll humor; ability to draw comedy from the suffering of others; appealing, cheery music; spot-on performances; overriding sweetness and humanity--but doomed, because of its oddity and lack of a compelling story line, to leave average audiences wondering what they're watching it for and why anyone admires it, how it even got made.andersson gives us almost a series of dry skits. running through them are various themes. money: a guy at the next table (waldemar nowak) nicks the wallet of a rich bore talking on a cell phone in a restaurant over a glass of brandy, then goes and orders a set of posh suits made to order; a deadbeat son calls his celebrated father away from an elaborate gathering to beg him for one more loan. a shrink worries aloud about his depleted investments while his wife humps him in bed wearing only a shiny viking helmet.depression: an elementary teacher (jessica nilsson) breaks down in class because her husband has called her a "harpy;" the rug salesman spouse (pär fredriksson) collapses before clients because he's called her that. several men have depressing dreams. but hey--this is sweden. isn't everybody depressed? love problems: a fat bohemian couple is perpetually breaking up; a girl groupie has fantasies about a lead guitarist, micke (eric bäckman). wives slam doors when their husbands start to practice their instruments. (music too is obviously a unifying theme. besides the dashing guitarist there's a tuba and a drum player who're in a dixierland band and also play in marches and funerals. every scene has an added lilt from the music, which niftily links one sequence with another.) a raging storm outside the window of many scenes, violent rain, people out in it, thunder so loud it sounds like a battle raging across the land. this also unifies the tone and gives the impression various scenes are happening on the same dauntingly tempestuous day.andersson is a master of visual composition and the static middle-distance shot and the film has a foggy gray-green look engineered by dp gustav danielsson that's perfect because it evokes the gloom of a swedish winter but also twinkles with the subtle colors of the director's wit, which ends every scene with a smile. one almost never knew drabness could be so beautiful. (or perhaps one did: alexcanr sokurov creates such effects sometimes in very different contexts.) within scenes and in the film as a whole there's a kind of stillness that comes out of the visual style, the pacing of scenes, and the detached humanism of the overall outlook. there's something about a fully mastered style that's calming, reassuring.not everything works equally well. one may feel impatient with the succession of barely related scenes, which read too much sometimes like the work of a saturday night live writer in need of prozac. since some scenes plainly move you or draw a laugh, it's obvious that others fall a little flat.but some scenes are real zingers, and one obviously triumphant climax of pure magic is a dream--described and then visualized dreams being another important thread) in which the girl groupie imagines herself in a wedding dress newly married to her fey guitarist ideal, who plays a delicate series of riffs while a crowd of admirers gathers outside a big window. the viewpoint switches to outside and the window slides slowly away as if the building the dream newlyweds look out of were a train moving out of a station to take them to their honeymoon. it's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.eventually one may feel everything in you the living (du levande) is a dream, including the recurring scene where the barman is always striking a bronze bell and announcing last order time, whereupon all the torpid customers rise from their tables and go up to get one more drink.an italian reviewer called this "a small, great film," and that's right. it limits itself in a dozen ways, but there is greatness in it. roy andersson is a little master (like some medieval miniaturist) of the inner comedies of scandanavian gloom, and this is a film unlike any other. shown this year as a cannes "un certain regard" selection, this is also the swedish entry for the 2007 best foreign oscar. hard to say what bergman would think, but andersson worked with him; is famous for his elaborately produced tv commercials, some of which one can see on youtube. bergman called them "the best commercials in the world." it will be interesting to see if this director, whose craft is as subtle as his viewpoint, will start working in longer segments some time. meanwhile, any good film buff really needs to get a look at this."schadenfreude" isn't quite the right word. that means delight in the misery of others. andersson is teaching us to delight in the misery of all of us.

roy anderssons "du levande" is not totally original as it is counter piece to anderssons previous movie "sånger från andra våningen". still the movie has aura of total originality. some conventions of movie making are still thrown away: most of the actors look nothing like what you would expect in movie and the shots take long time. most of the time camera doesn't move but people move around it. the shots start from somewhere and many times the scenery builds up in amazing proportions. w.g. sebald comes to mind in literature with same technique. because of the time invested in every shot the suspension is really high in many of the scenes. there is a story and isn't - it is left for viewer to build up in his or her own mind. this movie is positive. it is determined not to see this all in negative way and at the same time will not pass the social injustices. one of the messages i got from it was that maybe all failures and accidents are not fatal after all. great movie.

you, the living (2007)mordant. i've never written that word before but it comes to mind here. let me look it up. well, it's part of it--corrosive, but also funny as heck. so corrosively funny. this is a dour film, for sure, with so much dry dry dry wit and quirky humor it's impossible not to like it on some level. filmed in a very spare style, often with a static camera and really balanced, stable compositions, like theater stages, we see a short enactment occur.but that makes it seem ordinary--which it is not. ordinary life is shown to be frumpy, ironic, delightful, coy, and depressing. and impossible. we, the living, must live, and since we're alive, we may as well take note. something like that. i think it was ebert who said you find yourself laughing and don't know why. exactly. and the promo material somewhere said it was a cross between bergman and monty python, and what they mean is it has the dry, silent, probing look of ingmar berman's famous swedish films, but it has the zany, somehow touching elements of the british comedians. i'd say, definitely, definitely watch at least half an hour of this. there is part of me that thought i was through by then--the rest continues in a similar assemblage of little skits and moments, and they do gradually evolve, but there is no great plot to follow or climax of the usual kind. there are some great moments later, even just the attention to the thunderstorm, which takes us out of the mundane human events nicely. the filming is gorgeous in its classical control, almost like a series of gregory crewdson scenes (and outdoing the photographer, actually). and the acting, with all its very ordinary, non-glam folksiness, is right on. a startling, beautiful, odd experience.

i laughed out loud several times during this film though give it a cursory glance and you would think it was something else altogether. i adore the pace and the way it slowly burns into you as you are presented these gobsmackingly beautiful tableaux. andersson gives us something else here. shows us something i had not seen since his last film. he is compositionally exceptional and via his method of fixing the camera and allowing action to take place before us, he opens the door on humanity and we peer into a place that reflects our own lives, our little lives. it is powerful stuff. it is the simplicity with which he allows the events to take place that creates the opposite feeling of complexity. everything in front of the camera is anything but simple. andersson's attention to detail is extraordinary. i believe most scenes, if not all, are sets built from scratch according to his designs. i cannot recommend this film highly enough. for me it took me to a place and i came out of it having witnessed a world frayed and beautiful, starched and pained, barren and splendid. at once alien and familiar. this film is brilliant and life affirming. i know because i came out smiling feeling wonderful. it has taken him seven years to make this. if he only made this one film he would still be up there with the greats.

the large bell in a bar intermittently rings for last orders and the inevitable rush to queue forms at the counter  do we want what we need only when it's too late? or is the irony of the opening scene's wailing cassandra a more resonant reflection of our perceptions on individual existence? there's an endless fascination about where writer-director roy andersson wants to take us in his fourth feature, "you, the living". with fifty or so semi-related vignettes strung together by a penchant for tragicomic hyper-reality, its wistful interpretations and symbolic instances of life that bind us all in this great big cosmic sisyphean struggle. the sheer simplicity of these vignettes act to dramatise the tenuity and immense preciousness of being apart of the symbiotic relationships we have with one another. andersson might whittle down the complexity of the human condition through harsh and fast cynicism more than he should, but he also reminds us of the inherent, reassuring glory of waking up each morning to a new tomorrow when we're all aware of our own distinct forms of arrested development.

you can't really call roy andersson prolific, (6 films in 37 years). nor can you accuse him of being conventional; he doesn't do 'straight-forward', at least when it comes to narrative. "you, the living", his first film in seven years, is like a surreal documentary in which a large number of characters are observed doing nothing very much and if that sounds off-putting, let me assure you it isn't. this is a funny, accessible and surprisingly warm-hearted movie, a slice-of-life far removed from that which we normally see on the screen.of course, 'slice-of-life' is hardly the proper moniker to apply to this movie since most people's lives are unlikely to be anything like this. the incidents on the screen run the gamut from the almost terrifyingly ordinary to the downright wacky and while characters may flit by, sometimes never to be seen again, others to reappear as if anxious for approval, andersson bestows on them all a kind of benign affection. that, and some rollicking music, ensure the time we spend with them is time well-spent.

enjoyed this film which deals entirely about an average family, so it appears. ben travis, (jeff daniels) plays the role as a father who is only interested in one son who is excellent at swimming and wins many trophy's, however, he hates it very much and even his father. ben has very little to say to his other son, tim, (emile hirsh) and even his daughter, penny, (michelle williams) who is fortunate to be away in college. the mother, sandy, (sigourney weaver) tries to hold the family together and even she is completely ignored by her husband also. a very tragic event happens in the family which changes everyone's personality, young and old start using drugs, smoking pot and drinking all the time at parties. there is even a homosexual scene and at the same time there is even room for comedy and of course there is a very dark secret that sandy travis finally tells her son tim.

imaginary heroes is one fine little film! written and directed by dan harris this story is classic theater, weaving comedy and tragedy together so tightly that the climax of the film takes your breath away.the travis family is an odd bunch: no member is who each appears to be. beginning with a suicide of the reluctant 'hero' child swimming champion matt (kip pardue), the father ben (jeff daniels) falls apart and isolates himself from his family and himself while the mother sandy (sigourney weaver) turns to pot and rage and sarcasm, the daughter penny (michelle williams) returns from school repulsed by her family's behavior, and the remaining son tim (emile hirsch) takes the brunt of all of the above by avoiding his classmates, girlfriend, and teams with his neighbor kyle (ryan donowho) to leap into drugs and sexual experimentation. throughout the film tim tries to hide bruises on his body that have a secret all their own yet lead his girlfriend to feel rejection, his mother to rage against the trailer park trash bully she believes is the cause, and finally open the window to the deep scars this family has suffered for years. secrets and lies, here, and the resolution of them is painfully dramatic.this may be sigourney weaver's finest role, although emile hirsh, jeff daniels, ryan donowho, and kip pardue (despite the brevity of his role) all contribute top-notch performances. the story begins slowly and seems to meander and that fact may lose some viewers' attention, but stay with this little powerhouse film and the impact of the work will stun you. highly recommended. grady harp

imaginary heroes, the remarkable work of the then 24 year-old dan harris, is tag-lined "people are never who they seem to be". perhaps this is wisely chosen as a stratagem of marketing; yet, i rented this movie in spite of the tag-line, rather than because of it. and, i'm glad i did. i found the move an insightful examination of tragedy. i personally found it to be a movie about coping with dreams: particularly those which are lost. in the case of one son, "loss" requires deep examination of what he had, and didn't have, in his life. yet, the central tragedy of the movie, while posing enticing questions in its own right, acts primarily as the backdrop against which different coping styles are set into relief. i believe the film inquires into an important question: how do we cope with our dreams, particularly where heroes become imaginary?

before barton jumps all over my remarks, let's all just keep in mind that opinions are like asses, we all have them.....i loved sigourney weaver & jeff daniels, i loved the dialogue and thought the acting was sublime. downplayed just perfectly and understated. unlike some others, i did not find this @ all predictable.i found sigourney's role refreshingly humorous and realistic, especially her scene confronting the bully in the trailer.i found it enjoyable and wasn't anticipating recommending this to all and sundry. this is why there are different flavors of ice cream, something to please everyone...

the nyt review says that sigourney weaver's character is taut and frustrated, and, later, that she could be the sister of mtm's character in ordinary people. say, what? no way. this lady was quirky from the start. nothing like mtm in ordinary people. sorry.next, the nyt goes on to say that sigourney weaver's sandy travis and jeff daniel's ben travis are 40-something year olds, "children of the 60s." ms weaver must be dancing a jig. i believe at the time she made imaginary heroes she was in fact 55 years old. she was born in 1949.nyt perception corrections aside, this was a pretty good movie considering it was made by someone so young. obviously sigourney weaver thought so, and so did jeff daniels. the young man playing tim was outstanding.there are some critical comments i could make about the script. such as that i never really got a good sense of why sandy travis missed her son. her sort of blown apart behavior was perhaps triggered by his death, but that such behavior lasted ¾ of the way through the film i felt had more to do with her stagnation marriage, her relationship with tim, and where he really came from, and other unresolved issues, than from any mourning of her elder son. ben's mourning was much more clear.so matt travis was an asshole. did his mom think so too? still, a very watchable film. what is becoming clearer and clearer is not that there are no roles for women over a certain age, rather that what it takes is a director such as this one to be so clearly in love with an older woman (ms weaver) and to almost make his film an homage to her. sort of an anti-woody allen.

so. i was completely in love with this movie. gaga for it, even with all its plot twists...but the one thing i found really disturbing was the connection between the two best friends in tim and kyle. while the writer of the film gave us such a poignant moment between the two, and their sexual experimentation/confusion, he then gives us a plot twist that makes them half brothers?!?! (although the subject isn't brought up in the film....and left unexplained and unaccounted for) i just thought that it was in bad taste, and the fact that it wasn't even discussed is even worse. (oops we've created a taboo...now let's not address the situation, because that wouldn't really be p.c.) otherwise a spectacular film

this off-beat horror movie seems to be getting nothing but bad reviews. my question is; why? i think this movie is pretty good. dee snider did very well for his first (and only) time directing. he also plays the antagonist, captain howdy (carelton hendriks). this movie seems to have a view of the future. although it came out back in 1998, it seems to be about modern issues. internet predators seems to be the underlying plot here. although taken to another level, this is an issue which we still face today. i'll admit, the story fell short a few times, but that doesn't make this a bad movie at all. robert englund is even in this movie, that automatically makes it better. the acting wasn't bad, the characters were pretty good as well. hendriks was a pretty good antagonist i think. i give this off-beat horror a 7/10. recommend for fans of saw.

everyone told me this movie was downright not good, and sick etc. so i finally rented it and i was amazed . i thought the torture was gonna be much much worse, but it did get shocking near the end but that was about it. i wouldn't call it a horror movie, maybe a mystery or something under the category of silence of the lambs and/or kiss the girls. it did get stupid at times, but the rest of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat. 7/10rated r - for strong torture, violence, language, and sexuality

i don't understand where these bad comments are coming from. the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.the part that gets you is that this could all happen. not to the extent perceived in the movie, but the whole idea is reality. this movie took that reality and twisted it into a dee snider nightmare.three thumbs up (the third one is from the dead body in my freezer).

this thriller is one of the few (film) surprises i've had in quite some time. everybody - and i do mean everybody - i talked to when it was in the theatres said it was awful...but then i got to thinking...none of these people really understand horror/thriller films or metal rock - so why do i listen to them in the first place????? this film kicks ass - but only if you are able to comprehend and enjoy this type of entertainment. in short (too late) - see it with an open mind and it might just open your mind. ...the soundtracks great too...

i didn't really think this movie was bad. sure, the detective kinda sucked at what he did, and he usually happened upon capt. howdy by accident, but he got the job done. capt. howdy himself was pretty scary. the make-up artist did a great job. i really liked seeing dee dressed up all geeky. i laughed so hard when i saw that. i personally don't see how someone can sit through crap like texas chainsaw massacre and call it a great movie, and then watch strangeland, which is more disturbing because a lot of it could actually happen with the internet being so popular, and call it bad. i personally think that texas chainsaw massacre was loads of crap. probably one of the stupidest movies that i've ever seen. i enjoyed strangeland. it was a very disturbing movie because almost all of it actually happens.

dee snider was inspired to do a two part song by a horror movie. this movie he wrote/directed/produced and starred in details the subjects from those songs (horror-terria,from twistedsister/ stay hungry). people have commented he must have a sick mind to put something like this out. i don't hear anybody making comments like that about stephen king, wes craven,dean koontz,or in his own time alfred hitchcock. the movie profiles a modern psychotic created by current trends in society. personally i thought it was pretty well done from sheer imagination and inspiration,also without the benefit of a large budget and interviews with actual victims/criminals. this movie is perfect if you want something to give you nightmares and make you cringe about the possible and probable. it could happen!!

honestly, this is one of the best horror movies i have ever seen. i was captivated by the story, petrified of captain howdy and on the edge of my seat for the whole ride. i do not really understand all the negative reviews.the set up has already been discussed in depth; captain howdy is an on-line predator who sets up meetings with teenagers, abducts them and introduces them to his favorite pastime of body modification and piercing. dee snider is captain howdy and he is one of the scariest psychopaths ever created; maybe the scariest because he is so human and you get the sense (especially if you are into body modification at all) that there are really people like this in the world.but the biggest reason i liked this movie and the reason it is so horrific is that captain howdy becomes the hero. at the beginning of the movie, the roles are clear-cut; the victims are innocent, the cop is the good guy and howdy is pure evil. by the second act, however, things have changed a little. you want howdy to be evil but it turns out that he is really just a victim of circumstance and maybe the good and the bad are not obvious. it is terrifying to find yourself cheering for the "bad" guy.a couple people have mentioned that strangeland should have been broken into two separate movies. to be sure, there are definitely two separate "acts" but this movie works so well because the two acts are back to back. the first act is the typical psycho-thriller but the second act is the most disturbing because of the viewers reaction to the situation. i do not think it would have worked quite the same if the second act were expanded and turned into a sequel.as a big horror movie fan, i highly recommend this film. it is the first horror movie ever to give me nightmares.

strangeland seems to have a love/hate relationship with many of its viewers. i personally loved the movie, and everything about it.the acting in some places could be improved upon, but the filming adds to the atmosphere where the acting can't. in some areas, the dialogue is a bit cheesy and over dramatic, but really, what do you expect from the late 90s? over all, dee did an amazing job in writing what i believe to be one of the most terrifying thrillers i've ever seen. it plays on the fears of many age groups--adult, parents, and children. every parent fears that their children will get too involved with chat rooms and will meet strangers from the internet. and it *does* happen in the real world. and every child and adult fears being kidnapped and tortured against their will; that happens too in the real world. which is what makes this movie such a sensitive subject for many.my only warning is if you *know* you are sensitive to things such as strong violence, visible torture, and gore, then you do *not* want to see this movie. if you are unsure about if this movie will entertain you, then read as many reviews as you can, ask people you know who have seen this movie, and be prepared to turn the movie off at any time should you become disturbed.

a lot of people give this movie a lot of crap, and all of it's really undeserved. people give this movie a hard time either because it's such a sick subject or they harp on some technical aspect of the movie no one else observes when they watch it. if, just by looking at the cover, you think this movie will make you uncomfortable...don't watch it! however, you'd be missing out on one of the better cinematic experiences of the late 1990's, despite what anyone else says.dee snider is wonderful here as captain howdy, the depths of insanity he plumbs to play this character has to be beyond words, and is much farther than any one of us would have to be willing to go. the acting here is wonderful. the film itself beautifully shot. the subject may be a bit too much for many to swallow, but it's still well worth your time. if you haven't seen this movie, check it out.

andrew mccarthy played the role of an atheist very well. i liked the plot of the movie. it gave something to think about other than a comedy. it had a very twisted mind and a good cop versus god. a very well used plot line.

i enjoyed the film, and the fact that it aimed rather high in dealing with some sophisticated material. i saw the film in a preview screening, and it wasn't ruined by any silly video boxes that spoiled the ending. the performances were quite good, especially andrew mccarthy in a more mature roll. i also enjoyed the look of the film which gave it a mysterious, forboding air. i also enjoyed some of the "twists" in the plot, and don't want to give too much away in case other countries' video boxes don't give it all away! the script was a little over the top at times, but i appreciated the fact that the film-makers weren't afraid to challenge the audiences with interesting and puzzling questisons regarding the roll of faith in our world. and, while some might find the ending a little too open-ended, i appreciated the fact that the movie refused to tie everything up neatly with a bow. that's not how life works.

this film was different. it took a sort of typical thriller story and reached for a more interesting, in-depth look at an individual character's struggle with faith. of course, it helped that the main performance, by andrew mccarthy, was quite excellent. the other performances were also quite interesting, although not as consistent. the ending was a bit of a let down, but there were lots of good moments. the film-makers tried something different here -- they didn't just go for the obvious chills and scares. this is a dark film (not for everyone) but if you want to be entertained and not talked down to, try this one.

i saw this movie on my local cable system under the title of 'beyond redemption'. i was searching for new material to watch, since most of the reruns one saturday morning didn't interest me. i've always been a fan of andrew mccarthy and michael ironside, so i chose this movie. i was pleasantly surprised.personally, i enjoyed the film. rich roesing, who posted a comment about the film being spoiled for him by seeing scenes from the movie on the back of a video rental box, are well justified. i did not have the disappointment of knowing beforehand anything about the film. this led me to rate the movie higher than the average score listed on the page.i like suspense movies, and this one was no exception. the movie kept me guessing until the very end. i was surprised by the ending!the moments of reflection and remembrance of past experiences by the main character during the film only added to the suspense. his reactions to those remembrances gave the film a sense of the humanitarian, yet conflictual, side of police work. the struggle with his faith is also a welcome addition.if you like suspense films, but also like films that expound on the character's feeling, personal inflection side, this film is for you.should you find this movie on your local cable or satellite system's guide, watch it!however, if you are looking for a rental video, follow rich roesing's advice and have someone get the video for you before watching it.

look, this is a low budget horror film that suffers from all of the problems that go with low budget movies. but you must see this just to watch lisa erickson as julie. she is smokin' hot and a great little actress to boot! these types of horror movies often unearth a rare gem and the power gave us lisa erickson! nothing i enjoy more than sitting down in my studio apartment with a coke and putting in this film. my friends bob, bill and dennis agree.. lisa is not only brilliant, she is a hottie. the movie itself often plods along and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in that regard. but as soon as lisa hits the screen, things really start hopping. the others are clearly not in her league. this is not the exorcist but as i said, if you want to see a fun little movie with a hot little actress, this is the one to see!

a man named jerry comes into possession of an ancient aztec doll.however this creepy little figure is possessed by an evil spirit,which takes over jerry's body and pushes him to spill the blood...i have seen two other horror movies "the dorm that dripped blood" and "the kindred" made by stephen carpenter and jeffrey obrow and i must say that "the power" doesn't disappoint either.the plot is slow-moving,but there are some effective human goo effects and a little bit of gore.the scene of a female tabloid reporter being attacked by arms that come ripping out of a mattress is a hoot.i liked this low-budget horror movie and you should too,if you are into 80's horror genre.8 out of 10.

abe zwick perfected the one-off, beautifully. he never made another film, but created a brilliant portrait of homosexual self-hatred in this film that is both caustic and affecting. he commands the screen, presenting the crumbling debris of a man breaking down under the strain of an increasingly meaningless life. paul (zwick) is an aging queen who's somehow convinced stanley (wayne crawford), a doe-eyed idiot with no sense of the future, to follow his star. he's a petty thief who's seething hatred has escalated recently. he's been forced to skip town and move to a suburb in miami. as a disguise, he dresses up like a dried up old blue-stocking with as much seething sexual torment as the church lady. he tells stanley to tell his friends that he lives with his "aunt martha". paul himself has no friends, spends far too much time alone in the house, and has to deal with stanley's dissolute lifestyle. it would be enough to make any man cross the line into transgendered homicidal mania. again, zwick portrays paul as a tragic figure who has utterly lost any understanding of how to relate to other people. nevertheless, there is a certain poetry in his anguish, which burns slowly over the course of the film. he's tragic, but also elegant. this is, ultimately, a very sad film. it certainly has many hilarious moments, but there is such an undercurrent of hopelessness and despair, that the humour is bittersweet. this film is worth watching for the performance of abe zwick. he could have really built his career on martha. she's quite a gas, once you get to know her. just make sure you cut your hair and stop your horsing around. she really hates that!

haha, what a great little movie! wayne crawford strikes again, or rather this was his first big strike, a deliriously entertaining little ball of manic kitsch energy masquerading as a psycho killer movie. it's actually a **brilliant** satire on post-hippie american culture in flyover country, though the movie was actually filmed independently in miami. it defies any kind of studio oriented convention or plot device that i can think of: sometimes aunt martha does dreadful things may not be a very technically adept movie, but it is a wonderful little slice of americana, made on the cheap by people who were honest, ambitious, imaginative and had balls made out of steel. it took guts, nerve and guile to make this movie, which amazingly appears to have stood the test of time. this movie is fresh, vital, alive, unforgettable, and charmingly weird enough to recommend to just about anyone with a sense of humor.i dug up last year during a period of time when i was fascinated by "star" wayne crawford (here billed under his pseudonym scott lawrence), a maestro of what can only be called regional film-making, usually of the b grade variety. he's a writer, producer, director, and actor all in one, probably best known for the 80s teen apocalyptic favorite night of the comet. here he plays stanley, the pants wearing half of a couple of truly marvelous characters, apparently homosexual spree killers on the lam after knocking off some old lady in baltimore for her jewelry. unsung screen legend abe zwick is completely convincing as paul, who poses as stanley's aunt martha, the cross dressing brains of the outfit who has conned stanley into thinking he's committed murder to ensure his loyalty. martha looks about as feminine as the sailors from south pacific's supporting choir in their coconut bikini tops, yet somehow nobody seems to notice -- or care? -- that she is a he, has no visible means of income, seems to spend all day fretting about where stanley is, and scurries around the neighborhood in her bathrobe carrying a butcher's knife. only in america ...as the film opens the two of them have just arrived in florida and set up residence in what looks like ward cleaver's old house, a garishly lit & designed television home that is so cliché as to be surreal. during one memorable scene martha and an unwelcome house guest sit on the couch, talk problems and drink cans of budweiser in what is one of the most mesmerizing, subversively ordinary sequences i've ever seen outside of a john waters movie. then there's stanley, always getting into trouble as he is a mop topped hippie with an stp patch on his vest who drives a psychedelic painted van that's about as subtle as the batmobile, drinks his milk straight from the carton, snorts drugs with blond bombshell bimbos, and hoards donuts in an old cigar box for a quick snack. opposites attract, i guess.but stanley also has a thing about not liking it when the young ladies he gets stoned with try to remove his pants, and it always seems to be up to aunt martha to get him out of the trouble that inevitably results. the bodies pile up, a nosy junkie blackmails them into using their house as a flop, stanley's birthday cake gets squashed, and everybody meets down at the local pizza shop before heading to the wood shed on the back property for a hookah hash party where the girls dance in their underwear. things get out of hand when one of the neighbors tries to get a bit too chummy with martha, who naturally prefers to keep people at an arm's length when they rudely invite themselves over for a nice chat. and this is a woman who carries not just a butcher knife but a loaded .38 in her slip. eventually the strange duo find themselves stuck with a body, a baby, and no place to go, and end up taking refuge at an abandoned movie studio where no doubt the technical crew borrowed the equipment used to make the film. i just hope they politely asked for permission first and cleaned up after themselves.a word of course must be said about stanley and martha/paul's relationship, since to dance around the fact that the two are at least suggested to be a homosexual couple would be to miss the primary gist of the plot. we never see the two of them get intimate and indeed even though stanley mockingly refers to being "balled" in one scene, their relationship is more symbiotic than sexual. it certainly isn't a "gay" movie, with abundant female nudity and an air of 70s misogyny that cannot be denied either. stanley & paul never consummating their implied sexuality on screen, even though the movie certainly would have had the guts to do so if it were important. it isn't, the story isn't about their sex, it's about the bond they share, and how weird it is. not their being gay, but their being the distinct individuals they are, who are two of the strangest movie creations ever to inhabit my tv set.the film is unique. it was made for only a few thousand dollars on what look like borrowed studio sets, the occasional location work, and an couple of public locations they managed to sneak a camera crew into when nobody was looking. the dialog is completely bizarre, mundane and delightfully esoteric. it's a movie that will take you by surprise, not everyone will like it but for those with a taste for low budget american horror/thrillers like the night god screamed, help me! i'm possessed, blood & lace and children shouldn't play with dead things, you've got yourself a winner here.8/10: usually i'd say something like "deserves a dvd restoration" but somehow i think doing so would ruin the movie's tacky ambiance. and wayne crawford, you, sir, rule.

the working title was: "don't spank baby". wayne crawford went on to become a successful producer, films like valley girl, night of the comet and others, even though he wasn't too terrific in this little gem. and little known abe zwick should have gotten tons of work from this film but didn't. filmed at moberly studios in hollywood florida, on the same lot the early tarzan movies were filmed. this film is definitely for those who appreciate the abstract. the movie was originally shot with some nudity and much more graphic slasher scenes. for reasons only known to tom casey the director, the bloody slasher scenes were given a tab of lsd, and the nudity was removed. even though this version is worthy of a look for those so inclined, in my opinion, the original version would have packed the punch needed to make this a full on slasher 70's cult classic.

the title refers not to a questionable poker hand, but to six comic players. they come in twos: charles ruggles and mary boland as a couple driving to california for a second honeymoon, george burns and gracie allen as another couple who go along to share expenses, and w.c. fields and alison skipworth as a sheriff and a hotel-owner in a tiny nevada town. no attempt is made to fashion a coherent narrativeit's a collection of comic bits strung together. all the first couple want to do is spend time together, but burns and allen's characters aren't married, so the men bunk together, as do the women. there is a bit of a plot: a bad guy plants $50k in the suitcase pinky (ruggles) is taking out of town, but because the expedition is being guided by gracie, the loot cannot be found. the bad guy shows up in nevada and fields accidentally captures him. a bunch of pleasant bits, ruggles' confused expression, gracie's batty, breakneck talk, and fields playing billiards with a corkscrew cue and doing a fluttery, craven, backwards-stepping double-take when he's threatened, and his wonderfully distinctive way of lingering over words. and trying to remember the name "gracie," he tells skipworth, "hmm. starts with a k... mcgonigle." she answers, "oh no, no, no, no..." "mmmm. wangahanky!" "no, no, no, no no. oh, gracie." "yes, that's right."

the gimmick, as it were, of this 1934 paramount comedy is the six comedy performers, paired off into three man-and-woman teams, who all appear together. w. c. fields and his frequent screen partner alsion skipworth appear in the second half of the film and shine in their roles as a small-town sheriff and innkeeper. fields seems to have been given the latitude to inject plenty of his own one-of-a-kind brand of misanthropic, surreal comedy into his part, and it works wonderfully, especially where he is allowed to do his famous pool table routine, a digression that is totally welcome since it is hilarious.at first thought it might have seemed like a mismatch to conceive of a film to be carried by the subtle domestic comedy of charlie ruggles and mary boland next to the broad, jokey vaudeville patter of the great husband-and-wife comedy team of george burns and gracie allen, but here it works perfectly because of the parts george and gracie are given in the script. they are there are freeloaders hitching a ride to california on ruggles' and boland's honeymoon trip and consistently find ways to annoy them at every step, including, brilliantly, while they are each holding on to the side of a cliff for dear life.making burns and allen comic annoyances to two sympathetic characters turns out to be a perfect way to fit their far-out, larger-than-life comedy characters into a real world setting -- the comedy of people reacting to them in a believable way turns out to be as much as a gold-mine as gracie's famous naive delivery itself.charlie ruggles deserves special mention for his performance as the fussy banker "pinky" whinney. he's marvelously subtle and underplayed, and draws laughs from lines that in another actor's hands might not even have been heard.the script is wonderfully witty all through, and most of the way it's a perfectly extended comedy of frustration in which our sympathies are with the poor whinneys who can't get a moment alone, and the extra bonus is that what frustrates them is just more first-rate comedy material from burns and allen. for the pre-code watchers out there, there is some rather suggestive material in some of the most amusing scenes, as whinney tries to get across to george just why he and his wife want to be alone for a while.there are a few signs of a rushed production here -- the occasional jump cut, one of the most obvious drop sets you will ever see in a movie (right up there with w. c. field's own short "the golf specialist"), and the knot in field's tie is constantly changing in shape. these don't bother me, though, and they shouldn't bother anybody who is enjoying the film."six of a kind" is a real little-known gem and one of the funniest movies i've seen in a while. if you're thinking about whether to watch it, the answer should be yes.

lauren himmel's debut movie is well directed with a nice polished feel to it. there's a strong storyline going on with a meaningful point to it all even if at the end nothing is resolved hence the name treading water. the storyline revolves around a lesbian couple and their battle with ones mother for acceptance. 7.5/10

the pickle was the most underrated film of the decade. despite my best efforts at home, it is still seen as a bad movie. i say to hell with everyone on this. every one doesn't understand that it is in part a comedy with a dramatic twist at the end. danny aiello plays a burnt out director with perfection and conveys a sad depressed man. the scene when he is trying to record a last message is quite good. the interludes of stones movie are absolutely funny. "this is harry stone and today i become a man!" in all a fine and sadly misunderstood movie. plus a great cameo by little richard. hilarious! i hope that more people see this movie because 202 people is not enough for a consensus.-silence dogood

this is a great off-the-wall romantic comedy about love, work, pandering to the public taste, and midlife crises. the main character is a talented movie director who decides to make a silly pg-13 movie to get himself out of hock with the irs. it has an excellent cast, a wide range of humor (from deadpan to slapstick), and fine writing. it's also a wry send-up of the movie industry. the metacommentary includes several excellent cuts between reality and the movie that's being made, and in some places the film departs from strict realism. the result is a multi-dimensional masterpiece of wry midlife humor.

although the wonderful soda counter in the local drugstore nolonger exists, and the clothes are definitely l946 immediatepost-war vintage, and good and evil are easy to understand, andthose old planes are really dated, this movie will never be dated. the human adjustments and problems post-war, the beautifullove stories, the wonderful acting (especially harold russell anddana andrews) are as moving today in 2002 as they were in l946. i was one of the young women who welcomed our marvelousveterans home from world war ii. like so many, my memories ofthe war years and the homecomings are as fresh today as if theytook place yesterday - this movie is very relevant for our times.

this film tells the stories of several couples coping with post-wwii life. through many moving accounts the audience learns how the war has changed people, while their human spirit went on to triumph.my favorite scene is where a young service man, who returned home as a double amputee (after losing both arms up to the elbow) is sure that he would be no good to his sweetheart, who still wants to marry him. his girl simply said that she would help him with the things he wouldn't be able to do, but that they would be fine together. moved by this true demonstration of love, the man embraces his fiancée in tears.the scene where a service man asked for a bank loan is also a highlight. when he is initially refused as a "high risk", a higher ranking bank official takes over saying "you fought for our country and kept us safe--that's good enough for me. your loan is approved!" "the best years of our lives" won 6 oscars, including a special statuette for the disabled actor who showed us all that life goes on and will continue to be worth living, even with a severe handicap. this film is a joy to watch over and over again. a true classic! highly recommended!

pat o'brien had his best role ever as notre dame football coach knute rockne. from humble beginnings, rockne entered notre dame as a student circa 1910. he is into chemistry but becomes a marvelous football player and hero.upon graduation, he teaches chemistry at the school but he has got the football fever that tugs at him, this forces him to give up chemistry to pursue his dream of coaching the game. in a way, too bad, the school probably lost a great chemistry teacher-certainly far better and nicer than the one i had in high school. (erasmus hall in brooklyn to be exact.)he motivates his students. he will not tolerate academic underachievement. he is a coach for all seasons.o'brien captures that common kind touch. one of his students, george gipp, is memorably played in a fine brief supporting performance by ronald reagan.the years pass and the achievements run high-but knute remains the same kind coach who testifies before congress when football is called into question.donald crisp is outstanding as a notre dame priest who knew that rockne was destined to coach football. albert basserman is adequate, but his jewish accent in the portrayal of a priest is awkward at best. basserman was nominated that year in the supporting category for "foreign correspondent."rockne's tragic death, in a plane crash, robbed the world of many more years of a totally professionally wonderful human-being. the film is great.

you don't have to be a notre dame football fan to enjoy this, because i am not....but, as a football fan in general, this was fun to watch. it almost makes me a fighting irish devotee. if you can't get caught up in the emotion in this film, gridiron fan or not, you better check your pulse because this is an emotional film with some very touching scenes.as a sports fan, i loved watching the classic footage of early college games. they had some pretty wild plays back then with a lot of laterals. they interspersed that footage with pat o'brien shown as head coach knute rockne on the sidelines and some of the players, such as george gipp (ronald reagan). reagan gets pretty good billing in this film but his part really isn't that large. o'brien is the only actor with a large role in here. the rest - all playing nice characters - include gale page as rockne's wife "bonnie;" donald crisp, as the notre dame's "father john callahan;" albert bassermann as chemistry professor "father nieuwland" and reagan, as gipp, perhaps notre dame's most talented and famous player ever.what this film does nicely is balance the personal story with the football. neither angle is overdone. the characters in here all people you can root for, as there are no villains. on my last look, it was interesting to discover johnny sheffield - tarzan's son - playing rockne at the age of seven and to see george reeves, tv's superman, as one of the players. there have been very few football movies made in hollywood, for some reason, and precious few good ones. this is one of them.

this is a classic street punk & rock movie. if you remember those times out on the city streets 14 years old two in the morning and nothing better to do than skate from friends house to friends house and sparking it. this movie brings back old memeries.

i watched the movie about 13 yrs ago while living in airlie beach qld australia. i had found it in the shelves of a little shop in the back that most don't bother to browse.to my pleasure i found it and watched it with the intention of one day owning it and being in my collection. i still do not have it but will one day.i like the concept with the poetry and the fantasy. the semi deserted street scenes with a busy teaming city in the far background added to the visual effect.i have numerous times mentioned this movie to people that enjoy this genre, with nothing but praise. it has stuck in my mind and will for a long time to come.i fully recommend this film, but only to those that are into this type.this comment and the one from la,ca can assist you when choosing to watch this film. the comments may be negative but i found them positive if you look past the derogatory connotation.

the beat was an exciting movie about a couple of young punks trying to survive in 1980's new york. this involves fighting with the other street gang that they directly share a high school class with, trying to stay in school, as well as going to local shows that involve bands that look like the dead kennedy's and have the name skulls for their band name. rex (played by david jacobson) plays an autistic kid who starts to get a long with all of these kinds, and starts to show them that poetry is really beautiful, and if applied to what these kids do in life can really make things work out for the better! billy kane (played by william mcnamara) and kate kane (played by kara glover) are brother and sister. although they roll with this crowd of thugs, these kids are not the same type of people as this group. they care for rex and they care for others, and really show an enlightened side of themselves. while his sister sleeps with the head of the gang, she is also falling in love with rex, trying to show him that she is not a slut. but in the end, the teachers at the school finally get to him and want to put him in a mental institution, he finally feels it is time to end his life, while animals of sound played without him. but they like to think that he is not dead, he is just living his life to the fullest, riding sharks and being happy living in the ocean. this movie, was one of those movies where i was glad that i watched it. while it was extremely entertaining, it also had a big message to it. something a long the lines that these kids had no direction, no future, no figure heads to look up to, but because a troubled kid came along they all realized that there was way more important things to life then fighting the local black kids, or being destructive to everything. rex showed them the beauty in angry music. rex showed them the beauty in rats, disease and murder. rex showed they the beauty in almost everything, while some of those things have no beauty involved, they still were able to see that when used in poems, these poems speak to people. rex played an important part in this move, who changed everyones heart from depression, to see that there is hope for them, and thats why he started to show them; the beat.

i think it's the sort of film you either love or hate and i'm really not the type to go in for arty movies. my mother rented "mullhuland dr" the other night and i nearly ran from the room, ha. but i love this film.we recorded "the beat" one night when we had just let the tape run and got a great film that way by accident. saved that tape and watched it a lot. i eventually got the vhs to add to my collection. i've watched it many times and at one point copied down the poems. i even tried to preform one scene for my high school drama class. she had said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut out the bad words. she refused to let me do it. if it could upset my drama teacher that much it has to be good :) honest she never treated me the same after that.i liked the acting it came off very true and honest. it wasn't clean and polished but it was better than that. it was true to life, how anyone would truly behave and display emotions not how hollywood does. it was great acting especially by the one playing rex.the story was original. not only do the characters get drawn into his world but you do too. not your typical person meets inner city kids and saves them through knowledge film at all. simply caring and friendship make things a bit better.the only thing is that even in the 80's there was more gun violence and less simple stuff like rock throwing but that little bit of innocence didn't hurt this film.i think it's a must see. you will either love or hate it but either way it makes an impact and that makes a good film that you will remember and talk about later.

my first review at imdb, after a few years of using this site constantly...anyways, saw this on the tube the other night, loved it. it's in the mindset of a dangerous minds or a substitute, but much better. was sure for a moment that rex was speedy levitch, in waking life, but after checking, it doesn't seem so.i can see why many have problems with this plot and its poetry, but i also think these people are close-minded. admittedly the ending wasn't quite what i was hoping for, but overall it was so unique and well-acted, i can't complain. i wouldn't call this cheesy, as one reviewer did, it pulled off the scene better than most films of the 80's did. and they refrained from playing any really dateable 80's music.can't remember everything that made me smile when i saw this, but basically it realistically showed very creative individuals surrounded by mediocrity, and whether i share rex's beliefs or not, i love original attempts to describe the meaning of life. and his mutant theory is, to my knowledge, original. he rambled a lot as well, but they showed how confused he was at times, and why he might have some psychological issues. and then in his moments of clarity he was a philosopher extraordinaire, a person who noticed the little details in life and tried to give expression to them.also i was very impressed with john savage as the teacher. usually actors fail at that role. he pulled it off brilliantly.if you enjoyed waking life, i say watch this movie if you get a chance.9.5/10pk

"... the beat is too strong ... we're deaf mutants now--like them", rex voorhas orminei am surprised that this movie has been uniformly bashed. let me be the first to actually discuss the virtues of "the beat" and why you must see this film now.make no mistake, this movie is cheesy and "bad" in the conventional sense: the story is preposterous, the poetry is silly, and the acting is inconsistent.but these are the film's charms--all of these ingredients form the recipe for one of the most underappreciated cheezy films of the 80's.if the reference to "deaf mutants" didn't pique your interest, then perhaps this will: what kind of name is "rex voorhas ormine", anyway? it is such an unusual name (for north american audiences) that i said to myself, "even the names of the characters in this friggin' movie are firggin' silly."well, "the beat" is so fabulously cheezy that the "meaning" and "symbolism" behind "rex voorhas ormine" is revealed not-too-subtly by bart waxman (the misguided guidance counselor you love to hate). i won't spoil the revelation behind rex's name, but please don't get too excited, o.k.?overall, the acting is inconsistent (john savage--who plays the "concerned teacher" mr. ellsworth is pretty good, as is the fellow playing bart waxman, but the rest of the cast are unconvincing). that said, the acting does not detract from the film. why? there is a sincerity in each of the actors' performances that makes the characters they play endearing. so although the performances may suck, you are still left with the impression that the actors are really trying to do their best. as a result, the actors' sincerity succeeds where their acting fails (which is quite often).the homage to "beat poetry" in this film is bad, bad, bad. but this is a good, good, good thing when it comes to entertainment. would you actually enjoy "better quality" or "more respectable" poetry--especially in a film like this?folks, that would be boring (think about the droll they made us read in high school--sanitized to avoid "corrupting the youth", politically conservative and devoid of any critical analysis, etc.) even if you don't like poetry or "arty" movies (with all of the "intellectual" posturing that implies), you most certainly can (and should) appreciate ludicrous poetry in a wannabe art film!!!! how could you not enjoy the following?"do you remember the roar of the dinosaur? a woman's scotty craps on the floor bad scotty bad, oh the woman's so sad she washes her hands and then waits by the door today, yeah--today!"yes, that is an example of some of the remarkable poetry liberally sprinkled throughout "the beat." but what about the story, you ask?well, the story is preposterous. but then again, that is the beauty of this film. apart from some cliches, stereotypes, and predictable plot points, there are enough genuinely unique elements to the plot/story to keep things interesting. who is rex? where did he come from? what the heck is he talking about? deaf mutants? illiterate angels? do billy and kate really understand what rex is saying? is the audience supposed to understand rex and his poetry posse? (i've seen the movie several times and i still haven't figured everything out.)will bad poetry and high school talent shows really end gang violence?i guarantee that you have never seen anything quite like "the beat"--a perfect combination of brilliantly bad poetry, mediocre-yet-sincere acting, and a "mythopoetics conquers gang violence" storyline that has yet to be rivalled by any film ever made.bonus for fans of classic nyc hardcore: the cro-mags make a rare film appearance as the "iron skulls" and it's a hoot to see them perform several songs. i wish they included more concert footage, but maybe that will be an "extra" included on the "collector's edition" dvd i fantasize about.

of all the major 30s star actresses, miriam hopkins has been the most bizarrely overlooked and underrated. her string of excellent 30s and 40s films is quite impressive but she is often referred to as stagy or brittle. yet she had a great sense of humor and was memorable in several comedies, including this film, old acquaintance (with bette davis), and the smiling lieutenant (with maurice chevalier and claudette colbert). hopkins was famous for her dislike of hollywood, and the results has been a bad rep--undeserved.in wise girl she play an heiress trying to rescue the children of her dead sister from their guardian--the sister's brother-in-law (ray milland). the film offers several hilarious scene such as hopkins taking a bath is a storeroom, hopkins joining milland and guinn williams in a greenwich village restaurant for $3 apiece to act as "bohemians," and hopkins going ringside during one of williams' fights. milland is also excellent and very funny.hopkins and milland make a great couple. the film also boasts solid support from williams, walter abel, henry stephenson, james finlayson, margaret dumont, grace hayle, leonid kinskey, and inez palange. the two girls are ok.but hopkins, drunk on a "slice of wine" and wearing a pinned-together dress that is twice her size is hilarious as she blows at stray hairs while smoking.... a scream.

society heiress susan fletcher (hopkins) and her wealthy father simon fletcher (henry stephenson) are vexed that their young nieces joan (betty philson) and katie (marianna strelby) are living a bohemian lifestyle in greenwich village with their artist uncle john (milland) after the death of their parents (susan's sister and john's brother). simon has given up trying to convince john to allow he and susan to take care of the children and have resorted to using private detectives to catch him in either unbecoming behavior or unemployed and therefore unable to care for the children properly. susan finally decides to take matters into her own hands and goes to greenwich village herself, posing as an actress, to try to gain information and/or persuade him to see reason. what she discovers however, is that she not only likes the free and artistic lifestyle john and his friends are living and that the girls are being brought up well, but that she is quickly falling in love with john. inevitably, her true identity is discovered and she is faced with the task of convincing everyone on both sides of the custody debate who should belong with whom.i really enjoyed this film, and found that its very short running time (70 minutes) was the perfect length to spin this simple but endearing story. miriam hopkins, one of the great 1930's-1940's actresses is delightful in this film. her energy, style and wholesome beauty really lend themselves to creating an endearing character, even though you know that she's pulling a fast one on the people she quickly befriends. this is the earliest film i've seen ray milland in, and he was actually young and non-patrician looking. (and apparently three years younger than his co-star) his energy and carefree manner in "wise girl" were a refreshing change to the demeanor he affects in his usual, darker, films. honestly, though i am usually not remotely a fan of child actors, i really enjoyed the two young girls who played susan's nieces. they were endearingly precocious, and were really the jewels of the film. unfortunately, i can't dig up any other films that either of them were subsequently in after this one, which is a shame since both exhibited a large amount of natural talent."wise girl" was a film that was made three years after the hollywood code was instated, and to some extent, this was abundantly clear by the quick, happy ending, and the pie in the sky loftiness and ease with which the characters lived. the alleged bohemian co-op was in fact a gorgeous cul-de-sac where the artists lived for free or for trade, and everything is tied up very nicely throughout. fortunately, this was a light enough film and the characters were charming enough to make allowances for its fluffiness and short-comings and i was able to just take "wise girl" for what it was; a good old-fashioned love story that was as entertaining as it was endearing. unfortunately, films of the romantic comedy/drama genre today are considerably less intelligent and entertaining, or i wouldn't find myself continuously returning to the classics. 7/10

sometimes it's hard to define what separates a successful, delightful comedy from one that falls flat. in this case, the contrived plot about a spoiled rich girl who schemes to take her nieces away from the greenwich village 'bohemian' who is raising them, only to fall for him herself, is not promising. and nothing in director leigh jason's filmography suggests that he was an overlooked major talent. and yet he must have been responsible for creating a relaxed, happy atmosphere on the set that was faithfully recorded on film.he also had the good sense to cast this movie properly. the one small flaw is miriam hopkins in a part that ginger rogers would have been perfect for. hopkins is efficient but brittle, lacking the warmth and sexiness rogers would have had. she is further hampered by a pair of bizarrely long and sooty false eyelashes that are sometimes a distraction. but a very young and very handsome ray milland couldn't be better in an exuberant, uninhibited comic performance of great charm.and better than that, particularly for new york city residents, is the hollywood depiction of greenwich village in 1937. though completely synthetic and idealized, it remains recognizable to a contemporary viewer. art director van nest polglase created an amiable jumble of mews apartments and ramshackle shared backyards that is the perfect backdrop for this picture's collection of artists, strivers, smart-alecks and wannabes. best in the supporting cast is guinn williams, bringing sweetness and light to his role as a prizefighter-sculptor-dressmaker, suggesting the self-invention and fluidity (sexual and otherwise) of life in the village. even more refreshing are betty philson and marianna strelby playing the little girls. plain, intelligent and full of humor, these girls seem like real human beings and are nothing like the professional child actors of the time.of special interest are a couple of memorable comic set-pieces: ray milland's vacuum cleaner demonstration to a woman with a howling baby is played with more spontaneity than one expects (the baby and his contortions are marvelous 'found' moments) and a phony domestic 'play' in a department store window that degenerates into a free-for-all is also fun. the movie slides slowly downhill with a straight-faced custody trial and then never quite gets back on track when the action moves to long island, but this movie is still worth a look.

i bought this a while back, during a massive martial arts movie phase. although this certainly ain't the best, i do love this kind of film making, and there was a lot to keep me entertained in this one. leung kar yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars, i always appreciate the fact that, whilst he lacked formal martial arts training, he usually gave a more than capable fighting performance. he also has a good beard. this movie has him in a good, heroic role and although he doesn't kick as much ass as in some of his other movies, he still acquits himself well. early appearances from cherie chung and chow yun fat are also nice too see, especially for the fact that chow yun fat takes on the bad guys without his trademark gun play. he may not be a great fighter but he does ok. eddy ko is as great a bad guy as ever, he performs the same villainry as in many of his other films and does it great, as per usual. the fellow who plays bu is good too, i don't recall his name, but he's in magnificent butcher too. although the fighting isn't as good as other movies of the era, the postman fights back makes up for it with a lot of imagination, quality cinematography and a nicely quirky ambiance. there are some very nifty scenes, good characters and a good eclectic mixture of hong kong talents all coming together to decent effect. all in all, i would recommend this to kung fu and general hong kong action fans. it may not be a stylised classic like the shaw brothers films, or as crowd pleasing as jackie chan or bruce lee, but it is rock solid entertainment.

i am a huge fan of the $5.50 dvd bin at my local walmart. hopefully you have one at your local branch. you can find a bunch of campy flicks, a bunch of trash, and the occasional surprise. this movie is one of the surprises. my friend recently bought this one, and in thinking it would be another cheesy kung-fu laugh riot, i was genuinely surprised at how good it was. i watch a lot of movies, and as a result, i can almost always call how a movie will turn out; and if there's a plot twist, what it will be. not this movie! the directing is brilliant, the plot is awesome, and the fighting is unbelievably inventive. if you see this one sitting around somewhere at a dirt-cheap price, get it! if you see it at full price, i would still recommend it.

freely, from one scene to another, from one story to another, just like when walking, from a shadowy path to an open place, like the wind in the leaves, from a tree to another, how many different sounds ? just like when traveling, people meet and tell their stories and then part forever, who knows ? and just like when walking through these places full of the lost expectations from another time, the human 'thickness' of the world takes the breath away.i saw this movie with friends of mine, not all of them liked it, maybe were they too used to scenario-based and ready-made stories, i don't know. so this movie is for the silly ones who love looking at the sun sparkling on the sea, walking without any hurry in the hills or through the little villages, listening to the growing grass, which tells the stories of those underneath, six feet under, in the warm wind of summer.

in august days/dies d'agost marc recha has given us a sun-saturated catalan documentary-style road movie that's mostly a meandering improvised meditation on brotherhood and reclaiming the dead. the beautiful sometimes large-scale, richly atmospheric 35 mm. landscape images, nice soundtrack and catalan-language narration are enchanting as a mood piece, if one is content with a trajectory that hasn't much momentum and doesn't lead anywhere in particular. filmmaker marc recha and his non-identical twin david are the stars and the narrative is voiced by their younger sister. marc had been researching the life of ramon barnils (1940-2001), a socialist editor who had been a family friend. he felt he was saturated with information and had to take a break. the break turned into making this film, which seeks to capture the mood of the interviews with barnils' associates, thoughts about the spanish civil war, the drought season they were experiencing, the rugged landscape, the recha brothers' affection for each other, swims and suntanned nudity and whatever characters or stories they ran into as they camped out of their van. this leads to pursuit of a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers. in the end david has to go back to barcelona to be with his daughter and marc has to return to his project, and there it ends. i found it fascinating to listen to an extended narration in the catalan language with its blend of spanish and french-sounding words (perhaps linked with provençal?). this isn't a major film but it commands attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its clean visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing around with genres and blending autobiography with fiction and documentary in a fresh and thought-provoking way.an official selection of the 2006 new york film festival at lincoln center.

this is the fourth full-length feature film by marc recha. by the third 'les mans buides' -empty hands- i promised myself not to cut my veins anymore. but this time round the plot is completely different -a kind of homage to ramon barnils (sabadell 1940 - reus 2001) a catalan journalist-. the visuals in the trailer are stunning -a gleaming river bathed in sunlight- and the promise that marc himself would be in front of the camera with his twin brother -none of both professional actors- convinced me at last, six weeks after its release. abandon yourself in this very unusual road/river film. learn almost nothing about ramon barnils but his most poignant legacy: his constant fight against amnesia of what we catalans chose to forget. 'la batalla de l'ebre' -look for battle of the ebro at the wikipedia- was lost not once but twice because after 40 years of silence and 25 years of half-hearted democracy nobody has done much to remember the legitimate side of the spanish civil war and those who fought it. this film is about the lonely people roaming the same places with very little conscience of what took place there 70 years ago. this film is about the landscape.

thank goodness not all dutch people are that ruthless. i think jason is being judged like that by most people, simply because he has a famous father. maybe he's not as great as some of those actors, but he's definitely not as bad as suggested. i watched the movie some years ago, and i actually loved it. i knew jason from other movies and of course robin of sherwood. but i must say i really liked his acting from this movie on. it was really good!during the movie, i actually forgot he was the son of. sean.. who?and if you're a shakespeare lover, i can recommend this movie. i'm sure you'll enjoy it!

what do you mean son of actor, not an actor. you don't become an actor just because your daddy is a superstar---it doesn't work that way, not in uk at any rate.macbeth (this version) is a low budget scottish movie. you can't compare this to the polanski version because polanski has all the budgets in the world. jason acted throughout school, but his big break came in 1985, when he landed the role of robin hood in britain's "robin of sherwood" television series. he has appeared in many films since then, including "shanghai noon" and "lord of the rings 2″. jason has since moved behind the camera, forming the production company, unconditional entertainment. he recently wrapped filming on his latest movie, which stars cuba gooding, jr. and ray winstone. and all this has nothing to do with being the son of sean connery. if you think jason said to sean, "daddy, i wanna be in macbeth movie that they are going to film," and sean said, "sure, son, whatever you say," and made a phone call and got his son the role, you are mistaken. in fact, jason connery is being cut out of his father's will. seeing as how his father is sean connery, that's a big chunk of change jason will be losing out on. the reasoning behind the decision is apparently sean's strong feelings that his only son should learn to provide for himself. the relationship has become fairly strained, with jason even threatening to change his name. ------------------------------------ of being the son of sean connery,"i realize that i'm always going to be compared to my father. there are innuendos all the time. should i spend my whole life justifying myself?" ------------------------------------so stop being a jackass and accuse him of not being able to act just because he is son of sean connery (big deal!).watch jason in bullet to beijing and you'll form a different opinion about his acting ability.

every review i have read so far seems to have missed a crucial point. shakespeare wrote for the accent and the pronunciation just as he did for northerners in other plays. the scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of the language and affects profoundly what is said and the way it is taken. so, listen again and note the difference. the play is well done and the rhythm of the words are so much better than that provided by people using received, polite, well- enunciated english. i am reminded of the time a teacher in a school in leicester, unknowingly, asked me, age 14, to read a piece of walter scott which was written in the tone of the border. i come from the border and when i read it as it should be read it made all the difference.

excellent performance. there still are good actors around! also great directing and photography. very true to shakespear, and a 'must' for all shakespear fans. macbeth (jason connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)he gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting. helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil. if you love death and decay, and shakespears lyrics... this is the one.

what about dj cash money??? this film fails in part by not covering the mid to late 80s. there was only a small mention of dj cheese in 86.also, it's grandmixer "dst", not "dxt"!!!!!

...scratch it. just as african's created rhythms with the jawbone of an ass and virgin islanders welded oil drums into ear pleasing steel bands, so did urban dj's itch to scratch in the pursuit of new methods of creative expression. "scratch" is a wholly unnarrated documentary which will take you to the heart of the hip-hop/rap movement and explore the genesis of turntablism, the art of scratching vinyl, and the ultimate dj/mc contempo entertainment expression. the film reveals some surprisingly intelligent and articulate "scratchers" with startlingly unique abilities in concert and competition where the beat meets the street. good stuff for anyone interested in grass roots or ghetto gutter movements in sound art. (b)

just saw this film at resfest and was floored. i've never been a huge fan of scratching, but this film had me hooked from the getgo. it's listed as a documentary, but never really felt like one. (can't remember the last time i had so much fun watching a documentary). it has a style and an energy that is refreshing, insightful, and never too preachy. the production values were up there too. (shot on film with cool cuts and an amazing soundtrack). overall a smart, entertaining, and enlightening piece.

wow - most of the audience just seemed to shake their heads through much of this documentary at the sheer wizardry displayed on screen.the shift from the early days as a new-york based black-american phenomenon to current days as a racially diverse subculture (and largely west coast-based) is profiled well.the humble turntable is not given the respect of any traditional musical instrument, but it can be so much more versatile and technically complex. these djs take the required skills for any musical instrument - dexterity, rhythm and timing, among others - and apply them to a new technology with several more variables.dj qbert's comment that he pictures what "music" must sound like on advanced planets and then works it out, seemingly silly at first, makes more and more sense as you watch these guys go and spit out a multitude of sounds that no single traditional instrument could ever create!some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain 'stars' and squanders an opportunity to profile the wider hip-hop culture. one film at a time people!

this film is essentially for those who have had little or no introduction to hip-hop, specifically turntableism, as was the case with the director before he started this film. it was cool to have it focus on the bay more than expected, because ny is always getting all the credit, but comin from the bay the q-bert worship is a little out of control. this film didn't introduce anything new to me, but it did change my opinion in that going into it i was sketchy about the prospect of giving the tables the distinction of being a bona fide instrument. this film ought to convince anyone that it's right up there with the viola and clavichord.

wonderfully funny, awe-inspiring feature on the pioneers of turntablism. dj shadow and q-bert are amazing in this terrific documentary. check out just about every major dj crediting their getting in to scratch thanks to herbie hancock's post-bop classic 'rockit', and archival footage of some of the most complex and mind-blowing turntable routines of all time.

scratch is a documentary about djs and their art of scratching. from that one line description of the film you would have no idea how entertaining and educational this little film is. it is a joyous and vibrant celebration of a cool subculture which is little known. it's filled with great underground hip hop music and you get to see some top djs (e.g. dj q-bert, dj shadow, and mix master mike from the beastie boys) showing off their stuff. going into the film i wasn't sure that "scratching" can really be called an art form, or that the turntable can be viewed as an instrument in its own right. scratch completely changed my mind on these points. what these guys do with their turntables is truly amazing--it is definitely some kind of art--and the turntable, if you know how to use it, can be transformed into an instrument that you can "play," as much as a drum or a guitar. and you even get a lesson on the basics of scratching from dj q-bert (e.g. how to use the fader to get different sound effects). all these djs in their own way were inspired to take up the art of scratching after watching herbie hancock perform his song "rock it" (you remember that song, don't you?) live at the grammys. what got their attention was not hancock himself but his dj and his scratching. not only is scratch about scratching, but it does some "scratching" of its own thanks to the creative way in which this documentary is shot and edited. there are moments where clips are quickly "rewound" and then "forwarded" several times, which mirrors (in the film medium) what happens when a dj quickly moves the record on his turntable back and forth while using his fader (that "wicka-wicka-wicka" sound). whether you're a fan of hip hop or not, you can count on scratch to give you a very enjoyable night at the movies. after seeing it, i had an itch to go buy a turntable of my own. and i mean this as a compliment.

being a huge fan of hip-hop and turntablism to begin with, i always knew i would like this film. however, i wasn't prepared for just how good the documentary actually is. it covers almost all the important aspects of the only element of hip-hop which has been there from the very start. the "story" begins in the early 70's, and follows the evolution of turntablism as an art from up until early 2000 (turntablism aficionados will point this out as significant).the editing is nigh on perfect throughout the film. aside from the excellent visual "scratch" techniques which they used, the rapid cutting between interviews and the stock footage is excellent, giving the film pace when it is needed. the sound editing is also very good, with some nice sweeping sounds being used to help with transitions.the absence of a narrator was also welcome. we aren't taken by the hand through the story, and as a result the audience is able to make their own assumptions easier. each dj adds another side to the story, and it is so interesting to hear about the unknown stars of hip-hop, especially those who were there when hip-hop was being shunned left, right and centre by the music business.although there are many excellent things about this film, i do have a few gripes. the biggest of these is the absence of several notable djs, such as ca$hmoney and jazzy jeff, and also djs from outside america, such as scratch perverts and dj noise. however, if you watch the commentary on the dvd (something which i highly recommend), producer and director go in to great depth about how they regret not being able to feature them. the deleted scenes contain many interviews with ca$hmoney, jazzy jeff and the scratch perverts.this is definitely the best documentary i've seen on hip-hop culture and music. it does stop short of showing the true potential of turntablism; for that i highly recommend checking out the dmc and itf videos. however, that is a minor quibble. i highly recommend this movie, not least for the phat soundtrack, with excellent music throughout. (9/10)

the omission of jazzy jeff, the creator of the chirp and transformer scratch, raised a few eyebrows, but it's good to see he made it to the extras of the dvd after all. with scratch, doug pray, who previously chronicled the grunge phenomenon of the '90s in hype (1996), made an excellent documentary about the world of the hip-hop dj and the evolution of turntablism. his latest documentary, infamy (2005), explores contemporary american graffiti culture. after a couple of viewings four years ago, my dvd had been gathering dust ever since, but recently i watched it again and besides the subject material, i was surprised how well-shot and edited this documentary actually is. an immensely enjoyable soundtrack as well and not just talking heads, but lots of music, old school footage, parties, break dancing, you name it. one of the best things about the film, is that it mainly examines where the art of turntablism is today (in 2001 that is), without disregarding the pioneers of course. good stuff.camera obscura --- 8/10

i watched this movie a long time ago, but i've always loved it. the story is about a young girl, sally o'moyne who finds out at a young age that when she prays to st. anne, her prayers are answered, hence her missing lunch pail and a mean neighbor who tattles on her and she prays, that someone should give him a black eye for tattling. well, a minute later something hits him and he has a black eye. sally then believes in the power of prayer and decides to use that power for good. she is well known and loved around the neighborhood as she has copybooks/journals filled with all her friends requests to st. anne.meanwhile, a local boy returns home from college (i believe) and sally is awestruck at how much he's grown-up. sally has a huge crush on him, but is so shy. should she use her power of prayer to st. anne for her own selfish desire or just watch as the most popular girls in school try to snare the man of her dreams? this is a fun filled movie with a grandfather who is so charming and irish, brother's who are hilariously annoying and a sworn irish neighbor-enemy who spars with grand-pop on an everyday basis. he has his own story of wanting to buy the o'moynes property which is a little house in the middle of two huge apartment complexes (his own), in other words, the o'moynes house is an eye-sore to his lovely buildings.this movie is definitely worth a watch and is good enough and rare enough to add to your movie collection. i hope you enjoy!

this film centered on a young lady who makes prayers to help her family and friends when they encounter difficulties in life. it made me think of other movies like the "song of bernadette" and "francis of assisi" and has a very strong catholic faith influence in the film. ann blyth is very charming as first, the catholic school student and then later as a young woman who buys a statue of saint anne (which is the name of the street that i live on, by the way) and makes many prayers for the saint's intercession whenever problems come up in her life. frances bavier (aunt bea from the andy griffith show) and edmund gwenn (from miracle on 34th street) play relatives of her. a local priest of mine used to say that my sister resembled ann blyth and the both of them have the same first and middle names. a nice good family film that came from an era when life was a bit more simpler.

wonderful family film that should be a staple at christmas time. it's a mystery to me why it isn't. a true lost film that i first encountered, flickering away on my old 19" black and white rca, when the million dollar movie was still in vogue on channel 9 in new york city. this rudolph mate directed fantasy should be nestled under everyone's christmas tree. but it has never been released on home video. too bad. i believe i saw part of it on amc a few years ago, before they cut many of their older films from the rotation. tcm should take up the slack and play it at easter or on christmas eve. any movie with santa, aunt bee, the hostess cupcake lady, and an actor with the first name king, can't be bad. ann blyth as "sally" is a bundle of energy. during her school years, she rushes over to the chapel to pray for st. ann to help and give guidance to her mixed-up and financially strapped family. it works. so, after she graduates, she places a statue of st. ann in her own bedroom. at one point the entire o'moyne residence is moved to another address. i think this was done to put an end to a neighbor dispute between the o'moynes and the dastardly fellow next door. blyth is cute as a button. edmund gwen can play the reclusive grandfather in his sleep. all-in-all, this is a satisfying movie experience.

this is a family comedy -- in the very best senses of the term. uncomplicatedly about faith and family, ann blyth, with the help of everybody's favorite grandpa, edmund gwenn, gets divine help in lifting the o'moyne's above the would-be vengeance schemes of goldtooth mccarthy (john mcintire). pure fun.

dan dailey gives a sincere and colorful performance as the great dizzy dean. his handling of the character is very true to life and captures the flavor of dean's background and limited education. the film of course centers around dizzy deans rise to fame and his sudden trip to the sidelines with an injury he chose to ignore, much to his regret. his wife is splendidly portrayed by joanna dru who gives a very down to earth quality to the woman who loved and supported the ballplayer who rose to a "dizzying height" so quickly. the portrayal of dizzy's later career as a sportscaster is honest and unflinching, reflecting his troubles which stemmed from his poor education and his colorful language both on and off the air. dizzy was quite a character and daily has breathed life into his story with admirable skill. if you enjoyed this film, i recommend the comedy "kid from left field" (1953) wherein daily plays a down and out has-been ballplayer idolized by his young son (billy chapin). daily again fleshes out a ballplayer in a completely satisfying manner. i heartily recommend pride of st. louis to baseball fans everywhere.

in a sport that prizes quirkiness and treasures it's characters, one of the greatest of them from the 1930s was pitcher dizzy dean. he was so colorful a personality he was probably elected to the baseball hall of fame on the strength of that as opposed to his pitching statistics. after all part of the dean story is that early end to his career.in the pride of st. louis dan dailey successfully captures the character of dizzy dean, at least the dean i remember. i'm not old enough to remember him pitching, but i do remember him broadcasting baseball game of the week during the 1960s. for that's part of the dean story as well, being a pioneer broadcaster on radio and later television. now that announcers are in the hall of fame, there's no question dizzy belongs there.jerome herman dean was one of a tribe of sharecropper's kids who had very little schooling, but an amazing talent for throwing a baseball at blinding speed. in fact he had a younger brother paul dean who was a pretty good pitcher himself.richard crenna plays paul in this film and it's one of his earliest film roles. paul dean in real life was a quiet retiring sort who's career was also cut short by injuries. because of that crenna isn't given much to work with. during the dean heyday, sportswriters tried to pin the nickname of daffy on paul, but it never took. joanne dru, taking a break from playing, western gals in gingham dresses and corsets is first rate as the wise, patient, and understanding patricia nash who met and married dizzy while he was playing for houston in the texas league. in the 1937 all star game dizzy started for the national league. facing cleveland's earl averill, dean was hit on the foot by a line drive smack at him. refusing to listen to medical advice, dean came back to pitch too early. he'd broken a big toe and put too much of a strain on his arm. he was never the same pitcher and his refusal to accept that is part of the story. had he had a career of say ten to fifteen years who knows what pitching statistics he might have rolled up. dean was the next to last pitcher to win 30 games in 1934 and after denny mclain(who was something of a character himself)did it 1968 it hasn't been done since.dean went into broadcasting and while he was not the first former player to go into the broadcast booth, his colorful game descriptions made him an instant hit. he started broadcasting for the other st. louis team, the browns, and the browns were a pretty miserable team with not much to cheer about. dean became a star attraction there.of course part of the dean story is the trouble he got into because of his lack of education and his colorful way of expressing himself on the air. that's part of the story i won't go into, but in the film it's handled with tact and humility and your eyes might moisten if you tend to the sentimental.a fine baseball film, a real tribute to an american success story.

fred was such a great show.it was simple but somehow very addicting.i can still remember the days when i'd watch this on kids wb saturdays ,but then kids wb did the unforgivable.kids wb became like that older relative that tries to act "hip" and "funky fresh".*shudder*they became like that relative who tries to act all cool ,but the attempt is a cheesy disaster.they pulled coconut fred's fruit salad inland and all the other good shows to put on some of the most pointless shows i've ever seen in my life(johnny test).the only thing that keeps me watching kwb anymore is the occasional bits of the old shows and the anime on 4kids.it was such a huge mistake to pull this show off of the schedule.this brings me back to my first point... bring it back!!!

"coconut fred's fruit salad island!" is a hilarious show that is on saturday mornings on wb. it stars coconut fred and all of his friends on the island, and every episode is a very funny misadventure of theirs. most of the time, it is because of coconut fred's trouble making antics which makes it funny, and other stuff going on on the island at the same time. the humor is great and nobody on the island is very bright at all, which adds it being as amusing as it is. i don't think this could be funnier. the voice talents of the characters are magnificently superior and are exaggerated, which adds to the show's hilarity. if this is ever on dvd, i'm getting it a.s.a.p!strongly recommended for a good laugh.

fans of apocalyptic movies will savor this well-made low-budget thriller that is essentially a remake of the 1951 george pal classic "when worlds collide." a comet is headed for a near-collision with earth, and when his fellow scientists disregard his warnings of doom, eccentric scientist peter crawford (dennis hopper) gathers a group of private investors to secretly construct an underground sanctuary.the story unfolds through the eyes of muscle-bound gulf-war veteran jake lowe (peter onorati)who inadvertently discovers crawford's hidden sanctuary and then decides that crawford is wrong for keeping his project hidden from the rest of humanity. as the comet approaches, the subject of who should live and who should die makes for interesting drama.while the special effects are not in the same league, i enjoyed the story more than i did spielberg's war of the worlds, because i feel this screenplay is better. some suspension of scientific reality is required, but it's worthwhile for the development of a good story. i highly recommend this film to fans of the genre.

for a movie shot in 18 days and a budget less than 2 million, this little movie that could deserves a 'best we could' award. interesting premise (aside from the usual meteor stuff) with solid perfs by a cast of familiar faces. 2 thumbs up. advice to the other reviewer: don't be afraid to say you liked something.

a £3.50 dvd can be a gamble and this was one that sort of paid off.a decent saturday night type movie that entertains if you gloss over the obvious plot flaws. special effects are a bit few and far between with some repetition (and why does london always look as if it's in the 60's ?)if it had the budget of, say, armageddon then i'm sure it would have performed better at the box office as the story is quite a good one.overall, tycus is consigned to b movie history but if you see it for £3.50 then it's worth buying.

this is the first american film i have seen at this year and i think it will be the greatest one because of the feeling . as a teenage singer in america,aaron is not as pop as before,most americans i met said his song is fake and that he even didn't know how to rap.but attention,everyone,he is a kid,how many people can understand him.being a pop fan is difficult,and being a pop star is more difficult.i think this time aaron(jd) has shows something real to us.and i think people should learn to understand each other. at another hand,i like the music in the film very much.i remember the first song appeared in the film is "saturday night" and it also include some aaron's real live show,and the second one is "one better",so i think if you enjoy this film,maybe you'll be a pop fan,too. at last,i hope you will have a great time^^ a voice from a chinese boy.

i love aaron carter but even i expected pop star to be predictable, but i was so wrong! aaron carter was really funny in it and a great actor! also the actress who played jane was a brilliant actress! every one who i no who watched it loved it!the music in it was also really good!the my favourite lines from the film is "you cant send me to a public school mom! im a celebridee!!" and "take your time, it'l come to you!"although the endings kind of cheesy,all the good chick flicks do! this film is great, and a proper good chick flick, that i can watch over and over again!

bergman's skammen is one of the most realistic depictions of war ever set to film. this is not an action film by any means, though the pacing is faster and there is most action than in most any other bergman movie. nor is this a romanticisation of war or patriotism, unlike most war movies. in fact, the gritty realism and the deliberate ambiguity of the character's loyalties has a very contemporary feel.skammen is a darkly lit movie, that should be watched at night, so as to let it work it's magic. many of the effects are conveyed indirectly, but so effectively that some scenes compete in intensity to a contemporary, insanely huge budget film like saving private ryan. of course, the action in skammen is on a much smaller scale but it is impressive none-the-less.while the film-making style feels contemporary, the setting of the film feels timeless and placeless. the war-torn countryside, and even the yet intact provincial hamlet could be anywhere, any time. and this film is not so much about specific historical events, with specific names and dates, but about universal human reactions to adversity and chaos.the acting in skammen, though typically impressive from ullman and sydow, is not of primary importance in this film, unlike most other bergman movies. through much of the film they are spectators, much as we are. bergman has the war imposed on them, and through them on the audience, and their reaction is perhaps what any of our reactions might be.highly recommended. 10/10

i don't recall a film which so deftly shows the emotional destruction of war, as mirrored in one single marital relationship. the focus of the film is the union between ullman and von sydow--the two are in every scene. through the course of the film, they experience a role reversal--one has the strength of survival and the other is reduced to emotional escapism through dreams. both will lose a measure of humanity, but one to a greater degree than the other. the characters and the viewer go through periods of fluctuation in regards to closeness--the camera pulls out and away, sound disappears, words are lost, only for the camera to return to painterly closeups of its facially expressive stars. the confusion and fluctuation may make this film hard for some viewers, but this is all purposeful under the master hand of bergman. i think the use of a "fake" war makes the film timeless, as relevant today as ever before, and by focusing on the human relationship through war, makes the film relevant to everyone. the pair could be anyone. the film is not grounded in place or time, but rather in emotion. a unique and effective war film, unlike any other. bergman's films are virtuosic in presenting human relationships--that he would bring this to a war film is masterful.

when liv ullman's character says, "i feel like i'm in someone else's dream and they're going to be ashamed when they wake up," she is referring not only to being an unwilling player in society's war games, she is referring to being an ignorant participant in life itself. at the film's end, when she says that she had a dream that she had a child and she was trying to take care of it, but she forgot something else, the implication is that she has forgotten what she has learned in the war she's just survived, that like her own mother before her, she will be unable to pass on any vital lessons to her own child. and, therefore, the cycle of the shame of ignorance will continue...ad infinitum...

how is it possible to like and dislike the same movie?the plot is very much like that jody foster thing, sommersby, only not as good. nicole was great....jude was adequate. they didn't give him many lines...is there a reason for that? generally, he's a pretty good actor. she's so elegant, his character is so country bumpkin. it makes one wonder what they see in each other.romance between two such was only successful in lady chatterly's lover.i think the dislike comes about because the movie is too long. they could have told the story in two hours.the story is good. good locations, good filming. the character actors were great.

i really enjoyed this minghella epic, thought not quite so much as "the english patient" (a modern-day classic). the first 20 minutes or so feel awkward, but as inman (jude law) embarks on the journey back to his love ava (nicole kidman), the film picks up in leaps and bounds and it becomes a very memorable, thoughtful romantic drama. apparently it is fashionable to hate kidman at the moment, but i don't agree at all, and she does well here. i actually think that the romance between inman and ada is weakly developed in the script (they really don;t get much screen time together to develop a relationship), but law and kidman give it their all and convince. ada's journey is the crux of the film- she becomes a strong woman who can bear almost anything. zellweger at first seems all wrong as ruby, but she grows on you after all and sparkles in many of her later scenes. the film has beautiful photography and set design, but never really captures the true feel of a period piece. jack white, in particular, has long straggly hair and a pale rocker's complexion that look completely out of place with the setting. cillian murphy fans will enjoying seeing the talented irish actor in an early bit part, and natalie portman actually proves she can act in probably the film's most striking sequence. it's a pity that in "the other boleyn girl" she's so inadequate.

it's initial premise is based on the american civil war but it's ultimately a love story. we start at the beginning of the war where the main characters (kidman & law) are obviously aware of each other and there's an obvious attraction, they have a passionate kiss on the day he leaves for the war. the main thrust of this film is for law's character to return to kidman's and his struggles to achieve that and her struggles to survive until he returns. the reason it fails to convince is that we don't see enough of this relationship before law's character leaves for battle - it's difficult to believe the premise that 2 people yearn for each other so much given they've had so little contact. everything else is just about fine, renee zellweger and her incumbent father and his entourage are lovely additions as is the threat from the gang chasing deserters. sure it's a long film but it does hold the interest and the cinematography is great. an honourable attempt that doesn't quite make it but worth a watch nonetheless.

it's been awhile since i've seen cold mountain,bit i do knew that i enjoyed it immensely.though it does take place during the the last days of american civil war,it's not really a war movie.it's more of a romance/drama.and it works.mainly because of the performances.usually i don't like nicole kidman,but i liked here.i thought she was very convincing in her role.i liked rene zelwegger,as well,who i'm not usually a fan of.jude law is good as usual.the supporting cast.there are some great supporting performances her,too numerous too mention.there's also some breathtaking scenery in the film.and there are also a number of very nice musical pieces as well.the story is sad and tinged with tragedy but it s a beautifully done well told story.for me,cold mountain is an 8/10

watching "cold mountain" gave me the impression that its director, anthony minghella, was deliberately trying to outdo himself and the own film of his' that he was trying to beat was the virtually impeccable "the english patient" from 1996. comparing the two movies, the premise is quite similar. we have a passionate love affair between two people set in a turbulent time of war and they end up treating the war more or less as a disturbance in the background while trying to find themselves back in each other's arms again. the primary plot differences are that nicole kidman's character is not married, jude law's is a deserter, and the conflict is the american civil war."cold mountain" is, story-wise, more watered down and mellow than say "the english patient" and it's more on the level for people who want a simple love story with some kind of an exterior turbulence causing a problem. it is a shorter film, which is a plus for people with less patience. however, it's not as spectacular or original or genuinely gripping as "the english patient." my *only* big complaint about "cold mountain" is, astonishingly, the love affair between the characters of inman (jude law) and ada monroe (nicole kidman). amazingly, their love was the least interesting thing in the picture. they don't have a real relationship; we don't feel any real passion coming from them and the passion that we do see is more physical than emotional. i was more fascinated by the friendship between nicole kidman and oscar-winner renee zellwegger and also jude law's travels across country dodging vigilantes and enemy soldiers. if minghella had strengthened the importance of the love story, then he would have had, i feel, a better picture.of course, the movie is entertaining even if the love story is uninteresting. the civil war sequences are absolutely great; they are of the modern tradition that show war as horrible and dehumanizing. the re-enactment of the petersburg campaign, in which tons of explosives was detonated from underground and then followed by a hand-to-hand battle is horrifying. minghella does not shy from showing blood and gore in an artistic and sensible manner, and he's not afraid to show casualties of innocence and life in these scenes. there are moments where women as well as men are killed, oftentimes by crossfire. and there's more to it. just the sound design of the movie generates tension. there's a scene where inman and another deserter make themselves a meal by sawing off the head of a dead cow. we don't see the slicing, but the sound effects of blade going through bone are sickening.lastly, i must congratulate the cast for the performances. jude law was terrific in the movie and deserved the academy award nomination he received. i feel that nicole kidman deserved one as well, even though her character was a bit shallow. renee zellwegger had the most personality and screen-stealing atmosphere. and then there's just the bit parts that also really work to complete this stylistic world recreating a horrible time in america's past.maybe "cold mountain" would have been better as a war picture, but it most certainly would have been spectacular like "the english patient" if its love story had been powered up and made more passionate by the screenwriters and director anthony minghella. as it is, it's a most enjoyable picture, i wasn't bored by it, and i recommend it. i just say that its love story - though a central plot point - is a little more mellow than it needs to be and all the stuff around it was what really worked.

"how can a name, not even a real name, break your heart?" here's how. there have been few film versions of a celebrated novel that have done better justice to their source material than anthony minghella's movie of charles frazier's cold mountain. if you've read the book you will be able to feel most of the major scenes soul shakingly recreated. i personally cried numerous times while reading the novel and spent much of the evening watching the film through tears. astounding scope, beautiful words, great acting and great music. in the interview on the dvd accompanying the film minghella talks about the multiple layers of the story. all of them work. one of the best films i've seen and an invitation to one of the greatest novels of the last ten years.

i went into this film thinking i wasn't going to like it, but hoping to be surprised, but this, much like the film, ended up being bleak and hopeless. but don't get me wrong, minghella delivers every bit of a grand epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what comes as just that, then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of the better films of the year in their opinion. the acting is of a high quality and will most likely come away with a trinity of oscar noms for law, kidman and zellweger, even though portman's few scenes may be the most powerful in the film. the locations are beautiful and minghella has an eye for a good shot.however, for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going willingly may come away disappointed mainly due to minghella and his adaptation. the film is so utterly bleak it makes for what i consider to be a punching bag epic which is a film that that tries to hit hard with emotion but does so to such an extreme and so often that during the film i didn't have the time to emotionally invest, or hadn't recovered from a previous blow, and it became unrealistic and consequently too difficult to really care, not to mention predictable. overall the "cold mountain" almost left me too drained to even think back on the good aspects of the film, as all i remember is death, which may have been an original motif but ends up being the focus instead of the characters.

i watched cold mountain and the english patient again this weekend. the former is a civil war melodrama about inman (jude law), a confederate soldier who deserts the army to return to ada monroe (nicole kidman) a girl he barely knows. both films were lovingly directed by anthony minghella who does an exceptional job. although, cold mountain is very good it could have been a great movie with the right casting and less folksy, backwoods dialog.romantic epics need a convincing heroine. the english patient, had kristin scott thomas who was perfectly cast as the smart, alluring and beautiful katherine clifton. the main problem with cold mountain is ada who seems silly and dim-witted and lacks that quality would make you believe that inman could become obsessed after one kiss. as an actress kidman has a limited range, she usually plays stern-faced women who face adversity with stoicism. kidman was also too old to play the ingénue and law's love interest. the film needed a young actress who could play charming, warm and vulnerable. for someone who was supposedly enduring hardship and near starvation she seemed ridiculously well-fed and over-dressed. kidman was so impeccably groomed that it looked like she had spent three hours getting made-up for each scene. michele pfieffer in her younger days could have played the part perfectly. even natalie portman would have been an improvement.renee zelleweger was more appropriately attired but her animated performance chewed the scenery but maybe she was trying to compensate for kidman. jude law was in his own silent movie in the odysseus role, but played his part well. ray winstone was excellent as the london/southern villain.during the civil war, people were probably not very well educated by today's standards and maybe they did speak in monosyllables. however if you watch bbc adaptations of dickens, austen or mrs. gaskill everyone is articulate. maybe this is unrealistic but it would improved my entertainment.

i just saw the dvd and loved it. in particular, i thought the director and jude and nicole did an amazing job with the kiss between inman and ada just before inman left. it was the most romantic kiss i've ever seen in a film. i thought it was crucial for setting the tone for the rest of the movie; it managed to make it believable that inman and ada would walk/wait, respectively, for each other for all that time without ever really having had a relationship. i thought the film managed this crucial plot point much better than the book itself. i'm sure many of you will be quick to name other film kisses which best this one, but this one is it for me! jude and nicole had showed incredible chemistry in the far too few scenes they had together.

well, i expected, for all the hype and oscar nominations, an epic civil war drama (& something with the "magnitude" of the "english patient" given the same director). this film isn't of epic stature, but it turns out i was relieved it wasn't. it's a love story in the midst of the horrors of war where young men are sent off to fight, deserters are tracked and killed, and the women and children at home are left to fend for themselves while the men are gone.anyway i thought nicole kidman and rene zelleweger were pretty decent and not knowing much about jude law, he was all right, also. it seems rene z. had the more fun part of the 3 leads and was able to smartly play a spirited, feisty downhome woman with much aplomb. also for me it was good to see actress, kathy baker...someone's who's talent needs to be more recognized/acknowledged.this film is worth seeing this -- i'm can't articulate why really, but maybe because it is a slice of americana. 

this movie worked for me because i see this movie as an exact opposite of 'gone with the wind.' farm owners instead of plantation owners. scarlett fights and connives for what she wants; ada gets depressed and turns inside herself until ruby, (renee zellweger,) shows up to save the day. sort of, in a round about way. deserters instead of officers trying to get back to their families, the lists goes on and on. even the love story was opposite. if this is what the producer and writers were trying to get across it succeeded with me. there are only two things i didn't like about the movie, the rest i thought was well done and i liked it enough to recommend it to friends. first, i couldn't see the attraction between inman, (jude law), and ada, (nicole kidman,) as being strong enough for inman to desert to get back to her. inman said he only had written to her a few times where ada wrote to him almost constantly. second, something or someone getting killed or dying in almost every scene was a little much. i must say it was full of action because of that, but after about the second scene i knew something or someone was going to die in the next scene. i like to be surprised by the next scene, not know what is going to happen before it does.i thought all the acting was very well done, with zellweger the best. she deserved the credit she got for it. i thought she played the part of the hillbilly girl very well. she must have done her homework on the part. zellweger even said in the movie that she was smarter than people thought she was. i think that was true. law did well with his part with all he had to go through to get back to kidman. it must have been a lot stronger love to go through all that than i thought it was. now he showed a lot of emotion in his face during his trials. kidman's part may have had something to do with the fact i chose her performance after the other two. except when she was depressed she didn't show much emotion, i don't know if that is how the part was written or if that is how she perceived the part. she still did a good job, i just thought the other two were better. i liked the scene with the zellweger, kidman and the rooster, even though it was one of those scenes i mentioned above. i thought the 'home guard' was exactly as they probably were back then. even though we don't hear much about them they were a part of that time. i thought the scenery was beautiful. the movie had everything needed to be a good historical romance.

i have not managed to completely block out this film from memory even though it has been two years since i've seen it.don't get me wrong - i have long forgotten the main story line - the relationship between kidman and law, that made no impression on me but it was the torture scenes in the film that really struck me. i cried for about two hours straight after wards. it had never previously occurred to me how people, in war time, could take advantage of something as pure as a mother's love. we see several examples of this here - in both the scenes with natalie portman and with the mother with her fingers in the fence for keeping her son hidden at home. i was shocked at these scenes and will probably never watch the film again as a consequence because the scenes even now are perfectly clear in my mind. however, i am glad i watched the film simply because it has made me more aware to the horrors of war and the horrible cruelty that mankind can inflict on it's own. the blonde albino character has been top of my list of most evil bad guy ever since i saw the film. his horrible sneer and lack of any human feeling for the people he tortured really hit a nerve with me. at one point i wanted to get up in the cinema and kill him myself (see the movie pushed me over the edge of reason,it only occurred to me afterward that i'd only be hitting a big screen - that shows the film's power and intensity at least). i recommend the film for it's sheer experience not for the entwined love story but for the manner in which it depicts war without needing a battlefield.

in cold mountain, north colorado, near to the period of the american civil war, the reverend monroe (donald sutherland) arrives in the small town with his daughter, the shy ada monroe (nicole kidman), due to health reasons. ada meets the also shy inman (jude law), and they fall in love with each other. with the beginning of the war, inman becomes a soldier, and his great support to stay alive is the wish to see ada in cold mountain again. meanwhile, ada meets ruby thewes (renée zellweger), a survivor of the war, who helps her in the farm and becomes her best friend. the story alternates present and past situations, disclosing a beautiful romance. i liked this film a lot. having names such as philip seymour hoffman, natalie portman and giovanni ribisi in the supporting cast, a magnificent direction of anthony minghella and seven indications to the oscar, this movie does not disappoint. my remark is that there are some very important scenes deleted in the story and presented in the dvd. at least one of them, which show what happens with sara, her baby and the three dead bodies in her farm, should not be deleted as it was. my vote is nine.title (brazil): 'cold mountain'

anthony minghela's (writer/director) cold mountain is a carefully constructed, sensitive, and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederacy during the civil war, which deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner. while it accurately depicts the brutality and inhumanity of that war, it also does something that many films related to this period to not handle as effectively - cold mountain studies the southern context from the inside out, and portrays changes among the non-slave owning common people wrought by the war. and, almost uniquely, cold mountain does not over-generalize southerners, northerners or anybody else.the film surfs through genres as needed - never presenting a dull moment. it is a romance, a war story, an action-adventure and historical fiction, all nicely woven into one.the story centers on inman (jude law) and ada monroe (nicole kidman), who are smitten with each other for very simple reasons. as this young romance begins to bud, inman enlists in the confederate army, taking with him a book ada has given him and a photograph of her. ada's character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third person perspective, but the story is clearly hers from the beginning to the end. ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister. she begins the film as a daddy's girl skilled in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives were expected to learn. in other words, as she admits to ruby thewes (renee zellweger), she is a master of everything useless.ada's father passes on, and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself. with no experience of this sort, she struggles, and survives by holding the memory of inman close to her heart. ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father. ruby has all the skills and abilities ada lacks, and as they become inseparable business partners, they grow to love one another as best friends. inman's experience is radically different, but something of a mirror image. during his participation in the war, he sees many friends killed for causes they don't really believe in, and decides to desert. nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to cold mountain and ada, and most of those he meets die.the bulk of the film takes place during inman's long walk, following both of the protagonists as they live, learn, grow and change. an on-going act of will borne of desperation preserves their intense passionate love. for inman, it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation. for ada, it is very much the same thing, but also a symbol and remnant of the old south - a world which is rapidly passing.the cinematography is powerful and breathtaking. there are beautiful shots of appalachian landscapes which give the film a strong sense of history. the script and editing are also extremely strong - emphasizing the broad class and educational differences reflected in the ante bellum southern dialects of the middle and lower classes. with the cast of this film, nothing short of perfection should be expected. and the cast, mostly, rises to the occasion. my one criticism, however, relates to the accents adopted by kidman and law's characters. an australian and a brit probably should not be expected to accurately reproduce southern american speech, but there are a few occasions where these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting vocal slips. i admit my oversensitivity to this, and can say with some confidence that it won't bother most people. zellweger's performance is outstanding and she creates a character i will remember into my senescence.very highly recommended.

this movie moved me more than i was expecting, and i was fully prepared to cry. the acting mainly carried this film, with superb performances from jude law, nicole kidman and renee zellweger, as well as the supporting cast. these actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they lingered the remainder of the night with me, and i had trouble shaking this war drama. the costumes and cinematography were also magical, but didn't get carried away with themselves. they didn't take focus, but added to the whole effect. cold mountain could never become my favorite movie, as that title will always belong to the english patient, but it's in the top five. the story itself was well developed, and stayed fairly unpredictable. i did not find myself guessing what line came next. a heart-wrenching story about humanity and war. in fact, this movie was so strongly real that it was barely noticeable it took place in the 19th century. it seemed to apply to all times.

lifeforce was one of cannon films' biggest flops. it received mostly bad reviews and did nothing to help director tobe hooper's career in the wake of the spielberg/poltergeist controversy. all of this is unfortunate, because lifeforce is actually a really great movie. it is supremely entertaining, moves along at a fast pace and features some of the most outrageously over-the-top direction, production, performances and special effects ever to explode across the screen! it must have looked bizarre on paper: the producers of the delta force, the screenwriter of alien, the director of the texas chainsaw massacre, the composer of breakfast at tiffany's, the special effects wizards of star wars... audiences were not ready for this demented exercise in weirdness.what more do you want??? we got an alien spaceship full of giant bats! we got a sexy, naked space vampiress sucking out people's souls! we got exploding bodies! we got zombies! we got possession! we got an s&m interrogation! we got the entire city of london on fire! it's dracula meets night of the living dead meets quartermass and the pit meets earthquake. it's quite possibly the single most outrageous horror/sci-fi/comedy/action/disaster/erotic/apocalyptic epic ever unleashed, that is, if there are any other ones out there.try watching this movie while chemically altered. perhaps then you'll understand. a genuinely f***ed up experience, and one of director tobe hooper's most underrated movies. maybe one day, it will find its audience.

danny boyle was not the first person to realise that zombies can run like the clappers. that honour belongs to lifeforce, which is, of course, the greatest naked space vampire zombies from halley's comet running amok in london end-of-the-world movie ever made. tobe hooper may have made a lot of crap, but for this deliriously demented epic sci-fi horror he deserves a place among the immortals. plus it offers space vampire mathilda may, the best thing to come out of france since simone simon, spending the entire movie naked. which she does very, very well. just bear in mind that while she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence anyone on earth has ever encountered, she's also "totally alien to this planet and our life form and totally dangerous." it's a pitch meeting i'd have loved to have sat in on: astronauts from the british space program find three naked humanoid alien life forms inside a giant 150-mile long artichoke/umbrella shaped spaceship hidden in the tail of halley's comet filled with giant desiccated bats and bring them back to earth with near apocalyptic results as they proceed to drain the population of london of their lifeforce amid much nudity, whirlpools of thunder and spit your coffee across the room direlogue ("i've been in space for six months, and she looks perfect to me." "assume we know nothing, which is understating the matter." "don't worry, a naked woman is not going to get out of this complex."). oh, and we'll get the writers of alien and blue thunder to write it with uncredited rewrites by the writer of mark of the devil, the sex thief and eskimo nell and the director of the jonestown monster. sounds like a winner, here's $22m  have fun. and they do, they do.true, there's enough promise in the raw material to have made something genuinely creepy and thought-provoking (at a time when aids hysteria was approaching its height, a sexually transmitted 'plague' offers ample opportunity for allegory), but in the hands of the go-go boys at cannon, what could have been another quatermass and the pit quickly turns instead to be more plan 10 from outer space. it's full-to-bursting with delirious inanity, be it frank finlay's hilarious death scene ("here i go!"), peter firth's grand entrance ("i'm colonel caine." "from the sas?" discreetly shouts michael gothard across a room full of reporters: "gentlemen, that last remark was not for publication. this is a d-notice situation" he replies to the surprisingly obliging pressmen), the security guards offering mathilda may's naked space vampire a nice biscuit to stop her escaping, reanimated bodies exploding into dust all over people, the sweaty prime minister sucking the life out of his secretary and london filling up with zombie nuns, stockbrokers and joggers as the city gets its most comprehensive on screen trashing since mrs gorgo lost junior at battersea funfair and went on the rampage. and that's not mentioning the "this woman is a masochist! an extreme masochist!" scene or the great stereophonic echo effect on the male vampire's "it'll be a lot less terrifying if you just come to me" line while a lead-stake wielding peter firth adopts his best action man voice to reply "i'll do just that!" in one scene alone you have a possessed patrick stewart embodying the female in our deeply confused astronaut hero's mind, steve "i-never-got-over-playing-charlie-manson" railsback and his amazing dancing eyebrows in full-on "helta-skelta!" mode trying to resist the temptation to kiss him, the inimitable aubrey morris (the only man who makes freddie jones look restrained) playing the home secretary sir percy heseltine as a kind of demented brian rix, peter firth (one of those actors who always looks like he must have been a doctor who around the time no-one was watching it anymore) hamming up the blasé public school macho in the hope that no-one will ever see it and the peerless reaction shots of john hallam as the male nurse who keeps on opening the door mid-psychic-tornado to bring in more drugs. as if they needed any more in this film. it's just a shame that frank finlay's mad-haired scientist who isn't qualified to certify death on alien life forms (a role originally intended for klaus kinski) missed out on the action in that one.no matter how mad you think the film is, it still manages to get madder still, whether it be a zombie pathologist ("he too needs feeding") exploding all over the home secretary's suit, patrick stewart's blood and entrails forming a naked mathilda may or the space vampires turning st paul's cathedral into the world's biggest laser-show to transport human souls from the london underground to their geostationary mother ship. i loved every gloriously insane moment. in it's own truly unique way, this might be the greatest film ever made.the dvd offers the original 116-minute version that opened in the uk rather than the heavily edited 101-minute us version, which not only offers much more hilarity for your dollar, but also fully restores henry mancini's score to its original glory (the us version covered a lot of the gaps with additional cues by michael kamen and james guthrie). although a somewhat surprising choice at first sight, mancini cut his teeth on many of the classic universal sci-fi horrors of the 50s and his score is quite superb, with a terrific driving main title that offers a rare reminder of just how interesting he could be away from blake edwards. sadly there's no more than a trailer by way of extras, though it would be nice to hope some day for a special edition with some of the deleted scenes from hooper's originally intended 128-minute cut: from what's on display here, these might just offer even more comedy gold!

though it hardly compares to other sci-fi film giants like 2001: a space odyssey or close encounters of the third kind, lifeforce does work as a totally berserk and bizarre melding of science fiction and horror elements. somehow, despite dialogue that approaches the ridiculous and acting that does the same, it manages to work because of a few highly different elements.loosely based on colin wilson's 1976 novel "the space vampires", this film from director tobe hooper (poltergeist; the texas chainsaw massacre) focuses on a joint us-british mission aboard the british space shuttle churchill to study halley's comet. led by an american commander (steve railsback), they discover an alien spacecraft in the comet's coma. and when they investigate the interior of the spacecraft, they find alien occupants that look like giant bats. later on, the churchill reaches earth's orbit, but no response is given from radio calls issued from the mission's home base, the space research center in london. columbia is launched to rendezvous with churchill, but they find the entire ship gutted by fire--all except for the alien beings encased in glass who, far from being untouched by the fire, look absolutely perfect. the aliens are bought back to earth...and that's where the incredible happens.these space vampires escape from the space research center and, instead of draining their victims of blood via bite wounds, suck their victims' lifeforce totally out of them. one of them is the space girl, a thoroughly nude vampiress played by mathilda may. railsback, the only actual survivor from churchill, is bought in by the src's chief (frank finlay) and a british special agent (peter firth) to track may, who is in telepathic contact with him. pretty soon, however, the vampires have turned london into a scene of pure holocaust; people are either being dessicated or turning into zombies, and the threat by nato to sterilize the city with thermonuclear radiation looms large. railsback finally catches up with may, and sacrifices himself by impaling her with a large metal sabre.undoubtedly disjointed, unquestionably uneven, but nevertheless worth watching, lifeforce, despite the frequent incoherency of its script and its acting, benefits from some drop-dead excellent special effects work by john dykstra (star wars), some of the best ever seen. the other working element, and a surprise one it is, is the incredible orchestral score by henry mancini, almost wagnerian in the same way john williams' score for star wars was--and mancini, like williams before him, uses the london symphony orchestra, to boot!largely forgotten these days, and a critical and box office disaster in 1985, lifeforce, if for no other reason, should still be seen for anyone with a taste for the bizarre. there had never been a film quite like it before, and there will certainly not be anything like it again.

like several other reviewers here, i'm surprised to see many negative reviews on this film. dan o'bannon's previous effort was the groundbreaking 'alien' of 1979. because it and 'star wars' introduced the stylistic approach of 'used' or 'dirty space' in art-direction for these kinds of features doesn't mean that this was the only way to produce them.rather than dismiss 'lifeforce' out-of-hand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation feature, it's important to recognize that the film draws upon the 'esteemed' traditions of british horror and science-fiction - specifically hammer and american international features like quatermass (specifically 'quatermass and the pit', 1967), doctor who and 'the day of the triffids' (1963), if not the works of gerry anderson ('ufo', 'space:1999' and 'thunderbirds'). but none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized writer o'bannon's genre-scholarly appreciation for 'queen of blood'(1966) and 'it! the terror from beyond space'(1958) - the immediate sources for 'alien' (1979).granted this film has some 'legacy' elements, but perhaps it's worth comparing this film to its more immediate peers - 1981's 'an american werewolf in london' and 'the company of wolves' (1984) - other 80's films that share a 'looking-back' while they adapt those stories to the 80's zeitgeist. all three films drew on earlier incarnations of the same, but substantially sexed-up their themes (because they could), and, at the same time they recognized the tongue-in-cheek, humorous aspects of their projects.neil jordan's 'wolves' played to many of the psychoanalytic memes floating around at the during the '80's, while 'american werewolf' curdled its theme as a 'coming-of-age' film. it's called artistic license, and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latter-day dramedy inherent in the 'scream' franchise, 'i know what you did last summer' and 'final destination'. but these teen-targeted, films seem to be part of a box-office trend, whereas the 80's films like 'lifeforce' belong a canon of british sci-fi - even if this one was written by an american.in many ways this film holds up much better than latter-day disaster and alien-invasion flicks ('independence day', 'armageddon', 'deep impact') in that the 'solutions' don't reside in gun-battles, weaponized payloads and testosterone. at the opposite end of the pole, it is unfortunate that steven soderbergh and james cameron didn't examine tarkowski and lem more closely before they remade 'solaris'...the goal of this film was fun, not ponderousness or stupidity.7/10

** and 1/2 stars out of **** lifeforce is one of the strangest films i've ever seen, so ridiculous, yet at the time it's strangely compelling and never the least bit dull. whether it's due to the nonstop nudity, the large amount of violence and action, it all comes together to make an entertaining 2 hours of cinema.the spaceshuttle churchill has been sent to investigate halley's comet when they detect something hiding inside the coma of the giant rock. a small team, led by colonel carlsen (steve railsback), has been sent to search the area. what they discover includes hundreds of frozen bat-like creatures and three nude and seemingly unconscious humanoid beings inside strange crystalline containers, two male and one female (mathilda may). they decide to take all three back with them, which results in a catastrophe.when london receives no response from the crew, another crew is sent to find out what's going on. when they dock with the churchill, they find the remains of the crew, all dessicated beyond recognition. the humanoids are still in perfect condition, and they take them back to london.after various tests, the scientists still don't know what these beings really are. then, late one night, a security guard in the compound feels compelled to enter the room the female is being held. he touches her shoulder, and she awakens, stands up, and smiles at him in a seductive and wicked manner. she approaches him, and begins to kiss him, when it becomes clear that she's actually taking his lifeforce, sucking him of all of his energy (the effect is slightly cheesy).she escapes from the compound and begins to leave a trail behind. another man, colonel caine (peter firth), is brought in to track her down. then the men discover that there is a pattern to the lifeforce process. the corpse of the security guard awakens in 2 hours, and takes the lifeforce of a doctor. it seems in every 2 hours, this process is repeated by a victim. with the help of the churchill's sole survivor, carlsen, they attempt to track the girl down before it's too late.lifeforce is pretty good late night entertainment. it has all the elements one could look for in such a movie, loads of nudity, blood/gore, and plenty of special effects. this is certainly better than a similarly plotted film, species, thanks in large part to a more riveting finale.the performances range from decent to terrible. faring the worst is easily steve railsback, who overacts to no end. much better are peter firth, who comes through and convincingly, and the gorgeous mathilda may (she's as beautiful as french actresses sophie marceau and emmanuelle seigner). may does go through virtually the whole role without wearing clothing, and there were reports that it was hard on her while filming, so the fact that she is able to go through every scene without fidgeting and looking uncomfortable is impressive. there are times when she can be quite creepy, being simply seductive. most of the film manages to work because of her.

daisy movie review by james mudge from beyondhollywood.comon paper, "daisy" sounds like an asian film fan's dream come true, directed by "infernal affairs" co-helmer andrew lau and starring everybody's favourite sassy girl, popular korean actress jeon ji hyun. unfortunately, despite the talent involved, and the fact that the crew flew halfway around the world to shoot in amsterdam , the film turns out to be a bit of a disappointment, being a clich'd romantic drama which wallows in misery and self importance.the plot follows hye young (jeon ji hyun), a rather naive korean girl who lives in amsterdam , spending her life working in her grandfather's antique shop and doing portraits for tourists. one day, she begins receiving flowers at exactly the same time from a secret admirer, who she believes to be a mystery man from her past who once built her a nice little bridge. one day she meets jeong woo (lee seong jae, also in "holiday" and "public enemy"), who unbeknownst to her is actually an interpol agent tracking asian criminals in the netherlands .with hye young assuming that jeong woo is responsible for the flowers, the two fall very slowly into a chaste romantic relationship. however, it turns out that the man sending the flowers is actually park yi (jung woo sung, from "sad movie" and "musa"), an assassin working for a chinese crime syndicate. inevitably, the love triangle turns tragic and the two men end up facing off while poor hye young tries to work out which of the two is the love of her life.although "daisy" is ostensibly a love story, it has the feel of a funeral, with a slow, sombre pace and a plot which piles on the misery. half of the film's running time is taken up with scenes of the characters staring longingly out of windows into the rain, with the silence broken only by bouts of self pitying narration. director lau seems to be under the impression that the film is a weighty shakespearean tragedy, rather than yet another gloomy hit-man love story. as such, the proceedings have a rather pretentious air, despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and based largely around glaring cliché borrowed liberally from the likes of "fulltime killer" and john woo's classic "the killer".almost every aspect of the film is riddled with angst, with the three lead characters suffering as if the weight of the world was on their shoulders, and steadfastly refusing to do anything to pursue their romantic inclinations. park yi in particular, as the kind of overly emotional, socially retarded assassin so beloved of modern cinema, is faintly ludicrous, from his blatant incompetence on the job to his hilarious attempts to discuss impressionist painting with hye young or his penchant for flower growing. this languid passivity does make the film's central romance somewhat hard to swallow, and lau's attempts to evoke the feeling that it is fate which brings the characters together comes across more as shoddy coincidence.fans of jeon ji hyun should note that her character is far closer to her role in the glum supernatural drama "the uninvited" than "my sassy girl" or "windstruck", and while she tries her best to pull a few wacky faces here and there, her performance is certainly more subdued.the film benefits from glossy production values, and lau makes good use of the amsterdam scenery, playing on the contrast between the grey, almost gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue skies and flowery fields of the countryside. unfortunately, he tends to overuse slow motion for some of the emotional scenes, which when coupled with some of the picture postcard visuals gives the film the feel at times of a perfume advert. there are a few scenes of surprisingly violent action, though these are few and far between, and whilst well staged, seem to have been thrown in as an afterthought and do little more than briefly raising the pulse.despite its flaws, "daisy" makes for engaging viewing, and the story grips almost in spite of itself, mainly out of a morbid fascination to see not which of the men hye young will end up with, but to see who will lie dying in her arms. the self indulgent melodrama works well enough to tick all the right boxes for the genre, and the film functions perfectly well as an enjoyably glossy, weepy romance.it is worth noting that the dvd features the director's cut of the film, which for once indicates that it is substantially different from the theatrical version, which not only adds 25 minutes, but reorders some of the scenes, making the narrative less linear. although this new version is perhaps too long, it is surely superior, as without these changes, the film would surely have been even more conventional and would have suffered from even murkier character development.wai keung lau (director) / jae-young kwak (screenplay) cast: woo-sung jung . park yi sung-jae lee . jeong woo david chiang . cho ho-jin jeon . detective jang ji-hyun jun . hye-young dion lam . yun joon-ha

a young korean artist lives in amsterdam. she is a bit of a loner and has never had a serious relationship, insisting that she is "waiting" for the right person. she works in the public square, drawing portraits for passersby but, for herself, she also indulges in painting her favorite flowers, daisies. but, all of a sudden, she has a secret admirer. flowers are delivered to her residence every day at 4:15, usually daisies, yet she can not catch the sender in the act. this is because, unknown to her, her beau is a korean hit-man, and he wishes to remain hidden, for now. one day in the square, however, another attractive korean man sits for the artist and happens to be carrying a pot of daisies. she concludes that he is her shy hero and, also, the man she has been waiting to find. this second gentleman, too, has a secret; he is an interpol agent. the assassin can see everything that transpires in the square, due to having an apartment close by. naturally, he is disturbed that another man has entered the young girl's life. how will this shadowy love triangle play out? this is a beautiful picture to watch. the setting in amsterdam and the surrounding countryside is very, very lovely. add in three most attractive young korean actors and, visually, any viewer has a stunning panorama in front of them. the story is quite nice, too, being a mixture of drama and action, with a dash of the unexpected. costumes are very fetching and the production values, high. in short, anyone searching for a quality foreign film with a compelling story and great scenery would find this movie a wonderful choice for a diverting evening. should you have someone's hand to hold during the view, so much the better.

i saw the korean version of daisy first. it came across as a simple love story that flowed nicely from start to finish. i saw it 3 times as i waited for my copy of the director's cut to arrive.then i got the dc and watched it. wow! i think this is the first real director's cut i've ever seen. amazing how detailed the editing is in both versions! the dc is laid out like a hardcore thriller, with the love story in the background. it moves at a slower pace than the korean version.the variations between both versions are so drastic, it seems like two totally different movies. i thought i would be worn out watching the movie again, toughing it out just to look for the added scenes. that wasn't the case. it really felt like i was watching a whole new movie.while the dc is 20 minutes longer than the korean version, you'll be hard-pressed to pinpoint where or what has been changed. 2 seconds chopped off here. a second added there. an entire scene added here. another erased there. in both versions, scenes have been added, omitted or chopped up and reordered. in some scenes, entire lines of dialogue were replaced or reordered - while the scene itself was untouched. even simple sound effects were added/omitted from each version - having a major impact on the mood of the film, and sometimes even changing the outcome of a scene. what comes across as a tender moment in the korean version is a sad, somber one in the dc. the endings of both versions leave room for interpretation. as far as i can tell, both versions end a lot different, and were intended that way.i'm assuming most people will be acquiring the director's cut of the film, and will find the movie pretty decent, but a little long and boring. if that's the case, look for the korean version. same movie, but different feel. i think there's a deluxe 3-dvd version that contains both cuts of the film - not sure.the versions compliment each other so well that as a pair, i'll watch daisy more often than i do any of my other favorite korean movies. alone, i'd say the korean version is a nice love story that i'd watch once in awhile. the director's cut, i'll watch maybe once or twice, then never again, as i find the pacing dull. but they just go so well together! for what i consider the best experience, i'd say watch the korean version first. then watch the director's cut to help fill in the gaps of the story that you were curious about.the editing is the real star of the film.

flowers! if it's one thing you'll take away from this movie, it's gonna be the flowers. they feature so prominently and are used as plot devices, you'll become an expert in identifying with daisies and black tulips by the time the movie ends.set in amsterdam, daisy tells the frustrating love triangle story between 1 girl and the 2 men in her life. one a professional hit-man eking out a living, the other an interpol agent. featuring a pan-asian cast (korean, hong kong) and crew (director andrew lau from hong kong, writer from korea, and a thai post production team), i could imagine the headaches in coordination.park yi (jung woo-sung) is a hit-man who found a soft spot for painter hye-young (played by the pretty jeon ji-hyun). it's love at first sight in the meadows of daisies, where her clumsiness caught his attention. however, being shy and ever mindful of the dangers of his professional career, he can only admire her from afar, do little (or perhaps big) things for her in an anonymous fashion, but the one that takes the cake is sending her potted daisies everyday without fail at 4:15pm. he becomes her guardian angel from afar, shielding her and keeping her safe from harm.hye-young is in love with this mysterious stranger. she is constantly waiting for him to appear, but i really wonder how difficult could that be given the almost punctual daisy delivery. nonetheless, she's terribly moved, and touched by this sole act. however, as the stars would have it, interpol detective jeong woo (lee sung-jae) chances upon hye-young at a town square during one of his undercover missions, and he too is captivated by her. in a similar fashion, because of his profession, he is doubtful if he should make the first move.which is where the audience would find it frustrating. the lady obviously would fall for the wrong guy (then again, it's the "good" guy), park yi being infuriated by jeong woo's pursuit, but yet still refuses to step out and identify himself, and jeong woo being the opportunist in grabbing the free anonymous identity unwittingly. it's almost as if you wanna give everyone a slap to wake them all up.that aside, it is precisely this tension that keeps you intrigued. and it is wickedly fun to watch the two male leads finding it tough to fall in love without jeopardizing their careers, or their loved one. but fret not action fans, there are enough cat-and-mouse revelations and unsaid camaraderie in the mould of infernal affairs, as well as ample gunfights, although i felt the ending could have been scripted tighter.what rocks is the clever editing. telling the story in a non-linear timeline (no worries, it ain't that bad, you'll still be able to follow the narrative) from the points of view of all the leads, keeping you in suspense, and culminating in a three way split screen showcasing all their emotions in a single converging event, which i thought was extremely well-done.it's a beautiful film in terms of landscapes of lush meadows and busy city squares, with plenty of classical music to sooth the soul. as with romance movies, all the leads are eye candy - the girls will have a field day with the two handsome male leads, while the guys have to make do with a somewhat pudgy-faced (argh! ok lah, at certain angles) jeon ji-hyun.if you're into a romance movie with an equal balance in the action/tension department, then daisy would be your choice. if you prefer a more conventional weepy, then the other korean movie making its debut here at the same time, you are my sunshine, would be your alternative. and yes, i totally dig the ending scene, which i thought only the koreans do it best? kinda reminded me of the jsa one.

good to see i'm not the only person who remembers this great film. i have very fond memories of this movie - seem to vaguely remember back to when i was about 8 and i'd watch the kids tv shows after school (broom cupboard anyone?). this was the first and last film to scare me - and the images of the boy surrounded by mist on a hill will stay with me forever! like most films of this era, it has a happy ending - aimed at children, but with a definite ability to capture an adults attention. the lovely cornish scenery really sets the film up to feel isolated - and the "ghostly" scenes are simple but very, very effective! i'd love to try and find this movie again - see if it still hits home!

i saw this film early one morning in the early 90s when i was about 12.i have been trying to find what it was and finally today i did!i remember enjoying it and being a little bit freaked out at the ending when it showed the gravestone of the young boy and his ghostly face!please could anybody let me no if i can get a copy of this as i would love to see it again.i remember the kid getting stuck down a cornish tin mine and then befriending a boy.cant remember that the kids were stuck there with miners but must have been.the boy helps them out of the mine and turns out to be the ghost of a boy who had died while working down there i think.

this film has "haunted" me since i saw it when i was about 8 years old. i didn't know what it was called so am so pleased to have tracked it down finally. i remember being quite scared, because i'd just been to a tin mine in cornwall when i watched it, so could imagine it all. fortunately i didn't see any ghosts of dead children there, but i found this film really quite disturbing and scary when i was much younger. i've certainly never forgotten it, even though i couldn't find it anywhere. i seem to remember the children's film foundation films being generally good, but they don't show them at all any more. i also remember programmes like the children of green knowe in the same era on bbc - equally unsettling in its own way.

i remember watching this as a child as part of the children;s film foundations friday film specials on cbbc and have recently happened upon a copy.in the twenty or so years since my last viewing this film has lost nothing.it is an atmospheric tale which entices with cornish folklore and adds elements of truly creepy imagery of the ghost of the young miner billy.shot in the wonderfully scenic port loe area of cornwall the film utilises the mixture of rugged coastline and abandoned tin mines to make the setting truly believable.there is much packed into this cff drama, something long since lost from children's television today and well worth a look if you can track down a copy.

so after years and years i finally track this film down! i was dying to see how it lived up to my memories. i distinctly remembered the shots of the ghost boy running down the mine, then waiting behind two planks of wood crossed in the mineshaft, just staring out with a pale white face. this single shot was probably the most chilling shot of my childhood, i remember chills running down my spine. watching it now, its obviously nowhere near as scary, but quite subconsciously strange to see the same images again. if anyone wants a copy, private message me.the story itself is fairly standard bcff stuff. its strange though that the message is pretty unclear this time around - there is no real moral as such (except that 'ghosts are here to help us?' or 'don't be prejudiced against ghosts!') there wasn't even a greed/capitalist angle in terms of wanting to profit from the mine. however, a massive act of irresponsibility from the captain, encouraging the two kids to actually follow the vague implications of a ghost not only into a mine, but into a new mine hole, which is totally dangerous. the captain then encourages the children to climb down a huge ladder, deep into the mines, simply because he thinks the ghost wants them too. its also a bit odd that the ghost chooses the boy to help the trapped adults, and not just help the trapped adults direct. oh well.

being cornish and brought up with the history of tin mining, this film is quite special to me. filmed in and around various locations in cornwall, it depicts the story of two your children who get trapped down a mine with a group of miners.the 'haunters' of the title refers to the 'spriggins' - ghosts of child miners who reside in the mine and are said to bring evil to all that mine there. events take place with an american wanting to invest in local tin mining, but when the young local kid josh is plagued by sightings of the ghost of a young boy, he and his american 'girlfriend' set out to unravel the mystery behind his death, climaxing in the rescue of themselves and several miners from almost certain death when a new shaft is opened and the spiggins save them.top film, albeit low budget and short, but worth a look if you're from cornwall and/or into tin mining!

this film is one of those that can't be regarded by its outwardness. indeed, at a first sight, it seems that the story simply focus the desire of have more money. but..let's take a look on the other side...what do you see? you see that the money is only a metaphor for the ambiguous feelings the human being have:should i do the right thing, or should't i? and... what's the "right thing"? le's make a deeper analyses... -what does it mean a little town in the border? - it means that sometimes we can go too close to the border of doing something we thought we couldn't... - what does it mean the arid soil shown in this picture? - it means the dryness that sometimes take possession ot our offensed hearts... - what does it mean the phrase of the character (kristen) :"now i belong to him"? - it means the loss of our free will, due to our unpremeditated deeds. in my opinion that's the writer of the story and the director tried to "tell" us. by the way...do you remember what another character (jack barnes)said:"nothing is so simple..."

i first saw this movie in the night program of one of my favourite tv channels.... i was hooked from the very first minute. nothing is as it first seems, lots of suspense, great acting from mr. van dien, and i did not mind the "heat" in it one bit ;-) ... and, best of all: you are in for a surprise ending!!!

this film starts out with all the moody promise of a great contemporary noir western - after the ill-conceived opening flashback sequence anyway. the scenery is beautifully desolate, the characters achingly isolated. while some of the acting is less than believable, the plot ultimately delivers enough tension and twists to make this movie worth a look.

this movie moves and inspire you, it's like you are one of the family. just to see and witness life during the depression era, makes you feel humble and grateful. jonathan silverman delivered well, so convincing and very witty! a must see for teens!

blythe danner and judith ivey deliver wonderful performances here as jonathan silverman, as eugene, recounts his life in 1937's brighton beach.what makes the film so good is the relationships among the characters with a backdrop of extremely wonderful family values.bob dishy had a marvelous opportunity here as the father of the clan. he gives a restrained but compelling performance as the patriarch of the family.his sons played by jonathan silverman and brian dillinger are fabulous. there are certain scenes when silverman is skating or hopping where i'm reminded of jerry lewis.as for danner and ivey, they too are wonderful. their mannerisms, intonation and idealism of the jewish culture are beautifully realized by them.the cinematography is just wonderful. beautiful brighton in 1937! even as the inevitability of war loomed, the film is rich with many of the typical problems faced by families in that period. in a sense, you don't have to be jewish to experience what the family is going through.a must see for nostalgic buffs, and those of us who believe so strongly in family values.

one of the enduring classics from mgm came out in the closing years of world war ii, it's the film that made young elizabeth taylor a star. she had done a few films as a child actress before national velvet, but when it came out her place in the movies was assured. ironically enough biologically she'd be growing up fast enough after national velvet was out and her next struggle as an actress was to get substantial adult roles because casting directors only saw her as innocent little velvet brown who loved her jumping horse.i'm not sure of how this would work because steeplechase horses have to have confirmed bloodlines and the pi's are a subject not dealt with in national velvet. all we know is that he's a reckless and untrainable horse in the hands of reginald owen and after he breaks free and causes considerable damage, owen gets rid of him for a nominal price to the local butcher donald crisp.at the same time as these things are happening, mickey rooney comes wandering into the lives of the brown family which consists of crisp, wife anne revere, and daughters angela lansbury, juanita quigley, and elizabeth taylor and their little brother butch jenkins. rooney is a former jockey who's now on the open road and heading for the brown family where his father was once a horse trainer for anne revere's family. it's he who sees the potential of the pi (short for pirate) as a steeplechase jumper and it's elizabeth who convinces crisp not to pass up this chance.elizabeth taylor was so sweet and innocent in national velvet. the good book says you have to have faith like a child and she has it to spare. she infuses rooney with it, to have faith in the heart and ability of the pi and to leave a little over for himself.anne revere won a best supporting actress award for national velvet. she's a very wise mother who has hidden depths to her that the audience doesn't suspect. it turns out that back in her youth she had a taste of fame and glory swimming the english channel and her prize money, saved all these years, she gives to her daughter. that scene is probably what won her the oscar. national velvet also won one other academy award, for film editing.over 60 years after it made its debut national velvet as a family classic hasn't lost a thing. its depiction of life between the world wars in great britain is still a standout. and national velvet launched a movie legend. can't do much better than that for high regard.

during the 13 years of schooling i had from kindergarten through high school, there was only one day that my class took a field trip. when i went to school, you went to school, from 8:30 until 3:30 and filed trips were not taken. but, for some reason i could not recall at this advanced age, we went to see a movie - national velvet. i do not recall the movie, so, on the eve of my 57th year, i decided to revisit it.it is a movie about a time that no longer exists. a time when people trusted others and didn't lock their houses. a time when people were given the benefit of the doubt. it was a time when family was the most important thing. this film shows all of that and more. it shows love and trust and caring and the goodness of people.it would not be a bad thing for every family to view this film once in a while and discuss its message.it was a treat to see the young elizabeth taylor, mickey rooney at his best, the academy award-winning performance of anne revere, angela lansbury before murder, she wrote, and donald crisp, who performed for almost sixty years.what a movie!

this is the first movie i ever owned on video, and 14 years later, i still have the same copy. elizabeth taylor was as radiant at twelve as ever later in life, mickey rooney gave real dimension to mi taylor, and donald crisp was solid as ever as mr. brown. the amazing anne revere, as mrs. brown, seemed to be the wisest woman in the world. after nearly 60 years, the warmth, humor, and excitement of this film still affect the viewer; we still laugh at the jokes, root for the pie, and love velvet for the spirit and capacity for love that she displays. i love it as an adult just as i loved it as a child. a must for every family video collection.

my daughter already wrote a review of this movie in my sign in...but i want to add a few words. national velvet' was one of my two favorite movies as a child. (the other being 'the wizard of oz.) the cinematography, the acting, the script, and the music all came together is such a wonderful little heart felt drama that it can still bring tears to my jaded eyes. based on a book by enid bagnold, the script followed the book quite well. the characters are so thoughtfully created. it's easy to become emotionally involved with the entire family and the quaint little irish village in which they live. the premise...complete outsider believes in her horse and herself enough to chance a try at the greatest horse race in the world...is awe inspiring to any young person, especially a young girl in the 40's...a time when girls were sometimes ignored as humans beings let alone athletes. you would have to be terribly hard-boiled not to appreciate it's merit. but the perspective i cherished most about this movie is the unabridged innocence in it's moral message.. it's almost magical how 'mom and apple pie' the movies were back then. i was really taken aback by the imdb reviewer who asked...'was the world ever really this trusting?' and then proceeded to chastize the director for his complacency regarding unchaperoned' overnight travel involving the two main characters. my answer to his question is an unequivocal yes!!!! the movie going world was that trusting in the 40's.my grandparents remember taking my mother to this movie when it was released. then my mother took me to see it when i was young, and my daughter was lucky enough to be born at a time when she could watch it repeatedly on video tape. now we have it on dvd. it's been a family favorite for generations, albeit generations of horse lovers. it was never about sex...it's about coming of age! it's about believing in yourself and working hard to reach your goals. also, so old fashioned it wasn't even about the prize money! it's about the girl child who understood her horse had what it took to be the best'. and yes, the director was indeed concerned with elizabeth taylor's lack of physical development because the book made a big deal about velvet brown (liz taylor's character) having to cut her hair and bind her chest so that she could pass as a male jockey when she went to the grand national steeplechase. this was a guys only sport back then...i think there have only been 12 women ever to compete in this race. it's almost insulting that anyone would bother to think the lolita thing about this particular movie...besides, anyone having had anything at all to do with an adolescent girl and her horse would know that the only thing they ever think about with stars in their eyes have four hooves and a tail.and now for a great bit of trivia...the stunt riding was performed by the now famous horse whisperer', monty roberts. i believe he is given mentioned for his riding in the movie credits.i give this movie a 10 out of 10! i never get tired of watching it again.

i am 13 years old and i am writing this review in my mom's sign in. she will write her own review later. this is my all time favorite movie.it was filmed in england in 1944. i watched it so many times when i was little that i wore out the video tape. i love this movie and it changed my life! the beautiful landscapes. the mighty pie-bold thoroughbred horse. the plain little irish village with the young girl who wanted to do what no other girl had ever done, compete in the grand national steeplechase in london with her most beloved horse, the pirate. it all made me want to ride horses (which i have done now for 7 years)and learn everything i could about their breeds so i could also draw and paint them. it's a ground breaking movie about winning against all odds, overcoming your fears, believing in yourself, and reaching difficult goals by working very hard. also, the horse race scene was one of the best ever made and i have seen many movies with horse races. i never get tired of watching this movie. everything about it is perfect. especially if you are a young girl and passionate about horses!

a sentimental, heart-tugging family film set in england of the 1920s. a young elizabeth taylor wins a horse in a raffle and decides to enter him in the grand national; fortunately, ex-jockey mickey rooney is around to give liz some help. director clarence brown displays some remarkable control with material that could've been excessively maudlin in someone else's hands. he and screenwriters helen deutsch and theodore reeves take great care in establishing genuine characterizations and developing the story naturally. true, there are one or two scenes that seem a bit forced, but overall it's quite affecting, and gorgeously filmed in technicolor. the race itself is quite thrilling, and like so many great classics, there's a marvelous, three-hankie fade-out at the end. liz proves that she was a real trooper right from the start, and rooney--who i usually find rather annoying--is surprisingly subdued and really very good. donald crisp is terrif as liz's gruff father and angela lansbury is a delight as her older, boy-crazy sister. most of the acting kudos, however, belong to anne revere, who won a richly deserved supporting actress oscar playing liz's wise and caring mother.

in "lassie come home," "national velvet," and "the courage of lassie," elizabeth taylor was eleven years old  nevertheless, her charm and beauty were extraordinary, and what she lacked in talent and experience was well hidden in a fine production that was nominated for five academy awards as horse-trainer or dog-owner, as spurned wife or mistress, liz is a female who is absorbed in the giving and receiving of love: devotion to the object of passion is the center of her life little liz lavishes love on horses and dogs with remarkable intensity ecstatic; a dreamer with a turbulent emotional life, persistent, the young liz dedicates herself to the prize-winning horse the way she later devotes herself to menanticipating her later images of young sex goddess, liz as velvet is both saintly and mature howard barnes, in the new york herald tribune, called her a child who 'lights up with the integrity of a great passion.' directed by clarence brown with loving attention to detail, the movie that made her a star is a big bestseller from another era set in sussex, england, where velvet brown, a butcher's daughter, teams with a vagabond teenager named mi taylo (mickey rooney) to train for competition a horse she's won in a raffle from the coastal plains with its beaches, to the rolling hills, thatched cottages, and miles of country walks, "national velvet" is the product of a bygone era in movie-making following closely the structure of the popular enid bagnold novel, the movie is part horse story, part family portrait: scenes of training and riding are balanced by cozy family scenes, vignettes about young love and sermons from mom on the virtues of courage and endurancethe browns are a noble version of hollywood rustic dedicated to a sober work ethic, they live quiet, exemplary lives mrs. brown (anne revere) is the very spirit of plain-folk wisdom; the spokeswoman for common sense and fair play, she knows well enough not to silence the semi-hysterical energy of her horse-crazy daughter, and she lets the girl have her dreamanne revere won an oscar as velvet's mother, as did editor robert j. kern

i saw this 1997 movie because i am a fan of lorenzo lamas (and of his father, the late fernando lamas). in my opinion, lorenzo looked his best in this film, mostly due to his hairstyle and the preppy wardrobe that were flattering to him.as the plot progressed, i realized the movie was more than just entertainment or a reason to see a favorite actor. the story was about a ring of serial killers and the attempts of law enforcement to investigate the ring and bring the members to justice. there was adequate suspense, and i believe the violence was necessary to relate the story to the viewer.at the end of the film i was shocked to learn the film is the true account of horrendous murders that occurred in utah. furthermore, lorenzo and his leading lady were portraying actual fbi agents who solved the disappearances of many young women and contributed to the apprehension of the ring. i believe the film is worthwhile as it informs the public about the dangers and capabilities of the criminal element.

the first in a new style of films for lamas- no tattoo's, motorcycles or karate. i, for one, miss them. but this is a serious movie. he plays a fbi profiler who has lived so long with the bad guys in his head that he no longer trusts anyone, including himself. gary busey is either a great actor or somebody i wouldn't want to meet in broad daylight on a crowded street. kristen cloke pursues lamas as doggedly as she pursues the serial killer. there is one surprise after another as the story unfolds not the least of which is the ending. it seems to never come - there is always one more layer to the story. cloke and lamas start out as the good guys, turn into the bad guys and somehow end up the heroes. but it's definitely worth the rental price. for maximum enjoyment throw in a candy bar,a bag of popcorn and a soft drink. you're going to the movies!

this was so much better than i expected, the film oozed proffesionalism compared to other b-moive of this sort of budget. the script was good if a little formulaic but the acting was surprisingly good from all including lorenzo and you always expect good standards from scheider and busey. aswell as the good plot and acting the action is good especially the car chases and the crashes are a-class. all in all this is a rise above other b-movie thrillers and doesn't have to rely on constant nudity or a flow of cheesy puns to make up for budget and script defficiencies, its certainly worth a rent.

what a show! lorenzo lamas once again proves his talent as a cop who committed the worst crime a good cop can commit, by being a good cop. then, again, he shows how sensitive a cop can be, displaying a range of emotions like no other actor can except, maybe, himself in terminal justice.huge enjoyment!

i stumbled across this film while channel surfing, and was blown away. it was being broadcast on a lesser known short films program here in australia.it has been a long time since i have been so impressed by a film, especially one so short. the power of the story, the quality of the acting and the stunning cinematography... wow. if it were available, it would make a very worthy addition to my dvd collection.i am undoubtedly impressed, and i will look forward to joshua leonards' next film.an exceptional experience 10/10

this is my favourite indian movie of all time. it is comic genius. salman khan is hilarious. but amir khan steals the show with his witty dialogue. karisma kapoor's outfits tell a story of their own - makes you wonder if the stylist deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the movie funnier (at one point she looks like she's wearing a nappy). andaz apna apna is the only comedy genre movie to make me laugh from the beginning till the very end. there is not one dull moment, every scene is hilarious, even the songs and dance moves will have you in stitches of laughter. i especially loved the scene in which amar (amir khan) 'regains his memory'. i've seen this movie so many times i've lost count. and i'm so glad to say that this time bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic movie as far as i know a.a.a it is not a replicate of a hollywood movie (thank god). overall i recommend this movie to anyone who understands hindi/ urdu and loves good comedy.watch it you'll love it!!!!!

andaz apna apna is a movie that i treasure and its one movie, i don't mind seeing at any time... well almost any time! this movie is simply marvelous and according to me, is the funniest movie i've ever seen! and yes, i do put it over hera pheri... reason? hera pheri has scenes you'll watch out but andaz apna apna? not possible! simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for! aamir & salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes but i'll put the characters in order of favoritism: rank # 1. crime master gogo (shakti kapoor's best performance till date and yes, this happened before the casting couch): gogo is an innocent character who belongs to well reputed family of mogambo (mr. india fame). crime master gogo is actually mogambo's nephew but for mogambo, he's more than a responsible, handsome, charismatic charming son. gogo, makes the biggest mistake of life by lending 36,000 rupees to teja (who is as balla had once said, "a fraud and a cheat!"). now, gogo's only goal is to get back what's his and in his journey of recovering his lost money, gogo realizes that there is more than 36,000 that he needs to achieve and thus begins... gogo's struggle against the sinner-world.rank # 2. teja (teja main hoon, mark idhar hai!): teja is an evil character who is ram gopal bajaj's twin. originally named shyam gopal bajaj, teja chooses to change his name to suit his personality. teja, as a child had always envied his brother and then one day, things took a turn for the worse when his father gave his entire wealth to ram bajaj. teja decided to kill his father but in the night's darkness, instead killed munshi harish chandra (raveena's dad), though teja doesn't regret his actions. teja's sole mission, now, is to get back his property somehow and start his own poultry & bakery farm. teja also needs to return back the loan to gogo (but has no intentions whatsoever to do so). in order to achieve his evil goals, teja employs two people: robert (vijay khote, who is very good at aiming) and balla (shahzad khan, ajit's clone and son... who is a very very smart boy!) rank # 3. amar (aamir khan): wants to marry the rich heiress raveena, so he sells his father's cheap saloon and heads off for mumbai. amar, has no problem taking care of the big business that raveena's father will hand him over after their wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and shift to london, if needed.rank # 4. prem (salman khan): after gogo, prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie and the way amar tries to take advantage of him in the mask of a friend, is tragic.i won't reveal any more characters because jesus christ! i just wouldn't stop typing! the movie is outright stunning! go and get the dvd now and beware of those cheap vcds as they have omitted many good scenes out of the movie.the background music is stud and the action is better than the matrix, especially the final encountered between prem and crime master gogo (watch out for it), it appears in the climax. andaz apna apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teach us a lot about life and values and ethics. it teaches us about bravery (why else would amar ask prem to stay back when they go to meet the kidnapper, even though prem was complaining that he had to go to the toilet???). andaz apna apna is also a tragedy, especially the scenes where salman is targeted by aamir and is given overdose of stomach-upsetting pills, the part where teja reveals his sad feelings regarding why he couldn't go to london and the part where gogo is arrested in the ending, without even getting back his 36,000. andaz apna apna is overall a complete package.... sit back and enjoy the ride! bet there'll be a second ride after that... and then a third!the movie was considered a flop back then and i bet no one liked it but buckle up guys! this movie is a big hit! even if it didn't have enough people coming to theatres, the movie is one of the highest selling home dvds and one of the most frequently movie on most of the channels so the producers have laughed their way to the banks long time back!

it'll soon be 10 yrs since this movie was released....still makes me laugh.... if u enjoy this film, try the new hera pheri....t'is as hilarious. and my favourite bit of the film must be when salman realises that he has no bullets left in his gun while he has the upper hand and has everyone at gun point...and he actually says it out loud!!! u just wanna bash him....but u know u can only do that if u stop laughing!!!! fantastic film.... 10/10

i have been watching this movie repeatedly, since it came out. even though it is 8 years old now, it still cracks me up. the jokes are still hilarious and the way the characters are portrayed will make anybody of any age laugh like they've never laughed before. enjoy it

its a very good comedy movie.ijust liked it.i don't know why i love this movie i just love it.storyline:it is a story of two boys amar (aamir khan) and prem (salman khan) who want to get rich quickly by taking all the short-cuts in the book. amar is the son of an honest barber, murli manohar (deven verma) in mumbai, while prem is the son of bankeylal bhopali (jagdeep), a hardworking tailor in bhopal. both amar and prem sell their father's shop and house respectively, and zero in on a hill station where a beautiful wealthy heiress raveena (raveena tandon) has come from london accompanied by her friend cum secretary karishma (karishma kapoor) with the intention of getting married to a virtuous indian. the lucky man to wed raveena will inherit her father ram gopal bajaj's (paresh rawal) entire wealth. amar and prem see their get rich quick chance and woo raveena, each trying to out do the other. enter teja (paresh rawal in a double role) whose sole ambition in life has been to grab his twin brother ram gopal bajaj's millions. so teja plants bhalla. (shehzad) and robert (vijoo khote) in raveena's house, to help him in fulfill his ambition. as the story progresses it turns out to be a mad chase from ram gopal bajaj's wealth, full of humor, romance thrills and chills. will raveena & karishma see through amar and prem's mischievous intentions? will teja succeed in his motives? see it all in super comedy andaz apna apna. aamir,salman,raveena,karishma and paresh at there best.good music.good direction.good story and screenplay.and very good comedy !!!!!!

there are some movies that are loved by almost everyone who you come across and yet happen to be box-office failures. andaz apna apna, an intelligent and hilarious comedy falls in that catogory. for once, an indian director has kept in mind the sensibilities of the audience, and not churned out a kader khan type stereo-typical hoax. the movie is about two guys who dream of riches, and try to accomplish that by wooing a millionaire's daughter. a humorous drama unfolds while a lot of complexities surface in the story. the complexities add to the sheer comedy of the entire plot. aamir khan plays the a street-smart guy, while salman khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the dumb guy. the villian played by paresh rawal,and his henchmen, junior ajit and "kaliaa" make you laugh in your sleep. although the movie borrows from a lot of other movies, despite shoddy camerawork, and despite being "loud" at times, it remains one of the scarce "funny" movies bombay has come up with after movies like padosan, golmal and other amol plaekar movies. it is sad that it didn't do well at the box-office, for that means producers turn back to formulas and creativity is abandoned.

its a spoof, its an intelligent comedy, it has some a pathetic action and choreography (and mind it, it is intentional), good hummable songs, good performances by the entire cast, brilliant by amir, salman and paresh and over all an script which is so rare in indian cinema that too in comedy (watch david dhawan, harmesh malhotra etc). story is of two wastrels whose only aim is to get rich and famous by any which ways. they come across one such way when they find out that a rich nri is coming india to get married. rest of the story is about oneupmanship and how these wastrels try to out wit each other. entire cast is perfectly cast right from deven verma till viju khote. songs are rightly placed and are funny. surprise package is salman who acts with perfect timing and this particular act gave him his style of comedy.all an all a fum film which you should not ignore if you like and watch indian cinema.

it's simply ridiculous how underrated this movie is. it is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. it never lags, it never slows down, it is a movie that has a wonderful flow to the plot. that along with the brilliant writing makes this an awesome movie. aamir and salman are outrageous, even raveena and karishma are funny in this movie. paresh rawal and shakti deliver some great bad guy comedy, but viju khote and the ajit-wannabe are the best with their dumbfounded bad-guy intentions. if you want to laugh, and enjoy a movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, you will not regret it. most indian movies tire me out by the end, cause they are 3 hours long. this movie is just as long, but i wish there was more when it ends, cause it's an amazing flick.

andaz apna apna is by far my second favorite comedy of all time, first being namak halal (even though that was technically a drama). story is nothing groundbreaking, but the complications that are added to it make it awesome. aamir khan is a total cartoon. just watch his expressions in the song yeh raat aur yeh doori. he is amazingly good at comedy, i never knew. salman khan was also good as the somewhat dimmer of the two characters. the noises he makes are almost as funny as aamir's faces. raveena and karisma serve their purpose but are nothing amazing. the real pick of the lot is paresh rawal as usual.the plot is rather simple, amar (aamir) and prem (salman) are useless sons of poor fathers. they don't believe in hard work and just want to get rich the easy way. so both their brains come across an idea to woo a rich man's (paresh rawal) daughter (raveena tandon) who comes to india to look for a husband. so amar and prem meet on the trip and join hands to drive off the hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl. when they succeed, they now have to get rid of each other. somehow both of them get into raveena's house, amar as an injured guy and prem as his doctor. from here on they try to oust each other. but things are complicated as raveena's friend (karisma kapoor) falls for prem and pursues him. and rich man's evil twin brother (rawal also) tries to get rid of the heiress and her father so he will inherit the money and sends in his two most trusted but bumbling fools to do the dirty work.this is a movie you do not want to miss. watch it! it will be worth it. i even own the dvd, its that good. and if you like this movie, i'd also recommend gol maal if you haven't already watched it. other good comedies are namak halal and hera pheri (new).

this movie is simply excellent. for some reason it wasn't a success at the box office in india. in new york, however, i have yet to come across a person who disliked this movie. this is definitely the funniest movie to come out of india. everyone gives a good performance; amir khan; however, just takes over and puts the movie over the top.

there have been very few great comedy films in the history of hindi cinema. andaz apna apna happens to be one of them. the film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (aamir and salman) who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaire's daughter (raveena). aamir and salman khan try their best to outwit each other and woo raveena. the plot thickens when paresh rawal & co. plan to take over all the wealth. the movie is well paced and very funny. rarely does one come across a hindi comedy which is both funny and intelligent. this is one of the few films with aamir and salman together (probably the only film!). unfortunately it did not succeed at the box-office, and we might never see a film of this calibre again. aamir khan is brilliant in the film and has proved his versatility as an actor in this film. salman khan gives a very good performance as a dim-wit. raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl, and karishma who is raveena's assistant/friend is also funny. paresh rawal, junior ajith, shakti kapoor, deven verma, jagdeep and tiku talsania just add to the flavour of the film! all in all, the best hindi comedy ever made and i wish they make more quality films like this one. you will want to watch this film time and again.p.s - for those of you who have watched this film, i also suggest gol maal, chupke chupke, chhoti si baat, naram garam, hera pheri (old and new), etc.

this movie fully deserves to be one of the top hindi comedies ever made . rajkumar santoshi is mostly known for his gritty hard-hitting social dramas , but this is easily the most effortless movie he has made .the plot revolves around two small-town buffoons amar (aamir khan) and prem (salman khan) . they want to get rich quick and so move to the big city . they hatch the same plan separately - to woo a rich heiress raveena (raveena tandon) who is the daughter of a rich businessman ramgopal bajaj (paresh rawal) . thus the one who marries raveena gets his hands on all her wealth . but when they get to know each other's plan , there is an intense tussle of one-oneupmanship over who marries raveena . hilarious gags and situations ensue as the battle rages on .at the same time ramgopal bajaj's identical twin brother shyamgopal bajaj wants to eliminate his brother and niece and usurp the family fortune . add to this an assortment of funny characters including a raveena's maid karishma (karishma kapoor) , a mistake-prone butler named robert (vijoo khote) , a manager named bhalla (shehzad khan) who mimics yesteryear's villain ajeet and a funny gangster gogo (shakti kapoor) who looks more like a pirate and a rollicking comedy awaits you .do not waste your time looking for logic in the movie . leave the company of your brains and just enjoy . the actors are so much in sync with the script that no room is left for mistakes . dialogues (rajkumar santoshi , dilip shukla) are witty . music (tushar bhatia) and lyrics (majrooh sultanpuri) are memorable . the picturization and choreography (saroj khan) of "yeh raat aur yeh doori" , "ae lo ji sanam" and "dil karta hai tere paas aaoon" is fitting and will remain etched in my mind forever .the film starred two superstars-in-the-making , aamir khan and salman khan (they eventually became superstars) . aamir khan is impeccable in his first all-out comedy role . i salute his sense of comic timing . salman pales in comparison with aamir but is still likable . among the supporting characters , paresh rawal stands out in his dual role of ramgopal and shyamgopal .the movie surprisingly failed at the box office . i fail to understand why . i recommend it to all nevertheless .

in a minute to pray, a second to die, clay mccord (alex cord) is an unhappy outlaw with a ten thousand dollar bounty on his head and degenerative epilepsy.realizing his days as an outlaw are numbered, he wants desperately (though somewhat reluctantly) to take advantage of an amnesty being granted by rough and tumble territorial governor robert ryan, (excellent performance) who badly wants mccord to renounce his ways and accept the amnesty as an example to others while in the bandit hub of escondito, outlaw mario brega plans to kill mccord to stop that from happening.also starring arthur kennedy, aldo sambrell and a slew of other familiar european faces, this is co-written and produced by (american) spaghetti western pioneer albert band, also responsible for the pre-leone film gunfight at red sands.though the solution to the main character's "epilepsy" is lifted straight out of howard hawks' el dorado, the script is solid, pretty fresh and unpretentious. this has a great balance of action and story and alex cord is great in it. he really should have been a bigger star.in defense of the shorter (well dubbed) english version: personally i'm past that age where the longer version is always the better version and the ending where mccord is ironically gunned down by grimy bounty hunters after his pardon, is needlessly nihilistic and completely destroys the film's message about hope and redemption.call me old-fashioned, but i rooted for mccord and felt he earned that happy ending!

i found this to be an underrated, quietly compelling spaghetti western (also known as dead or alive). despite modest credentials (apart from multi-purpose co-writer/producer albert band, the only notable crew member is composer carlo rustichelli), the film clearly benefits from the presence of its three american stars (newcomer alex cord is an ambiguous anti-hero, while veterans arthur kennedy and robert ryan lend a mythic quality to the proceedings) as well as the unusual plot (involving a crippled protagonist, an amnesty ruse covering a strategic clean-up of the town, and which has the law finally siding with the gunfighter against a horde of mexican bandits).there are several tough action scenes on hand  the film is capped by a terrific climax in which the star trio is besieged inside a blazing cabin  plus a couple of outrageous moments which are something of a spaghetti western trademark: from the middle of the street, cord sees a hidden gunman at a window reflected in a whiskey bottle; a man who helps cord escape is repeatedly immersed in a pool of oil by the villains. nicoletta machiavelli also makes a nice impression as a village girl with whom cord lodges; the supporting cast, then, is peppered with familiar (if largely anonymous) faces  all of them essentially genre fixtures.i wasn't aware of the fact that the english-dubbed version of the film on mgm/ua's r1 dvd was cut: i was fooled by the wrong running-time being listed on the back-cover; the film was only 99 minutes long and not 118  apparently, cord's character is killed in the longer italian version!

i caught this for the first time a few nights ago on television. i expected to only tune in for a few minutes, but found myself intrigued by the movie. i ended up watching it all and found it surprisingly compelling. the acting by the three american leads was quite good, especially that of alex cord. he plays a gunslinger with quite a degree of vulnerability. very different from how most of them are portrayed in westerns. he ended up in several situations where he was at the mercy of the bounty hunters. the final shootout between the three leads and the bad guys was very good, as was the scene where the doctor digs a bullet out of clay mccord. somewhat gruesome, but realistic. i must admit that, despite my initial misgivings at watching a "spaghetti western", i ended up enjoying this film quite a bit. i would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns.

"a minute to pray, a second to die" is a quality spaghetti western with a solid cast and an interesting storyline. it is filmed beautifully, with a relatively high production value for a film in this genre.alex cord does a terrific job portraying clay mccord, an outlaw who is suffering from increasingly debilitating seizures. he is seeking amnesty before his enemies close in on him, but is being too cocky for his own good when he asks for it. robert ryan delivers the best performance in the film as the governor of new mexico. mario brega and arthur kennedy are also great here.this movie is very good, but it doesn't stand out to me as being one of the best spaghetti westerns out there. it's lacking too much in style to be in the same league as any of the great ones. it does have some cool spaghetti overtones, but overall it's a bit too much like an american western. this is especially evident in the music score, which is ok as movies go in general, but pretty dull by euro-western standards. the soundtrack kind of reminds me of the music from "the unforgiven." although there is an interesting story here, it is told in a manner which is a bit too conventional for my tastes. if a spaghetti western fan and a hollywood western fan had to watch a movie together, this one would be the perfect compromise.all of this is not to say that anyone should avoid this film. i did enjoy watching it very much. as i said, it is a very well-done film and i recommend it to anyone who likes westerns, spaghetti or otherwise.

the cast alone tells you this will be a notch above the usual italian western. veteran actors robert ryan and arthur kennedy team up with alex cord who, at the time, seemed on the verge of stardom. the result is a movie that's both off-beat and down-beat and yet it'll satisfy those who seek more from a western than just gunplay. especially interesting here is the character played by alex cord. one expects the "hero" in these westerns to be taciturn and introspective, but "clay mccord" is an extreme example and, surprisingly enough, he's often shone in a passive, even weak position. much is made of the fact that he fears falling prey to the epileptic fits which immobilized his father, and in these moments of helplessness he's either at the mercy of those who wish to harm him or those who wish to help him. to emphasize his passivity, clay mccord -- don't you love that name? -- is often shone stripped to the waist as if he were little more than an attractive plaything being put on display. there's even a strong masochistic streak in his nature, most in evidence when he's used as a punching bag by his enemies and then suspended by his wrists and left hanging above the middle of a street. not only does he often fail to protect himself, but mccord is equally ineffective in protecting those around him. nearly everyone who helps him is killed. while "a minute to pray, a second to die" is far from being a complete success, it has a depth and a tone which sets it apart and causes it to linger in the memory. it's also a good showcase for alex cord whose career tended to decline after this point following a few promising years in the mid-1960s. he must have been about 36 years old when he filmed this -- in his physical prime -- and the scene of him hanging by his wrists, bare-chested and sweaty, is a memorable piece of cinematic "beefcake."

there are a number of reviews that comment on the cast of this film. suffice it to say that alex cord plays a strong lead opposite robert ryan and arthur kennedy. what concerns me is that many of you may not be aware of the (at least) two existing versions of this film. in the u.s. version clay mccord gains amnesty from governor lem carter and then rides out of town redeemed. i agree that ending is less than satisfying. however, in the original italian cut clay mccord rides out of town (weaponless as he has turned in his pistols to the governor) and is bushwhacked by the bounty hunters that have been slowly depopulating the bandit town of escondido. the bounty killers are excited at the prospect of splitting the $10,000 reward but are disappointed to find mccord's amnesty agreement in the corpses pocket. as they ride away one is heard to comment,"if this amnesty keeps up i'm gonna start hunting buffalo !" . this alone takes a minute to pray...a second to die and places it on an even playing field with movies like keoma and the big gundown. as the end credits say in the italian cut "fine".

a charming movie enhanced by the musical and vocal background, especially during the competition. my understanding is that there was never a soundtrack but could you, through your sources, advise me where i might get information on the singer and the likelihood of getting a copy of the song he sang. your help would be appreciated. the song really touched me and my wife and we would like to secure a copy wherever possible so that we might play it as background music when we have our family and friends over for our "italian nights". if you are able to get this information to us we would be eternally grateful. even if you can advise of the studio contact so that we might go direct.regards,john payling

i loved this movie, it was cute and funny! lauren holly was wonderful, she's funny and very believable in her role. costas mandylan was also very good, nice to look at too!! brenda vaccaro, as usual was a pleasure to watch, she did a great job with her character. it was a pleasure watching a movie that is funny, interesting and can be watched by the whole family. it's difficult to find nice wholesome movies anymore. thank goodness for the hallmark movies, they are wonderful! i wish i could buy it, if anyone knows where i could purchase this movie, please let me know!! i have purchase several hallmark movies and am very happy with them. i hope i can buy this one!!

marco poloni (costas mandylor) was born into a baking family in the bronx. although the polonis have been well known for their confections over the decades, the business has fallen on hard times. meanwhile, grace carpenter (lauren holly) is a most talented dessert maker in manhattan but, she can not seem to land a prime confectionery position because of the glass ceiling. an accidental meeting between marco and grace results in a conversation about a possible solution for them both. there is a high profile bake-off, the golden whisk, taking place in the near future and marco wants grace to partner with him. there is a hefty amount of "dough", haha, at stake for the winners, enough to set grace up in her own business and save the polonis eatery, too. reluctantly, grace agrees. but, there are complications. some of the judges and fellow contestants may have past issues with both grace and marco. then, too, although marco and grace both feel some sort of attraction for the other, grace has a long standing, very rich boyfriend. can marco and grace win the contest? this is a lovely film for the romantic at heart. first, there is the nice cast. holly has always been a lovely actress with a notable husky voice that furthers her attractions. in this film, she is perfectly cast as the determined but beautiful grace. mandylor, a newcomer, delights, too as the good-looking rival baker. the rest of the actors, including the wonderful brenda vaccaro as marco's mother, is quite nice. as a hallmark movie, the costumes, sets, and production amenities are beyond reproach and the script still manages to seem fresh and funny, despite some familiar themes. treat yourself, romcom lovers, to a most sweet confection by securing a viewing of this film. it is definitely the movie equivalent of a big box of quality chocolates.

i watched this movie because of costas mandylor and lauren holly. i adored them together on picket fences, so it was a treat to see them together again. this was not the best movie ever made, but it was cute. very predictable, but sometimes mindlessly fun movies are just what i need.the desserts were gorgeous, and i wanted to eat all of them. i did love it when that one fell apart though. i bet it still tasted good.costas and lauren still had the great chemistry that they had back on picket fences, and i swooned as they kissed in this movie.i wouldn't watch this again, but it was a great filler for one night.

this is a great valentine's day gift. a gorgeous guy and a pretty girl fall in love while trying to beat the competition at a baking contest. very romantic. i'm a real fan of costas mandylor since his days at picket fences and he hasn't lost his appeal. lauren holly is still lovely and adorable and the two still have great chemistry together. the supporting cast was good as well. seeing all those wonderful desserts being made was a delicious sight in itself. i loved that costas and lauren teamed up to win in the baking competition and in love. this is the kind of film that satifies all palates, romantic and otherwise. hallmark always shows excellence in their programming and this is no exception. the whole family can view this film. also shows that sometimes love triumphs over any adversity. i found myself sighing and wishing for more for this film and also yearning for those wonderful desserts. i recommend this film highly for all ages. a great treat for all.

this is a made for tv movie by hallmark. hallmark has always made quality movies that are family orientated. just desserts is a boy and girl fall in love while working together movie. two bakers competeing for a $250,000 prize against a field of professional bakers. it is fun and light hearted. the desserts look great. the movie has a catchy, upbeat little song played during the competition. i assume that it is a made for the movie song by roger bellon. to bad that no soundtrack is available. i would really like to get a copy of the song. i don't even know the name of the song, because the credits are squished at the end of the movie to make room for hundreds of promos. anyway, the cast is great. it is always nice to see brenda vaccaro. she is very bubbly and upbeat. lauren holly is always a plus and costas mandylor rounds out the good guys with a wonderful performance. professional chef wolfgang puck has a guest appearance. the movie is worth watching.

sometimes, you're up late at night flipping through the stations, bored out of your mind, and wanting some light and fluffy romantic comedy that doesn't make you feel bipolar. and this movie fit that exact billing. sure, the plot was ripped right out of the 1930s....the writing as schmaltzy as the hallmark greeting card company's legendary poetry, and the one- dimensional characters were played by a cast plucked straight from central casting - but it was cute, and exactly what i needed last night. lauren holly and costas mandylor have great chemistry together - i liked it on "picket fences," and i'm happy to say they still have it over 10 year later. costas mandylor, at 41, is still possibly one of the handsomest men to grace the screens since ol' rudy valentino kicked the bucket 80 years ago. rrrowrr! bonus points for casting that funny man who used to be on the roller skates on that show about the cartoon lady. i always thought he was something straight out of a hepburn-grant comedy. bravo!some people will probably say this was the corniest piece of cinema ever made, and i would probably have to agree - but come on! it's on the hallmark channel. what were you expecting? just sit back, relax, eat some sesame sticks, and watch a sweet little movie with two cute people and down a bottle of zinfandel. trust me, you'll love and accept the schmaltz a whole lot more, and then you can go to sleep dreaming about costas mandylor swimming in a sea of tempered chocolate feeding you petit fours with minty fresh chocolate icing. yummo! (ps. now i have a hankering for petit fours. thanks a lot, hallmark!)i really wish the evil girl had been cast with rachel ray, and maybe that dishy food nerd alton brown as the announcer instead of the creepy dude with the van dyk beard. shudder! that would have made my night. but hey, check out "just desserts."

it is to typical of people complaining about something when they no nothing about it...so this is about a gay man falling for a straight women. first of all...this is a true story so you cant say its not believable second its written by a gay man so the whole thing about this being against the gays are just plain stupid. personally i think this was the best love story i've ever seen. and i am very pro gay. i think this shows that real love is about personality not just looks and sex. and it has nothing against anyone who is gay, straight or bi unlike so many other shows. maybe we in europe take to it more cus most tv here are a bit deeper and make you think more then american tv...plus we don't fear when it comes to showing certain things.if you want something funny with one of englands best (lesley sharp) and you want to see a decent believable love story without too much sap this is for you. i know i love it

it's very easy to figure out why the new professionals was a dud, at least in new zealand: it didn't just follow in the footsteps of the original, it followed bodyguards, which out-professionaled the show considerably with its boss-and-two-agents formula. cmdr mcintyre was a latter-day george cowley: tough on his team, but one who would defend them to the death against others. the shadow the show cast was huge.well, not as huge as it should have been in the uk. here, it was networked in prime-time. it was even marketed in the promos as, 'they are the professionals.' someone else obviously noticed the difference. we were fortunate enough not to have this show released in different regions at different time slots.it was the high production values that sealed the deal for me. as other reviewers have noted, it followed the great british tradition of the one-hour actioner, but blended in personal elements at the same time. there's a slight undercurrent of something developing between liz and ian, though that never distracted one from the real plot. most episodes were based around inflammatory diplomatic incidents, the sort of thing that helps spooks along from time to time.unlike many 2000s shows, the plot was not sacrificed at the expense of fancy-pants photography or over-stylish direction. directors like christopher young kept the pace up and did their job. they made use of good locations, making bodyguards slicker than if it had been shot on back roads and alleyways. it was contemporary, it would still stand up beautifully today, and it was one of the better examples of the british actioner in the 1990s, showing that the uk can still do them better than anyone else.maybe except for the germans and their cobra 11.

when i first saw this show advertised to be on australian tv back in the late 90's i ignored it thinking it was just capitalizing on the kevin costner movie 'bodyguard'. but then i caught an episode and i wish i had watched it from the start. the partnership between sean pertwee and louise lombard was so well acted and the structure of each episode was extremely entertaining. it wasn't an overblown tv show that you can tell spent most of its energy in making things explode so that they could put that clip in the commercial to lure audiences and then not deliver on any other level. the show delved into the lives of the two main characters and thats what made it interesting. the stories for each episode where also well written with interesting guest stars who were good actors. and of course there was a lot of action and intrigue which is always good. but what was great was that there was humour, and it flowed naturally from the characters, it didn't appear contrived. it was british but in a good way, and if this show was made in america it would no doubt be on dvd by now. i don't know why british tv production companies are not interested in releasing this show on dvd. it was a great show and deserves a dvd release.

without doubt a great all round show that if shown today would attract a huge following.bodyguards was only 6 episodes and a trailer,but deserved a few more series to really bring it up-to speed.with outstanding performances from the highly talented and versatile sean pertwee and the dynamic louise lombard,it really did put it up with the likes of the proffesionals,the sweeney and thief takers.the story lines are based on the diplomatic protection services and with great filming and story lines and scene locations,it stood out from some of the junk that gets churned by other tv production companies.i do not think that it has been shown on terrestrial tv either,such as sky or freeview,witch is a shame as if it were to be shown nowadays,i am sure it would get a large viewing audience.so i hope one day the guys at carlton tv decide to release it on dvd,cheers,nick.

after a very long time marathi cinema has come with some good movie.this movie is one of the best marathi movies ever made. it shows how a old grandfather tries to save his grandsons eye. he tries everything that is possible in his hands to save the child's eye. doctor and a relative of his tries to help him in his attempt.the acting by the grandfather, the boy and the doctor are simply superb. they have shown true picture of a typical marathi life. every bit of action has some meaning in it. i would recommend to watch this movie, as initially i thought this one would be of documentary type but this was above my expectations.this film is really going to touch your hearts.i would expect more marathi movies to come up with performances like this.

i am a maharashtrian, a teenager living in the 21st century, and its obvious that i'm not much into even bollywood, let alone marathi movies. yet, when i watched shwaas, it left me with a unique feeling, one which only an extremely effective movie is capable of generating.it is a fact that, like most indian movies, the movie has its true and complete effect only if viewed in its original language. a lot of the emotion and meaning of the movie is embedded in its marathi dialogues, which, however hard one tries, can not be effectively translated into english.shwaas explores, in intricate detail, the relationship between a grandparent and a child. and it does complete justice to this strong bond. dialogues like "mazha parsha pan laakhat ek aahe"(my parsha is also one in a million) enhance the emotion. anyone who has closely observed the grandparent - child relationship will be able to relate to the situation portrayed in the movie.overall, it definitely worth watching. its a movie that has left a profound effect on me. i will surely recommend it to anyone!

shwaas is awesome ! considering that the producers had a meagre budget, they have done an excellent job. it is a must watch. the small kid has done an excellent job with a lot of emotions flowing through his eyes. grandfather is at his best. the photography is superb. technically correct and very creative. it helps in adding a lot of emotions to the mainstream content. the movie will keep u engrossed and don't be surprised if you are shaken after the movie and the story lingers in your mind for a few days.i sincerely hope that they make it to the final oscar nominationenjoy and again don't miss it

caught this movie on dd while flipping channels...and thank heavens, that too when it just started.. having studied in pune, this film touched off many happy memories of the city...that apart, one wonders why more movies like this aren't made...every character is so well etched-the grandpa, the kid, the doc...except for the social worker who grates a tad, the rest of the movie hardly has a flaw...a deserving entry for the oscars, even if it wasn't nominated...definitely leaves a lump in the throat...who sez u need mush to tickle ur lacrimals ? and to think that this movie needed sachin tendulkar to propagate it. inspite of being in marathi, there was hardly a moment where i wasn't able to follow the movie...the subtitles were good.. a must watch for any fan of good cinema.

this is a film about a six year old child from a village in maharashtra (a state in india) and his grandfather who come to pune (a city in maharashtra) to treat the child's eyes. here the grandfather gets to know that the child has cancer in both eyes and that they have to be removed to save the child's life. the movie is all about the main characters' and their feelings and actions until the operation.the movie is not a typical cliché indian movie, so dun expect to see songs or romance or melodrama. this ia a supremely crafted sensitive movie which resorts to silent expressions rather than over the top dialogs to get the point thru. witness the scene where the grandfather is told about the need to remove the child's eyes. the acting is superb, dialogs heart breaking. your heart goes out for the grandfather who has the unenviable task of telling the child and his mother about the operation. the handling of the subject has been excellent. the film was made under great hardship by the director, sandeep sawant who had to knock many doors to gather the rs. six million (approx. $130000) budget. even then the final product seems polished and has decent production values. also witness the subtle city village contrast shown by the director by incorporating some random shots of the boy's life in the village. sawant definitely seems to prefer village life.the acting by all is excellent. amruta subhash as the social worker is competent adding the required humane touch to her role. sandeep kulkarni as the docter is great, showing perfect mannerisms of a doctor. ashwin chitale as the child is a natural. he doesn't seem to be acting. everything about him is natural and does not seem forced.but towering above all is arun nalawade as the grandfather. he is astounding in his role. mere words cannot describe his work. it is a performance to cherish forever.shwaas is a sincere effort to make good cinema. it should not be ignored just for the fact that it shows that if things are kept simple, the the results can be really surprising. 10/10.

this is a very touching movie. this is a story about a special bond between a child and his grandfather. a villager (arun nalawade) brings his grandson, parashuram, to the city to get his eyes treated. but comes to know that parashuram (aswin chitale) has some rare cancer of eyes and has to undergo an operation and will lose both his eyes. the movie is all about the emotions and the turmoil both them go through and how they accept the whole thing. the movie avoid any melodrama and tells this story in a simple way. though the movie is in marathi, language is not a barrier at all.it proves that to make good movie you do not need item songs, superstars and usual masala. excellent performances. this is india's entry for oscars 2004. hope it gets the nomination at least. would rate 10/10.

probably the best comedy in a long time. keeps you laughing nonstop! the acting is good and there are a lot of hilarious cameos such as ben stiller as the guitar store guy. the plot wasn't as good as i had hoped but the comedy makes up for that. i can only hope for a sequel cause it seems like they can still do so much more. even though it was 1 hour and 40 minutes long i still wanted more at the end :) also there is a scene after the credits which is actually one of my favorite parts of the movie!! i suggest this to anyone who loves a good comedy and definitely suggest it to fans of the d or jack black. you should buy the album also, the songs are so damn catchy and hilarious, the music on it is top notch as well.

calling all d-sciples! grab your friends, hit the theater and see the hell out of this movie. from the opening sequence until after the credits you'll be laughing your self breathless. this movie is a wild ride through the history of the d, and not just some bull-crap list of the things they've done, but a chronicling of their rise to power. i am a huge fan of rage kage(kyle gass) and jables(jack black), so naturally i loved the movie. it helps to know about the show they had, and their first cd, but it's just as funny if you don't. from the hilarious and vulgar lyrics, the rocking rhythms, the massive amount of pot smoking, and the cameos, down to the outright insanity that is the story line, this is a movie for d-sciples and newbies alike. many of their songs are referenced, such as two kings, tribute, and kielbasa to their many audio tracks like cock push-ups, every fan in the audience will be saying i remember that as well as new comers saying "that's f'ing hilarious!." i highly recommend this movie to any body that's ever rocked out. this movie is certainly in high competition for being the next "this is spinal tap." one of the best ever.

this film rocks...so hard...the cameos...the drug references...the sharing...the love...the rocking!!! when jack and kyle first met in tim robbins' "actors' gang" theater company years ago, who knew that such a legacy of awesome music and hilariousness would ensue?? all that door to door rocking paid off...although anyone who enjoys classic rock will get a major kick out of this film, i would definitely recommend renting the original 6 hbo episodes at your local video store before going to see the film in the cinema. they're on the tenacious d masterworks dvd, which is available for rent at pretty much every video store. there are some inside jokes in the film that refer to these earlier episodes that will add something more enjoyable to the overall viewing experience...

when i first heard that jack black and kyle gass would make a movie about their band i was freaking out! i love their music and i hoped that this movie would be really funny! now that i have watched it i can't really say that these hopes weren't satisfied but i think i expected more. the movie is full of tenacious d's great music and i really loved listening to all of it. there are a lot of great jokes and i just love the story, at least the first bit. i don't like the way the movie ends. the ending is very abrupt and in my opinion they could have extended that a bit more.overall i think it is a good movie to watch! everyone who likes rock music should watch it! it'll give you a good laugh!

i am a huge tenacious d fan, and i think this is not the funniest movie in the world, but the most entertaining. it's not laugh-a-minute but that's not what the d intended it to be. i went into the movie seeing all the hbo shows, memorized both albums, and that made it even more enjoyable. plenty of inside jokes from past tenacious d albums, and hbo shows. since i knew the new album already, i knew 40 minutes of the movie because it is a musical comedy. i would say it has the best first 5 minutes of any movie and the best last 5 minutes of any movie. hands down.see this movie now!

tenacious d: in the pick of destiny tells the fictional tale of the formation of the band tenacious d and their quest to find the pick of destiny, a guitar pick with supernatural powers made from the tooth of satan himself (played by dave grohl). jb (jack black) and kg (kyle gass), joined together by fate, must travel to the rock n' roll museum and steal the pick of destiny to become the greatest band on earth. the movie is hilarious and delivers non-stop laughs. jack black and kyle gass work perfectly together, having been real life friends and co-workers for over 20 years. the film is in part, a musical. all (or most) of the music was written and performed by the d. all of the songs are new material and many of them are classic. the soundtrack is definitely worth checking out. this film will be mostly appreciated by fans of tenacious d, but if you are not a fan of the d, i still think you will enjoy the movie. if you are a fan of the d, then you must see this movie. the acting isn't as bad as you may think, and the laughs and crudeness never stop coming. i highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to get their socks rocked off and laugh as hard as they have laughed in a long time. look out for cameos by dave grohl, ronnie james dio, meatloaf, ben stiller, amy poehler, tim robbins, john c. reilly, and neil hamburger. also, stay tuned for an extra scene after the credits.

a very funny look at some of australia's current affairs and political goings-on. the chaser boys really seem to have fun with this show, and what i enjoy is that they all have their strengths; some are brilliant (chas) at making complete idiots of themselves, whereas julian can pull off the whole "i'm interviewing a famous politician and i'm about to suggest that he disguise himself as a pot of jam" type of humour.they have great segments in the show taking the mick out of all sorts of aspects of australian culture such as our current affairs shows, our adverts and early morning tv programmes. some material is a bit tired and predictable, but overall it's a lot of fun to watch, and will leave you with a smile on your face.

everyone is a genius in something. albert einstien was a genius in science, william shakespeare was a genius in literature and the boys from the chasers war on everything are truly comedy geniuses. their satire tv show is a constant hit on the australian broadcast commission ( abc ). after a small start as a satire newspaper, the chasers popularity skyrocketed when given their own television show. never short on controversy with the cast members will do everything some of it even being arrested for. chris taylor going on sunrise, a very popular live morning television show and telling his partner to f***k off, creating a fake motorcade and driving into apec high security area and doing a very funny satire of a australian ad about nicotine by following smokers around yelling out "no gary no no gary no". while controversial the show is increably funny and worthy of running for years to come.

this show is non stop hilarity. the first joke will make u wet your pants. and thats probably the weakest joke of them all. i started watching it when the second half of season 2 started airing. and straight away. i'm hooked. only 2 weeks after i started watching. i've downloaded episodes and bought the dvd's. reoccurring clips such as "the ad road test" and "current affairs" are quiet hilarious. then there's the ad's they take off "use emo. use your own tears for more effective use" also funny in the politics side of things. nothing is wrong with them doing this. it's funny. any australians who don't find this funny. don't complain and don't watch it. all australian tune in wednesday at 9 on abc

when you think of brilliant australian comedy you don't think of skit shows (although i'm quite partial to a bit of 80's and 90's full frontal) or even sitcoms - you think of satire! something that we australians really know how to do well. (eg: front line, the micallef program) we know how to take the pi$$, and the chaser's war on everything, is a classic example of how to do it, and how to do it really well. i've been a huge fan of chris taylor and craig reucassel for a long time. i remember listening to them on triple j's afternoon show. they were, and remain, two of the funniest comedians around.although i was sad when they left triple j, i was excited to find out what they were investing so much time in that made them have to leave. (they were doing cnnnn and triple j at the same time, so i figured this was something much bigger) and what an amazingly hilarious show chaser is. biting political and social satire at it's best.i'm also pleased to say that it has recently received a much better time slot than friday nights and has been moved to wednesday nights right after spicks and specks. thank you abc!! finally i don't have to tape it! :)
