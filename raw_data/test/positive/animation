i went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine. i'll admit that i was reluctant to see it because from what i knew of ashton kutcher he was only able to do comedy. i was wrong. kutcher played the character of jake fischer very well, and kevin costner played ben randall with such professionalism. the sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions. this one did exactly that. the entire theater (which was sold out) was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie, and were moved to tears during the second half. while exiting the theater i not only saw many women in tears, but many full grown men as well, trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying. this movie was great, and i suggest that you go see it before you judge.

my boyfriend and i went to watch the guardian.at first i didn't want to watch it, but i loved the movie- it was definitely the best movie i have seen in sometime.they portrayed the uscg very well, it really showed me what they do and i think they should really be appreciated more.not only did it teach but it was a really good movie. the movie shows what the really do and how hard the job is.i think being a uscg would be challenging and very scary. it was a great movie all around. i would suggest this movie for anyone to see.the ending broke my heart but i know why he did it. the storyline was great i give it 2 thumbs up. i cried it was very emotional, i would give it a 20 if i could!

in this tv special jon is the one who needs a life. the highlight of his day is counting the tiles on the ceiling and rearranging his sock drawer. not content with this forever, jon takes garfield to a self help group in order to meet people. how many people will be interested in a loner 20-something who's best friend is a cat?after several failed attempts at getting a girl, including one cringeworthy dance scene that rivals david brents' fusion of flashdance and mc hammer in the office (disco's dead?, says jon), he is more than shocked to find a cute girl who is as much as a jerk as himself. naturally, they get on but garfield is worried that john will forget about him and prefer having kids to a cat. fortunately jon's new girlfriend is allergic to cats. with slicker animation than past tv specials, this feels like a longer episode of garfield and friends.

[contains spoilers!!!] garfield and his owner jon arbuckle were in a rut. they basically had no life at all. all they did was lay around and count the ceiling tiles. jon even organized his sock drawer according to color and fabric. he needed a life. so he consults a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. a singles' bar was a great place to start. unfortunately, when the music started and jon hit the dance floor, we see what made disco die: jon killed it. jon next tried to pick up girls at the video store. he ended up feeling down in the mouth. literally. the laundromat was no prize either when jon and his would-be date get a glimpse of each other's underwear. jon tried to act all buff at the beach, but soon he angered a real buff guy, which left jon feeling, once again, down in the mouth. literally. jon then tried to pick up girls walking and jogging by. no avail. jon pulled out a guitar and sings the blues. unfortunately when he mentioned his cat being fat, a fat man walked up and stomped jon's guitar. it was hopeless. fortunately for jon, an ad flashed on the tv: an ad for lorenzo's school for the personality impaired. it guaranteed a lifeless person to get a life in a few easy steps. jon and garfield attend the class. the building didn't exactly look the same way it did on tv, nor did lorenzo act as peppy as he did on tv. jon sat next to a pretty girl named mona. so while lorenzo taught his lessons of introducing yourself, checking your pulse, and pretending to speak a foreign language, jon and mona get to know one another. they leave together, forgetting all about garfield. at home, jon and mona just sat on the porch and talked. garfield was jealous of mona for fear that she would take jon away from him. garfield envisioned the future: jon and mona get married, she moves in, and soon she gives birth to a little arbuckle who is overjoyed at pulling garfield's tale. back to the present, garfield would not stand for it. he tried to get jon to get rid of mona, until she started scratching behind his ears. but then jon learned that mona was allergic to cats. so that was basically the end of their relationship. but they still saw each other every now and then, and garfield was sure to be with them. another hilarious garfield tv special! this one was made during the run of tv's garfield and friends. garfield was slimmed down somewhat. somewhat. since hie early 1980's cartoons. the scenes of jon trying to pick up chicks is funny, so is the one where the fat guy stomps on jon's guitar. good ol' lorenzo music is back as garfield. thom huge is jon. frank welker (the third man of 1,000 voices) is lorenzo. and june foray (the woman of 1,000 voices) is mona. if you like garfield, then i recommend you see garfield gets a life today! it, along with here comes garfield, and garfield on the town, were just released on dvd! so check them all out today! you are guaranteed a good time. hey, has garfield ever let you down before?-

let me just say - i love the horror genre to the extent that i see every single one that i can get my hands on regardless (except really low quality b-movie horrors which i could do without) and recently have become a big fan of eastern horrors. little did i know that a korean horror would be the one that tops my list beating off heavyweights such as the japanese ringu (or the american ring), or even quality us movies such as the sixth sense and the others, and the widely acclaimed hong kong horror 'the eye'.previously 'the ring' had stood as my favourite horror but it seems to me that i prefer the beauty of 'the tale of two sisters' any day - the story is extraordinary and rather open to interpretation thus allowing repeat viewings although chances are you'll want to watch this again and again just because the movie is so masterfully shot... the story is likely one of the best in the genre to date. the acting is top notch too from the entire cast and the scares when they come have the potential to rattle you like anything within the ring - i did find myself glued to the screen at those points unable to take my eyes off. still i am glad it didn't come back to haunt me later that sadako/samara did from the ring - after all such feelings are unpleasant and the tale of two sisters leaves you with an uneasy feeling, but one that hopefully won't leave you without sleep but leave you satisfied that you have seen something quite special. but do remember.. if you don't understand the plot after the first viewing, a repeat viewing is more than advised.. i personally didn't have time for this since it was late so i flicked through scenes on the dvd, some numerous times until i had a good synopsis in my head and after looking on the net, seemed ihad pretty much nailed it on the widely agreed interpretation. and the satisfaction from solving a puzzle like that is wonderful.all in all - a masterfully crafted horror that is unlikely to produce the same 'level' remake (its been purchased by dreamworks) simply because of the korean content and everyone is advised to catch this in the theaters or on dvds while they can... its one of the best you will get. unfortunately due to the type of movie this is, there is no way to even talk about the story without spoilers so its best to do what i did - watch it without knowing a single thing except its 'a tale of two sisters'! and be prepared for something that is unlikely to be matched for some time.

this movie certainly deserves to be placed within the genre of horror, but not for obvious reasons. the horror of "a tale of two sisters" lies not with sudden shocks or large helpings of cgi guts and gore; it is a psychological horror movie which piques the viewer's curiosity from the start and builds a suspenseful aura of mystery and questions throughout. best of all, the ending does not provide a clear answer, pushing the viewer to analyse what they have seen and make up their own mind about what really took place.do not be put off by the seemingly slow pace at which the movie begins, and don't expect to be jumping out of your seat immediately. this is not the conventional hack-and-slash movie with orchestral stings designed to make you scared of nothing in particular. "a tale of two sisters" slowly builds an atmosphere of terror, a terror of the unknown and a fear of things which evade explanation until the very end. even when the final conclusion is revealed, it is not so heavy-handed and obvious as to make the entire film fall neatly into place. the movie requires its viewer to reflect back on what they have seen and to try and square this with the frightening revelation of the final scene. some things will still be open to interpretation, and this is one of the joys of watching a film such as this.the true fear of "a tale of two sisters" lies not in shocks or conspicuous scares; it is a psychological, gut-wrenching horror that defies convention and expands a genre to proportions hitherto unexplored by the traditional horror film. it is no exaggeration to say that this film stands apart even from the so-called 'asian horror' genre. indeed, it would be a mistake to align "a tale of two sisters" with films like "ringu" and "the grudge". this movie can be understood from a variety of standpoints, some requiring no suspension of credulity, others embracing the supernatural wholeheartedly.whichever way you choose to interpret this film, it is one that demands an open-minded approach, rewarding viewers regardless of their preconceived notions on asian cinema or horror in general.

every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie. this movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be.the plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about what's going on and you really want to view it for the second time. but after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be.a word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie. this is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie, in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b**bs and lots of blood.if you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports dolby digital or dts 5.1ch, without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation. and don't forget to switch the light off.my points on different aspects:-direction = 9/10 acting = 8/10 atmosphere = 10/10 sound effect = 9/10total = 9/10

many horror fans complain that horror has scarcely progressed in the last twenty years. i was inclined to agree with this until the influx of asian horror films, a trend which has admittedly grown dull. however, it has produced some true classics, and a tale of two sisters, for me at least, stands out as an exceptional piece of cinema, and perhaps the best horror film in a very long time.based vaguely on a korean folktale, it tells the sad story of two mentally-troubled sisters residing with their father and stepmother. after experiencing a few problems on their first night back at home, they determine to stick together and deny their stepmother access to their close relationship. the tension rises and there is the inevitable snap. but what happens after this requires more than a pair of eyes, as the story takes several twists, and the scares become more emotional and quite real. by the end, you may need a few moments to absorb it all and piece it together in your own mind, but it is exactly this pairing of horror and mystery that pushes it beyond the definitions of these genres and makes it an instant classic. one to watch again and again, if only to work it all out.

this isn't so much a review of a tale of two sisters as it is a discussion of some of the smaller plot details, so i advise you not to read this review if you haven't seen the film, because doing so will absolutely ruin a few surprises for you.in a way a tale of two sisters is far from original, at least from a purely superficial aspect - some of its iconography is taken straight from ring or dark water, while the storyline itself (especially what brendt sponseller calls the "rubber reality" aspect of the narrative) is reminiscent of films like fight club (lead character interacts with someone created in their mind), mulholland drive (character creates alternate reality in a psychogenic fugue), as well as other minor aspects of lost highway, jacob's ladder, and basically every film under the sun dealing with mental illness, plus amenabar's films (the others, abre los ojos), memento (particularly with regards to the torturous nature of memory), et al. thankfully all these similarities do not detract from the film's overall emotional impact, and i personally found a tale of two sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experience.many people have commented on the "confusing" nature of the narrative, but i personally found the storyline to be fairly self-explanatory, even if it is in part portrayed in a non-sequential manner. the narrative only becomes confusing for some because, midway through the final third, the story switches from a purely subjective setting (ie. soo-mi's warped perception of reality) to an objective one, with a flashback at the end explaining the origins of soo-mi's nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness. the shift in emphasis is bound to throw some people off guard, but structurally i found it somewhat reminiscent of aforementioned mulholland drive (even though we're not dealing with a character's perception of reality via a dream but instead their own schizophrenic tendencies - something which, in turn, reminded me of another lynch movie, lost highway). to be honest, i don't really regard a tale of two sisters as a horror movie as such, but rather a tragic story of a family's breakdown as well as an honest look at a character's mental illness (and i hasten to add that fans of psychoanalytical cinema are going to love this film).that aside, the cinematography in a tale of two sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films i've seen this side of wong kar wai's 2046. the performances are also fantastic without exception, and i expect to see more of the four lead actors in the future; not to mention the music, but then east asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be few and far between these days.it's very likely that some people will look past the finer artistic points of a tale of two sisters and simply dismiss it as "yet another asian horror film", oblivious to its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytical approach. but then each to their own. if you can ignore some of the film's platitudinous aspects and simply take it for what it is at heart, ie. an extremely tragic, heart-breaking story, then i see no reason not to recommend it.

alfred hitchcock's more assured telling of a film he made twenty-one years earlier is infinitely superior to the original. hitchcock said himself that his first version was the work of an amateur, and although it certainly isn't a bad film, he does appear to be right. that being said, this remake, although definitely better, still isn't among hitchcock's best work. that's certainly not to say that it isn't good, it's just more than a little overindulgent, and that drags it down. hitchcock seems all too keen to drag certain elements out, and these are parts of the film that aren't entirely relevant to the plot, which can become annoying. some of these dragged out sequences, such as the one that sees james stewart and doris day eating in a moroccan restaurant are good because it helps establish the different culture that our american protagonists have found themselves in, but for every restaurant scene, there's an opera sequence and it's the latter that make the film worse.the plot follows a middle-aged doctor and his wife that go to morocco for a holiday with their young son. while there, they meet a french man on the bus and another middle-aged couple in a restaurant. however, things go awry when the french man dies from a knife in the back, shortly after whispering something to the doctor. the holiday then turns into a full blown nightmare when the couple's son is kidnapped, which causes them to cut it short and go to london in order to try and find him. the film has a very potent degree of paranoia about it, and it manages to hold this all the way through. in fact, i would even go as far as to say that this is the most paranoid film that hitchcock ever made. like most of hitchcock's films, this one is very thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire duration, with only the aforementioned opera sequence standing out as a moment in which the tension is diffused. there is also more than a little humour in the movie, which gives lighthearted relief to the morbid goings on, and actually works quite well.the original version of this story was lent excellent support by the fantastic peter lorre. this film doesn't benefit from his presence, unfortunately, but that is made up for by performances from the amazing james stewart, and doris day. james stewart is a man that is always going to be a contender for the 'greatest actor of all time' crown. his collaborations with hitchcock all feature mesmerising performances from him, and this one is no different. (although his best performance remains the one in mr smith goes to washington). stewart conveys all the courage, conviction and heartbreak of a man that has lost his child and would do anything to get him back brilliantly. in fact, that's one of the best things about this film; you are really able to feel for the couple's loss throughout and that serves in making it all the more thrilling. doris day, on the other hand, is a rather strange casting choice for this movie. she's definitely a good actress, but she's more associated with musicals and seeing her in a thriller is rather odd (even if she does get to flex her vocal chords a little).as i've mentioned; this is not hitchcock's best film, but there's much to enjoy about it and although i'd recommend many hitchcock films before recommending this one, i'll definitely give it two thumbs up as well.

the original the man who knew too much brought alfred hitchcock acclaim for the first time outside of the united kingdom. of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that folks marveled how hitchcock on such a skimpy budget as compared to lavish hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen. the original film was shot inside a studio.for whatever reason he chose this of all his films to remake, hitchcock now with an international reputation and a big hollywood studio behind him (paramount)decided to see what the man who knew too much would be like with a lavish budget. this is shot on location in marrakesh and london and has two big international names for box office. this was james stewart's third of four hitchcock films and his only teaming with doris day and her only hitchcock film.i do wonder why hitchcock never used doris again. at first glance she would fit the profile of blond leading ladies that hitchcock favored. possibly because her wholesome screen image was at odds with the sophistication hitchcock also wanted in his blondes. doris does some of her best acting ever in the man who knew too much. her best scene is when her doctor husband james stewart gives her a sedative before telling her their son has been kidnapped by an english couple who befriended them in morocco. stewart and day play off each other beautifully in that scene. but doris especially as she registers about four different emotions at once. day and stewart are on vacation with their son christopher olsen in morocco and they make the acquaintance of frenchman daniel gelin and the aforementioned english couple, bernard miles and brenda dabanzie. gelin is stabbed in the back at a market place in marrakesh and whispers some dying words to stewart about an assassination to take place in albert hall in london. their child is snatched in order to insure their silence.for the only time i can think of a hit song came out of a hitchcock film. doris in fact plays a noted singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother. the song was que sera sera and i remember it well at the age of 9. you couldn't go anywhere without hearing it in 1956, it even competed with the fast rising elvis presley that year. que sera sera won the academy award for best song beating out such titles as true love from high society and the title song from around the world in 80 days. it became doris day's theme song for the rest of her life and still is should she ever want to come back.in fact the song is worked quite nicely into the plot as doris sings it at an embassy party at the climax.instead of doing it with mirrors, hitchcock shot the assassination scene at the real albert hall and like another reviewer said it's not directed, it's choreographed. you'll be hanging on your seats during that moment.this was remake well worth doing.

anyone who has ever gone on an audition can certainly relate to this one. great story of an aspiring actor and the pressures he must deal with both personally and professionally in order to make it to the big time. lou myers, as half-step wilson, provides many hilarious moments.

many funny scenes about the people that you don't normally pay attention to in a movie and what they have to do to get work and what happens once they do. lou myers was very funny as half-step wilson. any guy that has a tight group of friends can relate to many of the non-movie related scenes scattered throughout the movie.

this western was set in 1861 and had to do with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines that were laid by western union. while nice guy dean jagger (sporting lots of hair) did his best to get this done, there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons. so, it's up to either randolph scott or robert young to save the day.this is certainly one of the better 1940s westerns i have seen and it nearly garnered an 8--it was that good. however, for the life of me, i have no idea why fritz lang was assigned to direct this film--after all, he knew nothing about westerns. his forte was drama--and i guess this movie is a drama of sorts--just set in the old west. strange, yes, but it seemed to work out okay, though i wonder how this great german director felt about being given this job.as for the rest of the film, it's exceptional--with vivid color, great location shooting and very good acting. as usual, randolph scott put in another relaxed and realistic performance. i was surprised, though, with robert young being also cast in the film, but it was a good casting decision--he was supposed to be a harvard-educated easterner. when i saw barton maclane was also in the film, i pretty much assumed he'd be the "baddie" and my thoughts were well founded, since he made a career out of playing jerks! as for the script, it seemed pretty ordinary for the most part, but the final showdown between scott and barton maclane was a lot better than i'd hoped--making this movie ending on a very high note.

western union tells in melodramatic fashion the stringing of telegraph lines between two points out west. siblings dean jagger and virginia gilmore work for western union, and randolph scott and robert young work for the creightons. indians and some bad white guys get in the way, but nothing can stop america's progress. this sense of manifest destiny is greatly enhanced by a first-rate musical score and vibrant color photography. scott is a bank robber looking to mend his ways, and both he and engineer young vie for the attention of the perky gilmore. lots of great character actors help keep the large production moving forward.

this is a sort of hidden gem. it has little to no promotion, no fanfare, no classic status, and it deserves all of the above! one of the great directors of cinema, fritz lang, has created a real gem in this excellent western. a fine cast led by randolph scott (in probably one of his greatest performances), the always sturdy dean jagger, robert young as a surprisingly accomplished dude plus many veteran character actors: chill wills, slim summerville, john carradine, barton maclane and others in an exciting zane grey story of the laying of the western union cable across country. it has tense drama, sprinklings of humor and great effects. it's reminiscent of demille in ways and yet fritz lang leaves his own stamp on it. at very least this is a damned good western!

here's another of the 1940's westerns that i watch whenever it comes on tcm or fmc, because although it may be flawed historically, it is extremely entertaining and well acted, plus it's got randolph scott, my favorite actor second only to gary cooper-well, ok, fourth behind coop, charlton heston, and gregory peck. but the film itself, to me anyway, is reasonably historically accurate and as i said before, well acted and "flows" very well-i bet i've seen it 50 or 60 times, and enjoy each viewing more than the one before. i have it on tape from tcm but would buy it in a minute if it ever came out on dvd. see it if you haven't- i guarantee you'll like it!

lang does hawks as well as hawks does in the first part of this extraordinary western, before settling down into typical deterministic, dark and guilt-haunted lang for the finale.this is one of those films that shows its greatness almost instantly but at the same time very subtly. vance shaw (randolph scott) is on horseback and being pursued, we know not why -- he stumbles on wounded edward creighton (dean jagger) and decides to take his gun and horse, but discovering that creighton is in a bad way, decides to fix him up first. this is conveyed mostly through facial expressions and very brief, clipped dialog - in 2 minutes we know that shaw is an outlaw, but basically a good guy. shaw ends up helping creighton on his way to civilization, then disappears.cut to a few weeks or months later, with creighton on the mend and in charge of an expedition to lay telegraph wire going west from omaha. he hires shaw as a scout, who tries to leave when he finds out that creighton is in charge; but creighton wants him anyway, repaying a debt and sensing something quality. also hired is a tenderfoot, son of a benefactor of the project, but atypically the easterner richard blake (robert young) is quite competent as he shows right away in an amusing but exciting bronco-busting sequence. both of the hires vie for creighton's sister sue (virginia gilmore) who - again not typically - seems quite as able to take care of herself as any man. the camaraderie between the three men, the comedic elements involving an unwilling cook and various rough and tumble types, and the wonderfully played light romantic elements dominate the first third of the film and reminded me more of howard hawks' "red river" or "only angels have wings" than most lang - but they are so well played and the action progresses so naturally that it doesn't matter, and doesn't alter our pleasure - if it does perhaps change our expectations - as the more usual langian themes of the haunted past, dark secrets and the immense pull of the easier, destructive and evil ways come to dominate the later part of the film. shaw's old pals come back to haunt him as the the wagon train and its wires move westward; attacks mount on the crew, and shaw has to wrestle with what, if anything, he is to tell creighton about his tortured relationship with jack slade (barton maclane), leader of the outlaws.beautifully shot in early technicolor and moving fairly seamlessly from sound stages to western locations, this is for my money easily lang's best western and one of his very best films, conveying as potently as any of his films the tragic inability of men to escape their pasts and build a new future. scott is as good as i've seen him, showing more with a flick of an eye than a lot of actors can do in a paragraph of dialog, and the rest of the cast is uniformly fine. the inevitable showdown between shaw's past criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary, and a surprise even for a longtime lang devotee such as myself; and even in 1941 it seems there was no place more fraught with meaning on the margins of civilization than the barbershop and the dusty street outside. you can get a shave, you can feel like a new man, but you can't really ever be one as long as the old ties are still holding you back.genius.

what's fun about barker's nightbreed is that it's the story of a human on a rampage, a deadly threat to monsters everywhere. in this one, the monsters (the night breed of the title) are the "good" guys. it shares its sense of celebrating the different, the twisted, and the dark with the first addams family movie, and much of tim burton's work. it also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by barker.especially fun is the performance by cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the nightbreed. as happens in most classic monster movies, the villagers surround the monsters' castle with torches and pitchforks. only this time, the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic "weapons" with guns and bombs. and this time the sympathy you felt when you saw frankenstein's monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the movie.this isn't a masterpiece, and even barker has done more interesting, and certainly more chilling, work. but it's pure fun, it looks great, and remains light without mocking itself. worth a look!

i was peeved that the best make-up academy award went to dick tracy, a horrible film with horrible make-up. the nightbreed (based on the better titled "cabal" novella) look terrific, the acting is excellent and david chroneburg makes for a truly creepy and terrific antagonist.the plot focus's on aaron boone, who has recurring nightmares about a society of monsters living under a cemetery. is he making it up or are they real and calling to him? his pyschologist (chroneburg) convinces him he's a murderer, a slayer of families.troubled and suicidal, boone seeks refuge in midian but the monsters don't want him at first. he is also tracked by his girlfriend, lori who refuses to give up on him even after he dies and comes back cold and monstrous.but decker isn't about to let boone continue on. he raises the locals on an all out assault on midian, like a holy war in gods name led by the devil.barkers themes of misunderstood monsters may come from his experiences as a homosexual male, but they are always strong and honest. nightbreed turns the genre on it's head. the monsters are just trying to survive and want to be left alone, but man is hunting them.a 20+ minute longer cut was originally submitted by barker, but the studio chopped it into this fractured masterpiece. barker is hard at work trying to locate the missing footage for a directors cut release. until then, this version will have to do.

it is interesting to see what people think of this movie, since it is, in fact, quite unique (though it bears some of the trademarks of clive barker's writing). even though it might seem a bit cynical to say so, the movie is just intricate enough to deflect those that need standard hollywood plot hooks, and layered, so that if you expect to be fed, you will see a normal monster flick with lots of monsters and a disjointed plot.those who need a linear, specific and untangled plot line will hate this movie, because the story lies, like in the novella, partially between the lines, or in this case, partially off screen, in comments and the imagination.another possible hang-up is the ending, of which i can say, without spoiling it, that it is not entirely good and not entirely bad. it is, in fact, not very defined at all, which i know sends some people into raging tantrums about that they didn't get to know what happened, but to me, and to many others, i'm sure, just adds another dimension to the story - the dimension of speculation, and, in addition, the point that great disruption has a tendency to cause ripples that extend quite far.there is definitely moral here, but of a rather different kind than the standard hollywood in-your-face-at-the-end-of-the-movie sort of display. summing that moral up is simple, even though it is not quite that simply displayed; prejudice and the human tendency to hate the different.i love this movie, even though, as many of the reviewers have noted, the expressions of the actors (with the exception of david cronenberg, who does a wonderful appearance) are rather tacky. i'm not sure they are entirely to blame for their rickety appearance and lack of depth, though, seeing that these are common problems in converting literature to screenplay.all in all, this is a great movie, provided that you do not expect it to be a standard horror movie.

this movie was really well written and was very entertaining.there was great acting in it too. luke perry did a very convincing job. (like he always does)if you are looking for a eventful movie to watch this should be at the top of your list. there is a mixture of comedy, drama, and action. you can literally feel what the actors are feeling at points. i was very impressed by this movie. the special effects were very well done. the whole movie was very convincing. this movie is one of my favorites. what happens is north america could be torn apart and jack and his team have to try and to stop an eruption by destroying north america. it was a very cool and creative idea. i loved this movie and i know you will too.

this is a story of a long and awkward love. the daily life of a woman of 50 years old and some people around her is depicted. her daily life is so ordinary and routine that i doubted who was the real lead character in the beginning. then the audiences know that the woman and a man who was her high-school class mate had very tiny connection. the woman has been doing the same job - a milk-woman and a supermarket casher - so long. there are so many slopes that delivering milk bottles is a very hard job. the man had married another woman, who is now dying of cancer. he works at the city hall and devotedly cares her at home. they never look straight nor talk each other, but they never forget each other. the original japanese title means "at some time the days you read books". but of course when the man said "now i want to do what i've always wanted to do", it was to hug her and make love with her. she writes to a radio disk jockey that "if god gives us time to talk, we need at least a whole day". dreaming of that day, she has been sublimating the desire in hard work and book reading. i personally know a woman who has loved a man for long years, even after he married another woman and died for an accident. therefore the story setting is not that special. rather, this movie well portrays unspoken romances in many ordinary men and women. through this movie, you will recall your romance that is lost long ago. this is a movie with lasting effect.

the storyline of the milkwoman is a simple one of unrequited love that despite the passing of decades still remains strong. now 50 years old, minako obha (yuko tanaka) lives alone and works two jobs  one as a checkout clerk in a supermarket, the other as a milklady, doing her daily round on the hills of nagasaki. one of her stops is at the house of kaita takanashi (ittoku kishibe), a government official who tends to his terminally ill wife yoko (akiko nishina). minako and kaita used to see each other as school children, but after the death of minako's mother and kaita's father, who it seems were having an affair together, their own relationship was destroyed. lying in her sick bed, yoko knows however that her husband's feelings for the milklady aren't completely gone and, for the sake of kaita after she has died, she attempts to engineer a means of bringing them back together.while the story might be simple, the emotions it deals with and the means by which it expresses them is really where the heart and beauty of the film lie. the film takes its time to show the simple daily routines of each of the characters, their actions being recorded by an old lady who is writing their story for a book while looking after her own husband who is showing signs of dementia. in the process it depicts the social circumstances of people from different ways of life, how they interact with each other on a daily basis, how relationships form, and how past and present can collide. the director handles this marvellously with a strong structure and visual style. it's only later in the film that the story starts to follow a more conventional and inevitably melodramatic path, as if it is indeed being constructed to fit the narrative structure of the book that is being written. it's all validated by the emotional depths the film touches, represented most effectively in the exceptional performance of yuko tanaka.

i guess those who have been in a one-sided relationship of some sort before will be able identify with the lead character minako (yuko tanaka), a 50 year old woman who is still in the pink of good health, as demonstrated by her daily, grinding routine of waking up extremely early in the morning to prepare for her milk delivery work, where she has to lug bottles of megmilk in a bag in a route around her town like clockwork, to exchange empty bottles for full ones, and to collect payment and issue receipt. and there's always be that one delivery stop that's right at the top, needing to scale a long flight of stairs in order to achieve customer satisfaction.and peculiar enough, that stop happened to be a stop delivering to a man with whom she has been in love with for almost all her teenage to adult life, and not having the product appreciated, but poured down the sink. having gone to the same school, we see that they're not talking to each other, and in their daily life always seem so close physically, but yet so far away. there's no eye contact, save for cursory glances by chance, and little acknowledgement of each other's existence. we learn that they share a past that probably destroyed all notions of being together, where clear attraction between the two was hampered from developing further by the earlier generation.while i thought minako was an interesting woman in herself, one who has kept her feelings suppressed for so long, one can only wonder what kind of damage it would do. if i read that the original japanese title means "at some time the days you read books" and it's accurate, i felt the movie had a wonderful finale with that shot of her well stocked bookcase, likely alluding to the fact that she's not alone after all, and had probably fallen back on her crutch of sorts to deal with the pain of being alone, and back to a lifestyle which she had already been accustomed to for 50 years. besides immersing herself in two jobs, she has those books which serve as a form of escapism, and occasionally pens little sweet nothings to song dedication shows on the radio.yuko tanaka did a commendable job as the emotionally strong woman resigned to her fate and her decision to love none other, her object of affection, takanashi (ittoku kishibe) was a more interesting character who has more facets. staying true to marriage vows, he spends significant amount of screen time looking after his sickly bedridden wife (played by akiko nishina), while juggling with his job of social welfare in the children's affairs department in city hall. i felt that as a childless couple, the job provided him a means to care, not for his own, but for other people's children, the troubled ones who are neglected and left to fend for themselves. in a rare moment of rage, we see how he angrily chides such wayward parents who don't appreciate and wastes their children's lives away.the story by kenji aoki provides little quirks to make its characters appeal and successfully attempted to provide a lot more glimpses and dimension into them as well, such as how takanashi is a hopeless haiku poet despite being a member of the haiku club, and supporting characters such as the aged minagawa couple, where masao (koichi ueda) lent some comical though sad moments as he slowly turned senile, while wife toshiko (misako watanabe) narrates and brings us through this love story of a single woman at 50. even akiko nishina's performance as the bedridden wife was nothing short of arresting, with her character's enlightened state of knowing her husband's past, and making unselfish, and painful decisions in her sickly state.it's what you can expect from a typical japanese romantic movie, sans young, nubile leads as star-crossed lovers, but with all other elements in place such as romantic set ups, love songs and those quintessential restrained but affectionate behaviour. i thought the story was in danger of going down the beaten track when unrequited love gets consummated, but director akira ogata managed to steer clear of the usual melodramatic moments in such stories, though the story did call for some obvious plot development into the final act that you can predict, especially if you're already way past your romance movie 101.not being your average lovey-dovey story, i thought the milkwoman told a strong story with unrequited love as a central theme, and frankly a recommended romance movie (though told at a measured pace) if you're in the mood for some bittersweet loving, reminiscence, and seeking to live without regrets.

lead actor yuko tanaka fulfills so much in the exceptionally meditative "the milkwoman," a tranquil canvass on missed chances in the life of a 50-something woman, charting her routine with sincerely poignant motives. played out in the picturesque, tranquil town of nagasaki, akira ogata's unconventional romantic film, so to speak, is less a straight-out melodrama than a deliberate introspection of its characters' surrender to their current lives as a result of a tragic past that forced them to a choice they did not call for.perfectly embodying the requisite world-weariness subjected to a spiritless routine, tanaka plays minako oba, a middle-aged woman who, before her work shift at a supermarket, takes it upon herself to deliver bottles of milk among the residents of the hilly nagasaki. one of the houses she constantly passes by to make such a delivery is that of kaita takanashi (ittoku kishibe), a local government employee caring for her terminally ill wife (akiko nishina). minako and kaita were high school sweethearts who, courtesy of an ignominious event concerning their parents, separated ways since then.opening his film with the foreboding narration of a young minako vowing never to leave nagasaki, ogata does as such with the narrative, patiently sticking with minako as he, deftly aided by tanako's understated yet highly effective performance, follows her -- whether she's having chitchat with her aunt (misako watanabe) on being single, or when she jogs up and down the countless footsteps of their hilly town to distribute milk -- as she and kaita gradually overcome the hindrances that kept them apart for years. such unhurried development may not suit viewers weaned on fast-paced narratives but for the rest, it's a heartfelt introspection that affects powerfully and emphatically.

when i first heard of this movie, i was mildly interested. the plot seemed like an opportunity for hilarity and bam margera as an actor and director seemed like something that might be good. when i found out the movie starred ryan dunn, i was even further interested (i was a fan of homewrecker when it was on... yeah, i'm that lame). however, i didn't have much faith in it being to good. when i sat down to watch it, i was afraid i was wasting my time.but even just five minutes it it became apparent that i'd been wrong.i thought that the comedy of this film was delightfully idiotic, and definitely not suited for all kinds of people. the acting was rather good, much better than my expectations. i thought that it was rather easy to relate to ryan's character, which gave the movie a center that was believable. this is key in a movie as outrageous as this (and is probably why i was not a fan of borat).the movie is not suitable at all for younger people, duh, and will definitely create more than it's fair share of awkward turtles if watched with parents. but it's a good one for you and your buddies on a movie night.

i didn't know what to expect from this. i always considered bam margera and the cky crew a team of knuckle heads devoted to to doing stupid things for entertainment. i didn't know that they could act. but everyone who acted in this movie pulled off good performances. the hilarity of the 'aaaaagh!' scene mixes in with ryan dunn's depression and his revenge against his ex-girlfriend perfectly. at times the movie some scenes seem pointless but at the same time they're funny. i recommend this to anyone who likes a good laugh but this film may not appeal to those that prefer detailed story lines and a series of twists and turns.

with boundless, raw energy and an uncompromising vision, talk radio brilliantly explores the public's fondness for reducing strangers' private problems into entertainment via the radio.eric bogosian is sensational as barry champlaine, a rude, in-your-face talk radio host. he's a natural for this kind of role, and fine tunes one of the most impressive, interesting radio personalities i've ever seen on screen. the timing and delivery of his insults to his various callers are strokes of genius.alec baldwin also shines as barry's boss. he demonstrates the same explosive cynicism that he would later display 1992's glengarry glen ross. but the supporting role that truly stands out is the stoned, seemingly brain-dead teen played by michael wincott. you have to see it to believe it.oliver stone and robert richardson do a great job with the photography, which is almost entirely confined to a single broadcasting room. the claustrophobic feel of the movie perfectly mirrors its tone. after all, one of the major points of the film is exploiting people's private moments to draw an audience. stone demonstrates that these moments are often too private for the whole world to experience.talk radio is a film with strong emotional and cerebral impact - the likes of which are seldom seen today.

eric bogosian gives as great a performance as you'll ever see in an oliver stone film. his barry character is an assault rifle disguised as a man and he blows away anyone, on or off the air, that offends him. adapted from bogosian's stage play, "talk radio" is a vicious and frightening ride that doesn't let you off until it's too late. by then, you've become familiar with the fringe of racists, rapists, paranoids, wannabe assassins and mere prank callers who listen, speak and lurk in the dark of dallas nights. stone behaves himself, if that's even possible, letting bogosian dominate every scene, from barry's humble beginnings to the make or break point when his radio show can reach national syndication. the rest of the cast are uniformly excellent as the lovers and/or co-workers that all have being used and tossed aside by barry in common. the only thing i'd change is the recurring theme music, "bad to the bone". i'd have used bachman-turner overdrive's "not fragile". a better song, one i haven't heard in a film so far and a driving, relentless tune whose ominous riff is like the true soundtrack to barry's life.listen if you dare!

talk radio sees a man somewhat accidentally stumble through life, indeed the american dream, from whatever bog-standard and everyday job he has in a store; to presenter of a local radio show before going right the way through to the same job only later syndicated nationwide. it's a role he adopts out of his own aggression and natural mannerisms, a frothing mad approach to freedom of speech as he attacks just about everyone and everything, even those that often call up to agree with him or compliment him. his role as a man that rants on all things good, evil, right, wrong, political, religious, moral and immoral is something that people seem to take to in one form; that of 'it's entertaining and worth tuning in for', but additionally on a plane of rejection and antagonism  two things born out of the very things seemingly encouraged in professional working life in the western world. this, towards a man as he gets to the very top of his game by way of the american dream and dealing in freedom of speech as people take to a man but do anything but take to what it is he says.talk radio begins with a montage of tall, towering buildings in a business based area of dallas, texas. the skyscrapers are shot from a ,ow angle and tower over the viewer plus everything else in the general vicinity as this voice of one man tears through the images, belting out statements and information on items as these monolithic buildings dominate out screen. they are the very physical representation of capitalism, while the voice of what we learn to be a radio dj is the oral representation of the free west; personal speech and opinions on anything and everything. stone will finish his film in the exact same manner in which he started it, although the film is anything but a circular journey of any sort as the characters undergo monumental changes in both what they witness and their general livelihood. rather, the shots of the buildings act as an anchor around which the study is observed. the ideologies and ideas of a way of life exist; people subscribe to them, but it does them more harm than good; before the re-establishment that this proud way of life still exists and will continue to exist in churning out the sorts of people on display in the film until someone or something drastically changes things.the dj is barry champlain, a man with a radio show on a local texan station dealing with just about anything. champlain's somewhat carefree attitude to some pretty explosive content is established when he flies from one call with a bigoted man whom recently visited a holocaust museum to a young drug addict whose girlfriend has supposedly overdosed and onto both the berating and mocking of a pizza shop. to us, the content comes across as quite shocking; to these people, everything seems to be business as usual which plants some serious seeds of both doubt and horror within the minds of us, the newcomers to all of this.what barry's show is about, nobody ever seems to really establish: everything and nothing. indeed, time is taken in the form of either jingles or dialogue that the shows immediately pre and post champlain's show are on specific subjects; gardening, for instance, and are hosted by calm speaking and methodical people whom, i'm sure, do not flit from one random or extreme to another all the time raising the stakes. one wonders what barry's jingle is, the kind that plays around about lunch time during someone else's' show: "coming up later, the barry champlain show! featuring the village idiot and psychotic drug abusers!" indeed, his show's introductory piece carries a matter-of-fact tone, a shouting at the audience, as a loud rock track accompanies it.barry's success arrives in the national syndication proposal. it's born out of confrontation and a relationship built on the contempt he has for his listeners and that they have for him. the furthering of the material and the upping of the stakes ought to call into question just how far they think they can take this, and whether this progressing down a track for sake of entertainment is really worth it. it is when the show reaches this level of broadcast that barry seems to come unstuck for the first time in his broadcasting life, when a supposed serial rapist calls in and leaves mostly everyone slightly stunned. it's at this point the camera pauses on barry, and by way of depth of focus, encompasses those same looming, towering buildings the film began with which stand outside of the window, directly behind barry. they remain tall and proud. specifically, of the ideologies they've been built on and this furtherance of freedom of speech in broadening barry's show nationwide as one man climbs his profession's ladder suddenly clashes with the sort of content that's being offered. everything reaches a point too far, and that with freedom, ought to at least come a sense of clarity rather than a mere revelling.oliver stone made talk radio right in the middle of both a fascinating and explosive period of film-making he had in the late 1980s. in this time, he produced a series of really well received films in a pretty short space of time; beginning with one of my favourite war films in platoon before continuing with the quite brilliant wall street and eventually finishing with 1991's jfk. one might even say that this run continued on into the mid-nineties with natural born killers. talk radio is like its lead character in the sense it's loud, booming, stark and confrontational. it isn't anti-capitalism, as much as it is focused on drawing a line between what is perceived as entertainment and what is just going too far for sake of popularity and riches. talk radio is certainly a film that sticks in the memory.

excellent and highly under-rated from beginning to end. one of oliver's best. well scripted, directed, shot, acted and stuarts copeland's soundtrack (trivia: the music during the end credits vaguely sounds like a late 90's pop hit by "spacehog" band eric and cast are brilliant, let alone the callers. what a whirlwind of emotions. it make's your hair stand on end. (..."necks will be broke and whips will crack"--in a old female southern accent.. yike! creepy. scary than any horror movie.10 out of 10em

in this episode, locke and eko go searching for the "?" symbol that we saw during the lock-down on a previous episode. michael, having shot ana lucia and libby, struggles with his actions as libby inches closer to death.the most interesting thing about this episode (i think). is during the commercial break. locke and eko find a hatch under the plane that killed boone in season one, and a new training video ends with "copyright, the hanso foundation, 1989" in a following commercial break, a rather bizarre and nondescript commercial advertises "the hanso foundation" (a planted commercial), and the website advertised (www.sublymonal.com) leads the visitor through a world of information about life on the outside of lost's storyline. a must see for all fans!

the second "mr. eko" episode has somewhat less interesting flashbacks than the first ("the 23rd psalm"), but in just about every other department it is one of the best episodes of season 2, advancing the series' mythology/background as well as the characters. a new dharma initiative station - the pearl - is discovered by locke and eko, and the orientation film that they find and watch inside completes locke's transformation from a believer ("orientation" - after the end of the film: "we're gonna have to watch this again") to a doubter ("s.o.s" - "did you push that button, henry? i need to know") to a non-believer ("?" - after the end of the film: "do you want to watch this again? - "no, i've seen enough"). terry o'quinn's performance is powerful as usual ("every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button"). meanwhile, eko takes his place as the man who becomes sure that he was brought on the island as part of his true destiny, which is to continue pushing the button. other high points of "?" are a startling, unique dream sequence where person a has the dream as being person b (this is the kind of bold idea that the current season of lost could use much more of), and the haunting scene of libby's last word before her death, and the way jack and hurley cannot possibly know its true meaning. ***1/2 out of 4.

an eko-centric episode the "?" explores the aftermath of the tragic events that rocked the castaways in the previous one. as the main characters john, locke, sawyer, kate and hurley come to terms with the incident in the hatch, locke and eko set out to find out where henry took off to. as it turns out eko is on a mission of his own trying to figure out the symbol ? which locke had drawn on his sketch. we see flashes of eko's life in sydney as a priest who comes in contact with his brother through a stranger. we also witness the tragedy that struck the hatch boil down to a room temperature as michael continues to remain a mystery.an excellent lost episode with many interesting turns.

northfork is above all a masterpiece of widescreen cinematography. for this alone the film is well worth one's time. the stark, wide open plains and badlands of eastern montana are captured in the spare, muted earth tones of autumn or early spring. the gigantic grey cement fort peck dam is the film's protagonist. the film comments both subtly and not so subtly on about a dozen issues of western landscape. the dialogue can be trying at times, yet the images and concepts are powerful enough to lift the film. the 1950's period works so well here and is executed so well. i think that the passing years will be kind to this film.

i loved the movie "northfork". i knew nothing about the movie before watching it. therefore, i had no outside influence or information to guide me in what i was seeing unfold on the screen. in retrospect i would advise anyone interested in the movie to watch it if for no other reason than the quality actors who appear in it. do not read anything about the plot, story line, or evaluation of the movie. in fact stop reading anything further in my comments although i believe they are general and would not spoil the movie for you, i don't want to diminish the value of the movie to you. find your own path of meaning in this film or it is diminished in its potential.in general, i found the 3 benign strangers in northfolk puzzling. as the movie unfolds, they could qualify as three entertaining escapees from a mental hospital or, the dreams and hallucinations of a sick and feverish young boy, or three angels "sent" to find the "lost angel".the sick and perhaps dying boy works to convince the three "strangers" to abandon the search for the lost angel, become his guardians (mother & father), and take him safely far away from northfork (no less than 1000 miles). he even declares that he is the lost angel to try to manipulate them all to be his guardian. only one of the three responds to the boy on a positive basis. the other two have no real enthusiasm or passion for this involvement.the priest who is nursing the sick boy demonstrates a depth of caring for people and a deep conviction toward his faith. he transcends the desolation and emptiness of northfork and its people; he is the light of goodness and hope to both northfork and to the movie viewer.near the climax of the movie, the boy and new guardian journey over land to a field where a plane waits. they board to find the other two strangers also on the plane; in fact one is the pilot. the engines start and the plane takes off.who are the 3 strangers? if only one stranger was interested in helping the boy why were all three on the plane? where is the plane going? did the other two find the "lost angel"? is there a lost angel and if so who is it? who are the six men dressed like undertakers? if all of this is just the sick boy's feverish dreams, how did one of the 3 strangers end up reaching out to help one of the men dressed like an undertaker when he jumped and hit his head(neither the boy or strangers had contact with these men)?one or two sentences written under the title telling people what this movie is about is a tragic mistake (this is not a spoiler, it's statement about advertising only). so if you haven't seen the movie, northfork, the questions above show only a few of the interesting and fun forks in the road of thought when you view the film northfork. if you read the advertising summary of the plot of the movie before you watched it previously, maybe you ought to look at some of the questions above and watch it again... i know i will.terry

daniel percival's "dirty war", a bbc production made for television was shown recently on cable. the film has a documentary style in the way it goes after the people that caused the near holocaust in one of the big metropolis of the world, london. in fact, this film, produced in 2004 is almost a cautionary tale of the events of the following year, in which terrorists set explosive devices in the public transport that killed innocent people that were in the wrong place, at the wrong time.the film impresses for the pace the director and the production team gave to the project. there are no dull moments in the movie as we watch the preparation by the terrorists and the people that are following their dirty work. although the inevitable happens, it's amazing just to think what would be the consequences if a real 'dirty bomb' was planted in such a densely populated area.the last images of the film have a chilling effect. the mob scenes and the way the whole area is contaminated send shivers of fear, thinking how it could possible happen anywhere.

well this movie certainly was in keeping with the current times. no happy endings, super-heroes, or miracles here. just down-to-earth fiction to stimulate our minds along the lines of terrorism, and what-ifs. kudos to percival and mickery for an excellent screenplay and superb direction by percival. films like this are needed to keep us aware of what is out there. if every peace-loving man and woman on earth reported obviously suspicious activities i believe terrorism could not thrive. this movie showed just how hard it really is to subvert these terrorists, even with good intelligence. even though the film is a bit propagandist against islam (the use of a muslim police officer as a main character) i believe it was entirely realistic. there was meant to be shock-value in the bombing incident. as a very clever tool to relay the humility and indignity of people caught up in an attack such as this, they showed full nudity of women being decontaminated post-attack. it didn't take me long to realize that this was meant to even further instill into the viewer that thought, i.e., we are not in control of everything in a situation like this. although this took place in london, with the usual high-level british acting, it makes a statement for any part of the world. great movies don't have to be blockbuster epic productions, and this movie is very very worthy of viewing.

the bbc and hbo teamed up to create "dirty war", a 90 minute tv movie about a terrorist "dirty bomb" attack in london. the film gets down to business quickly as it packs both the terrorist and the government anti-terrorist efforts into the film leaving little room for human interest subplots. on the terrorist side we follow the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive materials to assembly to deployment to detonation. on the government side we see pr and training exercises, intelligence gathering and analysis, interdiction, post-detonation response, and follow up. the film also imparts a sense of how al-qa'ida type terrorist cells are organized, the radical islamic terrorist mentality, and terrorist strategies. a sort of anatomy of a "dirty bomb" incident, "dirty war" will answer many questions lurking in the minds of a public becoming ever more aware of this insidious threat.

i just wanted to say that when i was young my favorite t.v show back in the day was night heat. i loved the characters and the plot of the show. i thought that it was an excellent show and still do to this day. i enjoy watching the reruns and i am a big fan.i love the way the characters played off one another.i would always stay up late to watch my favorite show with my mother who also was a big fan. now i can enjoy watching my show again and listening to the theme song.which i thought was a cool song for the show.my favorite characters were scott hylands and jeff wincott.i enjoyed watching these handsome guys take down the bad boys.

this lasted several years despite the late hour it was on.like a lot of 80's crime dramas, it looked cold. both physically and figuratively. this isn't a bad thing though. and the (obviously) low budget actually worked in it's favor. gritty during a time when 'slick' was in.allan royal's wraparound segments as the news writer gave it a slight edge.the only actors i remembered were scott nylands (earthquake) and tony rosato (sctv). the cast of barely knowns was a good thing because one could see the group as a whole and not as a bunch of people supporting a 'star.' and yes, that's a young clark johnson (homicide) in a recurring spot.i hope a dvd release is in the future. someone out there wanna get on that?

i feel the niiiiiight heat! i feel your heeaaaaaaaaaart-beat! something ain't right!" theme song written by b.j. cook from skylark- david foster's old band and wife. she also wrote the memorable theme from cbc's "airwaves." oh night heat! what a program! well-written, well-acted and totally classic. crime solvers and a good team and a dash of humour at the end. i'd like to think this is really what detectives do/did. giambone was a real favourite! on a canadian tip, i learned every canadian actor's name and style from guest spots done on night heat. everyone passed through the night heat set and like law & order, it was story-driven so you could just watch and enjoy without a lot of character melodrama.

"the missing star", who competed for the golden lion at 2006 venice film festival, is a film that, when you think about, the first adjective that comes to your mind is: intense. intense looks, intense sequences, this movie's intensity captures the viewer since the very first scenes at the steelworks, in italy (i couldn't recognize the city, maybe genoa or even naples), although the pace is quite slow.vincenzo buonavolontà, the male lead, and with him, all the audience, sees a completely different china than a normal westerner imagines: horrible high-rise building with about 8 hundred flat owners inside, skyscrapers, desolation, fog, scrapers and cranes everywhere, but also the beauty of the yangtze kiang river, that will soon become a big lake because of the controversial dike that will wipe a lot of towns out. china is a country under construction, but, under all these colossal public works, there are still poverty, backwardness and unfair laws.we can relate more easily to this story because gianni amelio, the expert director, chose two phenomenal leads: sergio castellitto, a well-known actor in italy, and the chinese surprise tai ling, a total unknown girl that gives an as intense interpretation as castellitto's.the film is not perfect, there are some flaws here and there, but that doesn't mean it's a mediocre film. try to see it.

as a modern marco polo, from venice to china, here we come amelio, again, taking on the task to render us the grey area in the middle of two worlds in solid colors. eroded by globalization's collateral damages, the pessimistic vision of europe is mutual with chinas. the view of that charming but puzzling country is dealt from below, devoid of any claim to learn or impose opinions. reality, nonetheless, is harsh. abandoned and exploited children, beehive-homes, backward areas is the other china we ignore. vincenzo (castellitto), a technician of a steel factory, is one of us. his voyage to china is a pretext to understand, to learn from the inside a country where progress and third-world problems live together in an infamous balance. it's not exactly clear if vincenzo knew by the first time that the mechanical component was already been fixed, i think so; anyway is a minor aspect. liu, the chinese girl, is the key of the whole film. she carries on her back a lot of difficulties, she's got the strength to overcome, but how could she fight with little money and little help ? the realistic and unbiased view of the facts by the girl, refusing vincenzo's money, touched me a lot. a pack of bank-notes can't get back her husband, her baby (forced to treat like a stranger for the law), protect her by scorns. liu knew his intentions were benign and kind, far from a cold charity act. their friendship is beautifully narrated, the way it grows step by step, dignified and formative, unique. a priceless legacy to keep.some scenes are stunning, either for the acting (vincenzo crying on the ferry) or by the dialogues (at the restaurant, on the railroads). besides a careless editing and a pretty lazy start, "la stella che non c'è" is brilliant and sharp just because chronicles the untold verities.in competition at 63rd venice film festival, plenty bet on tai ling for the mastroianni prize, dedicated to emerging stars. she definitely deserved that award.[8/10]

when i went to the cinema, i expected not much. i knew nothing about this movie but it was the only movie i could see, 'cause i was in a small town then. so i saw this movie and i was fascinated! "la stelle che non c'è" is a trip through the new industrial china and it shows it honestly! you see most of the time the ugly places of china, and you see what really happens with this new industrializing. the main characters are sad but hopefully people. he's the naive italian guy who can't believe what he see's. she's a translator from china who's missing her son. sometimes sad, sometimes funny but every time poetic! a wonderful movie with wonderful actors! so only one star is missing!

this is a wonderful new movie currently still showing in cinemas in my country. its director, the calabrian gianni amelio, is in my humble view perhaps the only contemporary italian director, along with nanni moretti, to deserve being called great (that is, apart from the old masters who're still around and occasionally still churning out movies). it's one of my greatest regrets that contemporary italian cinema has been ailing since the mid-70s, mostly due to a dire lack of funding and nurturing of new talent, something which can be transferred to most fields and which makes italy one of the most static industrialised countries of our time production-wise (both in an industrial and cultural sense)... unlike, say, china. and this, among other things, is precisely the subject of amelio's latest movie. few directors can speak to me about the true, present state of my country and the world as amelio can, yet his pictures also have a precious timelessness and universality. and for those already worrying that they may be slow, ponderous and worthy - rest assured: of the ones i've seen they most certainly aren't, at least not if you're used to quality european cinema.the basic plot outline: vincenzo buonavolontà is a technician at an obsolete steel plant factory somewhere in italy, probably the north. he is played by sergio castellitto, one of contemporary italy's most versatile and talented actors. when a major chinese steel company purchases some of the italian steel plant's industrial machinery, vincenzo, who struggles to make himself understood with the non-italian speaking chinese director, tries to tell him that the machine is defective and its converter needs substituting, an element he's working on custom-building himself. he warns them that not doing this might have very dangerous consequences. meanwhile a young chinese woman called liu hua acts as interpreter between the two men, but seems to struggle to find adequate translations for some of vincenzo's technical jargon. the italian eventually loses his patience with her, virtually pushing her aside and asking her to hand him the chinese-italian dictionary so that he can do the translating himself.despite vincenzo's warnings, the following morning he finds that the chinese factory director and his employees have returned to their own country while not heeding his advice about the adequate use of the industrial machine at all. thus vincenzo, equipped with his great integrity, sets off for china. and here begins an endlessly fascinating road movie through china, a very topical 21st century odyssey through the asian giant. a latter-day marco polo's quest for the secrets of the mysterious nation? not quite. as in all of amelio's movies, the journey itself becomes far more important than whether its ultimate "mission" is carried out or not. in fact, the way in which the point is literally brought home, not without a touch of humour, is a lovely, poignant paradox and irony, which made my eyes well up while i was simultaneously smiling. the spectator is let in on the secret that vincenzo's trip was ultimately completely useless, but he himself doesn't know it, and goes home a satisfied man, a deluded innocent. at least, you figure, he's happy. sort of.the journeys that amelio's characters embark on totally uproots and strips them down to their bare, human essentials. they are momentarily without name, status or someone to put in a word for them. these theo angelopoulos-like themes are also explored in lamerica, actually my favourite amelio movie, closely followed by la stella che non c'è in order of personal preference. in the 1994 movie lamerica, two italian racketeers travel to albania to "do business". just like vincenzo, they intend to go there, do what they have to do and then go back home. instead, one of these two italians accidentally ends up on an almost homeric journey through this devastated land just after the fall of communism.but let us go back to la stella che non c'è: once vincenzo is in china, he predictably discovers that the seemingly "simple" task of handing the converter to its new owner is anything but straight-forward. the piece of machinery's new location is seemingly almost impossible to determine, unless he embarks on an arduous journey through china. when he comes across liu hua, the young interpreter he'd mistreated now working as a librarian, he tries to speak to her but she reacts in a hostile manner, informing him that because of him, she'd lost her job as interpreter back in italy. played by the relative newcomer ling tai, liu hua soon becomes a virgil to vincenzo's dante when she grudgingly figures that she could do worse than to act as guide and interpreter for the italian on his trip (obviously for a consistent sum of cash). this young chinese actress may not have the beauty of ziyi zhang, nor the movie star glamour of gong li, but her charming, expressive and pretty face oozes a combination of defiant strength, intelligence, dignity and wry humour that'll make her features difficult to forget once you've seen the movie. furthermore, she and castellitto have wonderful emotional chemistry as co-stars.amelio weaves dramas that are serious, poetic, mythical, post-neo-realist and humorous all at once, while maintaining a heart-warming ability to explore the fleeting essence of humanity in everyday, commonplace circumstances. a documentary-like naturalness conceals what is actually a meticulously conceived tapestry of faces and places, a vista which also manages to incorporate a cinematography of breath-taking beauty. the photography here is functional yet gorgeous, as befits a movie on the displaced in an industrial and emotional wasteland.amelio's observant eye is a grown-up, disillusioned one, yet also never a cynical or misanthropic one. the masterful camera angles also often gives a sense of vincenzo's alienness in the eyes of the chinese, bringing home a sense of objectivity and cultural impartiality that's very rare in movies about a "familiar" westerner exploring an "unfamiliar" non-western country. i cannot recommend this movie enough.

this is an enjoyable movie. its very realistic to the "wonderful world of music" i've been there and done that. it shows a human element in each character and the realism that nobody is perfect. these amateur musicians weren't all that bad players. cleavon little's character, marshall tucker, was played very well. marshall was no saint himself. here he was getting paid to do a job and he's giving these guys a hard time about everything in the van on the way up there. you don't bite the hands that feed you. i do find it hard to believe that a player with the jazz experience he has, claims he does not know any of the dixieland tunes. he has a tremendous sense of predicting chord changes to tunes he does not know. not common, but not unheard of either. he delivers a true and harsh message at the end of the movie when he tells the clarinet player, "its not a religion, devotion is not enough." on that level, he is correct, although i think the clarinet player could have handled the job. he was practicing his butt off and vocal accompaniment music is not that hard to read. very enjoyable movie.

this movie is almost never seen today - the only reason i can enjoy it again and again is from a slightly worn out vhs copy i made when the film was shown on tv in 1991 here in england.an ensemble cast are obviously enjoying themselves and this is reflected to the viewer. a razor sharp script helps things along, and once you've seen this you will want to watch it over and over again.wayne rogers is the 'star' but everyone contributes to a great film, with a great jazz soundtrack to boot. there are emotional moments during the film, but never to the point of sickly sweet sentimentalism - these are guys on the trip of a lifetime, and they convey that excitement wonderfully.highly recommended if you can actually get to see it.

"the gig" is a tight, funny and poignant little movie about a group of friends that have gathered together on a regular basis to play dixieland for fun. the group unexpectedly lands a real paying job, in musician's parlance; a "gig".they travel to upstate ny for a two week gig at a summer resort minus one member, who bows out due to contracting cancer. at the last minute, they hire a professional to take his place. things get sticky as an over-the-hill frankie valli type attempts a comeback at the resort and tries to utilize the group as his band.the attitude the professional bass player gave the guys rang true. by signing up to play the two-week gig, they were taking bread out of the mouths of someone who needed the job to feed his or her family. while pop, rock, rap, country and western, and r&b stars make money off of albums. jazz musicians have to travel abroad to make a living. almost nobody gets rich. the guys living their dream also cost others a needed income.i believe that almost everyone who can play a musical instrument with some proficiency dreams about playing a paying "gig" one time or another, woody allen and kevin bacon are two popular examples of this amateur-to-professional crossover. i especially recommend this movie to anyone who has ever played music professionally. my mom, who was a musician, loved it.

after the success of "muppet babies" warner brothers chalked up "tiny toons". but instead of making bugs bunny, daffy duck and all the rest of the looney toon gang kids, they created new animal characters who were kids with their own distinct personalities but personalities that nonetheless mirrored their predecessors. the leads included buster & babs bunny (no relation, which became their running gag or catch phrase), plucky duck, hampton pig, dizzy devil, shirley 'the' loon, elmira, montana max, furball, sweety, the rats and assorted animals of perfecto prep, and the original looney toons cast themselves. the "tiny toons" lived in acme acres and attended acme looniversity, where the looney toon gang worked as teachers who served as mentors to the younger generation the ins and out of comedy.during the show's run, various pot shots were taken at the bush sr. administration, pop culture, and coupled with various other gags and spoofs.buster & babs, arguably the show's main characters, as mentioned above, were similar to bugs bunny in some respects, but they also had their own differing personality ticks and comic styles, namely, babs' tendency to impersonate anyone and everyone, while buster, capable of being a great goof himself, usually played straight man (or straight rabbit) to babs' antics. plucky duck was a virtual copy of daffy duck (not screwball daffy but egomaniac daffy), with nearly as big an ego as daffy and just as much of an obsession with upstaging the buster & babs as daffy had with upstaging bugs, though he usually fell flat on his face in his attempts, yet he remained strangely endearing through out. hampton was an even more shy version of porky pig, and he had the thankless job of playing porky to plucky's daffy. shirley, the blond duck gal, was a new age valley girl type whom plucky would go in and out of phases of mocking or vying for her affections. dizzy was the purple version of the tasmanian devil. furball was the silent sylvester and sweety was the pink tweetie bird. there was also the purple female skunk who longed for a boyfriend and the pint sized versions of wile coyote and the road runner. evil was defined in the form of montana max, a rich kid who was always out to make a buck or make people's lives miserable. there was also elmira, a deranged animal lover whom everyone feared. and then there was godo dodo, an odd thing-a-ma-gig creature who had no clearly designated species except that he was from "wacky land" or something like that.pop culture references included batman (quite frequently actually), michael jackson, vanilla ice, dances with wolves, indiana jones, star trek, supergirl, fast food joints, the ten commandments, the twilight zones, saturday night live and even the simpsons, among others.not only funny, but it also managed to be warm and touching, something it's successor "animaniacs" never quite attained. also followed by "taz-mania".

ok, the show was a little uneven, but i still loved it. i found the main two bunnies annoying, but hamton & plucky were always amusing.i really want the baby plucky episodes on dvd (or even vhs). please release those!specifically the "potty years" episode aired on 11/22/91; the "going up" episode aired on 9/17/92 and the "minister golf" episode in 11/92.they are the funniest bits of the whole series and even over a decade later we still reference these bits!(i have nothing more to say, please reduce the minimum to something like 5 lines and rewards us for brevity!)

they just don't make cartoons like they used to. this one had wit, great characters, and the greatest ensemble of voice over artists ever assembled for a daytime cartoon show. this still remains as one of the highest rated daytime cartoon shows, and one of the most honored, winning several emmy awards.

it's now 2005 and 15+ years since this cartoon first aired. i haven't actually watched it seriously or closely in about 10 years. now that i'm an adult in my 30s i can look back with a serious eye as i watch the episodes again.in concept, the cartoon is partly an homage to the classic looney tunes but also its own original show. there are a few episodes that are structured like the old cartoons. for example, there is a singer that attacks buster and so he exacts revenge on this singer's concert -exactly like the old bugs bunny cartoon. the ensuing cartoon is similar to looney tunes, just in a different era. if you look at the old looney tunes, they did an awful lot of stuff exactly like tiny toons did. the old looney tunes made a lot of social commentary and parody. there were celebrity impersonations. there were a lot of corny period jokes, slang, and dialog. the comedy was surreal and wacky. you can say this exactly for tiny toons as well. the comedy styling is 'spiritually' the same. most definitely a throwback to the classics which hadn't been done well (if at all) in cartoons in the decades prior to this show. we recognize the cultural references in tiny toons and we can roll our eyes when something we don't like comes up. but the reason we don't think looney tunes are corny is because we weren't alive back in the 40s. also, looney tunes was original back in those days but today cartoons are rehashed over and over. so it's easy to perceive tiny toons in an unfair light due to our exposure to current events and our overexposure to cartoons in general.there certainly are differences in many respects - the timing, the delivery, and obviously the duration of the shows. they are two different styles from two different periods, being done under two very different circumstances - looney tunes being made for adults in theaters and tiny toons being made for kids watching tv. even so, they did a good job making an original show with original gags and still paying homage to and patterning after the comedy stylings of the old looney tunes.since tiny toons had a lot more time to play with, they had some genuine moments of great animated inspiration. you only have to look at episodes like 1 minute to 3, the baby plucky toilet episode.. there are so many more. for example, one of the best comedy dialog exchanges ever animated is in thirteensomething when babs and buster are on the phone in a split screen, hoping each misses the other. the miscommunication is spectacular. notably, the character development in this episode and in several others (usually the ones penned by deanna oliver or sherri stoner) is rather good. the female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, unusual considering the opposite is usually true for cartoons of that period.this was the first modern cartoon that had lots of both pop culture-referential and self-referential humor. this was way ahead of its time. tiny toons really opened up a door for writers to take comic liberties that are so common in the cartoons today, instead of doing the boring old crap we endured as 80s kids. yes, i loved transformers and thundercats, but tiny toons totally jumped away from all that. it was a breath of fresh air. bakshi's new adventures of mighty mouse may have been a precursor, but tiny toons made this surreal style of comedy cartoon writing a real success.as a kid i totally overlooked some jokes. for example, one episode is an homage to the marx brothers that i completely ignored as a teen. now i have a newfound respect for it. there are so many inspired gags that i never noticed that are genuinely brilliant. it's that kind of comedy that makes me think of looney tunes and family guy. i never noticed that kind of comedy as a kid. i've been thinking this for most episodes i watched recently.you'd notice these kinds of things if you actually watched the show. unlike some other reviewers here who i know are unfairly judging it, i've seen all the episodes and have thought about them thoroughly, exposed both as a kid and as an adult.you can tell there was an awful lot of care taken with the voice acting too. i'm not talking about just the main characters, but the side characters were done really well and creatively too. but back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. tress macneille had, in my opinion, her best performances in this cartoon. she hasn't been the same since. rob paulsen also did some incredible stuff here, too.this is all not to say the show didn't have some bad episodes. it had plenty. it had a lot of mediocre ones, too. but by far it certainly had a lot of genuinely funny episodes. especially back when it first aired it was actually funny to watch.out of 10 i give the show an 8.5 - and kudos for pushing the envelope and breaking down the doors leading to a new era of cartoons.

the greatest effort plus the finest cast ever assembled in a movie by the director tim robbins and susan sarandon and sean penn on the front row. someone said that this movie is good because directed and written by tim robbins but i convince you that sean penn and susan sarandon had give me a truly superb performance that i cried my heart out. their acting is so real! no doubt about it that this movie is rated 4 and 3/4 out of 5!

i read the book before seeing the movie, and the film is one of the best adaptations out there. very true and faithful to the book. sean penn and sarandon are amazing. robbins is a talented filmaker and i wish he would add more to his repetoire. he made the film very haunting and intentionally slow-paced to add depth. an especially brilliant bit of filmaking was the reflection of the victims appearing in the glass of the execution room at the very end.

i really enjoyed this movie. it challenged my emotions and beliefs, making it a true piece of artwork in my book. the acting was unsurpassed. i would never watch this movie with anyone i could not cry around, i don't think i cry harder to any movies, maybe because it makes me look at myself, i dunno. it is a must see.

one of the best ever. direction, fotography, a thrilling and dramatic history, wonderful soundtrack and, most of all, the incredible credibility of susan sarandon and sean penn, the best and most underestimated "under-40 generation" actor. after seeing this movie i guess if there's anyone who couldn't have any doubt about giving death to another man, in spite of the ugly things he could have done?

i must have seen this movie about four or five times already, and it gets better with each viewing. suffice it to say: this is the best film i've ever seen. and i think i've seen a lot.but i've always wondered why this film got so shunned in some reviews or ratings. for example, take the imdb top 250. why does it rank only at #216 (as of today)? surely, the answer's not in the film itself (because that is nothing but flawless), but in its reception. the film caused controversy in its portrayal of compassion for a convicted murderer and its anti-death penalty attitude. and so, obviously, the more conservative-minded user probably didn't like the film (as you can see from some of the other comments). so dead man walking gets a ranking that's nothing but ridiculous in relation to its quality. those people didn't understand what the film wanted to say, and maybe they didn't want to understand, being pro death penalty. so now i get it: it's all political. you're pro death penalty- you don't like (and therefore don't want to hear) what the film has to say.i'm truly sorry there are still so many people out there who simply tune out when a new perspective questions their beliefs.mr. robbins, your movie's issue split people's opinions. some reconsidered their point-of-view, some simply didn't listen, but you made a very important point. your movie will probably never show up on any "top 100 movies of all time"-list, but it'll be remembered, long after films like braveheart or babe or apollo 13 (all of which were unjustly preferred over your film at the oscars 1996) are forgotten. congratulations, mr. robbins, and thank you for this important piece of filmmaking.

how do you know if a movie is good or not? it is the impact it has on you that makes the difference. "dead man walking" upset me a great deal. i watched it twice. i don't know if i will be strong enough to watch it again. no, i did not feel good at all after watching it, but the film was as successful as it can be.robbins did a great job in incorporating all aspects of this controversial topic. he avoided making an argument that could easily be seen as biased or subjective. i hope that many people get to see "dead man walking". i believe that anyone who supports or opposes the death penalty so enthusiastically should see the movie.i don't know what else it could take to finally convince everyone that this relic from ancient times does not have a place in modern society anymore.the movie itself does not make an argument for or against death penalty. it describes reality. the reality is the best argument against the death penalty.a 10/10 for great performances, good filmmaking, and for the most important film made in yearsthank you, tim robbins!

it was very sensitive very deep. it's my favorite all the time you can't see movie more deeper than this incredible movie. susan sarandon made her role as matured mind actress, and she realized her role. she deserved the award. she convinced me with for being a nun. the music was very impressive and sensitive. really i liked this deep masterpiece.

"dead man walking" is one of the most powerful movies i have ever seen. i find it hard to believe that anyone, after having seen the movie, could feel indifferent about the film or its message. tim robbins does not try to impose his ideas and beliefs on the viewers, but manages to make a film that are in most ways sympathetic to both views on the death penalty -- whether it is right to murder a murderer or not. i have always known where i stand in this question, even as a child, and this movie -- despite the fact that it does not really take any sides -- made me even surer in my conviction that it can never be right to murder *anyone*.sean penn is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of matthew poncelet, his nomination for an academy award was very well-deserved. even if nicolas cage does a great job in "leaving las vegas", i would have been happier if penn had won the award. susan sarandon is also brilliant and she deserved the academy award she won. and tim robbins certainly deserves the vote i have given this film: 9/10!

"dead man walking" is a piece of incredible filmmaking. all the acting is top-notch and realistic, and the script examines the issue of the death penalty from both sides, paying equal homage to both. above all, this is a deeply moving story of redemption, of death with dignity and loss of ego. any film that deals this courageously and maturely with such incredibly difficult subject matter deserves a rating of 10/10. thank you, tim robbins!

in a world in which debatable and misunderstood subjects can be listed endlessly, this powerful 1995 film takes on one at the top of that list; moreover, it does it objectively and realistically, and with a sensibility and sensitivity that makes it a truly great film by anyone's measuring stick. and to add some irony to it all, even the subject matter of this film has been widely misunderstood, as it is wrongly perceived that this is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty; it is not. at the heart of `dead man walking,' directed by tim robbins, is a subject that in reality is possibly the most misunderstood of all, and with good reason, because it just may be the hardest thing there is for a human being to really-- and truly-- understand. and it is what this film is actually all about: forgiveness. real forgiveness; not excusing a heinous crime or the perpetrator thereof-- not saying that what's happened is okay-- but finding the strength to go on, and to do so by choosing life.	director/screenwriter tim robbins has crafted and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by sister helen prejean, in which she discusses her involvement with the death-row inmates to whom over the years she has ministered her faith in god. as chronicled in the film, what for her was to become a lifelong pursuit of not only justice, but human dignity, began with a simple letter from a death-row inmate at the louisiana state prison at angola. sentenced to death for rape and murder, matthew poncelet (sean penn) was reaching out to anyone who would listen, when his letter ended up in the hands of sister prejean (susan sarandon), who soon found herself venturing into a territory of which she had absolutely no knowledge or experience. and robbins has successfully captured sister prejean's emotional and turbulent journey succinctly, while managing to keep it devoid of any maudlin sentimentality, which makes it not only real, credible and believable, but makes it a poignant and thoroughly emotionally involving experience for the audience. through the medium of the cinema, what was once a personal, significant emotional experience for sister prejean, becomes one for everyone who sees this film, as well.	for her soul-stirring, impassioned portrayal of sister prejean, susan sarandon deservedly won the oscar for best actress. sensitive and fraught with emotional depth, her performance is incredibly touching and real, especially in the way in which she conveys sister prejean's underlying natural fragility and vulnerability, which she adamantly tempered with the toughness she needed to carry on with her endeavors on behalf of poncelet (and in reality, a total of five since she began). whatever your point of view regarding the matters examined in this film, sister prejean is without question an individual of heroic proportions, which sarandon exquisitely personifies here; and she does it without resorting to any superfluous melodramatics, but rather by keeping it real, by subtly and humbly exploring the humanity of the person in a very believable expression of characterization. it's an extraordinary performance, arguably the best of sarandon's brilliant career. 	turning in a career-best performance, as well, is sean penn, who was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of poncelet (he lost out to nicolas cage, who won for his performance in `leaving las vegas). perfect for the part in every way, penn has quite simply never been better, before or since. he effectively presents poncelet as a real person, rather than as an overblown caricature of a monster capable of perpetrating the crimes depicted here. not that it makes poncelet any less despicable; just the opposite, in fact. it makes it genuinely disconcerting to be faced with the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live next door to you could be capable of such things. and that's the strength of penn's performance-- it's so disturbingly real, presented with depth and nuance; you have but to look into his eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul. a terrific performance, and -- as good as cage was in `vegas'-- penn should have received the oscar for it.	in another stand-out performance, raymond j. barry is memorable in a supporting role as earl delacroix, father of one of poncelet's victims. with limited screen time, he nevertheless develops his character in such a way that enables you to empathize with him, as well as with sister prejean, as it is through him that we are given some insight into just how complex and seemingly tenuous her position is, at least on the surface. barry presents delacroix in such a way that gives the necessary balance and perspective to the story, which is ultimately extremely effective and helps to underscore the message of the film.	the supporting cast includes r. lee emery (clyde percy), celia weston (mary beth percy), lois smith (helen's mother), scott wilson (chaplin farley), roberta maxwell (lucille poncelet), margo martindale (sister colleen) and jack black (craig poncelet). it is doubtful that this film will change anyone's mind one way or another about the death penalty, but that was never the intention; what was intended, was to make a thought-provoking, emotionally involving film, which is exactly what robbins has accomplished with `dead man walking.' regardless of your personal point of view, this film will have an impact, and hopefully will open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness. for, as we see through the character of earl delacroix, true forgiveness is not something one merely decides to do, but is a task that can become a lifetime's work. and it's possibly one of the hardest things in life to effectively accomplish; and you come away from this film with an appreciation for individuals like sister prejean, who has selflessly dedicated her life to helping those in need, and to filmmakers like robbins and sarandon for bringing her to life for millions of people who otherwise would never have known her. i rate this one 10/10. 

'it's easy to kill a monster, but it's hard to kill a human being.'set in st. thomas housing project and angola prison in new orleans, "dead man walking" is the true story of helen prejean (susan sarandon), a louisiana nun sister who befriended matthew poncelet (sean penn), a murderer and a rapist bound for a lethal injection machine for killing a teenage couple sister helen agrees to help the convict and to remain with him till the endan act never before attempted by a woman at their first meeting, poncelet swears to the nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both of the kids and pleads her help for a new trial in order to convince the pardon board hearing to spare his life the film challenges the audience to actually give some thought to the human consequences of the death penalty, but gives voice to angry bereaved parents whose kids were shot, stabbed, raped, and left in the woods to die alone as poncelet's execution looms closer and closer, his character is seen deceptively complex, harboring doubts about the rightness of what they were doing to him in one moment, we hear him sensitive asking for a lie detector test to let his mother know that he is innocent, in another we see him furious playing the victim, blaming the government, drugs, blacks, the kids for being there poncelet never understood that he has robbed the percys and the delacroixs so much, giving them nothing but sorrow they are never going to see their children again, never going to hold them, to love them, to laugh with them in the scenes leading up to his execution, the death-row inmate drops his terrible facade and reveals his identity luckily both sarandon and penn are here exceptionalcarrying out successfully an exquisite, tangible harmony of souls when sarandon was looking at penn, she was projecting compassionate eyes brimming with tears she asks him to visualize her as he dies ''i want the last thing you see in this world to be the face of love''in that moment, we truly believed that she'll be the face of love for him

this film is well cast, often silly and always funny. lemmon and matthau work their tag team magic to perfection. brent spiner is just a riot as the egotistical tyrant of a cruise director. from the first "hare krishna" to the last "you ought pay him fifty bucks for calling you two studs", i thought this was a totally entertaining fun comedy

"out to sea" is a fun movie starring that wonderful duo of jack lemmon and walter matthau. this film is not quite as funny as their "grumpy old men" comedies (which it strongly resembles), but there are many laughs throughout. lemmon and matthau play a couple of in-laws who take a cruise together. once they get on the boat, the thing lemmon doesn't know is that matthau has signed them on as dance hosts so they don't have to pay for the cruise. this infuriates lemmon who's in no mood to dance. what's worse, matthau doesn't even know how to dance. nevertheless, they go along with it and it the process they meet some of their fellow passengers and crew members. here are the crew members: there's the cruise director gil godwyn, played to the hilt by "star trek: the next generation" veteran brent spiner, who acts like an evil dictator. there's two fellow dance hosts, played by "barney miller" star hal linden and veteran movie musical star donald o'connor. there's the ship's owner mrs. carruthers, played by "golden girl" rue mcclanahan. as for the passengers: there's vivian, a widow played by gloria de haven, who falls in love with lemmon. there's liz, played by one of my all-time favorite actresses, dyan cannon, who falls in love with matthau. there's mavis, liz's mother, played by veteran stage actress elaine stritch. and they meet others as well. all these actors are a pleasure to watch as lemmon and matthau play off of them. it's great to see cannon here, see's beautiful as ever; stritch is a hoot; spiner is a funny comic villain who's plays it deadly straight; de haven is wonderful; linden, o'connor, and mcclanahan have a good moment or two; and finally, the two main stars, lemmon and matthau, are fine as usual. a nice little gem of a comedy.*** (out of four)

out to sea was a great movie. i expected comedy and from about 10 minutes into the film to the end, there was comedy, and laughing points. jack and walter are great together, and the addition of rue mcclanahan made it a wonderful movie, that should be seen over and over again.

with two old friends.i've always enjoyed both lemmon's and mathaeu's films, and of course their team efforts are always worth watching, and often hilarious.although i didn't personally regard this film as in the hilarious category, it is certainly a competent and entertaining vehicle for fans of the two principle actors and of 60s style romantic comedy plots.brent spiner may actually steal the show in terms of laughs as the arrogant and tyrannical cruise director.gloria dehaven proves that senior ladies can remain enormously attractive.

this is the kind of movie that people of a certain age will say of "i didn't think they made movies like that anymore". walter matthau gives his usual over-the-top performance, but instead of leaving teeth marks all over the scenery, leaves endearing grease stains. he is like that great uncle we all know that still wears plaid polyester and embarrasses everyone, but we still love anyway.jack lemmon's performance reminds us why he had more golden globe nominations than anyone else (22). he gives a true-to-life performance of the basically 'good, ordinary man', even in the milieu of a farce.this film will probably not appeal to people who prefer blunt humor designed to confront or offend, but will appeal to people who appreciate broad farce played with a straight face.the entire supporting cast is excellent in their ability to play such absurd characters while maintaining the reality of each character.brent spiner gives a marvelous performance as a professional version of a lounge lizard. anyone who has known professional hosts in real life will immediately recognize the type he is playing. he nails the type perfectly. his rendition of 'slime' merits study as a perfect example of the contrast between absurd and pathetic.the plot is rather a straight-forward 'let's marry rich' theme that has the usual results. just because a plot theme has been done a thousand times does not mean that it is dated, but rather that it is a timeless theme.the rest of the supporting cast shows what can happen when professionals exhibit their skills in the roles that are written for them, instead of vying for the spotlight. in this film even the second tier actors shine. it is also obvious that they enjoyed making this film.the plot may be standard and thin, but it allows the performers to shine.this film is a true treat for people who want to see professional actors engaging in their craft. the plot falls away and the performers shine.

this is the kind of film that might give you a nightmare, besides that it's a lot of fun.hardware wars is the only good spoof on star wars, other films like spaceballs have failed. this is the only good spoof film i have ever seen, it doesn't rip-off star wars, it makes fun of it, and that's what spoofs are supposed to be.

this ranks as my favorite movie of all time. it's the best spoof of a science fiction movie ever; the fact that it was a sendup of star wars just made it all the better.i love slapstick. think of this as the marx brothers or the three stooges meet star wars. the writing is hilarious. the effects are a hoot. the free association that goes on guarantees all sorts of things coming out of left field. (i almost wet my pants when the wookie monster accosted the princess.)space balls was a much longer movie, but only had about 15 minutes of good material in it, and i felt sort of ripped off afterwards, like buying a burger that turned out to be mostly filler. hardware wars, despite being only about 15 minutes long, would be worth paying a feature price, imo.

hardware wars is a hilarious, 12 minute short film parody of the original star wars movie which was released just a few months after star wars in 1977. this film uses household appliances as space ships and star wars look-a-like actors to send you rolling around on the floor in uncontrollable fits of laughter. this film has won many awards at film festivals and was the film which inspired mel brooks to write his star wars parody movie called "spaceballs".this is my favorite parody film and i recommend it to anyone who is familiar with star wars and has a good sense of humor.

talk about your classics! ernie fossilus (the foss from here on out) came up with a cute and creative trailer totally spoofing star wars. this gem is so jammed packed with tributes and gags i laugh every time! not only that, when star wars did a re-issue with new special effects, hardware wars did the same! talk about a spoof that just won't die! there's a reason george lucas calls this his favorite parody. he was so impressed, he even hired the foss to work on "return of the jedi" (don't believe me, check his entry in imdb!)this has to be the first, and in my opinion, the best parody ever done. i think the special edition was a bit overdone, but on reflection, i think it's perfect for the modern day re-release of star wars, and goes to prove that sometimes, it's wrong to mess with perfection.yes, it's only 10 minutes, but it's well worth your time.you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss $3 goodbye! well, maybe 15 for the dvd, but you'll be real happy you did.

fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid. this short parody is at least as much a part of the star wars saga as phantom menace, and far more entertaining, if you ask me. hardware wars was the first in a long line of sw spoofs which form their own subgenre these days. i hate to describe it too much-it's so short that the premise is just about the whole thing. suffice it to say that many of the most popular and familiar aspects of star wars have fun poked at them. household appliances such as toasters and vacuum cleaners portray spaceships and robots, the princess anne-droid character wears actual bread rolls on her head instead of the famous coils of braided hair, and fluke starbucker is even more of a dork than his original, if that's possible. ernie fosselius is one crazy son-of-a-buck-he's also the source of porklips now, the apocalypse now spoof.

a tale of a young boy, dexter (joseph mazzello) with aids who befriends a rough and tumble boy (played by brad renfro) his exact opposite, the cure is sad, if a bit too soapy, pull at your emotions "message" movie with it's heart in the right place. for that fact alone, it's a recommended view. the highlight might be just watching them finding friendship and hanging out with each other when no one else accepts them. however since the real story centers on the boy's aids - things take off when one day at the local supermarket, dexter's eye catches a checkout tabloid magazine that states a new orleans doctor has discovered the cure. both of them, obviously a tad naive, make it a plan to set out for new orleans in whichever means possible. which kinda pulled me two ways. it's a mite heart warming and i hate to nit-pick, but i found the plot wanders in a melodramatic, predictable sense and the proceedings have a coat of gloss over them like only movies can do. i couldn't escape the tugging notion i was watching a road trip movie about self discovery, sickness and growing up. for instance, i know they're young, but i found it a real task to belief in the things these boys do. like boiling tree leaves and drinking the hot 'tea' or eating an experimental diet of chocolate bars because they believe it will combat the ravaging disease. to say nothing of them making a cross-country voyage as they do with no legal or downright scary repercussions. still misgivings aside, those movie conventions you come to expect, it's a story worth seeing particularly with family.

although flawed in it's view of homosexuals, this movie will shed light for the viewer about the myths and inaccuracies concerning aids. despite the depressing subject matter, this film depicts a warm friendship between two boys, and will make you laugh as well as cry. very well-acted by all, especially joseph mazzello and brad renfro. the language is a little strong, though appropriate, and it's an entertaining and intelligent film for the whole family. but remember to have the kleenex ready!

this early warner brothers talkie "son of the gods" (1930) deals with the racial intolerance that anglo-saxon americans show towards the chinese. chinese-americans are treated like second-class citizens, and whites hold them in nothing but contempt.prolific scenarist bradley king based her screenplay on rex beach's novel about a young, impressionable chinaman, sam lee (richard barthelmess of "only angels have wings"), who experiences racial prejudice first-hand when the girls that his college chums bring along for a party reveal their racist sentiments about sam once they learn about his heritage. sam goes to his father, lee ying (e. alyn warren of "gone with the wind"), who is a wealthy chinaman with offices not only in new york city but also in san francisco. sam feels deeply wounded by the racial slurs and he wants to leave new york and go where he cannot be hurt by americans. his patient father warns him that racism is a fact of everyday life and the only solution to racism is tolerance. sam has yet to learn this lesson. he refuses to take any more money from his father and catches a ship to london, england, peeling potatoes while he is on board.during the trip, he encounters a british playwright, bathurst (claude king of "arrowsmith"), who needs some help writing a play about the chinese. sam and he strike up a friendship and sam furnishes him with cultural information about asians. while they are relaxing in france, sam meets a beautiful young woman, allana wagner (constance bennett of "two-faced woman"), who falls madly in love with him. it seems that allana and her wealthy father are vacationing in the same motel. everybody at the motel knows about sam being a chinaman with the exception of allana. sensitive about his racial heritage, sam holds allana at arm's length until she convinces him that nothing could change her mind about him. they fall madly in love together. allana's father drops the bomb on her when he reveals that sam is a chinaman and all the memories of living in san francisco and dealing with coolies floods allana's mind. she storms into the dining room at the motel and publicly flogs sam with a riding crop in front of a room filled with on-lookers.of course, sam is terribly devastated by this reversal of events. he thought that allana loved him but she didn't. about this time, sam's father lee ying falls tragically ill and ying's secretary of sorts, eileen (mildred van dorn of "iron man") sends sam a telegram about ying's illness. predictably, sam rushes home to new york to be at his father's side. since his public humiliation, sam has vowed to show no kindness to anglo-saxon americans; eileen is an irish-catholic and probably one of his few white friends. lee ying dies and sam assumes control of the business and he practices his anti-white racism, until he learns that he was an anglo-saxon foundling that a san francisco cop on the beat gave to lee ying and his wife to bring up. the cop forgot about it until two white busy-bodied social worker types wanted to take sam away from the yings. sam learns this revelation about the same time that allana comes to new york and falls ill. during her illness, she utters his name repeatedly in her sleep and her devoted father goes to see sam and requests that sam visit her in order to help her recover. unbeknownst to allana, sam does visit her and she improves, but she has no memory of his visit, merely a hazy notion. eventually, allana learns the truth about sam not being a chinaman and they marry and live happily ever after.this socially conscientious warner brothers/first national pictures release contends frankly and unflinchingly with the race issue for the first hour or thereabouts before the revelation that sam has no chinese blood running in his veins catches both him as well as the audience by surprise. the reconciliation between allana and sam stretches credibility, despite their self-professed undying love for each other. however, in the name of a happy ending that would erase all the negativity that came before it, they wind up in each other's arms.the capitulation on the race issue with the revelation that sam isn't chinese damages some of the film's moral power. incredibly, "son of the gods" is a pre-code film that almost seems prudish; for example, sam is an american, not chinese! constance bennett gives a wonderful performance as a petulant beautify and she holds your attention when she whips sam with her riding crop. claude king is good as bathurst, and e. alyn warren is convincing as lee ying. interestingly, warren made a career out of portraying asian characters. richard barthelmess is flawless as sam; he delivers a highly nuanced performance. despite its age, "son of the gods" is a son of a good movie!

i loved this movie - the actors were wonderful and suited their roles. the story itself was great (and true, the setting was perfect and the message about human response to the war, danger and risk was exceptional. the person who wrote the music score also did the music for life is beautiful (another favourite of mine)- his comment was apparently that "...this was not a like an english movie, it was like an italian movie." i think he's right! callum blue is perfect for the part of eric newby. i recommend this movie to everyone who wants to watch a story that is true and morally uplifting as well as a beautiful love story.

i have just watched this movie for the first time today, and just loved it...yes it is simple in it's storyline, the sweetest love story,and how any female could not fall in love with callum blue beats me...the scenery in italy was as you would expect, beautiful, the baddies lost in the end,and for the two lovebirds to be reunited at the end, was wonderful, but that scene where a certain italian was sweeping away the confetti after eric and wanda's wedding, perfection!.have a cup of tea and watch a fantastic movie, yes, better have a tissue ready and be enthralled, i know i was and hope to get it on dvd real soon. all the actors played their parts perfectly, this was a ww2 film you could believe in as it was so realistic, and without going over the top as in other films...

"in love and war" is a simple feel-good tv-film, and should be viewed as such.(possible spoiler)it is the story of a wwii british soldier, newby, captured with his commando by the italians and imprisoned in a former orphanage. as the italians surrender to the allies, the commando is freed, and attempts to flee. however, the germans arrive and the commando is captured again. only newby, injured, remains at large. the rest of the film recounts how he is hidden and protected by the partisans, and his survival.(end of spoiler)based on a true story, "in love and war" is a refreshingly straightforward film. half comedy, half romance, the story is simple and unambiguous. the 'atmosfera' is warm and sunny, and the various stereotypes (the desperately unorganized or romantic italians, the serious stern-looking germans and the phlegmatic and pragmatic british), although unoriginal, are still humorous. nicola piovani's musical score also adds to the mediterranean flavour.although it is far from being a "tea with mussolini" or a "la vita e bella", "in love and war" is a sweet simple film that will put a smile, and maybe even a little tan, on your face.

this delightful, well written film is based on a new york stage play bearing the same title where sir aubrey (knighted sir charles aubrey smith in 1944) originated the role he plays in the film. here, in 1931, we see him in the early part of his acting renaissance in the very early era of "talkies" and in the character role that he would make his own until his death in 1948 after finishing his last performance in little women which released in 1949.this engaging play is about an elderly british aristocrat who locates his illegitimate children and introduces himself to them, having brought them to his manor in england.marion davies plays his daughter-by-error and it's a tour de force for her. she is all at once endearing, impatient, shallow, enchanting, wise and compassionate while creating an indelible and beguiling character that remains well ensconced in the memory.the 26 year old ray milland appears here in a small but prominent role having already appeared in seven other pictures then only in films for a bit more than two years.the film should be enjoyed as a representative of 1931 hollywood factory production of course and as such is not flawless. however, it's a charming pleasure from first scene to the last.

this is one of the better marion davies talkies - and one of the few to allow her to exhibit her skill as a physical comedian which was so endearing in her silent films. ok, so she does a clunky tap number, but even ruby keeler's dancing from the era does not hold up for younger generations. the problem here is the script. the story falls into unbelievable melodrama in the last reel. it's quite stagey, and is obviously adapted from a play... but not well enough. still, there is some snappy dialogue and slapstick throughout. worth a look.

toplines this ok comedy about an aging father (c. aubrey smith) who decides to gather his grown children from around the world. davies is working as a chorus girl in new york when she gets the news that "daddy" wants her. hmmmm, sounds familiar. davies' considerable talents as a comedienne save this otherwise so-so comedy as she upsets the staid british countryside with her brazen american personality. not as sharp as some other davies comedies, but still worth a look. ray milland plays her long-lost "brother." doris lloyd, elizabeth murray, and halliwell hobbes are all fun, too.

this 1931 comedy gets better with every viewing because of the comedic talents of marion davies and a terrific performance by c. aubrey smith. smith plays a gruff old man who gathers his grown children (from his younger days as a rake) in his declining years. one is american (davies), one english (ray milland who looks about 18), and one italian (nina quartero). there are some surprises as the plot moves along with ralph forbes(was has no appeal at all) falling for davies.davies and smith are just wonderful together and very touching. davies also gets to do a few dances and make a few "big" entrances. and of course davies is just gorgeous.halliwell hobbes, doris lloyd, elizabeth murray, guinn williams, edgar norton, and david torrence co-star. had they given out supporting oscar awards in 1931, smith might well have been nominated. he's just excellent in this this gem.

a grumpy old baronet, happily unmarried, decides to send for his three grown-up illegitimate children and provide them a home at his manor. to his surprise, he finds himself bonding with his uninhibited american daughter. can he find satisfaction in his new role as the bachelor father?this 1931 film, in which he gives a robust performance, marked the arrival at mgm of elderly sir c. aubrey smith, very soon to be one of hollywood's most valuable character actors. with his great hooked nose & beetling brows, sir aubrey looked every inch the part of the duke or general or statesman he would play so often. the acknowledged leader of the british community in hollywood, sir aubrey would also champion the game of criquet in southern california. he would remain very much in demand in studios all over town, right up to his death in 1948.the film's top-billed star is marion davies. best remembered today as the mistress of media mogul william randolph hearst & the chatelaine of hearst castle, the most fabulous residence on the west coast, she was actually a very talented & pretty comedienne. for a few years, hearst attempted to make her the queen of mgm (with her own production company & a huge bungalow-dressing room) but the studio already had several other queens - dressler, garbo, shearer, crawford - and he eventually moved her to warner bros. here miss davies gets a chance to joke & clown and her scenes with sir aubrey are entertaining.her love interest is played by ralph forbes, a handsome young british actor who was just starting to find good films (the trail of 98) as the silent days ended. he had all the qualities for major stardom, but sadly it was not to be. celebrity would come to ray milland, here making one of his first screen appearances. halliwell hobbes & doris lloyd also appear to advantage.

i think this show is awesome!!! i love it, and i love fabian (not in a romantic kind of way) but if i was there i would totally support fabian like haley did, and the other girls, yeah!! i mean if they're rood why don't you want to fight them back!! fabian is the only who have guts to confront people and say what he thinks, not just stay and suck it!!! fabian 100%!!!!! i love haley too, because shes like a normal girl who doesn't want to be with cows and bugs and grass everywhere, and sleep in a warm bed with servants, i mean, if you have the chance and the money why wouldn't you do that!!! and fabian too, fabian brought pizza and just like 2 or 3 people said thanks, i mean he spend money!!

this film for me and my wife is more entertaining than all the bloc-buster violent thriller/mystery/murder movies that abound. it is about real people making the best of their lives. they just happen to be indian and the main characters are in law enforcement. the realistic acting and the great scenery more than make up for the slightly implausible plot. the sound track is by bc smith, who also did the soundtrack for coyote waits, and is great. adam beach plays a tribal policeman who is a little bit accident prone and wes studi is the stoic consummately professional detective. there are many other fine either supporting or cameo roles by graham greene, tantoo cardinal, etc. we have also seen coyote waits, another adaptation of a hillerman novel, and we greatly enjoyed it too.

i hope robert redford continues to make more films like this. hillerman's books are wonderful, and as a young child raised in the southwest his stories hit home! adam beach is a highly under rated and under used actor. wake up hollywood, not everyone thinks that your mel gibson's are cool! many movie goer's today want to see films that make you think. i have seen all of the redford/hillerman series. they are thoughtful, scenic and have great plots. i'm hoping that if enough people write to robert redford he may decide to make a few more! thank you adam beach and tony hillerman for great entertainment! if anyone get's a chance to read tony hillerman's latest book do so! it's great. i also recommend traveling through arizona, new mexico, utah and colorado. stop at every view site and feel the setting of hillerman's books. amazing experience.

joe (wes) & jim (adam) re-acquaint us with the beauty, isolation (psychological as well as physical) and utter terror of "murder most fowl" in the navaho southwest. characterizations, settings and plot continually build .. . even if at times the personal asides leave us wanting "more" .. . with some interesting alternative choices as to "who done it?" flashbacks (e.g. peter fonda . .. good to see him) provide clues but they don't go where you might think. comic asides (e.g. the preacher) are mild and appropriate. where "skinwalkers" and "coyote waits" start to drag .. . "thief" engages the clutch and four-wheels you around the next corner, never quite sure what's there. disagree with joe leaphorn's manic comment to jim chee to "slow down" for the potholes. wrong ... there are no potholes in the plot, just tracks to follow. on to the next episode! great photography (as always), appealing characters and more to explore!

i caught this movie the other night on one of the movie channels and i haven't laughed that hard in a long time. this movie was so funny i went out and bought the very next day. i love this type of comedy. it just seemed so real in the way the actors react to the different situations here. i was rollin. i had never even heard of it and just started watching because of the title "seeing other people". the title caused me to give it a shot and i'm glad i did. i laughed so hard that it hurt. now it's part of my collection. i definitely recommend it to all those that enjoy smart-ass type of comedy. i will be watching this one over and over.

"seeing other people" is a daring romantic comedy about a couple named ed and alice (jay mohr and julianne nicholson) who are engaged and plan to be wed soon. they live together but are both having doubts about their relationship. alice realizes she's had so few sexual relationships in the past, she might just be marrying ed because she's never felt anything else. so they agree to begin fooling around with other people for a while to test their own relationship.the movie balances a prescient question - by focusing too much on the "what if?" aspects of life, can it in fact do the opposite and only make you feel more constrained? when ed begins having sex with a college girl he begins to become addicted and almost forget about alice - when he realizes this, it scares him.i hadn't heard anything about this film in advance but i enjoyed it. it's not extremely well-made and definitely has that purposefully low-budget indie feel to it - but it's a lot better than most romantic comedies out there in the mainstream today.check it out if you get a chance.

i loved this movie. it's a lot of laughs. the acting is good and the writing is really sharp. i'd rather see a hundred movies like this than three lord of the rings repeating and repeating themselves.it's a low budget affair and seems to be shot on dv but looks good and jay mohr and julianne nicholson are great together. why do you have a ten line minimum? i'm not a critic, just a patron.i doubt very much that quentin tarantino could write a picture this funny without filling it with masturbatory gratuitous violence. this movie should be seen on more screens than just one. i laughed from beginning to end. >

i was hugely impressed with this movie, if for nothing else than for the comedy. it might not be the edgiest, wittiest humor at all times, but i found it appropriate to every scene.the flow of the film is certainly a bit jumbled, almost confusing sometimes, but that is how the characters feel. sometimes, we're watching a bit of slapstick and other scenes revolve around a decisive discourse on relationships. this might be a bit frustrating to certain viewers, but it brought me closer to the characters' dilemmas of irregular chaos.the acting is great from everyone. i'm a huge andy richter fan, but i wasn't head over heels for his part like everyone else seems to be. he did very well, but julianne nicholson and lauren graham stole the show for me, both in their respective ways. jay mohr performs as expected, if you've seen him in other films. i've always liked him.overall, the movie is very funny and offers some nice foundations for a few types of relationships. when it comes to relationship questions and problems, some films try to surprise. there's nothing surprising about the conclusions offered here, but it's entertaining to watch them be revealed throughout the film.

i paid attention and enjoyed the very rich expressions capability of the main actress, julianne nicholson. i don't have words to describe how much have i been enchanted. all the actors and actresses played well. especially i noticed the solid good character who has been consistent in foreseeing the future - andy richter who played carl. i think that the idea to show a variety of friends and relatives with different opinions, and the several consulting meetings, is like the real world. jay mohr who played ed, the future husband, also played very real behavior. but, i want to emphasize again the point of very rich expressions repertoire which julianne nicholson is capable of and does so naturally, was overwhelming for me. indeed, the subject which this movie handles seems to me as very important and touches strongly meaningful thoughts of many people. i've seen this movie several times and have not been bored. it raises again and again in my thoughts.

i happened into the den this morning during the scene where ed was engaged in the 3-way and thought my wife was catching up on some early morning porn! much to my surprise it grabbed my attention and i rewound it and we started watching it at 4:30 in the morning! what a very entertaining, rich, funny and well developed plot line and script. we both thoroughly enjoyed it, my wife so much that she shared the experience with her girlfriends at work! going on to recommend it and say what a "kick" she got out of it. i am in my late 40's and she in her early 50's. i think this movie would have appeal to both young and old. an unexpected, very enjoyable surprise. nice work! thanks! two thumbs up!

plot: ed and alice are engaged. they live together and are living the dull life. he has slept around before meeting alice. she has a lot less experience. she decides she needs to sleep around before marrying. he very reluctantly agrees they should both see other people for a while. at first he is not really into it. his wild days are behind him and he is simply content. until one day alice comes back and tells him she made out with some random guy; who of course starts to fall for her. of course this is a bad idea which causes extreme strain on the relationship.good movie. you can see the train wreck coming but still good.worth a rental.

well, the movie did turn out a lot better than i expected. it's not boring and it's not unoriginal. it's really not a silly romantic comedy. the situations the characters put themselves in are very unusual, of course, we're still talking about a movie, but the main characters are indeed plausible. donald is, of course, an exaggeration, but he's just a pawn in the movie, a means to prove something. the ending isn't one of those ridiculously happy, always the same, moral containing pieces of crap you can usually see in movies of the genre. i genuinely liked it and i'm hard to please when it comes to this particular genre of movies. it's worth a watch. besides, it's better directed than other movies, the story line always stands up, the characters themselves stand up. and they do not experience this miraculous change and love is not revealed to them like a holly god given artifact, yada, yada. at the end of it all you actually see yourself going through it all, the movie makes you feel something, you may even learn a thing or two. it's not the usual hope-producing, tissue moistening idiocy. it's a good movie, not a consolation prize for teary women around the world.

[warning: contains spoilers]written by husband and wife wally wolodarsky (who also directed) and maya forbes, this indie film is one of the better romantic comedies in recent memory.jay mohr takes a break from playing smarmy weasels to be the nice guy faced with the fact his fiancée wants to bed other people and he's allowed to do so, too. julianne nicholson, who was so good in "tully," plays spunky and vulnerable with great gusto. too bad she doesn't get the recognition she deserves. good supporting performances help immensely, too. lauren graham, who made last year's "bad santa" memorable, plays the jaded, cynical sister to perfection, bryan cranston (the dad on tv's "malcolm in the middle") gets a few funny, raunchy moments, and andy richter plays a genial guy who falls for a single mother - helen slater in a credible, albeit familiar, role as a mousy woman.what surprised me most about "seeing other people" was how funny it is. there are some genuine laughs here. ed's first attempt at meaningless sex gets some great lines, and there's a ménage a trois that elicits one of the most truthful reactions from a man as the male fantasy gets tweaked.the film's premise isn't unusual, but i liked that it was alice (nicholson) who thought of it, much to the chagrin of ed (mohr). given the genre, you know that no matter how good her intentions are, alice's plan is doomed. we see how the couple works through this strange situation. initially, alice and ed are turned on by the idea, but then the human element sets it.i appreciated forbes and wolodarsky not turning this into a cheap sex romp. yes, there's sex and nudity, but there also are real emotions at work here. the "other people" alice and ed befriend don't want to be the objects of casual sex; they have feelings, too. in one case, too many feelings.granted, some scenes run one joke too many, the richter-slater subplot isn't necessary and alice does something truly uncharacteristic. but that's forgivable because mohr and nicholson generate such tremendous intimacy and honesty - check out the scenes where ed rummages through alice's underwear drawer or his reaction to her announcement about ending the experiment - that no matter how much we might enjoy their little game, we root for this couple to succeed.unfortunately, this film got little, if any, publicity and a limited release. hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies often veer on the unfunny, turgid and unsurprising, would do well to learn from this intelligent and funny film.

i liked this movie.no one i know likes it, but i do.i didn't like it as much as the first one but it was still good. the script and plot may not have changed at all, but the story was better than caddyshack 1.the only reason i didn't like caddyshack 2 is...no rodney dangerfield!i think the movie would be better if rodney dangerfield had jackie mason's part. although i did like jackie mason in the movie, it would be alot better if they kept rodney dangerfield.another flaw in the movie, that i didn't hate as much, was dan akroyd. the movie was done 8 years after the first one. bill murray, "carl", could've quit his job as an assistant greenskeeper and joined the military, you know? if warner bros. had thought of that, it could've made the movie better, also.this was my comment for caddyshack ii.i give it 8.2 out of 10it could've been better, but good nonetheless.if you've seen caddyshack 1 and are debating on whether or not to see caddyshack 2, i say give it a try.

the only conceivable flaw of this film is it's title!! please stop comparing it to the first! i did in my previous review only to separate it from the first. if you haven't seen the movie and are curious, totally forget about the first and invent a different name for this. there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own. this is a great exponent of screwy mid-80s comedy. i seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first. anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus. i maintain, the only reason this is in the imdb bottom 100 is because of its title. i usually hate movies like these (i.e. adam sandler, will farrell, farrelly bros....), but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically. i dunno, maybe it's like a bad relationship i can't get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure. either way, this is the single most underrated movie of the 80s behind 'the stunt man.'robert stack- we love you!!! (1919-2003)

amazing, one of my favorite movies way down at the bottom. guess i can take some pride in not liking what "the general populace" tends to go for. jackie mason is hilarious in this movie, and so's randy quaid. i can never get enough of his "strong-arm" tactics, just like in moving. he was also notable in national lampoon's christmas vacation. love that guy.

i am in a vast minority here. i also didn't much care for the original caddyshack, aside from the chase/murray duo scene and select rodney jokes. okay, break it down: rodney vs. jackie- both jewish and have similar humor. rodney's a bigger name and more distinct. jackie has an incidental and more observational approach to his jokes and is more 'up yours' in this sequel. jackie's attitude toward everything is memorable and in a way, inspirational! his quick lines and over-confidence left me wishing i could express myself in such a way. rodney was good, but there wasn't enough of him, and he was more 'in your face' and dismissive. jackie, in a rare film appearance, makes a perfect sub for rodney (come on, a gun shaped hair dryer?!?!) really, look at the little things!stack vs. knight- both play snobby yuppies very well. ted knight, despite his wonderful tv/film career, kinda shows his age. but, he does pull off the snobbish demands of the part and we want to see him fall. ted looks kinda weak and is pretty annoying, playing his anger and frustration too slapstick, while stack is more incidentally snide and vengeful; you really hate him and enjoy see him constantly fail. stack wins with me.murray vs. aykroyd- well, both had great, vintage snl-like scenes with the ever-present and enjoyable chevy chase (ty webb). i did like the murray/chase one better. murray plays his great, annoying, chatty character with obvious improv skill and is loveable- yet annoying. and the exact same can be said for aykroyd. both get annoying after a while, but it's a tie.i really loved part 2 over the first. they are 2 totally different mooded films. part one is more drug/bathroom/sex humor with a cast full of great names. part 2 uses golf as a backdrop for a 'stick-it-to-the-rich' type of comedy that makes one feel better about being working class. 80s script? yes. a bit far-fetched? yes, but wasn't the first? an insult to the sport of golf? yes, it's a movie. thin story? yes, it's a comedy with actual humor- not 'dances with wolves'!! besides- part 2 has a much better soundtrack!! please- don't expect this to be a sequel to part one!! it is 98% its own movie and shouldn't even have the name 'caddyshack' in it. that said, i am a big fan of caddyshack 2 and it is a great exponent of 80s fluff entertainment with quality humor. viva jackie mason!!! to all the reducers- lighten up! it's a great comedy of its own. randy quaid was wonderful, jonathan silverman was wonderful, heck, everyone was!! all this chatting and now i feel like watching it! i think i will

i have no idea why everyone hates this movie to call it garbage a travesty an unexceptable sequel is just unfair i mean what else could they have made for a sequel then. cause seriously i think it should have had a sequel (rodney dangerfield) says: hey everyone were all going to get laid and then a little dancing goffer and thats it thats the end of caddyshack even though the film rating on first one was (r) and the second one was (pg) it was still lots of fun .(7/10)

like richard pryor, mason never got the material he deserved. whatever you know of him is probably wrong. get past the accent and go see his stand-up. you'll be very surprised -- he's one of the best stand-ups i've ever seen and i have seen a lot of stand-up comedy (from lenny bruce to eddie murphy to jerry seinfeld to chris rock -- jackie mason is definitely up there). he's known for being a comic's comic. even howard stern said he is one of the top 3 funniest comedians ever.the accussation that mason is no dangerfield is ridiculous. dangerfield is known for having been a huge mason fan. dangerfield's career was going nowhere for a long time until he started following mason's shows. that is when mason provided dangerfield with inspiration for his, "get no respect" routine. while i think dangerfield is great, see them both do stand-up and you'll see mason is the better comedian.

one of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is highly touted as an `in-name only' sequel. there's nothing wrong with that except this: the return of chevy chase as ty webb. this connects the viewer to this character (from the original caddyshack in 1980,) and makes fans thinking or wanting caddyshack ii to be similar to the first one.there are rumors that rodney dangerfield was supposed to return. he carried a big part of the first film, so his return would have put caddyshack 2 over the top. jackie mason is the `new' rodney for this movie and does a decent job, even though their comic deliveries are way different. dan aykroyd was great but not in the film enough. he should have been involved to the tune of how much screen time bill murray got in the first one. robert stack (airplane!) was good in the `new' ted knight/villian role. (we miss you, ted!) danny noonan should have been back. so many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later. bushwood should not have undergone the total makeover it did. instead, the characters involved, rather than the club itself, should have been the main focus like they were in the first one. when you watch this film, keep in mind that it isn't a major sequel and you may think it's another good or bad eighties comedy. fans of the first should see it but don't be shocked when the comparisons between the original and part ii are so far apart.

everyone is entitled to an opinion. the only critic who counts is yourself. i think this is a great movie. much better than the original.in "caddyshack", rodney dangerfield is funny, but obnoxious. he was asked to do the sequel, but things got in the way. jackie mason shows the saying that "less is more". he is funny, but a man with real family issues, a more rounded person. it's no drama, but a movie that makes you feel. actually in some points, you feel sorry for jackie mason, especially when his daughter walks out on him.it has a good soundtrack, and overall, a good sorry. a good end to the series.in the tv show "alf", alf says that he cried in "terms of endearment". the wife , kate tanner, played by anne schedeen, also says he cried at "caddyshack 2".

seriously. if this had been the first shack movie, it would have been passable as funny, silly and goofy. light satire commentary on the class system would make this an enjoyable late-night rental.however, everyone wants to compare it to the first film, and maybe that's not fair. the first film is a cult classic; what could possibly follow it up? nothing. so take this second film as a stand alone, and it certainly has its moments.jackie mason is amusing, doing his best rodney-wannabe impersonation. is he as good as rodney? no. are his lines as good? no. but he is funny. the rest of the cast falls in line as being decent, but not outstanding. you'll recognize faces amongst the cast and wonder how they got to where they are today.the film is predictable, but aren't most in this genre? again, it's not the best comedy you'll see, but if you like cannonball run-type fun, you'll enjoy this one.

caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly-held classic. people have criticised the film on a lot of grounds, but they all ultimately hark back to the fact that this is not caddyshack.i would begin by saying that we should just take caddyshack out of the equation and consider this film on its own merits, but i think that would be unfair. the movie does have a lot in common with its predecessor. the class-related themes of 'snobs versus slobs' and the desire to fit in to a class above your own are as prevalent here as they were in the first movie. the two things that are truly lacking here are bill murray and rodney dangerfield, who are replaced with dan ackroyd and jackie mason respectively.now i am not about to try and argue that ackroyd comes close to murray in the movie, but jackie mason is an admirable successor to dangerfield. he comes off as a cross between dangerfield and arnold stang, but without biting too heavily on either. i wouldn't say that he is anywhere close to being as funny as dangerfield is in caddyshack, but there is a whole lot more point to his character and his dilemma in the film.chevy chase only pops up and handful of times in the movie, which is another common complaint. maybe these particular naysayers didn't notice that he only popped up a few times in the first movie. for my money, his scenes here are a lot funnier, if somewhat over-directed.while i'm on the subject, it is really the over-direction of this movie that brings it down. it comes across as far more self-conscious in its attempts to get a laugh. many of the jokes are laboured and there's far too much of the gopher, who seems to have taken on a far more anthropomorphic personality and a voice, just in case we didn't grasp the idea that its meant to be funny.characters are similarly hammered home, particularly the smarmy yuppy kids. jackie mason rarely misses a beat, and is consistently likable and very funny, but we didn't need the tango sequence at all! the director is clearly not of the same school of thought as harold ramis. not to suggest that caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a little overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with a quirky music cue.all things considered, this is a fun, goofy movie with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at the time were saying. don't be put off by the appallingly low rating on imdb, check it out for yourself.

i have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and each time i watch it the movie is just as entertaining as it was the first time! george berger (played by treat williams) leads a small group of 1960's-1970's era anti-war "hippies" living at large in new york city. this small group happens upon a young man, claude bukowski (played by john savage) who has been drafted into the us army for service in vietnam. despite their best efforts to dissuade him, claude does eventually report for basic training in the army. still distressed over his having left them, the hippie group steal a car and travel across the usa to visit claude "...for a couple of hours," in the words of george berger (to an m.p. stationed at the entry gate of the army base claude is temporarily stationed at in nevada). the outcome is truly touching, so i won't spoil it for those who have not yet seen this fantastic movie. the musical score is equally fantastic! don dacus (of the rock group chicago), who plays the part of "woof" - one of the hippies, is a not a key character, but the movie wouldn't have been the same without him. beverly d'angelo (who plays sheila franklin, an uptown girl who is befriended by the hippie group) is sensational in her role! a must see film!!

i first saw this film in the early 80's on cable. it was unique as a statement about the sixties, culture, war, music, race, and a bunch of things i'm certain i missed. however about a year ago it came back into my life as i started enjoying it with my son. he's a little young (9) for a lot of the themes in it, but he understands dancing hippies are fun to watch, and he gets the idea that end is ironic. while i can't think of other films in this genre, it does have a stand alone genius i love. it also does a unique justice to central park. most musicals are lost on me, one way or another. "tommy" was over the top and heavy handed in direction, "oliver" seemed like crowd control on the silver screen, "the wall" was so much abstract self important and indulgent dribble, but listening to "failure of the flesh" from hair sounds right for our times today, as it did in the eighties, as it must have in the sixties...truly timeless.

the largest crowd to ever see a wrestling event in the us took place at wrestlemania 6. over 93,000 people showed up to break the rolling stones indoor record, and this event didn't disappoint at all. maybe the biggest match of all time took place as the immortal hulk defended his world title against the ultimate warrior. there are over 12 matches in all so you get tons of action

*spoilers ahead*great wrestlemanias were still a few years away. but this one was certainly good, with lots of good matches, and one great match.demolition was always at their best at wrestlemania. i'm glad their last wm hoorah (i refuse to include the other version) was a win over the colossal connection. i liked the gag of andre never tagging in.few fans know that this was the first time anyone ever beat mr. perfect. for some reason, brutus beefcake's feat was never recognized. or the fact that he did it pretty easily.the hart foundation's win over the bolsheviks was the shortest in wm history, including the 24/9 second match between king kong bundy and s.d. jones.i'm glad jake and dibiase got to fight at wrestlemania. this made up for the fact that the feud had to be put on hold for so long.i expected the big bossman-akeem feud to heat up, but the bossman just clobbered him. as good as bossman was as a heel, he was just great as a face. he was always intense and obviously loved his job.if the warrior just had a better work ethic and maybe tried to learn to wrestle, he would have been a great wwf champion.worth a watch, especially since the boring matches are too short to complain about. and the tag team matches are all very exciting.

this event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that, i believe, is not equaled today. the colorful characters - in their stereotypical garb - brought a certain charm to the show that has since been raped by society and overexposed. wrestling had a bit of an innocence back then. a kid could watch it without watching an episode of jerry springer.looking back now (i was 5 at the time), although i loved both warrior and hogan, i think i enjoyed warrior more because of his mystique. hogan was the branded hero who weilded an impressive public image. the ultimate warrior, on the other hand, was a masked man of few words - an out-of-the-limelight hero for a different audience.this rivalry was so exciting as a kid because of this duality in me duking it out for each combatant. i had a place for both of them. because there was bloodshed too in this long, heavy battle, the stakes were high - at least to me as a kid. on a similar note, because of hogan's defeat, this made him more human - i remember feeling kind of sorry for him.all of these emotions at play in the juvenile boy's soap opera made wrestlemania vi such a great time to witness this game.

crossing the bridge: the sound of istanbul received one of the most rapturous applause from the audience when it ended and very deservingly so. i did not expect too much from a musical documentary but the movie proved to be much more than that. it was also a visual documentary of istanbul with stark contrasts of old and new, western and eastern, poor and rich, modern and traditional. black and white photographs of old istanbul by world famous armenian photographer ara guler were exceptional. but of course main theme was music, and by god, what a variety of it! it was in a way similar to bueno vistas social club; the love and the respect of the interviewer -alexander hacke here replacing ray cooder- for the musicians exuded from the screen and engulfed us all. the music was mostly very interesting. the jazz session by a group of romany gypsies in a small western turkish town was mind blowing. i will not be surprised if the travel agents start getting group booking requests for kesan after the movie is released. but i most loved muzeyyen senar who looked amazingly elegant in a sort of burlesque way and whilst tipping her "raki" declared courageously: "my voice and i are 86 years old!" well done faith akin. i bet there are many more turkish musicians who are feeling left out: go for volume ii please.

this is a movie about the music that is currently being played in istanbul. istanbul was the center of the two old world superpowers, the byzantine empire and the ottoman empire. today, it is a megalopolis of almost 10 million. so it is to no ones surprise that a lot of music is being played in istanbul, with a great variety of voices, styles, and influences from everywhere on the globe. it is turkish music, of course, and i was fascinated by turkish music ever since i bought my first record long time ago. the movie features different singers, instrumentalists and bands. spoken comments from the musicians nicely illustrate the music being played, and the social context in modern turkey. for my perspective, the most interesting comments were from orhan gencebay. furthermore, the movies shows urban scenery mainly from istanbul which is very pleasant to watch."crossing the bridge" is listed as a documentary and it includes music from minorities, e.g. kurds and roma. other important topics are omitted such as turkish jazz music, or music of the armenians and greeks.this movie is strongly recommended for lovers of the music and culture of turkey, the balkans, the eastern mediterranean, and the middle east. it may also be worthwhile for those with a keen interest in the global effects of musical styles such as rock and roll or hip hop.

in the 1980s in wrestling the world was simple. hulk hogan would take on roddy piper, or bobby heenan's cronies or ted dibiase and come out victorious more often than not. occasionally he would get an ally like randy savage in 1988, but mostly it was all about hulk hogan vs bobby heenan, and that's the way it should be.but on this night that was about to change, a new champion, a man who the wwe thought would be their man for the 90s was crowned. it didn't work out. but the wwe was right about one thing: hulkamania was finished and a new order needed to be established.this historic wrestlemania, the first to be held outside america, kicked off with rick martel defeating koko b ware. koko never really had a lot of luck at wrestlemania and was taken down in short order here.next up the colossal connection andre the giant and haku put their tag team titles on the line against demolition ax and smash and lost. new tag team champions crowned.next match saw earthquake defeat hercules. hercules was another fellow who didn't really have a lot of luck at wrestlemania. plenty of luck for brutus beefcake as he ended mr perfect's undefeated streak. well, i guess someone had to end it.roddy piper and bad news brown fought to a double count out in a slow but fun match, next up the hart foundation defeated nikolai volkov and boris zhukov in 19 seconds. not really a match, unfortunately. the barbarian then defeated tito santana in a short match.the american dream dusty rhodes and saphire then defeated the macho king randy savage and queen sherri in a messy mixed tag match. this was the only female wrestling really going on in the wwe at this point of time.next up was a fun match as the rockers marty janetty and shawn micheals defeated the orient express in a fast paced encounter. there were a lot of good tag teams at this point in time. jim duggan then beat dino bravo in a nothing match.next ted dibiase put his most cherished possession, the million dollar championship on the line against jake roberts. roberts was distracted by virgil and counted out allowing ted to retain his title in an entertaining match and one of the longer matches on the show.next up the twin towers collide as the big bossman defeats akeem in short order, this is followed by rick rude winning a short match with jimmy snuka.finally we come to the main event with hulk hogan putting the wwe title on the line against intercontinental champion the ultimate warrior. this is an entertaining back and forth match won by the warrior after hogan missed a leg drop. the crowd was extraordinary and the match was a great spectacle.and so the torch was passed, but would the ultimate warrior prove to be the champion the wwe hoped he would be?

a rare lengthy kinski feature role as crazy johnny sex crazed outlaw who is wanted in san francisco. kinski's character is obsessed with raping women a sexual predator in the old west who has nothing more but stealing, raping, and killing on his mind. this movie maybe a major disappointment for many spaghetti western fans but not for many klaus kisnki fans. overall it had two things going for it a great performance from klaus kinski and a great music score by stelvio cipriani. another story line which needed much more work done to it to be impactive but still fun to watch!it would be nice to see this movie redone in the future. since most old movies are being re-made nowadays.

klaus kinski popped up in a sizable number of spaghetti westerns throughout the 60's and early 70's; he was usually cast in secondary parts as nasty villains. kooky klaus lands himself a juicy lead role as crazy johnny laster, a foul, twitchy, and deranged sex maniac who comes up with a plan to abduct a lovely heiress in order to obtain her considerable inheritance. johnny and his gang become wanted fugitives after the plan goes disastrously awry. writer/director mario costa ably crafts a sordidly compelling portrait of a severely sick and twisted piece of sniveling low-life work: the plot unfolds at a steady pace, the tone is appropriately gritty and serious, and the exciting action scenes are staged with real skill and brio (the shoot-outs in rock quarries are especially gripping and thrilling). ironically dressed in white, oozing oily charisma from every rotten pore, and jumping on beautiful women every chance he gets, kinski's johnny makes for a fascinatingly creepy and monstrous brute. kinski is simply spectacular as this gloriously repellent character; he receives fine support from the luscious gabriella giorgelli as sweet, fiery saloon girl juanita, steven tedd as the cheery riccardo, giovanni pallavicino as ruthless band gang leader machete, giuliano raffaella as smart lawyer gary pinkerton, and paolo casella as johnny's sensible parter glen. kudos are also in order for stelvio cipriani's moody and spirited score. well worth seeing for kinski fans.

"buffalo bill, hero of the far west" director mario costa's unsavory spaghetti western "the beast" with klaus kinski could only have been produced in europe. hollywood would never dared to have made a western about a sexual predator on the prowl as the protagonist of a movie. never mind that kinski is ideally suited to the role of 'crazy' johnny. he plays an individual entirely without sympathy who is ironically dressed from head to toe in a white suit, pants, and hat. this low-budget oater has nothing appetizing about it. the typically breathtaking spanish scenery around almeria is nowhere in evidence. instead, costa and his director of photography luciano trasatti, who shot another kinski western "and god said to cain," lensed this horse opera in rather mundane setting around tor caldara, lazio, italy and monte gelato falls, treja river, lazio, italy. nevertheless, "the beast" qualifies as a continental western because it deals with wholly unscrupulous characters and the action could be classified as film noir because the hero and heroine are trapped by intolerable circumstances that compel them to resort to criminal activities. predictably, their well-laid plans backfire owing largely to the kinski character. indeed, the licentious kinski character resembles a wily e. coyote type character. consistently, he struggles to have sex with several beautiful women but either lawmen or outlaws frustrate each of his efforts. ultimately, "the beast" amounts to a tragic character study brimming with irony. the stelvio cipriani orchestral score sounds as if it were lifted by the tony anthony western "the stranger returns." the mario costa screenplay takes place on the western frontier between san diego and mexico that is being terrorized by a notorious mexican bandit called machete (giovanni pallavicino of "we still kill the old way") and his gang. they prey on the stagecoach and nobody is safe from their depredations. the first time that we see 'crazy' johnny laster he pauses to refresh himself at a stream and spots a gorgeous looking woman washing clothes. he creeps up behind her and attacks her, but a bigger man armed with a rifle intervenes and he has to flee. he shows up in a nearby town and a snuff-snorting gunslinger recruits him to help ambush a wealthy man, mr. powers, on the trail and rob him. they wind up killing him and getting no money. mr. snuff-sniffer accidentally leaves his snuff box at the scene of the crime and the sheriff arrests on suspicion of murder. 'crazy' shoots his accomplice from his hotel room so that he doesn't have to worry about being implicated in the crime.meanwhile, a young couple in love are having trouble making their way in the world. riccardo (steven tedd of "requiem for a bounty killer") lives a mexican couple on their ranch and helps them raise their real son juan. in the village, riccardo's lovely girlfriend juanita (gabriella giorgelli of "stranger in sacramento") sings and dances in the cantina. riccardo and juanita plan to marry, but the last place that juanita wants to settle down is on a dusty ranch. she dreams of living in the city, but life in the city requires more money than either riccardo or she has. they team up with a blond outlaw name glen (paolo casella of "shoot the living and pray for the dead") and they plan to kidnap mr. power's daughter nancy when she comes to get her inheritance. glen makes the fatal mistake of enlisting 'crazy' johnny to help them because glen knows that johnny needs the money to get women.they abduct powers' daughter and keep her at a remote cabin with johnny standing guard over her. meantime, juanita masquerades as powers' daughter and shows up in town to get the money from powers' attorney gary pinkerton (giuliano raffaelli of "blood and black lace"), but he grows suspicious because juanita doesn't look anything like he remembered nancy. riccardo brandishes his six-gun and warns pinkerton that they have kidnapped nancy. unfortunately for riccardo and juanita, pinkerton can only lay his hands on $50-thousand because machete has struck such fear into the hearts of everybody that the powers' total inheritance cannot be shipped through the territory by stagecoach. meanwhile, back at the cabin, horny johnny tries to rape nancy, but she outsmarts him, knows him out with a chair on the pretense of needing to be alone while she undresses. after she knocks him unconscious, she steals a buggy and drives it back to town. johnny recovers, pursues her and murders her about the same time that glen, riccardo, juanita, and pinkerton meet him on the trail. they inform johnny about the complications created by machete's reign of terror and give him $12-thousand as his cut of the money. pinkerton is aghast at the sight of nancy's bloodstained corpse and threatens johnny. naturally, johnny guns him down in cold blood on the spot.things really begin to deteriorate as the law in san diego sets out to capture machete. glen, riccardo, and juanita return to mexico while johnny attacks two women at a ranch and narrowly escapes getting caught. he rides to mexico, finds a cantina whore and is going down on her when a bounty shoves a revolver in his face. johnny confesses that he knows where they can find more money if they will release him. machete's men follow up on johnny's tip and capture juanita. the villagers join riccardo to attack machete and johnny rescues juanita but she dies later on after a big shoot-out. riccardo is left standing alone now. machete and his men retaliated against his step parents, not only killing them but also little juan. everything that riccardo and juanita dreamed up having goes up in clouds of gun smoke for an unhappy ending. 'crazy' johnny dies and never gets to assuage his lust. if you think about costa's uncompromising sagebrusher, "the beast" emerges as an interesting character study and an exercise in film noir in a western setting where everybody is punished.

wrestlemania 6 took place april 1, 1990 at the skydome in toronto, ontario, canada.match 1: rick martel vs. koko b. ware - for what it was, a very solid opening match. koko was always fairly popular with the fans, and at this point martel was still getting over as a heel talent. in the end martel is able to snag the win in a pretty non memorable match.match 2: the colossal connection (andre the giant & haku) (c) (with bobby 'the brain' heenan) vs demolition (ax & smash) for the wwf tag team championship - at this point andre's health was really awful, so his performance was really nothing special. the crowd is 100% pro demolition in this match. in the end haku is pinned and we have new tag team champions. after the match andre lays out haku and heenan and turns face at what would turn out to be his last wrestlemania.match 3: earthquack vs hercules - very short match. big dominant heels were really a popular thing at the time. r.i.p. to both men in the match. john tenta (earthquake) passed not that long ago and same with hercules. in the end earthquake pins hercules for the win.match 4: mr. perfect vs brutus "the barber" beefcake - the first really good match of the night. r.i.p. to curt henning (mr. perfect). really solid back and forth action from both of these talented guys. in the end brutus gets the win thanks to a lot of his major fan support during the match.match 5: 'rowdy' roddy piper vs bad news brown - not a technical classic, but a pretty decent brawl for wrestlemania. piper comes out half black/half white in what is considerably a classic moment. in the end both guys fight to a double count out with no clear cut winner.match 6: the hart foundation vs the bolsheviks - complete squash match. the hart foundation gets an easy win. surprising that wwe used to have a tag team division.match 7: the barbarian vs tito santana - bobby heenan's "heenan family" fairs better in this match as the barbarian takes the win against tito santana. not memorable, but good to go back and watch years later.match 8: randy savage & sensational sherri vs dusty rhodes & sapphire - big inter-gender tag team match. dusty rhodes wears the uncomfortable polka dot outfit out to the ring. in the end rhodes and sapphire get the win over "the macho king" and sensational queen sherri.match 9: the rockers vs the orient express - surprisingly another tag team match. tag wrestling used to be so much better during this time period. a young shawn michaels and his partner marty jannetty take a loss by count out in this match to the orient express.match 10: dino bravo vs jim duggan - duggan gets a decent reaction, despite his american patriot gimmick. bravo, a member of jimmy hart's group, comes to the ring with hart and earthquake. although he has support, duggan takes the win.match 11: "the million dollar man" ted dibiase (c) vs jake 'the snake' roberts for the million dollar championship - the first major main event of the night. roberts was extremely over with the fans. match was considerably good for what it was. dibiase is able to pick up a count out win on roberts. but roberts ends up possessing dibiase's money and giving it away.match 12: the big boss man vs akeem (with slick) - one man gang's sad attempt at being an african dream named akeem. a really short match that needed some more time to develop itself as a match. boss man wins with a slam.match 13: jimmy "superfly" snuka vs rick rude - heenan comes to the ring with rude for this match. snuka, never really got it good at wrestlemania. he always seemed to be on the losing end. after a short 5 minutes, rude gets the win over snuka.match 14: wwf champion hulk hogan vs intercontinental champion the ultimate warrior - dubbed as "the ultimate challenge" we get some interesting promos from both men earlier in the night. the match was actually very good, given that people tend to think hogan can't wrestle. a lot of near falls that really got the crowd and people that watch at home into it. in the end warrior gets the win on hogan and wins both titles. a stunned crowd looks on as hulk hogan suffers his first loss at wrestlemania.

wrestlemania 6, is an entertaining wrestlemania, if not an entirely successful one. the ultimate challenge, is of course worth the price of admission alone, but once again as with a lot of the early mania's, there's too much filler in between. the crowd pops for almost everything, and as always, giving us the reliable announcing team of gorilla&the body. having a face vs face match as the main event for a wrestlemania, was absolutely unheard of at this time, it only made things that much more tense. matches. koko b. ware/w frankie vs "the model" rick martel. for a 3 or so minute match, this is as good as it gets. i wish it was a tad longer, but what i got, was pretty damn good. martel wins, with the boston crab.2 1/2 /5wwf tag team championship. demolition vs colossal connection|c|/w bobby heean. huge pop for demolition. match itself is pretty dull, i often had trouble paying attention. andre really didn't do much, so in a way it was more like a 2 on 1. there is solid talent involved here, and it's a shame they couldn't produce better. demolition wins that titles, with there pattened maneuver off the top. crowd blows the roof of for the finish.1 1/2 /5earthquake/w jimmy hart. vs hercules i got what i expected here, a standard boring filler match, with earthquake doing his thing. i'm not really a fan of either, so it didn't perk my interest much. quake wins with his sit down splash.1/5brutus beefcake vs mr.pefect/w the genius. deafening pop for bruti. really good match up, with sadly not enough time given to develop even further. it really kept my interest, and remains one of my favorites on the card. beefcake wins with a slingshot to the post, much to the crowd's approval.3/5roddy piper vs bad news brown. huge pop for piper. nothing more than a boring brawl, that does not know what it wants to be. some entertaining antics from the hot rod, but nothing else. noteworthy for roddy painting himself half black, and calling himself "hot scott"1/5the hart foundation vs the bolsheviks. record breaking, but other than that, nothing to see here. harts win with, the hart attack.0/5the barbarian/w bobby heenan. vs tito santana. average for the time it got, but watchable nonetheless. crowd was rather dead for it, except for heenan's interference. jessie's hilarious cracks, about tito's food is more entertaining, then the match itself. barbarian wins with a nasty looking, flying clothesline off the top.2/5mixed tag match. dusty&sapphire/w elizabeth. vs macho king&sherri. big pop for dusty, and an even bigger one for elizabeth, who looks absolutely stunning, might i add. i thought it was ok. it was lively at least, if nothing that great. i'm not a fan of dusty' so. dusty and sapphire win, when she rolls up sherri.2/5the orient express/w fuji. vs the rockers. crowd is rather anemic for this, surprisingly. decent no doubt, but with these guys involved, it should have been better. the constant focus with fuji, kinda detracts from the match. express wins by count out, when janetty gets nailed with salt.2 1/2 /5jim duggan vs dino bravo/w earthquake&jimmy hart. duggan like an idiot, brings out the american flag in canada. duggan gets some solid boo's for it too, but that also may be due to bravo's canadian heritage. crappy match all around, i don't care for duggan, but that's not why it sucked. too short in the end, to really matter. duggan wins when he whacks bravo in the back, with the two by four. duggan gets splashed for his troubles.0/5million dollar championship. ted dibiase|c|/w virgil. vs jake robers/w damien. some slow spots, but when all was said and done, i had a good time. two solid wrestlers giving it there all, resulted in an entertaining match up. crowd noticeably gets ancy during parts of it though, by doing the wave. dibiase wins by count out. jake has the last laugh, by giving away some of his money, much to the crowd's delight.3/5big bossman vs akeem/w slick. nice pop for the bossman. too routine, and too short to really mean anything, in the end. akeem was a gimmick, i was never too fond of. bossman wins with his slam.0/5the rhythm&blues segment was pretty much a failure. crowd wasn't into itrick rude/w bobby heenan. vs jimmy snuka. for a filler match, before the main event, this wasn't too bad. if it had time to get going more, it would have been excellent, for sure. rude wins, with the rude awakening.2/5title for title. ultimate warrior|ic champ| vs hulk hogan|wwf champ| this one is all about the atmosphere from the crowd, and the split crowd reaction, for the most part. warrior got a pretty decent pop, but in my opinion it was a little underwhelming. hogan dwarfs it completely,with his. it's one of wrestlemania's best matches in history. with two people, who aren't really known for there wrestling, they managed to create an amazing match up that was talked about for ages. i have seen this many times, and my respect level grows higher for each one, for their effort, considering i'm not a fan of either. even die-hard fanatics who crave pure wrestling, can't bitch about this one!. warrior wins with his splash. 5/5bottom line. wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining entry, if nothing overly special. it's memorable for the main event, the location, and the crowd, but it's not one of the best if you ask me. that being said i do enjoy it, and i give it my recommendation to fellow wrestling fans.7/10

this was a very good ppv, but like wrestlemania xx some 14 years later, the wwe crammed so many matches on it, some of the matches were useless. i'm not going to go through every match on the card because it would take forever to do.however major highlights included the huge pop for demolition winning the tag team belts from haku and andre the giant, the first ever mixed tag match featuring randy savage and sensational queen sherri vs dusty rhodes and the late sapphire and the first ever clash between the ultimate warrior and hulk hogan.some matches were a complete waste of time. like the bolsheviks vs the hart foundation was only about 40 seconds long, koko b ware vs rick martel was short and big bossman vs akeem was too short.mr perfect vs brutus beefcake and ted dibiase vs jake 'the snake' roberts were very good indeed.overall grade - b

this movie is amazing. you will never laugh harder. it's a target. no, i think it's...yes it's...a boob! this movie gets funnier by the second--like when jackie chan's character finally dies in his final fight scene. this movie is velly velly seekwet like treasha! congrats if you buy or rent this. you'll never return it, in my opinion. i didn't, and i haven't found it in a store since. i watched this movie once and i was forever in love with kung-fu action flicks. if you're looking for an amazing film in the realm of great production value, good or even mediocre acting, and good special effects...this is not that movie. if you're looking for laughs and timeless wonderment, pick this up for a dollar and you'll probably never let it go. with friends, popcorn and drinks, it's the perfect evening.

the hand of death most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to- due, in no small part, to john woo's masterful direction, coupled with kat's superb cinematography: some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental; there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art-house film. both james tien and sammo hung make for the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate. tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad. it's a role reversal the likes of which i don't think i've ever seen before (tien normally played a hero and, in fact, with his moustache, i didn't even recognize him at first). sammo's goofy "buck teeth" only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed; that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable- in a villain you love to hate kind of way. his choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic. jackie chan appears briefly (early on and late in the going) as a blacksmith, and i believe i actually glimpsed yuen biao somewhere along the way. tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent.

the hand of death aka countdown in kung fu (1976) is a vastly underrated early work by director john woo. the film stars dorian tan (tan tao-liang) and features jackie chan, sammo hung and james tien in significant supporting roles. many people believe, or have been lead to believe by deceptive advertising, that this is a jackie chan film. this is not a jackie chan film, dorian tan is the star but jackie gives one of his best (most serious) early performances.the hand of death is about a shaolin disciple named yunfei (tan) who is sent on a mission to assassinate a shaolin traitor named shih xiaofeng (tien) and protect a revolutionary named zhang yi (woo). along his journey yunfei meets up with a young woodcutter named tan (chan) and a disgraced sword fighter (chang chung) known as "the wanderer." both men have suffered at the hands of shih and want to take revenge. the three team up to defeat shih and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety.the martial arts action is above average under the direction of sammo hung. dorian tan uses his trademark high kicks very effectively as the "northern eighteen styles kicks" along with some "southern five styles boxing." sammo hung and jackie chan provide excellent martial arts performances as well. james tien is not the greatest martial artist on the jade screen but does an acceptable job. some of the early fights are a bit slow and seem over choreographed but the final showdowns featuring chan, tan and hung are very good.director john woo provides plenty of interesting character development in the film, which is refreshing. the cinematography by leung wing kat is very stylish, unique and beautiful for a kung fu film of this era. joseph koo's music: a combination of soft flutes and 70's "shaft" style orchestral pieces is kung fu cinema at its best. hand of death is not jackie and sammo's usual kung fu comedy. hand of death is a serious, straightforward revenge driven story.hand of death aka countdown in kung fu is an underrated classic in the old school kung fu genre. the film is one of the best artistically of its time and a preview of the great things to come from jackie chan and sammo hung. hung's great choreography is put on display here before his directorial debut and chan's early charisma and talent can be clearly seen.hand of death is a solid, stylish old school kung fu film and a brilliant early work of the legendary john woo.kung fu genre rating 7.5/10 wanderer to tan (referring to his new weapon): "the little eagle wing god lance." tan: "just a knickknack."

my friends and i saw this at the san diego black film festival. it was great. stormy is a strong black woman and nana reminds me of my grandmother. rene is fine!!! seeing him take off his clothes was definitely worth the price of admission. can someone forward me his contact info?my friend thinks flex is the finer of the two. she's been a flex fan for years though so she might be a little biased. the cousins were funny and just as trifling as nana described them. lol.i am looking forward to seeing this movie again when it comes to theaters.

true love, i truly enjoyed and loved this movie. it was fun, funny and inspirational. i just saw it on dvd. how did i miss this one it's a winner! i mean flex was "that guy". i wanted to marry him. this was my 1st time seeing him as a straight leading man and he pulls it off. i thought tangi miller was the best ever and i was a felicity head too. a fearless woman who only fears her nana. thank you for giving women of color range in your work and she looks great! tasha smith was a blast! aloma wright was priceless as nana. this cute romantic comedy is "a must see". oh and the new comer marcus patrick is worth the surprise ladies...true love. karen

cute movie feel good movie i had never heard of this movie but ran across it while looking for something to rent. i had high hopes for this movie based purely on flex being in this movie. i have never seen him in anything not worth while. true to form this movie delivered for me. i enjoyed the story. the movie is full of great actors and actresses. the hilarious tasha smith, essence atkins and of course tangi miller. i really liked this movie a lot. i didn't give it five stars because it did not discuss certain issues that i thought the movie should have detailed. the issue was apparently resolved but i would have appreciated a discussion resolving the issues. i liked the movie so much that i am now buying the movie after i've already rented and watched it.

this film was great!tangi miller and flex did a great job. they both look good together and they both pulled it off.tasha smith was so funny as the cousin,and she couldn't stay out of her business.essence held it down for her girl, when she needed her. aloma was sweet and played a dear grandmother she really reminded me of my grandmother.and oh,i can't forget about the stripper, he was so find, and i didn't know if i should cover my eyes or smile while i watch him reveal his sexiness on the big screen.damn! he was fine! tangi looked flawless, and sexy, and she stepped up a notch since felicity. over all the movie had a lot "a" list actors and actress. it was funny, sexy, crazy, touching,loving, emotional and wonderful. this movie is a must see! go it get on dvd now if don't have it!

françois truffaut, young jerk of the "cahiers du cinema", main bastion of the coming so-called new wave, made a big show of hating this film and even accused it of dragging french cinema into mediocrity. translation: truffaut, who was terminally repressed sexually, was already jealous of the way carné could make a huge success of a story that pushed all the right buttons of its audience and actually involved it into something important with all the trappings and seduction of sensuality. in other words, where the general public and many critics saw a perceptive sociological analysis wrapped in a beautiful film, truffaut saw "girls on the loose". carné, after all, had everything that would be severely lacking from the new wave: intelligence, refinement, humour, a great talent as a storyteller, a great ear for dialogue, dazzling technical brilliance, the capacity to make his actors do what he wanted them to do, and a good dose of good taste. by comparison, truffaut is a provincial bore with nothing to say.a 50's tragic remake of "pride and prejudice", the french answer to "rebel without a cause", an updated version of "children of paradise", "les tricheurs" tells a story of disaffected parisian youth who have lost their way in an atmosphere of existentialism, sexual liberation and disrespect for traditional and religious values. some (young) critics perceived carné's take on the subject as the moralizing slant of an "older person", whereas i think what happened, quite to the contrary, is that carné being gay and knowing a thing or two about repression, felt an untold sympathy for the young iconoclasts in his story. furthermore, this being a french film, there is no mistaking that the rebellion in question is essentially sexual, something that still had to be decoded in american films like "rebel without a cause" and "the wild one".carné's young people are all supremely beautiful, graceful, elegant, spontaneous and intelligent. they are gods and goddesses. they drive the latest vespas and the right cars. the cut of their suits, dresses and duffle-coats was a high point of the fashions of the last century. their haircuts are still plastered on the wall of your local hairdresser. their body shape, which they attained and maintained without effort, is still the modern western ideal. they listen to the best jazz musicians. they know how to move, how to be sexy and how to make love  even though the pill hasn't yet been invented. they know how to negotiate different social classes and cultures. unfortunately, they are defined by and live by the code of the gang and their own heartless rituals that exclude sentimentality and make a sin of romantic love. the only thing wrong with them is that their elders don't talk to them and vice-versa. the incidents depicted in this film got a lot of tongues wagging for a long time in france about the amorality and nihilism of youth while still making it a huge public and critical success.this film is so stylish and gorgeous, i suspect the older viewers who watched it wished they could be like the people depicted in the film and quite a few young filmmakers or aspiring filmmakers like truffaut developed a bad case of jaundice reflecting how they could never conceivably make a film as sexy or popular as this one, although they would be very good at eventually aiming for the nihilistic bits. on the other hand, given a certain clichéd aspect of the script (amorous misunderstanding leading to a medical emergency), one can only wonder at the horribly pious and puritanical mishmash americans would have extracted from the same basic script if they had dared to tackle the subject.interestingly, the movie was filmed in the same basic locations as the american musical "funny face" a year earlier. where hollywood saw the picturesque aspects of the rive gauche and existentialism, carné restituted its tragic and ironic dimension. watch this trailer on youtube: 19zkkeonjpo

it's generally an accepted fact that marcel carné's 1936-1946 movies are masterpieces and it's considered polite to say that the rest are mediocrities.this is an unfair opinion:at least ,two of the latter era are eminently watchable:"thérèse raquin" ,his best post-war work,and "les tricheurs" (the cheats).there's a strange evolution from the prevert golden hour to "les tricheurs":in "les enfants du paradis" "quai des brumes" or "le jour se lève",true love is thwarted by the villains. in "les tricheurs" true love does not exist anymore:we deal with a bunch of young people who believe in nothing;falling in love would be incongruous for this youth.the adults are not the villains at all:mic's brother and mother are kind people ,but she is beyond their command.very few grown-ups appear anyway.during two hours,the characters do not stop playing around,dancing,listening to jazz records(a music which was not still part of the bourgeois culture),and heavily drinking .when two of them discover they care for each others ,it will be too late.the cast is rather good ,laurent terzieff as an existentialist cynic and andréa parisy as a rich kid are the stand-outs.on the other hand,pascale petit and mainly jacques charrier(who married brigitte bardot the same year as "les tricheurs")do not possess the ambiguity their parts ask for.they are all smile,too sweet and to nice to be believable.oddly,"les tricheurs" was labeled "nouvelle vague"!when you know what the priests of this cinema school (the likes of godard)thought of carné ,it's really a good joke.but this disenchantment you feel throughout the whole movie is really disturbing.

i blow hot and cold over carné. he really can be a puzzle for me. i think perhaps his inspiration left him a little earlier than it did for other directors of his generation. certainly a man who came to maturity in the thirties with the popular front seems ill at ease in the france of the fifties, with its rampant commercialism and heavy american influence. he is almost thirty years older than his young stars, and it shows. the party scenes go on much longer than they should, as if he were trying to buy time for the anemic scenario to work. roland lesaffre's character--he plays pascale petit's older brother--seems to exist only to reassure the director that his old-style ideas are still sound.at two hours, this picture is far too long. still, let me praise pascale petit for her game performance; she was a natural who should have challenged brigitte bardot for sexpot supremacy, but somehow lost her way. andrea parisy is excellent too as the girl who gets pregnant and wants charrier to marry her and make her baby legitimate (yes, they still thought that way in the fifties). laurent terzieff is the only french actor who could play an anarchist convincingly: he is great here as he rescues a cat from death, then remarks he can't stand cats. jacques charrier only reminds me how mediocre he was as an actor, with that constant little grin and those blank eyes.

first, i rated this movie 10/10. to me, it's simply one of the best i saw since i was born (i'm 23, but i saw numerous films). the story is cruel, but reality is, too, not ? it went deep into me and stirred my bowels. i saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me - and i still remember it !second, there is no 'national preference' (this expression is a direct translation from the french) for this movie. i mean it's not because it is a french movie that i put it so high : it has really caught me when i saw it. furthermore, i don't know well marcel carne's filmography, so i don't know if it is or not his best movie, but i know it is not his most famous : hotel du nord, quai des brumes and les enfants du paradis are the most famous.third, the movie's in b&w, but it deals with inter-temporal problems of youth (not acne) like love, friends and studies in a modern way. it could even be remade frame-by-frame with actual young actors, a dolby(tm) sound and special effects (a car crash), it would still be a great film !problem : maybe is it a film to be seen by young adults (from 16 to 25 years old) - and above, of course - for its message to be well understood... did i say it was a great movie ?

this late 50s french study of disaffected youth (in their early 20's, actually--"grown up", but not yet settled down into the adult world) probably missed the mark by a mile in terms of being an accurate depiction of 1958 french youth (don't virtually all youth films made by adults do this? the ones that don't--river's edge comes to mind-- are rare indeed), but director-writer marcel carne, of les enfants du paradis fame, is too accurate an observer of humanity to not provide an insightful view of the essence of these characters. in a sense, the details are not important--you could change the details and set this film today and it would work just as well--but the loneliness and insecurity and superficial passion and self-righteous anger of the characters is captured well. the young pierre brice and jean-paul belmondo are in supporting roles, but leads jacques charrier, laurent terzieff, pascale petit, and andrea parisy play the roles with subtlety and depth. there is also a fine jazz score, which you can get on the cd jazz in paris--jazz & cinema vol. 2. unlike some who have commented on the film, i don't really see director-writer carne as sitting in judgment on these characters--he seems as though he is an objective observer to me. of course, these middle-class characters may seem like people who are spoiled and have nothing to whine about to some working-class viewers of the film, and i think carne is certainly aware of this. for this american viewer (i watched a dubbed, fairly literally i'd say, version of this titled the cheaters), the film provides an interesting window into the france of the 1950s. it also is self-consciously poetic (the scene on the ledge, saving the cat, is but one example of this) and has intellectual aspirations in that charming way that only french films can get away with--i can imagine the heavy-handed, melodramatic, shallow way this kind of material would have been handled by an american studio production, and the sensationalistic, moralistic, suggestive way this kind of material would have been handled by american drive-in/exploitation filmmakers. i feel that marcel carne has captured the essence of that period between, say, high school graduation and when, by one's early 30s, people have largely settled into a routine, whatever that routine may be. those willing to watch the film with an open mind and not fire away at the many easy targets it offers should find a serious and valuable study of people in their early twenties. and even if you don't want to do that, you can go in the other room while the film is playing and simply enjoy the fine soundtrack, with great 50s jazz and instrumental pop, including the wonderful original score by an american "jazz at the philharmonic" group including coleman hawkins, dizzy gillespie, stan getz (spelled "goetz" in the credits), roy eldridge, and ray brown.

as an adult, i am grateful to have caught this movie by chance when i was a teen. during the time, i was experiencing familial problems. this particular movie managed to capture what i was seeing from a closeted world. how much peer pressure is too much? i actually had to purchase this movie because it reached me on a level unlike most films try to reach an audience. how far might an individual go for social acceptance? who is the "bad" crowd? teenagers do struggle trying to find out the answers to these questions, but ultimately...who is the "pack leader" if there must be one? is it the strong? the beautiful? perhaps the person we just all seem to like? could it be the moral character? as far as the movie goes, the cast worked together as if it were predestined. i only hope that more directors and producers try to create a piece of work that reaches all of us like this particular movie reached me. i wish i could vote higher than ten because this particular title deserves much more.

i just saw this movie on showtime in the wee hours of the night. i was viewing the beginning with one eye open, but instead of drifting off to sleep, i became invested in this crafty, nail-bitter of a movie. it was very believable and engaging. i could have done without so much profanity(as with every david mamet movie i see), but thoroughly enjoyed the experience. i know teenagers swear, but i don't need to listen to it. anyways, the story had some interesting surprises which i won't reveal but if you have a chance to catch this movie on showtime, i think you will enjoy it as much as i have.

as a camera operator, i couldn't help but admire the great look that this picture achieved. the performances were excellent, as was the story. just when i thought this film was about to slow down, it didn't. heart-pounding tension, great pacing through editing, and a score that knows when to be quiet all come together here under competent and capable direction. the camera was always in the right place. love that.

born bad is a well put together crime drama about a group of teenage kids. teens as well as young adults would find this movie well acted and entertaining. the movie is similar to the black circle boys in the sense that a bunch of teenage boys go around their town making up their own rules and not caring about the consequences.

this is a great movie for all corey feldman fans. this movie has a great cast of young actors. a group of teens decide to rob a bank to get some quick cash, but all goes wrong when a security gaurd gets shot and they take hostages

i just watched the dvd version of born bad and found it to be tense, gritty and, near the end, too graphic for the faint of heart. justin walker (clueless) and corey feldman turn in superior performances. for a low budget film, this picture delivers. the depth of character and clever dialogue are two things not usually seen in a roger corman picture. check it out on dvd!

mishima - a life in four chapters is in my opinion the best paul schrader film to this day. mesmorizing cinematography, accompanied with philip glass mystical musical score added a completely magical aura to the story of one of the japan's greatest novelists, whose originality and picturesque narrative are beautifully portrayed in this picture. as any gifted character, mishima was troubled with severe self conflicts, the main of them being the conflict between the "pen and a sword" as the director puts it in his final chapter, or the struggle between the sensitive poet with homosexual feelings, living in a notoriously masculine society with centuries long warrior traditions, thus widening the gap between the sensitive and the militantly traditional side of mishima himself.all schrader's films (and the ones he wrote scripts for) are basically stories of the inside conflict within a man that doesn't belong in an environment he lives in. that also goes for mishima, who, apart from japanese military school upbringing is brought up with love for theater and words. his demise consisted of both of these key points in his life, it was about words and theatrical ending in a life long play. film like this comes along once in a long while, and most will have to wait a lifetime to reach this beauty. 20 out of 10!!

the only pure life, is one that ends with a signature in blood.so says mishima anyway, a young sheltered boy who becomes a celebrity author. the life of one of japans most celebrated literary voices, is told from three perspectives, his life just before he and four members of his private army take over a japanese military base and commit ritual suicide(shown in color), flashbacks(shown in black and white), and scenes from his novels(shown in a kind of dreamy technicolor set design somewhere between traditional noh theater and "the wizard of oz". these stories are often told at the same time, but are edited to reinforce, the slow fusing of mishima's life with his fictions, until the end(or the beginning) when like the ancient samurai he so admires, he will be at a balance of pen and sword (when his words and actions are the same, and he is a full and "pure" being).paul schrader wrote the screen play for "taxi driver", and directed "cat people"(a bizarre erotic horror film, which left strange impressions on me as a boy), and in mishima, he comes closest to making a really excellent film.whats interesting is to watch the poet, the homosexual, the shy and awkward man with a low body image who overstates his tuberculosis to get of of ww2 (of which he seems forever ashamed), become a body building, samurai obsessed, a-sexual, media phenomena, all the while still writing prolific amounts of novels, plays, and short stories.a short and sweet version is to say mishima has no father, and becomes obsessed with masculinity, beauty, sex and self destruction, in some tragic attempt to feel connected to something bigger than himself, that he was always missing. watching him with his fellow suicidal cadets, you see him happy, delivering his big paternal speech, giving orders, and loving the control...until the speech itself, the point where pen and sword meet? of course, this ignores the subtlety of the story telling craft here which makes this transformation so natural and remarkable. though the story, fascinating at times, really isn't this movies greatest success. the cinematography, performances, editing,music(by philip glass), and set designs, are really what make this worth seeing, and more than a traditional bio-pic.one day i will pick, up a mishima book, he does seem to have an ear for prose, and for staging ideas, but for now i'm satisfied with the film.those interested in japanese literature, and post-war culture, should check out. fans of inventive combinations of facts and fictions, should enjoy as well.

this is a very amazing movie! the characters seemed so realistic to me, it was hard to believe they weren't real people. being from the south, i thought judith ivey's character seemed especially real, and as everyone else has mentioned, she does an outstanding acting job. the characters are not beautiful and look nothing like the average hollywood stars - their imperfect bodies and personalities seem so much more natural and real. one reviewer mentioned that the main character, alice, had no good reason to run away from home, which is true - she didn't have any moral or upstanding reason to run away, such as escaping child abuse, etc. i thought that she was just fed up with dead-end jobs in a working class life and wanted to flee down to florida where her friend lived the appealing and privileged life of a college student in miami. the actress shows alice's confusion, uncertainty, and questioning turn into decisiveness and willingness to take control of her life with impressive naturalness. the film also shows how alice is trapped in situations with seemingly no options, causing her to panic, take action, and reach out for help. at first, the grainy filming style put me off and made me think that it was a very low budget or homemade movie, but in actuality it is very well done. the home movie quality really makes you feel like you are there with the characters, a part of their rv trip across the country. this is definitely a film worth seeing, although i don't quite understand all the descriptions of it as a heart-warming coming of age tale. it is rather vulgar and disturbing at times, even if it is not completely sad in the end.

while i can understand some of the points made regarding the cinematography (i thought a more purposeful approach would have better supported the low-fi, home movie feel) i must say that i thought the script and acting of what alice found were excellent! dean bell has crafted a real gem that judith ivey charms with character-driven delight. her performance of sandra is a pleasure -- unfolding, alternately, as diabolical and romantic. we are at once intrigued and repulsed by her actions... and never given more information than is necessary. her's and the supporting cast's efforts meet bell's post-modern fairy tale with arms wide open. emily grace's alice is infused with a doey-eyed magic. she seems to mold like clay before us, morphing into some sort of beautiful, lost beast. by the end, we are at odds with words, as she is, saying goodbye to her mother. kudos also should be doled out to jane lincoln taylor -- whose mother provides the right amount of tragic historic weight -- and justin parkinson -- whose shy first-time john, sam, provides one of the sweetest, if not most awkward, sex scenes in film. bell has created a first rate story and assembled a plethora of talent to make it.

it's a sad state in corporate hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking routes you've been seeing in the movie house since day one. i had literally no idea how this film was going to end, because it went left when i expected it to go right, zigged when i expected a zag, etc. this could have easily unraveled into generic suspense thriller, or depressing white trash drama, but it stayed a course all its own till the end. it is a sad story, though. not because of what happens to alice, but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her down this path.the plot has a quiet dignity of form that's usually reserved for theater, but the pacing could use some tightening up. either way, it's a very good film, and for some reason i suspect sour grapes from those who have scored this one low.

having worked professionally with young girls on the run, i found this film surprisingly authentic. i would never have found it had a friend not loaned his videotape. there are classic themes here: coming of age, mother/daughter estrangement, the limited choices of the underprivileged, who is the good samaritan, tragedy is in every life & the many layers or relationships. flashbacks are meaningful (when alice acquires a gun we know she has some familiarity with how to use it) and it does not end in cliché. the cast really "sells" their roles. it is adult material and the audio is a bit too grainy. allow it 15 minutes to so to draw you in.

i recently got the movie and all i can say it is a good movie. there's a lot of famous rome monuments and historical locations.it is from the same writer and director from the da vinci code. tom hanks stars along with ewan mcgregor and ayelet zurer. the movie starts out with the space and time experiment in sweden until one of the canisters is stolen by the church's most hated enemy the illuminati. the plot is hard to discuss about without spoiling anything. its a race all of rome following the illuminati trail to get to the illuminati secret meeting place. while racing against time to find the path of the illuminati. over all its a movie worth seeing hell i watched it 3 times and i still like it so in the end go buy it. it is a lot better than the movie 2010. and the ending has one awesome plot twist.

first i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than the da vinci code. sure, you have the religion vs science problem but it doesn't try to make a big statement about it. its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well. one scene particularly (that involves fire) i found extremely well done. second, the changes from book to film. although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others, i gotta admit i was wrong. it was refreshing that the film didn't follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done in da vinci. if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though. however the big twist is still there so don't worry about that. finally i'm glad they removed some silly sub-plots and didn't even try to hint at the possibility of langdon and vittoria getting together. the performances are really good, but nothing out of the ordinary. that's okay for a film like this. i'd give it a 9/10, mainly because it delivers what it promises, entertainment, pure entertainment

so first things first..angels and demons is a much better and very different film than the da- vinci code.following the recent slew of comic book movies, remakes and questionable resurrections of aged franchises. it is refreshing to watch a very solid and entertaining film that is devoid of shaky cam filming techniques, lens flare, excessive gci and over the top action sequences.in this respect angels and demons almost feels old fashioned.it offers a good and considered debate on the age old subject of religion vs science, offers an insight in to the parallels between the grand houses of god in rome (beautifully shot by the way) and the temple of modern science that is cern's large hadron collider facility.hanks is hanks pretending to be the smart guy and he fits the role much better second time around than his wooden performance in da-vinci. good support is offered by a rock solid cast, with a particular highlight being armin mueller-stahl's stoic cardinal. but the films main saving grace is it's pace. for the entire running time i was totally engrossed in the story and the film never really gave me time to sit and pick apart its faults in logic.my only serious criticism is that some of the science depicted is at best debatable regards real world authenticity. but that is not the fault of the film makers, rather an observation of the old adage that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story..speaking of which the story is a cracker, mixing adventure and a race against time with a good sprinkling of intelligence and a nice twist or two along the way.overall i would highly recommend this to fans of either of the national treasure movies (which this clearly mimics but with a much more serious vibe) and fans of ripping adventure tales in general.

as i sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity ron howard and tom hanks call the da vinci code, i could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is angels and demons.hanks and company are back for the sequel-prequel angels and demons, and they have learned their lesson.acting wise everyone is much better. aylet zurer is very good as vittoria vetra, and better than the girl who played sophie neveau. tom hanks is very good as always, he is better in this though, because he works harder at giving the movie the feeling that it is a thriller. i think ewan mcgregor does the best job of any of the actors. he might even deserve a nomination come march, but doubtful. he had me convinced right until the very end. he's dynamic and faithful, but rational, and realizes that the church needs to put their past behind them. the minor actors also do very good jobs.technically and visually the movie is much improved. the cinematography is much...much better, and the visual effects are superb. the final explosion sequence at the end is excellent. howard does a masterful job, taking you through a tour of rome.pacing wise, ron howard does an amazing job this time around at keeping the story moving, and not boring us with a history lesson deemed at denouncing christianity. the movie also makes you feel like more is at stake. in our feeble minds discovering whether or not jesus had children, is not as high up on the list compared to a cataclysmic explosion killing thousands including the roman catholic church. part of the reason i think the story is so fast paced is due to the excellent score. i cannot say enough about the score. it was epic at times, like something from lord of the rings, but then sometimes it felt like a bourne movie, which is a nice mix.my only complaint about this movie is that it is ridiculously far fetched. the chances of the carmelengo being someone of ewan mcgregors age are highly improbable, and the chances of a cardinal with an adopted son getting elected pope are even more ridiculous. not to mention the whole antimatter thing, which has yet to be created, and dan brown wrote the book in 2003...overall angels and demons is much tighter knitt, faster paced, more exciting, and more important movie than the da vinci code. this is must see thriller for anyone who loves history and mystery combined into one.

goldrush: a real life alaskan adventure is a great tv film for all ages. the movie focuses around "fizzy" (alyssa milano) who wants to go on travel for gold in alaska. the only person who hires her is pierce thomas madison (bruce campbell). what comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget. this tv film was just great. the acting is #1 (especially by bruce campbell and alyssa milano) and i also learned some information about the goldrush. i recommend this tv film to all without hesitation. it is also based on a true story.10/10

"valley girl" launched nicolas cage's career and was an 80's version of "romeo and juliet." it is a definite example of an 80's teen classic. nicolas cage, deborah foreman and elizabeth daily all have brilliant portrayals in this movie, but it will never top "fast times at ridgemont high" as the ultimate 80's teen flick because if it weren't for "fast times," then the 80's generation of teen flicks would just be a big blow to the head. that's for sure.

here is a movie of adventure, determination, heroism, & bravery. plus, it's set back in the late 1800s which makes it even more interesting. it's a wonderful, adventurous storyline, and alyssa milano is wonderful at playing the wholesome, confident, no-nonsense fizzy...a great role-model. this is one of my favorite movies. it is a movie to be watched again and again and will inspire you and enrich your life without a doubt. not only is the storyline excellent, but the movie also has fabulous scenery and music and is wonderfully directed. this movie is as good as gold!

this is good movie that is flawed in many ways with low production. martha coolidge herself said she only had 350,000 dollars to work with. this is a movie that i loved growing up in the midwest. i remember friends and i having the nostalgia trip on this movie 10 years ago. great things about this movie....great cast with hungry actors and a hungry director. bad points of this movie....to small of a budget calling for way too much improvisation. if martha coolidge had been given more money and time on this movie then the results would of been even better. they should have taken the story from an early 20's prospective and not from a 15-17 year old high school stand point. most of the actors/actresses were in their early to mid 20's trying to play 15-17 year olds....(come on) the music is extremely memorable and the two soundtracks get played all the time in my car. the best scenes in this film take place in seedy hollywood clubs by nicolas cage's character. i gave this film a high rating of 9/10 for five reasons.. nicholas cage's improvisational on the spot acting; the camera work and angles are excellent given the budget they had and only being able to have one take of each scene; the sytles, music and lingo are captured perfectly and forever; again the music is incredible and carries the story along from scene to scene; and finally...martha coolidge could turn a weak script, unknown actors and a very very low budget and 20 days of shooting the entire movie into such a good and memorable movie is astounding!

this is a romantic, albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites. it is one of the many classics of the 80's genre like "pretty in pink" or "some kind of wonderful".nic plays the traditional punk guy in love with the traditional valley, preppy girl julie. it is a heartwarming love story that makes you root for him to win the girl in the end.true, most of the acting sucks but ...i have been in love with nic since seeing this in the theaters and have seen nearly every movie he's been in since. he's really grown as an actor but it is obvious in this early movie of his that he had a lot of potential.if you love 80's movies, you will love this classic.go rent it!!!!!

i'm glad cage changed his name from coppolla and got this part on his own. light-hearted, no deep thought needed, but a cute piece about opposites attracting- though her parents are still hippies.... captures the voice of the early 80's- the whine of the valley and the funk of the other side. one can see the beginning of cage's talent.

i have to say this is my favorite movie of all time. i have seen it well over 100 times (actually had to buy a new copy as a result of overwatching) it is what the eighties was like and what a romantic story with a few morals thrown in. i highly recommend to anyone wanting to relive the high schools days again. buy a copy now it is a classic!!!!

valley girl is an exceptionally well made film with an all-around great cast. even though the dialogue is a bit dated now, when the movie was released it was very hip. to this day, i know many people (teenagers included) that cannot form a sentence without using the word "like". that is without a doubt the legacy this movie will leave. a rating of 8 was given for this, like, most excellent movie.

i've seen this movie quite a few times and each time i watch it, the quirkier and funnier it becomes. perhaps its the lack of research that went into nicolas cage's character's 'punk' persona or just the cheesiness factor because it was such a typical eighties film...nonetheless it's a cute love story with extremely funny, unique characters. i think it's right up there with "fast times" and "weird science" (quintessential eighties flicks!)

sweet, rich valley girl develops crush on a punk from the alley and when her snobby friends disapprove of him, she's forced to choose between her heart and her popularity. very funny romantic comedy blends in elements of black comedy and '80's cheese that make this all the more fun to watch. the movie not only follows the life of the valley girl and her punk; but her friends too as they shop, party, hang out, and go to the mall. if the dialogue doesn't have you laughing non-stop for a week, the music will. songs like "johnny, are you queer?" are found throughout. also, elizabeth daily is a funny, existential character and the prom king & queen speech at the end is hilarious!

there were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but there were only a handful that were made with thought, made you laugh and captured the time period right; this was one of them. cage is hillarious, so is forman who from her bio unfortuatley has dissapeared from the hollywood limelight. i'd love to see this released on dvd with in a special version with commentaries by cage and forman. wishful thinking, i know. ever want to plan a true 80s movie weekend, rent this, sure thing and 16 candles and breakfast club. it will take you back to a "totally rad" time which it seemed at the time, was a lot more simple. memo to studios: time to release the dvd!

valley girl is the definitive 1980's movie with catch phrases filtered throughout this wonderfully acted movie. the characters are so convincing that you forget it is a movie and not a video of an actual "day-in-the-life" of any high school, usa. this flick is to the 1980's what the brady bunch tv series is to the 1970's. if you don't like it, well then "gag me with a spoon."

this typical teenagers movie is one of the best, beside the story is good, the music is well accompany the movie all along. although i do not enjoy classic movie unless it is classic and better written script, this one is exceptional. maybe the hair style and language should be change a bit, in the 80's i believe offensive language is still rarely heard.

while boris(aleksey batalov)is off to fight in war against the germans for his mother russia, his beloved veronika(tatyana samojlova)marries his conniving cousin mark(aleksandr shvorin)in a moment of weakness shortly after her parents were killed in an air raid over moscow. through various trials and betrayals, veronika will await word or letter from boris no matter how long it takes, holding hope that he will return to her.powerful piece of film-making boasts simply incredible photographic work by cinematographer sergei urusevsky. some of the many magnificently framed, moving shots include the scene where the camera follows veronika through a crowd of loved ones saying goodbye to each other as she rushes through the mob of bodies to say goodbye to boris..and doesn't quite reach him even as we watch boris looking impatiently into the swarm without luck. the sequence after the air raid where veronika walks up the standing stairs circulating up the destroyed building she once called home and the scene where mark makes his lustful move on veronika as another air raid continues just outside the building as wind rustles the curtains and flashes of light emanate inside are just two of many examples where sergei urusevsky shows his genius at framing images that will last forever on film. but, without the power and tragedy of the story regarding how war can forever shape the destiny of a couple who dearly, deeply love each other, this film couldn't hold up with the beauty of the visual alone. together, however, we're left with an amazing film..simply a haunting masterpiece from the soviet union after stalin breathed his last breath. i feel honored just have beheld such a great film.

what can i say?? this movie has it all...romance, break-ups, rich kids, punks and preps. this is my all time favorite movie that i can recite line for line....i remember when it first came out, i was 14 and couldn't get in....so finally got to see it on cable... i was hooked! wanted to move to california and be a valley girl.. (hey, i even remember the song by moon zappa, do you?) tried in vain for years to get the never produced soundtrack...now you can find it on rhino records....

nicolas cage and deborah foreman provide stunning performances in this 80's tour de force! a great 80's movie akin to fast times at ridgemont high! i highly recommend this movie to any child of the 80's who hasn't seen it. it's a cult classic.

for the most part, romance films were never my cup of tea. but valley girl is one of the few romance films i not only could sit through, but actually enjoy. nicholas cage is great in his first role and deborah foreman is cute beyond belief. there are some side stories that tend to become muddled, but not enough to diminish this film.

one of the better teen comedies to be filmed during the 80's, valley girl has a young nicolas cage in a starring role. deborah foreman is fun as the object of cage's desire (and whatever happened to her?). look for veteran actors colleen camp and frederic forrest as julie's hippie parents - they're quite funny!

we still really love the movie and soundtrack "valley girl". i have owned it on video for eons and wore out the original soundtrack. i have several friends with whom i get together and we have "80's raves" - parties where we get together and play 80's music and run "valley girl" on the big screen - and we're all in our 30's now. we have an awesome time.it's all in good fun, like, ya know?

i just love this film it totally rocks! nicolas cage looks hot and tommy does not! i definitely feel that fred and randy should have had a little more time together on screen cause they're totally cool. my favorite part is when he says "peter piper picked a pepper i guess i did!"

putting aside the "i'm so sure"s and "totally gnarly"s this is one of the sweetest and lifelike romances portrayed on film. deborah foreman (where is she now?) as julie and nicolas cage as randy are as classic as romeo and juliet, tony and maria, jake and samantha... you can't help but fall in love with them. plus the soundtrack - the plimsouls, sparks, the furs, the flirts, and of course, modern english - is also outstanding. for fans of films about young love, i'd equally recommend the recent film all the real girls by david gordon green.

i remember seeing this film when i was 13 years old and i fell in love with it and i was a big fan of the film and the characters i adored. my favorite character was stacey (heidi holicker), because she made me laugh when she showed no interest in fred (cameron dye) who really liked her and i was hoping that in the end that they would get together then her boring boyfriend, ralphie (christopher murray)because he ignored her and hung out with his friends. i love the cast and the story. i always love the part when fred try to get together with stacey, and i always remember when he chased her around the car. but it was so good. i'll always remember cherish that in my teen years. now that i am 33 years old and i picked up my copy on dvd and will look forward seeing it.

20 years later and this movie still has echoes of its greatness floating around. never has a movie surpassed valley girl's incredible soundtrack. the movie completely encapsulated the 80's to such a perfect degree that it could only be realized this many years later. nicolas cage at his best. a movie that just has so much character to it, that it makes you realize how sad hollywood has become (as far as quality goes). the special edition dvd is loaded with tons of extras and well worth it to purchase it as you'll have plenty of material to sift through. for sure.

this gem captures early 80's life brilliantly. as a grad '83 boymyself, i must say that valley girl (along with fast times atridgemont high )stands out as the class of the teen sex filmgenre. the characters are accurate representatives of the era; thevapid mall chicks, pseudo punk rebels, preppy jocks are allrepresented here.i have seen this over ten times now. the music in the film was topnotch. unfortunately, these tunes could were never as popular intheir era as those by arena cockrockers like journey, styx orloverboy. before the soundtrack existed, i searched out recordsand tapes (it was the 80's after all !) of josie cotton, sparks,plimsouls and modern english.this movie deserves respect. it isn't just a good 80's teen flick. it isa great film. period.

in my review just submitted i referred to the young actress lead as katerina when it should have been veronika. i was so involved with character and the action i guess that i wasn't that concerned with names. anyway, she and the film are brilliant. as i said, the cinematography and the director's use of montage are worthy of eisenstein and his cameraman, tisse'. the production design is top notch. the placement of actors in the foreground, middle ground and background within any given mise en scene is worthy of study. stunning, memorable camera movement, and an ending that has an emotional punch that leaves hollywood films far behind. gee! heroic self sacrifice instead of walking into the rainbow. thanks again, john hart

this is the essence of the early eighties! the malls, the credit card machines, the food, the punk hair color, the soundtrack... i am in love with this movie. this sweet, intelligent romeo & juliet teen flick is instantly addictive.martha coolidge is one of my favorite directors. she really employs her actors, like john hughes and steven soderberg, so check out -joy of sex- and -real genius-. the soundtracks for -valley girl- are great. if you can find a copy of the film, buy it! it's out of print and very hard to come by.

i really liked this movie, it totally reminds me of my high school days. the soundtrack is awesome. i am a huge nic cage fan and this is my favorite movie that he is in. i love the storyline, it is a total love story, against the odds kind of thing. i think anyone who graduated in the early eighties (1980-1984) should see the movie. it totally brought back memories of high school for me.

this movie is one of my all time favorite movies and is what made me a lifelong nicolas cage fan. back in the mid-80's i taped this movie (when vcr's were impossible to do this with!!) and would watch it over and over. nicolas cage is just brilliant here. and, he looks wonderful and has no affecting "acting-isms" (see "peggy sue got married" to know what i mean about that!!). i measure all his performances against this one. he was so perfectly cast as the cool punk guy with the edgy friends. the music was great. the plimsouls! the psychodelic furs! modern english! men at work! whenever i hear "melt with you" i am taken back to the finale of this movie. what ever happened to his cute costar, deborah foreman? and his hysterical friend, cameron dye? certainly took a different turn than nicolas! interestingly, the slutty friend (elizabeth daily) ended up being the voice of tommy from the rugrats (she is billed as e.g. daily for that horrid show)! bizarre!if you want to take a great trip back to the 80's, watch this movie. it is definitely a classic. like totally!

but perhaps you have to have grown up in the 80's to truly appreciate this movie. if you love the early 80's this is definitely a must see. also, one of the best soundtracks ever!

it was 1983 and i was 13. i watched valley girl on hbo one night when my parents were working. after it ended i wanted to talk with someone about it immediately. turns out my best friend watched it too and it became our favorite movie. every weekend after that we watched it until we could recite it. we woke her parents up late at night laughing hysterically. we began to worship the main character, julie, played by the beautiful deborah foreman. i am not saying this is a great classic. although it is for me personally. and i understand that the whole valley girl talk becomes annoying but that was the 80's. but deep down at the heart of the movie-it is a love story, and a familiar but good one. girl meets boy and there are sparks from both sides, an instant connection. julie's friends don't like him-he doesn't fit in, doesn't go to their school, doesn't have money. they like her better with her ex-boyfriend the football player even though he is a jerk. she makes the ultimate sacrifice-her own happiness for her friends' happiness. and she has these really cool supportive hippie parents. it is one of nicholas cage's first movies and his first starring role. one minute he is absolutely hilarious and the next incredibly touching and romantic. his friend fred is pretty funny too. if you were a teenager in the 80's you will love this movie or at the very least it will bring back memories. it is no longer my favorite movie but it is still one of my favorites, probably in my top 10. i am eagerly awaiting it's release on dvd if they ever release it. you can go to deborah foreman's website to sign a petition to get it released on dvd and there are 2 soundtracks from the movie that are must haves if you like 80's music.

valley girl will always hold a special place in my heart: i would say this is certainly the best of the 80's teen-sex-comedies, but that is a back-handed compliment. this is a good movie, period. it is very specific in time and place--nearly twenty years later this is a marvelous snapshot--yet its story remains timeless. (this is just romeo and juliet, minus the death, after all!) nicolas cage is wonderful, showing all the early promise that, it turns out, he has squandered on overblown action crapola. deborah foreman is the revelation of this movie, and i can't believe she didn't go on to have a bigger career; someone rediscover her quick. this is sweeter and gentler than most films of the genre--the requisite nudity seems thrown in by contractual obligation--and, while not groundbreaking, it certainly is nice to see this kind of movie that respects its characters and doesn't crucify its shallow young girls for having fun--even foreman's crew of best friends, misguided by peer pressure, are never presented as villains. (indeed, her friend stacy, forced to doubledate w/ cage's friend fred, has a good time despite her protests, and makes out w/ fred in the backseat.) this will take you back to the early 80's if you were there, but it holds up quite well today. warning to those unfamiliar with the movie: do not watch one of vh1's seemingly continual showings of it--go rent it in its unedited glory. otherwise, you are missing some of the movies' most potent, time-specific dialogue. and one can't write about valley girl and not mention the fabu soundtrack of great 80's tunes--most of them by one-hit wonders, which are not only integral to the sense of time and place in this movie, but thematically well-chosen. see it--awesome little flick! fer shur!!

this film is the most romantic in years. david duchovny is superb. he´ll make you cry, smile and dream. minnie driver and james belushi are very good too. but, david is astonish. don´t miss the opportunity to see this little film and fall in love with bob and grace. run, don´t walk!

i don't normally go out of my way to watch romantic comedy, and maybe i will in the future after seeing return to me. the plot was simple and no secret after the publicity. you don't have to be einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes. what you can do is relax and let the cast take you into a world where the "chemistry" abounds and the good guys win and you can just laugh and have a good time. i love this movie....and have the dvd on order!

my yardstick for measuring a movie's watch-ability is if i get squirmy. if i start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore, the film is too long. this movie did not even come close to being boring. predictable in some parts sure, but never boring.all of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up, why not the coast guard too? they are definitely under-appreciated, until the day your boat sinks that is.the movie was very enjoyable and fun. kevin costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesn't know when to quit. however, i was most impressed by ashton kutcher's performance. i have never liked him, never watched any of his tv shows and always considered him an immature ... well, punk. in this film, he does a great job! he is well on his way to having leading-man status. i think the film we were shown must have been an advance rough cut or something, because about 2/3 of the way in, the film stock turned very grainy, the sound level dropped and microphones were seen dropping down all over the place. also at the viewing were representatives from the movie, looking for audience feedback - particularly on the parts of the film we didn't like.*****possible spoiler: the feedback i gave concerned a a couple of lines in the beginning. kevin costner comes home to see his wife, sela ward, packing her stuff up and moving out. he says, "maybe i should be the one to move out." and she replies, "no, you don't know where anything is in this house; i should be the one to go." this doesn't make sense: if she knows the layout so well, costner is right, he *should* be the one to leave.

i liked this movie, not because tom selleck was in it, but because it was a good story about baseball and it also had a semi-over dramatized view of some of the issues that a baseball player coming to the end of their time in major league sports must face. i also greatly enjoyed the cultural differences in american and japanese baseball and the small facts on how the games are played differently.overall, it is a good movie to watch on cable tv or rent on a cold winter's night and watch about the "dog day's" of summer and know that spring training is only a few months away. a good movie for a baseball fan as well as a good "date" movie  trust me on that one! *wink*

i agree with the guy above, it is so funny i understand it all, but my friends just don't get it. go to japan and you will see a different movie after being there. when i met my girlfriends dad, at his home in kanagawa. i swear i felt the same as jack,. scared, but by the end of the day it was all good, so i give this movie a 10 out 10.i have watched it at least 30 times, taking it with me to watch on the plane flying to japan next month. one thing that is real good is the ball game scenes. makes me feel like i am there again. this is a must see if you have any interest in japan and baseball. too bad they don't make a sequel. does anyone know where the temple scenes were filmed and the argument with hirko in the walkway with a roof on it???? need to know so i can win an argumrnt with me japanese ex-wife. thanks

you have to have lived in japan for awhile to enjoy the beauty of this movie! i lived on okinawa for over 2 years, and northern honshu for 4. believe it or not, what you see paints a very good and accurate picture of contrasting east/west mentalities, both from a sports as well as personal relationships perspective. a funny, funny, and heartwarming movie that deserves better than americans viewing it can ever judge. 8+ out of 10!

it's out of question that the real anna anderson was not princess anastasia. apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearance(anderson's eyes are perceivably larger, lips thicker, nose larger and turned up at the end....etc), anderson's unable to speak russian was a ridiculous tell......that's why i detest anna anderson and her confederates so much. not a lot of swindlers have the audacity and endurance to scam for 60+ years with such a blatantly untenable scheme.yet to some extent i have sympathy for anna anderson. life must have been hard for a young polish peasant worker in those days. and to impersonate another woman for 60+ years is an arduous task for anybody.she had to hold back her fleshy lips all the time to mimic the thin lips of anastasia's, and had to occasionally go lunatic to make people believe all her chaotic memory was just a result of mental problem.anna anderson was an awesome woman on a wrong track. had she put her good-looks, learned elegance, endurance, acting skills into proper use, she could of made a first-class actress.on a side note: some main characters of this two-parter seem to be loosely based on real figures. prince erich could be a mixture of gleb botkin(believed by many the most possible brain behind the whole scheme), duke george and dmitri of leuchtenberg, and several other figures. and darya romanoff seem to be based on the gorgeous princess xenia georgievna romanova. but unlike the real confederates, prince erich was motiveless in this show and supported anna out of love for and sincere belief in her, which is touching.on the whole this is a great show. fictionalised a bit but still remains faithful to the reality. the power of amy irving's acting lies in that she successfully represented anderson's self-assuredness, the mixture of impersonating others and being herself is intriguing. just as princess xenia said about anderson:"she was herself at all times and never gave the slightest impression of acting a part." highly recommended.

anastasia: the mystery of anna was a two-part star studded historical t.v. movie based on the peter kurth book, anastasia: the riddle of anna anderson. it keeps up historically pretty much, names are changed etc. but sticks to the real story quite well. omar sharif and claire bloom do quite well as the russian royals, czar nicholas and czarina alexandra. what stuck out in my mind was the all too short portrayals by rex harrison and olivia de havilland. all in all it was a pretty classy production with some fine acting. i was quite awestruck by the production values when it first aired on nbc in late 1986. also starring was the fine german actor jan niklas who had previously starred in nbc's other russian epic "peter the great". i felt that part 2 skipped over some important details of anna anderson's trip to america. it's important to know too, that in 1986 less was known about the anna anderson story. back then it was still not known whether her claim to be the grand duchess anastasia was genuine. by the late 1990's more was known and anna anderson is now reputed to have been a fraud. too bad the networks aren't making fine made-for-television movies like this anymore.

this movie is a very enjoyable homage to the bogart and other detective films of old. robert sacchi nails it as bogie and michelle phillips is a truly timeless beauty as gena anastas. however, the most noteworthy portion of this film involves the longest belly dancing scene ever produced in a hollywood film. one well-known professional instructor commented that nothing else in cinema comes close for dance excitement. the scene, which ends up being an important part of the plot, occurs in a lushly beautiful middle eastern nightclub and is by all accounts mesmerizing. the pulsating music, the swirling veils and ringing finger cymbals, free-flowing undulations and beautiful costumes - and a surprise twist involving the seductive sybil danning - build tension and excitement until the very end. the three talented and beautiful professional nightclub dancers are led by exotic brunette beauty kamala almanzar, one of the us' leading belly dancers since the mid-1970s. she was hand-picked by famed armenian musician guy chookoorian to travel with his orchestra on the road. guy's ensemble is the live band that the dancers perform to in the scene. if you watch the trailer on this site, you will see a glimpse of kamala (playing the finger cymbals behind sybil danning). if you're not yet a fan of belly dancing, you will be after watching this movie, and if you're an aficionado, it holds up very well after repeated viewing.

making this short and to the point. this movie was great! i loved it! i actually picked this up at a hollywood video for 3 bucks on vhs and watched it about 5 times in the last couple weeks. i'm a big bogart fan and i just latched onto this movie. i thought the song was funny and now have it as a ring tone on my phone. robert sacchi is great and pulls off a good bogart. his nose is a little big, his voice is a bogart-columbo mix, and he does a few things that are awkward but otherwise, he was fantastic and this film was wonderful. no one can be a perfect bogart but he was great. remember, sam marlow is a fan of bogart and isn't going to do everything he did. he mentions a lot of other movies and does some things that were never part of the real bogart's character's. but, it's so funny and hilarious and has a great cast, including some beautiful women. watch it and have fun!

sacchi is the best bogart impersonator ever... dry and droll as sam marlowe. the music from award winning composer george duning [from here to eternity, picnic, the world of suzie wong], the cinematography of perfect locations [including the famous ambassador hotel] are all right on target as famous tv director robert day [kojak, streets of san francisco, the avengers] guides the most endearing group of well-known character actors through a spoof of every dark detective film every made. see this if you loved all the old serious flicks and have a sense of humor... this one is a hoot.

this amusing, sometimes poignant look at the hollywood detective genre of the 1940's and 1950's stars robert sacci as an unnamed former cop who retires, uses his life savings to pay for plastic surgery to transform his image into that of his idol, humphrey bogart, then sets up shop as a private eye under the name "sam marlowe". robert sacchi, incidentally, is one of the rare few bogart impersonators who got the lisp exactly right; more to the point, the body and facial language are there. for awhile, "sam"'s only client is his landlady, who wants him to find her undersized boyfriend, and his only conversational foil is his secretary, simply called "dutchess" (misty rowe), who in his own words, "looked like marilyn monroe and made about as much sense as gracie allen", and has a passion for banana splits. then he encounters elsa (olivia hussey), the plain, sweet, virginal daughter of a retired props-master who has been murdered for no discernible reason. in the process of investigating the murder, sam shortly runs across: the gene tierney lookalike daughter (michelle phillips) of anastas, an avaricious, obscenely wealthy greek shipping tycoon (victor buono, turning in a creditable sidney greenstreet), his hapless, long-suffering second wife (yvonne decarlo, who manages to play a variety of put-upon emotions without saying a word), his two smarmy henchmen (herbert lom, channelling peter lorre, and jay robinson, doing a reasonably accurate lionel atwill), and anastas' vicious, amoral middle-eastern potentate (franco nero) who comes complete with a glamorus and bafflingly loyal mistress (sybil danning), all of whom would give anything to acquire the "eyes of alexander", two huge, perfectly matched star sapphires. when elsa is murdered, marlowe's interest in solving the case becomes personal, and he sets out through a labyrinth of los angeles landmarks, including the hollywood bowl, the scatological and esoteric attractions of hollywood boulevard, and santa catalina island in pursuit of the rocks, determined to get at them before either of the two wealthy competitors. throw in cameos by mike mazurki and assorted others, the traditional dumb-but-sympathetic ally on the police force, and a plethora of nicely drawn character turns that provide dimension to practically all players, and despite an unfortunate title song, you have, to my mind, a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience.

alejandro (alejandro polanco), called ale for short, works at an auto-body repair shop in what has come to be known as the iron triangle, a deteriorating twenty block stretch of auto junk yards and sleazy car repair dealers close to shea stadium in queens, new york. here customers do not question whether or not parts come from stolen cars or why they are able to receive such large discounts, they simply put down their cash and hope that everything is on the up and up. sleazy outskirts like these are not highlighted in the tour guides but iranian-american director ramin bahrani puts them on vivid display in chop shop, a powerful indie film that received much affection last year at cannes, berlin, and toronto. a follow up to his acclaimed "man push cart", bahrani spent one and a half years in the location that f. scott fitzgerald described as in the great gatsby as "the valley of the ashes".for all its depiction of bleakness, chop shop is not a work of social criticism but, like hector babenco's pixote, a poignant character study in which a young boy's survival is bought at the price of his innocence. shot on location at willets point in queens, bahrani makes you feel as if you are there, sweating in a hot and humid new york summer with all of its noise and chaos. the film's focus is on the charming, street-smart 12-year-old ale who lives on the edge without any adult support or supervision other than his boss (rob sowulski), the real-life proprietor of the iron triangle garage. polanco's performance is raw and slightly ragged yet he fully earned the standing ovation he received at the film's premiere at cannes along with a hug from great iranian director abbas kiarostami.cramped into a tiny room above the garage together with his 16-year-old sister isamar (isamar gonzales) who works dispensing food from a lunch wagon, ale is like one of the interchangeable spare parts he deals with. while he has dreams of owning his own food-service van, in the city that never sleeps, he knows that the only thing that may make the "top of the heap" is another dented fender. in this environment, ale and isi use any means necessary to keep their heads above water while their love for each other remains constant and they still laugh and act out the childhood that was never theirs. as barack obama says in his book "dreams from my father", the change may come later when their eyes stop laughing and they have shut off something inside. in the meantime, ale supplements his earnings by selling candy bars in the crowded new york subways with his friend carlos (carlos zapata) and pushing bootleg dvds on the street corners, while isi does tricks for the truck drivers to save enough money to buy the rusted $4500 van in which they hope to start their own business.though ale is a "good boy", he is not above stealing purses and hubcaps in the shea stadium parking lot, events that bahrani's camera observes without judgment. in chop shop, bahrani has provided a compelling antidote to the underdog success stories churned out by the hollywood dream factory, and has given us a film of stunning naturalism and respect for its characters, similar in many ways to the great italian neo-realist films and the recent iranian works of kiarostami, panahi, and others. while the outcome of the characters is far from certain, bahrani makes sure that we notice a giant billboard at shea stadium that reads, "make dreams happen", leaving us with the hint that, in rumi's phrase, "the drum of the realization of that promise is beating,"

this episode is not incoherent like another person said. the source agreed to help because he was not going to keep his word, if you pay attention... he says after she (phoebe) agrees to stay down there in hell, "get rid of her and balthazor so i don't have to worry about them in the future"... and also, he didn't let cole warn the sisters like phoebe asked in exchange of accepting the deal, that's why prue died, because she got hit harder than piper and on the head, and there was no phoebe to call for leo this time, and in the past leo said that she almost got herself killed. pay more attention next time! and there is not a "to be continued..." after this episode. it is the ending of season 3, and on season 4 they can't show anything from prue because she owns the rights of it "prue", so the producers would have to pay her for whatever they show. this is the last episode she is in!

piper, prue and phoebe bring dr. griffiths to the manor in order to try and save him from the source's personal assassin, shax. whilst phoebe looks in the book of shadows for a spell to vanquish shax, prue and piper are attacked by shax and chase him into the street. unbeknownst to prue and piper, they were filmed by a news reporter and her cameraman using their powers and broadcasted live on national television. with phoebe in the underworld, prue, piper, and leo must find a way to reverse the damage done. leo goes down to phoebe, and tells her that the charmed ones have been exposed as witches. on the surface, piper is shot by a manic witch-wannabe, and prue has to take her to the hospital. the problem here is that the crowds are blocking the driveway. so prue has to use her magic on the crowd, and they go to the hospital. piper is pronounced dead, and a swat team moves in. leo learns of piper's death, and goes down to tell phoebe. cole is asked to ask the source to reset time, and the source agrees; only if phoebe turns to the dark side. phoebe agrees, but the deal will shatter them. up on the surface, prue and piper are battling shax. prue shouts out for phoebe, who unbeknownst to them is in the underworld. shax throws piper and prue through a wall, and dr. griffiths out of a window. prue is not pronounced dead until the season 4 premiere episode, "charmed again, part one"."all hell breaks loose" is a gripping episode, and it made me sit on the edge of my seat. sad that prue's dead, but happy that there will be five more seasons of charmed. my vote; 10 out of 10. excellent

right the hospital scene with holly and shannon was done brilliantly it starts off with piper on a gurney looking very badly injured, the docs race her into a resuscitation room & they move her from the gurney onto a bed and prue holds her hand from that point on it is obvious that piper is having a lot of trouble breathing and her lungs are failing, as she turns to beg of prue to not leave her side she gaps "don't go i love you and then her pulse drops and she goes into cardiac arrest & the monitor shows a clear flat line & the nurses go into full out trauma mode & bring in a defibrillator prue steps back from the bed in horror as the doctors desperately try to shock her dying sisters heart but there is no response and she is tragically pronounced dead well great scene well done girls

i'm not going to ramble on about it but i'm just going to make it brief. basically for those who don't know how prue actually died........... the first time round the demonic assassin comes hit piper and prue with an energy ball they fly through the wall blood everywhere. phoebe the third sister comes down the stairs, says the spell which send him away but not vanquished.(needs the power of three)leo comes heals them both and so on. they get exposed along the line and the only way the can be saved is for a demon named tempus to turn back time. the only way he can do that is is phoebe stays in the underworld. she agrees, tempus turns back time. it now around 7:00 in the morning again. demon comes strucks piper and prue with energy ball. they fly through wall again. but this time phoebe isn't there to say the spell to fend demon off. demon kills doctor. doctor flies through window. he is dead. demon goes in a whirl wing type thing and glass on the doors shatter which is a great effect bye the way and there is and airy sound. thats where it ends. now.......... what the whole world doesn't know if they didn't pay attention to the next episode. although what i'm about to say wasn't shown its what happens trust me................ because this time there was no phoebe to call for leo this time he arrives later. piper survives because her injuries wern't as fatal as prue's and leo heals her first before prue so by that time prue is already dead. there mystery solved. ps calling for prue with a spell should have worked!!! and she should have made a surprise appearance in the last ever episode.ok i did ramble on

this episode of charmed changed everything! the show is about to end it's third season, and all hell is breaking loose in this episode. the charmed ones bring an innocent named dr. griffiths to the manor the protect him from shax, the sources assassin. when shax attacks, he blasts in as a tornado and then corporealizes into his demon skin. he blasts prue threw a wall which totally knocks her out and practically kills her. then blasts piper threw what is left of the wall. phoebe comes from the attic and says the vanquishing spell before shax came kill the doctor. but being the power of one, it just wounds him.leo comes to heal the other sisters and prue wants to find shax and destroy him for real. phoebe, meanwhile is in the underworld trying to find cole.when prue and piper go out into the street to find the demon, the demon finds them. after their battle, the witches realize that a camera caught everything! when they get back to manor trying to battle the media and after they vanquished shax, a a witch gone kookoo shoots piper. prue uses her telekinesis to move people out of the way so she can get to the hospital. but they get their to late and piper dies. and just when prue is about to get shot, time is rewound to where they bring dr. griffiths to the manor. shax blows in and blasts prue and piper. but phoebe is still in the underworld so shax kills the doctor and blasts out of the manor. when leo finally comes, he can't heal prue. prue is dead and so is the power of three. for now. personally. this episode was sad. prue was the strongset of all of them. i would love to have her power of telekinesis. i really don't think phoebe should of went to the underworld because if she didn't, shax wouldn't have killed prue. but paige brings the power of three together again and i'm happy with the show's progress

prue and piper bring dr. griffiths to their home to save him from the sauce's assassin shax. while phoebe looks in the book of shadow how to vanquish the demon, prue and piper fight and chase shax on the streets to destroy him. however, they are filmed and exposed live in the television news as witches. they become national sensation with a crowd in front of their house. phoebe trusts on cole and goes to the underworld with leo to ask him to summon tempus and revert time while a fanatic woman shots piper, who dies. the source proposes phoebe to stay with him and in return he would save her sister. phoebe accepts the deal, and the time is reverted to the moment shax is attacking prue, piper and dr. griffits."all hell breaks loose" is a good but incoherent episode. with piper dead and the power of three destroyed, why should the source revert time to save her? but this dramatic show is certainly one of the best of the third season and let the viewers anxiously waiting for the next episode. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "voltando no tempo" ("back in time")

i watched this episode a lot of times because i didn't get how prue died. this is what happened. prue, piper, and phoebe try and save their innocent,a doctor, because shax wants to kill him. phoebe goes upstairs to look in the book of shadows while prue and piper are protecting their innocent. shax appears while phoebe is still upstairs, so shax throw an energy ball at the doctor but prue pushes him out of the way and prue get hit in the chest with it and smashes against the wall, same with piper. so phoebe comes downstairs and says the spell, since it was only phoebe who said it and not the power of three shax only got wounded. phoebes calls leo to heal piper and prue. so leo heals them. phoebe went into the underworld to find cole, meanwhile prue and piper are looking for shax in the streets. piper and prue see shax and piper uses her power to blow up shax, meanwhile a new reporter got it all on tape. so its all over the new about the three powerful halliwell sisters, meanwhile phoebe doesn't know anything because she is still in the underworld. there's repoters and people all over the halliwell house. then a maniac comes in the house and says "can i be part of your coven?" and prue says "no this is our house get out of here!" and prue uses her powers to throw her out. as the maniac come out of the house crying saying "there mean witches". the maniac gets so mad that she shoots piper right through the stomach. prue get in her car and trays to go to the hospital but people won't let her through ,so prue uses her powers to move people out of the way, making people wanna kill her more. they got to the hospital but piper didn't make it. meanwhile phoebe is in the underworld.phoebe finds out that they have been exposed, so phoebe asks cole to ask the source if he can reverse time.the source says he will only reverse time if phoebe promises to stay here in the underworld, so cole told phoebe what the source told him. phoebe says "what would make him think i would make a deal like that?" and then cole says, "so you can save one of your sisters lives." leo goes to the hospital to find out the piper really is dead so he tells phoebe that its true. then phoebe agrees to stay only if cole will go back to warn piper and prue about the exposer and death of piper. back at the hospital swat is about the shoot prue, but the second before they do time is rewound back when they were at the manor with the doctor but this time phoebe wasn't there to call leo to heal prue and piper, so the doctor get throw in the wall too. the doctor died and so did prue. but this is what i didn't get, if piper was throw against the wall too how come only prue died? why did they not show leo come and heal piper and leo trying to heal prue? if you know the answer please e-mail me at angelpuss924@yahoo.com ps. i miss prue but i like paige too and i'm glad the show continued

having seen only once and in the dawn hours, i can't seem to forget this haunting film. a mix of mystery, suspense, and heartbreaking romance it reminds me of vertigo.the actors, though not that well known are good especially joan hackett in one of her best performances.you believe in her, in her love,in her newfound quest for freedom brought by her love, and in the end in her overwhelming pain.the plot is ingenious and compelling and does not stretch credibility. the direction and technical stuff certainly could be better but they do not compromise the overall effect. and it has one message: don't let revenge blind you, you can became its last victim.a real pity it has not been remade, but perhaps it is a period piece better left alone.

this movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best made-for-tv movie mysteries i've ever seen. the acting is superb. i've seen it twice and still am puzzled at some parts. i'd love to have a copy so i can play certain parts over and over again. i am interested in buying a copy of this movie, but cannot find it anywhere.i am wondering if if anyone has any suggestions how to find it? i've tried e-bay, amazon.com, internet searches, and am completely frustrated. i've not seen it on turner classic movies, nor on american movie classics and i have even put out fliers in our community asking if anyone has a copy.

i was a 20 year old college student living with the folks when i first saw this, and i've never forgotten it. i'm a huge joan hackett fan, and this film was perfect for her remarkable talent. i'm so glad to see that so many other people have such a fond memory of seeing this. naturally, it's not available on any media! it would be perfect to show on lifetime, but because of its age, they won't. you never see anything there before the mid-eighties. i can still remember what made me watch it when it was first run: rex reed reviewed it in the new york daily news, and he said that it was like a throwback to the great hollywood films of the forties, and had it been made then, the hackett and grimes parts would have been played by stanwyck and crawford. think about that! p.s. so sad that joan hackett left us so tragically young.

i remember seeing this movie 34 years ago and it was full of suspense and twists. it grabs you at the beginning and keeps you guessing throughout the whole movie. i have thought about this movie for the past several years and have checked in video stores to see if it's available, but was never able to find it or anyone who had even heard of it. i think this type of movie is timeless, and i know it would be enjoyed by a whole new generation of movie watchers. i hope this gets on video soon as it would be fun to see if it has the same impact on me as it did back in the early 70's.it's very rare that a tv movie can make that much of an impression, but this was did and still does after so many years.

i have never forgot this movie. all these years and it has remained in my life. i have looked for this movie on so many sites and stores. if anyone ever reads this and has a copy i will pay you for a copy of it or please let me know where i could find one. this is a movie that should be a classic romance known as well as my other favorite, somewhere in time. it was truly brilliant. if the right actors would remake this film and give it the patience it needs, to be the right acting, it could be a block buster.a love story as powerful as this should be around for all lovers to see. i remember how sad i was at the ending and it really came as a shock. i believe with all my heart that johnny really loved the woman and she him. this was one terrific movie and it is a shame that it is not available for us to purchase. please contact me at shawe49@aol.com - i want to give my thanks to a wonderful lady that responded to my message almost a year later. she had a copy of the movie and was so kind to send it to me. she is a great fan of this movie as i am. with her help, there have been 3 happy ladies to receive these dvds'. she is waiting for the book that it is based on. i am checking with my local library for it, titled 'mrs maitlands affair, by margarett lynn. i am sure it is great also. many thanks to julie for her graciousness and friendship. i am your friend always,/ sharon

roy thinnes and joan hackett are superb in this 1970 melodrama. the lush settings, the haunting music, and plot twists make it a truly interesting film. i had seen it when it first came out on tv. once more it aired when i had a vcr, but i did not have a chance to tape it. would love it on vhs if someone has a copy. apart from the suspense (which is worked in beautifully) i feel the story is unique, and is pretty much true to the book, mrs. maitland's affair by margaret lynn. i would say that it was one of the greatly overlooked best films of the 1970's out of movies made for tv. i have given the film a number #10 rating, because it is done with so much originality. there is a true pathos and air of romance which has the viewer sympathizing with the culprit.

i first saw this movie at least thirty years ago, and it remains one of my all-time faves! it's a classic - the intriguing plot, great characters, suspense and shocking twist ending (all set against the backdrop of the gorgeous monterey/big sur coast) never get old. roy thinnes portrays johnny brant, a captivating character that grows more mysterious as his true identity unfolds. the acting is great and believable; viewers get caught up in the web that develops between the workaholic husband, disenchanted wife and the alluring stranger (thinnes as brant). i have searched for a copy to buy for years - i guess tv movies don't get released to video, unfortunately. great movie, see it if you can find it.

this movie has a twist that caught me off-guard. it made me go over the scenes in my mind to see if there were any clues along the way. loved the gorgeous roy thinnes and joan hackett's skillful acting. the beautiful, haunting music stays with me as well as the intriguing story.

some tv programs continue into embarrassment (my beloved 'x-files' comes to mind.) i've been a fan of dennis farina since 'crime story,' another late, lamented show. 'buddy faro' never had a chance. the series had a good premise and great actors. it's really, really a shame.

i agree with all aforementioned comments. this show was a delight to watch. funny, witty, terrific acting and zany sets. it's always a thrill to find a show that is smartly written, assumes the audience has brains and displays subtle humor. i would spend good, hard-earned cash money to see it again on dvd. and as long as we're requesting smart series that never got a chance...how about dvd releases of maximum bob (another well written, odd duck show with a delightful cast of characters.) and add to the list...middle ages or frank's place. there has to a way to release these shows out of the vaults and into the hands of devoted fans and new audiences.

for some reason, some shows just fail...some deservedly, some not... buddy faro was a clever show with interesting characters and dark humor that was enjoyable to watch...maybe it was never intended to be a big hit, but it had a "quirkiness" about it that made it enjoyable... that being said it appears i may have been the only one watching....dennis farina and frank whaley were casted perfectly in their respective roles...production quality and writing were great and vegas was the perfect backdrop... hopefully the first and only season will be released on dvd as i believe it deserves some notoriety... maybe at least make it on tv land.... cheers

chris penn is hilarious as the all-time stoner brother of jeff spicoli. this movie is great because it was a lot more real and funnier than fast times at ridgemont high. casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all eddie van halen which went on to become songs on ou812 and unlawful carnal knowledge. this movie is one of the great stoner film heroes with cheech and chong. fast times was more depressing than funny. abortions, friends cheating on friends, jerking off in bathrooms, bad jobs, and failing school. someone must hate the eighties to like ridgemont more than the wild life. the film even had great cameos like the maker of city limits michelle schocked in the liquor store or ben stein in his first role in the sunny's surplus store.

this movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is 80's entertainment. oh don't get me wrong, most of the music back then sucked. i only ever liked the metal bands from the 80s. bands that had some balls. forget that whiny keyboard crap and all that 'life is horrible and i want to die' garbage. but the movies from the 80's are the best. they were all about nonsense and just having a good time. this movie exemplifies that! party! get naked! get laid! woooooohooooo!

at the time of this writing (january 25, 2006), i am saddened to hear of the passing within the past few hours of chris penn. other than footloose, the wild life is the film that i remember chris most from.i still remember in the film, with slight fondness, of chris' wrestling character and teammates sitting in their favourite restaurant with a huge plate of french fries in front of them, drowned in an entire bottle of ketchup.anyhow, my comment is in regards to the title track sung by bananarama. after these many years, i still remember the rumour (canadian spelling -- lol) that bananarama was called in at the very very last moment to compose the track for the film and that they wrote the song on the plane bound to the recording studio to record the song and just after they recorded the song they went to shoot the low cost video for their title track. i heard that this entire process (from start to finish) took 4 hours to do! if this is true, then they truly are worthy of being the most successful female band of all time.anyhow this is just a rumour i had heard back in the day and still remember a generation later. perhaps anyone who reads this can comment and clarify. thanks.

this movie was really funny. the people that were expecting to see an oscar worthy comedy, should get over themselves. this was a fun movie to see with interesting and funny characters, plot lines, dialog quotes and catch phrases. i rate a movie a 10 if i have bought the dvd, or in this case, the videotape, and have watched it many times, and in this case, still laugh out loud. i have about 12 movies in my collection with a rating of 10 and about half don't have anything do do with the oscars. again, this was just a fun, light-hearted movie. i hope this comes out on dvd. i highly suggest checking this movie out, if you are in the mood for a wacky comedy.

_the wild life_ has an obvious resemblance to _fast times at ridgemont high_, and _the wild life_ comes up short.------------ some other stan wrote the above comment. of course the wild life is no ridgemont. ridgemont is the quintessential 80s flica. however, the wild life is enjoyable if you're not whiny about mindless movies being mindless movies (especially when you know it's supposed to be a mindless movie in the first place). the little latino from scarface is in this movie and he's straight disrespectful ("i got visa...masterrrrr charrrrge!!") the colonel also makes an appearance ("lawsuit..."). rip the colonel 1931-1997.this movie is no worse than a 6 in comparison to other genres, btw. it is no worse than a 7 in terms of other 80s teen comedies at that. it does very much have the feel of a cameron crowe movie. only staniels gave it a 5.

fast times it ain't. but check this movie out, it has a heart. pour yourself a drink and enjoy. it's loaded with a slew of just-beginning stars. sherilyn fenn has her first on-screen credited cameo. chris penn, lea thompson, eric stotz, jenny wright, rick moranis, etc.--they all look so young. oh and if you look closely the cop's wife is nancy wilson from the rock band heart.

see no evil with kane. the movie has a great storyline but it just wasn't a hide my eye's, scream out loud horror flick i thought it was going to be from watching the wwe superstars on monday night raw when the movie first came to theaters. i did enjoy the movie though i loved the story it played out.great movie excellent would like to see a part 2 it doesn't matter if kane gets killed at the endor not they have killed off other horror stars in every movie they have out and they still comeback for more so a part 2 wouldbe very interesting.

kane is a killer named jacob goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. most of them die except for 3 of them. in my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. i still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. the best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the blonde girl's mouth. kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change. that was his only look the entire movie. great action and killing scenes, i don't think i could give it a full 10 out of 10, but 6 seems good.

there's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing god's work. yeah right! this killer makes jason voorhes look like a chump, and freddy krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. he is jacob goodnight(wwe's glen "kane" jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a axe, and a hook and chain. those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. that is totally methodical! when the encounter happened 4 years earlier, jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head. how on earth did goodnight survive after 4 years? now he's in the condemned hotel called blackwell. and this hotel got a lot of stories to tell. i thought this movie was haunting as well as interesting. i liked the part where goodnight checked out one of the girl's tattoo on her back. and goodnight himself is really deranged thanks to his maniacal mother. if you think friday the 13th was something, you better think again. this movie will leave you on the edge of you seat. and i think the eyeball rip was bone-chilling. this movie proves it point,and it wasn't a waste of my time. i enjoyed it. the title don't lie! rating 2.5 out of 5 stars!

finally a true horror movie. this is the first time in years that i had to cover my eyes. i am a horror buff and i recommend this movie but it is quite gory. i am not a big wrestling fan but kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. i have to admit that i didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad i did. during and after the movie i was looking over my shoulder. i have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough. i think that is why this movie is getting some good reviews. it is a refreshing change and takes you back to the texas chainsaw ( first one), michael myers, and jason. and no cgi crap.

this horror movie is definitely one of the best ones i have seen in my life and there are many reasons why. the storyline is really good it has lots of action and great horror sequences in it the actors are not very good but there are not that bad but kane is definitely the best actor in this but he was always a good actor also the cast is very good such as kane as jacob goodnight, christina vidal as christine, michael j. pagan as tye, samantha noble as kira etc. also i just have to warn you that the killing scenes are very disturbing but they are very creative but that just makes it better and you can't have a horror movie without blood and gore also they look very realistic. so i am sure that you will not be disappointed with see no evil because it is a really good movie. so make sure that you rent or buy see no evil because it is just so great.overall score: ********** out of ********** ***** out of *****

see no evil is the first film from wwe films. yes wwe, word wrestling entertainment, pro wrestling. of course being that it's a wwe film a wrestler has to star in it, the wrestler being glenn jacobs aka kane. which is not really important as if you didn't know kane or what wwe stood for you would never know it had anything to do with the wild word of wrestling, as the movie has nothing to do with wrestling. see no evil is gross out horror film, it has some moments were the some people may jump but for the most part it's just saying, hey look how gross we can get! not that there is anything wrong with that. jacob goodnight (played by kane) is sort of a jason type character, his mother tortured him as a kid with strict (understatement) christian beliefs and has warped his mind. now he's a big scary chopping killing machine. 90% of the movie takes place in an abandon hotel where jacob stalks six teenagers (surprised?) and a handful of adults. i could explain why they are in a creepy old hotel but eh, who cares? despite it's lack of originality see no evil is well made, for what it's supposed to be. kane plays an awesome killer and needs little make up to be scary. one flaw in the movie is the most annoying possibility people survive, i really looking forward to having them being horribly killed, but alas, does not happen. i wish the film didn't have the stigma of wrestling attached to it, although like i said the film has nothing to with wrestling, people are still closed minded enough not to want to see it because, given of course if they are a wrestling hater. then again the movie may also make money because wrestling fans will want to see it. either way, see no evil has top notch effects and little cgi, and like i said, it's quite brutal so like i say it's good stuff....if you like that sort of thing.

well, i'm a few days late but what the hell....! anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to "see no evil" was....surprise. the film is actually pretty good. there is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. it hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. think "madman" meets leatherface with a dash of norman bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick. while sne is thin on plot (most horror films are), it kind of makes up for it in the violence/methods of killing, the gore, suspense & the fact that kane does a great job of playing the highly disturbed jacob goodnight. the title of the film comes from the fact that jacob plucks out the eyes of his victims using just his fingers & stores them in big jars. why?? you'll just have to watch it & see (pun intended). there are certain cinematic elements lifted from other horror films most notably psycho, tcm, & madman but they're not blatant. finally, sne really doesn't go into territory we long timers haven't seen before & granted, sne is no "pyscho" or "tcm 74" but it certainly merits a look imo. bloodstone's recommendation: take in a matinée showing of "see no evil" bloodstone's rating: 7.5/10

a dangerous psychopathic killer jacob goodnight is holed up in the abandoned and rotting blackwell hotel,alone with his nightmares until eight teenage delinquents show up for community service duty along with the cop who wounded jacob four years ago.when one of their own is kidnapped by the killer and her fate uncertain,the remaining petty criminals must fight for their lives..."see no evil" was directed by the porno filmmaker gregory dark and it stars wwe superstar kane as remorseless psychopath.the supporting cast is terrible and there are no surprises to be found here,but there is enough extreme violence and gore for slasher fans to enjoy.overall,i liked this film and you should too,if you are into mindless slasher flicks.sure,it's cliché,but who cares.7 out of 10.

so the wwe has done it. they have poured over into film;their first one being see no evil, starring their very own kane. i caught this movie and went in not expecting it to be a great film...it just seemed to cliché and looked like nothing new. to my surprise it actually wasn't half bad. a viewer stated above that it is good b-horror movie fun, and honestly thats the best way to describe it. now the question i was asking myself was how was kane going to hold up...well let's just say he made an absolute bad ass out of the 'jacob goodnight' character. he sold the role really well, and really did look menacing. but what can you expect from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs around 320 in solid muscle. the acting was decent, and the story was nothing new of course, but we all know that. the directing as well as the cinematography was done very well and the hotel backdrop really looked dilapidated and well done. considering this was directed by a porn movie director, i was quite surprised. i'd recommend this movie if you're looking for mindless gore and killing and just some overall fun. think of this movie as a modern day latter friday the 13th film. and save room for the ending too, cuz it's a good one. and stick around after the credits too...

i was expecting this movie to suck, but what i got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. the teens are decent, with penny mcnamee definitely the best of the bunch. rachael taylor looks like a young christie brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. i saw the "twist" coming from miles away, but i still enjoyed the movie.but what really stood out to me was the direction. gregory dark might actually have a career in legit film ahead of him. aside from overusing the horror film "speed cam"(you know, where like the guy's face shakes all fast?), there's some good shots here. the camera angles and environments really emphasize kane's size, making him look even bigger than he actually is.if you're looking for deep story or characters, this ain't it. but that's not what slasher films are about. if you're looking for some good violence, or if you're into gory films, go check this out!

this, ladies and gentlemen, is truly a modern b-movie. the dialog is stilted and delivered with wooden rigidity, the premise is predictable (there are a few decent twists) and characters remain 2d for most of it. and yet there is a certain...charm. wwe wrestler kane brings to life the sick, twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos (though it is somewhat like his character that he's been playing around ten years) and so i'll find it quite amusing when people say it's "not much of a reach for him," but glen jacobs is, apparently, quite the nice guy, so actually it is. in any event, he's cast perfectly as the hulking brute and the deaths are suitably over the top (jason would be proud), but i heard at least four applause breaks for four different kills scenes. frankly go into this movie thinking that you'll have some fun and a gorefest, oh it is quite the gorefest. the r-rating is richly deserved and i actually got a little nauseous during some of the more graphic times. in any event, a very, very fun, but fairly bad, movie.

the problem with other actors cast in the rôle of dorian gray is that they either looked too old for the part (hurd hatfield, helmut berger, josh duhamel, david gallagher, ben barnes) or that they were unable to pull off the english aristocratic manner without being stilted. dorian is the perpetual 19-year-old (or so), all milky skin and honey'd locks, as described by wilde, so the challenge is finding an actor that has the maturity and range for the part (i.e., who can portray the naivité, callousness, and manipulativeness), but at the same time looks like someone in his late teens. and peter firth pulls it all off in this excellent british tv adaptation.gielgud as henry wotton, while considerably older than what wilde had in mind, does wonders with his scenes--wilde's aphorisms have never sounded so natural and unforced. especially george sanders in the 1945 version was pretty feeble by comparison (and his costume didn't fit).finally, jeremy bratt plays basil as the most masculine and at the same time the most gay of the trio, again a fitting interpretation. in general, the film includes enough gay subtext without turning dorian himself gay--he's all things to all people and supposedly there's no drug or sexual perversion he hasn't tried in the 18 years covered by the story, but that makes him more narcist than homosexual. he seems to equally wreak havoc on both sexes here, as he should according to the novel.of course the budget of this production was not very large, so everything feels a little stagey. particularly dorian's encounter with sybil's brother suffers from the obvious studio look. also, the final shot of dorian (a puppet i suppose) in his white toad-like make-up is more hilarious than convincing and basil's death scene is inadvertently funny. (also, as far as i recall, basil should have been killed seated at the table.)but all in all, this is a very worthy adaptation. i'm sure wilde would have liked it. the only thing missing is the sensual side. not so much sex scenes, but wilde's decadent world of fragrant flowers, luxurious cloths, and precious gems isn't really explored here, i.e. the aestheticism is completely missing. but like "i, claudius", the excellent acting makes one easily forget these shortcomings of production values.

playwright john osborne's (look back in anger, the entertainer) dramatisation of oscar wilde's only novel positively revels in the homosexual subtext of the original, perhaps too much so. nonetheless, the dialogue, the acting, with a cast headed by sir john gielgud & jeremy brett, and the brilliantly cerebral production (marred only by a "too quick" ending) make this worth the while of any lover of theater, with a capital "t".

i will always think of mr. firth as dorian gray, if i live to be 100.perfectly acted and directed, bringing oscar wilde's insight, wit and humor alive with an absolute and utter perfection unusual in television.more proof that the bbc more than makes up in talent what it doesn't always have in money.a must have for all wilde fans-and indeed for everyone else. inspired and perfected, every one of the actors looked exactly right for the role and every shot was well done.by the end i found that i loved every single character in a way that no other movie of the type had ever inspired. watch it, then try to watch another version. it's just not the same, is it?

i enjoyed this film and after it finished it still makes you think about it. i believe jeremy brett is brilliant in this role although his "death" acting was a little over the top, but as its jeremy brett i didn't mind.this is a good piece of drama and does follow oscar wildes novel very closely. if you enjoy this film then i recommend you also watch "an ideal husband" with jeremy brett as lord goring.this film gives a great insight into oscar wildes way of thinking.and while watching it the viewer is reminded of how in a way dorian grey is lord alfred 'bosie' douglas and basil halward is oscar wilde.

in dramatising wilde's novel, john osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown dorian's essential wickedness. if you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. wilde and robert louis stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. this story really treats of a theme similar to stevenson's "dr. jekyll and mr. hyde", but note that wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas rls took the scientific route. both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil, with evil winning in the end.the actors in this bbc movie, take a different route, too, from those in the 1945 film. john gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical quips as george sanders, in his role really projecting wilde himself, but with a subtle difference. you'll suspect that sanders really believed what he was saying, but gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes. peter firth, too, shows the two sides of his character in restrained fashion, but then we don't get to see as many of his escapades as hurd hatfield had a chance to display.it's a very good production, with the dramatisation reflecting the essentials of the novel, if not all of its ramifications.

onstage john osborne's adaptation of "picture of dorian gray" is a fine tribute to oscar wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.on screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between basil and henry showing that time has passed.)the acting however is brilliant. sir john gielgud return's to his wilde roots as lord henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella. jeremy brett is also strong,offering a touching portrait of the anguished artist basil hallward.peter firth,while not originally my vision of dorian, handles the role with style and grace...and later with a convincing strain of cruelty. the supporting cast is equally fine, gielgud's former 'importance of being earnest" co-star gwen francon-davies plays his philanthropic aunt agatha with dignity and judi bowker makes a touching sybil vane. the wit,pathos and tension of wilde's work have been remarkably transferred to the screen. my only other qualm is with the hair styles. many of them seemed out of place,looking more like 1970's versions of victorian hairdos rather than the actual style. overall however,the acting and writing elevates this production to a high level of small screen excellence.

this is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career. lee, lifeson, and peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. that being said, i think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and/or through the miking process. this is not the fault of the boys however. they even mentioned that the show was setup last-minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. they just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption. neil's snare sounds distant and geddy's bass has good harmonic content, but no bottom end at all!! they should have held out on this concert and waited for a better occasion. only buy this dvd if you are a hardcore rushian. the quality is lacking in the audio department.

admittedly alex has become a little podgey, but they are still (for me) the greatest rock trio, ever. i wholeheartedly recommend this dvd to any fan.i was very disappointed that they canceled their planned recent munich gig (logistics) and regret not making an effort to see them elsewhere. the dvd is a small consolation - the greatest incentive to acquire a proper dvd playback setup.naive perhaps, but i still don't understand the significance of the tumble-driers on-stage; i would be grateful for any clarification.cheers, iain.

after searching for 6 months, i finally found this dvd. all i can say is it was damn well worth the wait! "rush in rio" may very well be the greatest rock dvd in existence. i'm not joking. it's incredible! all the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. i find it makes you feel like you're actually in rio watching the concert from the audience. that's one of the reasons i love this dvd. it makes you feel like you're actually there. also, geddy, alex and neil have never been in better form! geddy's vocals are flawless, alex's guitar playing is still incredible, and neil - absolutely no words to say. the camera work on this concert was very good i must say. they gave us a good look at everything that was going on on-stage, and in the audience. kudos to the cameramen! anyways, enough of my raving! go watch "rush in rio" for yourself. you will be amazed. i guarantee it.10/10

these guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. the musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where rush exists. future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. get this dvd and you will enjoy it throughly!! i was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in houston, tx and was blown away. i have not missed a show since power windows and i have to say that they are better than ever. everyone should embrace these guys and teach others what real musicianship is! there will never be such a tight and well put together trio again in our lifetime. lets just hope and pray that they do not retire anytime soon!

rush in rio is simply an amazing dvd. this concert is one of the peak moments of the history of rush and they deliver their music brilliantly and with more power than ever.i was lucky enough to actually be in this concert, and not only that, i was in the very first row grabbing the gate that separated the audience from the stage!! it's the first and only time i've seen a rush concert live and it was a dream come true for me. i have no words to accurately describe this experience but i can tell you it is one of the highlights of my life.some people complain about the sound of this dvd saying it is not very clear and polished, but the sound you listen is real, true to how it was in the concert. it is raw and powerful and so authentic that every time i watch it i go back and re-live that beautiful moment. many artists record live shows and then they make a lot of tweaking, so the final product is far from what the actual concert really was. sure you can achieve a very sophisticated and polished sound this way but you don't get the real thing. this is not the case with rush in rio, this is the real deal!! i admit that i enjoy those fancy sounding concert dvd's, i love music and the sound is a very important aspect, but it's refreshing to listen to a concert that is so honest. you listen to rush just the way they sound in a live performance, no tricks, no tweaks. this is a real live concert dvd.i highly recommend rush in rio, the set-list is fantastic and the performances by geddy, alex and neil are mind-blowing. not to mention the crowd, you can see how much they love rush and sing along to every tune, even yyz which is an instrumental!! i actually appear singing twice; in tom sawyer i sing "always hopeful yet discontent" and in earthshine i sing "only reflect". it's just a few seconds but i simply couldn't believe my eyes when i saw myself in a rush dvd!! awesome!! i hope you enjoy this magnificent concert from the greatest band on earth.

i purchased this dvd recently and i was totally awed that rush's songs sound the same as they did when i first listened to them in 1980. the lineup of geddy lee, alex lifeson and neil peart is so talented that i want to listed to them play again and again.songs i remember like tom sawyer, xyz, the big money, the trees, freewill, closer to the heart, 2112, limelight, and the spirit of radio were played and the 40000 plus fans there singing along and having a great time and i swear over half the audience was under 25!writers who put down rush as far as rush fans like myself are concerned are a bunch of jealous dunderheads who like to taste rancid sour cream mixed with lemonade in a taco.rush doesn't put on makeup, wear spikes, lip sync,wear lipstick, get in trouble with the law, and have a band member brag about how long they have been unmarried. all they do is entertain!i give this dvd a 100 out of 100.

having seen rush live, i'm able to appreciate the awesomeness of this. others may complain of sound problems, but it's sometimes over dubbed by the overwhelming screams of 60,000 brazilians and it goes to show the band's territorial gain of attention

"rush in rio" is, no doubt, one of the most exciting dvds i have purchased. although i am a biased rush fan of almost 20 years, i found this performance to be flawless. the music is heavy and sharp (which sounds great on any surround sound system), the band is energetic, the crowd has a constant smile... it's like they were able to capture every concert i've been to. for any rush fan, this dvd is a must; if anything, just to see the "boys in brazil" documentary (which reveals the travels of this rather isolated, personal band). for any non-rush fan, this dvd is an enjoyable concert. rush fans know the talent of these three canadians. we have rather firmly stood by them for years. i've shown this dvd (or portions of it, anyway) to those who have never heard of rush, or those who think rush is less than good because they do not appeal to the pessimistic masses of rock (i.e., sex, drugs, and a drunken frenzy). the bottom line is this dvd is worth every penny and more than worth the time to view it.

i have been a "huge" rush fan ever since "moving pictures" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why rush is so popular. they completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. a real example of this is during "yyz" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. they really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful "lust" that rarely happens anymore. you get the best seat in the house for one of their best concerts given. the second dvd is a fascinating documentary of the band while they are in brazil and shows you a lot of the backstage things going on and it allows you to see them not just a musicians but as actual people in their everyday life. this dvd gift set is a must for any rush fan young and old and is definitely a keeper for your dvd collection. their is even a cd of the concert for those who just want to listen to the music. this dvd is worth it!

a long overdue concert release, rush-in-rio dvd is both compelling and disappointing. this slick two-disc set shows rush at their finest. after 30 years of honing their unique sound, it's great to have this record of one of the most talented rock bands ever.the concert features over two dozen songs, a documentary, and three songs that feature multi-angle viewing. packaged in a bi-fold holder with sleeve and a small insert, it's priced very well for the amount of material it contains.i'm a rush fan of the late seventies to early eighties period, and this dvd comes through big, with half of the show highlighting songs from that era. i won't list the songs, in case you want to be surprised. if you attended the vapor trails tour, then you'll know what they'll be playing.playing in rio to their biggest crowd ever, rush is a huge crowd pleaser here. in fact, that was one of the first things i noticed that was peculiar about this show. throughout most of this two hour concert, you hear and see the crowd, actively chanting and dancing wildly to the music. at first, it's heartening to see the fans give rush a well deserved response. but after several songs, i was ready to hear and see more of the band and less of the crowd. this is in no way a slam of the crowd of rio. more power to them! it's a critique of the final editing of the dvd.which brings me to my second and main reason "i hate it". the video editing is terrible in my opinion. save for the multi-angle view bonus cuts, the entire show is a frenzy of visual chaos. it's like the director wanted to see how spastic he could make it. i count changing camera angles, on average, between every one and four seconds, constantly! after about three or four songs, my head and eyes were ready for a break. which is too bad, because i would have liked to have sat through the whole show, like i was able to at the concert last year. maybe this fast-cut editing is the latest craze for concert dvd's, but i really think it's an annoyance and detraction from the overall experience. as stated before, i wouldn't mind it for a song or two, but the whole visual aspect of this disc is hurried, or rushed. it's really ironic, because all the previous concert clips i've seen of rush, mainly from moving pictures, are strictly straight-filmed, with little switching back and forth. it's almost boring, visually speaking. this dvd has taken it to the other extreme. i know a lot of dyed-in-the-wool rush fans will vehemently disagree with my statements, but that's just my impression of it.the bottom line: if you're a rush fan, you'll buy this dvd regardless of my review, or any other. i still would have bought it after i had read my review. just don't get expect a "normal" concert. who knows, the things mentioned above might not bother you.

this much anticipated dvd memento of rush's visit to south america in 2002 is possibly the finest rock video ever set down on disc.the picture and sound production values are amazing,even more so as they constantly battled the elements to bring this production off. all the tracks you would expect from the rush catalogue are here from tom sawyer to the pass gloriously reproduced for the frankly,orgiastic brazilian crowd.they actually singalong to yyz-which is an instrumental, and gives you an indication of their fervour!the first disc is the concert and the second disc contains 3 multi angle set-pieces -la villa strangiato,yyz and the awesome drum solo, plus a 30 minute documentary about the bands visit to brazil. all in all this is a triumph and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy.

this dvd will be treated with indifference by mllions of classic rock music devotees across the world because rush just aren't cool. it is a shame that rush have had to overcome sneering disdain from the majority of north american and british music journalists over their thirty odd year history as this has deprived many people the chance to get into a real band.each of the last four decades are well represented here and what a catalogue of songs it is! we have the seminal "2112", the magical "the trees" and the lyrical "tom sawyer" interspersed with the high-energy, genre-challenging pieces from their latest album "vapor trails." the musicianship is almost flawless, the stage show is spectacular and the brazilian fans are just plain crazy (at one point they sing along to an instrumental!)each band member plays at a level that defies belief-real craftsmen performing art.if you doubt this try out the instrumentals "la villa strangiato" or "the rhythm method" for size-and yes the latter is a drum solo (which has to be seen to be believed.)sound and vision production values are very high as befits the rush experience and you also get a documentary and multi-angled set pieces to boot.this is an astonishing performance and tribute to the canadian rockers and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy.

even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. alright, more than a little... my first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.don't watch this movie expecting another darko. darko fans are never going to like another richard kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. donnie darko is a thing of the past, get over it.richard kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. to be honest i had to watch the box twice before i liked it. the deeper meaning- (to spare you a bunch of sociological psycho babble) humans are self serving, we make decisions that can destroy our lives and don't open mail without a return address.summary: creepy old man tells cammeron diaz if you push the button i will kill someone you don't know and give you a million bucks. of course she pushes it and as promised by the creepy old gets a case of money. then the movie takes a dive into the unusual. to spare my fingers the typing... for pushing the button, diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien beings, in an elaborate experiment to gage the morality of the human race.i liked: the willingness of the movie to ignore the generic movie guidelines. its different. its intense. it has a deeper meaning (although its philosophy 101 material). it leaves you guessing. not a hollywood ending!i disliked: why would any being with the technology to inhibit another life form devise such a ridiculous scheme? what god like alien has the patience for that? diaz was good, but was there a need for the country accent? they live in virginia. i give it a 7 because kelly didn't put as much attention to detail as with his other movies. overall good flick.

the trailer goes nowhere near and only scratches the surface of the film and rightly so too, not because it has that obligation to keep its real narrative under wraps, but because what actually transpires, will provoke entirely different lines of questioning, some of which are frustratingly not answered in the film, leaving you to your own devices to interpret the series of events. which of course means plenty of material for an after-show discussion.metaphorically, the box refers to how us humans tend to subconsciously hole ourselves into situations or things in everyday life, and how our enclosed thoughts tend to see things from a certain perspective, seldom out of the box. there's a speech made near the end by one of the characters that will leave you pondering over this fact, which governs the basis of the entire film, and even threading on existentialism, where our bodies are mere vessels for the soul, and from cradle to the grave we put ourselves in more boxes in a way of life fashion.what i disliked about the film, is how it tried to sound intelligent through the frequent name dropping of covert government agencies like the cia and nsa, as though there's something overtly clandestine about these agencies that we should be aware of. they serve little purpose other than to put every action and every person under scrutiny, that nobody can be trusted, wrecking havoc in a sense to both the characters and the audience as we try to keep up with trust issues to aid in the interpretation of the narrative. having it set in 1976, against a nasa backdrop of manned space missions, and in langley, virginia, also provided that heightened sense of wary that will sap your energies as you sit through it patiently.based upon the short story button, button written by richard matheson and made into an episode of the twilight zone, the story follows the lewis family, where husband arthur (james marsden) works at nasa and develops a prosthetic foot for his teacher wife norma (cameron diaz), and you'd think it's all happy family with their son walter (sam oz stone), until one day a mysterious man called arlington steward (frank langella in a two-face inspired facial effect) whom we are preempted of in the opening, comes knocking and giving them a deal or no deal button in a box. plunge the button and they'll get a million bucks (we're talking in dollar terms of the 70s here) although a stranger out there will die. if they don't, well the deal's got an expiry date.the story would dictate a deal be made, which of course sparks off a mysterious sequence of events that unfold, with even more shady characters (who nosebleed) appearing, some whom are inexplicably zombie like, apparently all under the influence, or employment, or arlington steward. whether or not steward is death, a clandestine government employee, a messenger from god or a representative of aliens after an anal probe, remains unanswered, so whichever way you look at it, it's as if he's delivering something expected, just begging that mankind will shake off its innate greed so that his work can be cut short and to return to wherever he came from.if you need a little distraction from the disparate scenes which make up the narrative, the production sets and art direction are gorgeous in recreating the 70s look, as you try to figure out the mystery of the consequences that stem from a result of not fully understanding the fine print. it's full circle this examination of human nature, of our greed for immediate gratification, manifesting its result in longer term pain, confusion and further choices that we'll make based on real sacrifices. nifty special effects come into play as well, though it just leaves more room open as to the genre of the film.so is it horror, science fiction, or a mystery thriller? it's everything rolled into one actually, together with a sprinkling of the philosophical. just don't go expecting a straight narrative film with clean and easy answers at the end  this is like an x-files episode on steroids.

the box is one of the strangest movies i have ever seen. to explain my experience, let me use this word picture: imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but twilight zone reruns. the resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your iv. the dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.summary: a man shows up at the door of a couple. he gives them a box with a button on it. press the button, they will get a million dollars in cash and a person they don't know will die. i'll try not to spoil anything, but from there things devolve into a plot so intertwined and complex and purely original that it will make you question your sanity. but hey, most of us have been sane for a while now, and change is good.pros: amazing storyline, overall good acting, not a slow moment once it gets going. it asks questions of human morality that are rarely, if ever asked in popular culture. this movie is deep, it has meaning. its not summer blockbuster special effects fluff (not that there's anything wrong with that); this movie had a relatively low budget and it showed in some places. but i think it is perhaps that very thing that makes me like it so much.cons: the first twenty minutes, before it gets going, are really quite slow. at the end of the movie, you will be so confused that you just have to sit down and think for a good half hour. i can guarantee that this movie will not get rave reviews from your peers or most critics; it is far too strange and there aren't explosions every three seconds. in fact there are no explosions of any kind in this movie (besides your brain popping from trying to understand exactly what the heck just happened). personally i don't think this is a bad thing, but many will.rating: easily a 9/10. i have never had an experience like watching this movie. the only reason i can't give it a 10/10 is that it is just too wrapped up in itself. there are several large things left unexplained at the end that are still bugging me as i sit here writing this. but overall, this is the best experience i have had in a movie theater in quite a long time. but be warned, you will not like this movie if you can't sit back, turn on your suspension of disbelief to about 150%, and prepare your brain to do some impressive acrobatics.visit www.thestuffblag.com for more reviews

i've seen a few of mr. boorman's movies and didn't like much of them. not that they are bad movies, quite the contrary are good movies, but not content i personally found entertaining. however i think where the heart is, although made to cater to the less than art savvy american audience, is masterful as satire, and as social commentary of the times it was made in. i've had to replace this movie in my collection at least a half a dozen times, since every time i loan it out to someone i know could appreciate it's artistry on all its levels, my copy fails to come back home to me, lol. the last time took 7 years to replace it since it was out of print for vhs sales, has never been made as a dvd that i know of, and had to wait till one of the premium cable channels ran it before i could tape it again.my favorite aspect after the nail-on-the-head social commentary is the paintings by timna woollard. i've searched for 15 years to find anyone or anywhere that could lead me to where her work is available for sale. or better yet a copy of the paintings in the movie without the ending credits rolling over them. i have a room in my house that i dedicated to putting copies of her paintings in, and no one seems to know if it ever was released as a coffee table book, or video aquarium, or as a documentary of her work. if anyone does know of where i can acquire any sort of copy of timna's work or where her studio is in england, please do not hesitate to contact me via email.

this movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts. the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful. the story is also both funny and poignant at times.people who like european films and "art movies" will like this movie. this is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it. go rent it.

this movie has a lot to recommend it. the paintings, the music, and david hewlett's naked butt are all gorgeous! the plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching -- and it's not predictable, which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age. but, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just odd. it often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but i never figured out what it was trying to be parody *of*. and if it's not a parody, well, it remains a movie with great potential that it didn't live up to.

in dublin, the crippled rebel rory o'shea (james mcavoy) moves to the carrigmore residential home for the disabled, affecting the lives of the residents. roy is able to understand the unintelligible speech of michael connolly (steven robertson), who was left in the shelter by his prominent father many years ago due to his cerebral palsy, and they become close friends. rory convinces michael to move from carrigmore to an apartment in dublin, and they hire the gorgeous siobhan (romola garai) to assist them. living together with rory, michael faces a new world, finding friendship, love and freedom and learning to survive by his own. "inside i'm dancing" is a wonderful tale of friendship and freedom in a very beautiful story. the acting of steven robertson and james mcavoy are awesome and i do not understand how they have not been nominated to the oscar with such magnificent performances. romola garai has also a top-notch performance and is extremely beautiful and sexy. the screenplay is touching, never corny and without redemption and the precise direction of damien o'donnell is very sensitive. unfortunately the brazilian title of the dvd is shamefully ridiculous, giving a wrong idea of this excellent movie. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "os melhores dias de nossas vidas" ("the best years of our lives")

when i was 10 (currently 14), i vowed to never see a movie that i knew would not have a happy ending. and until a few weeks ago i had done pretty well, except for shakespere for english class...etc...i was still only watching things that ended happy. but then i saw ramola garai in havanah nights, which was cute, not good but entertaining enough to watch. after seeing this a few times over the two or so years since i first saw it, i grew to like it, especially the music. so i did a search on her and found imdb...i saw "inside i'm dancing" and assumed she had done another dancing movie, and over looked it. it was later on an image search(of rory, looking for gilmore girls poster for locker) i picked up an image from this movie...i then searched for a trailer, i found the trailer and when i saw the hospital and heard rory say "you've got the future" i remembered my vow and realized this would not be a good movie for me. but it just stayed in the back of my mind until we were at the video store and there it was for $5 used, so i went ahead and bought it. after seeing it i just wanted it out of my head because it was so sad. i still wouldn't go near it until i had cerebral palsy as a vocab word. then i just had to see it again and this time all i did was laugh, even at the saddest parts i no longer felt depressed because i realized that over all this movie was happy and uplifting...i love it and it is now one of my favorites, i;m sure this is the worst comment you have ever read. but watch the movie it's worth it.

this film was amazing, it was extremely funny and moving. damien o'donnell and jeffrey caine have put together a great movie which will appeal to all ages. james mcavoy and steven robertson made this film brilliant. their acting was excellent, there was this real lifelike feeling between them, that made you really believe they were the characters they were acting out. romola garai is amazingly gorgeous and brilliant in her role. the story of these two physically challenged people and their carer is well put over, and you really start to grow to know and feel for the characters as the movie goes on, it was especially upsetting at the end. i would recommend this movie to anyone that loves a truly heart felt movie, warning to the more sensitive viewer make sure you have tissues you will need them.again amazing film!!

gerald (richard carlson) and kitty (veronica hurst) have just finished celebrating their engagement announcement in france with family and friends, when he receives a letter asking him to visit an ancestral castle located in scotland. gerald's uncle reportedly has fallen ill and has requested gerald, the sole heir, be present. gerald goes off to scotland, leaving his future bride behind. a few weeks pass and he doesn't come back. concerned, kitty sends out telegrams but doesn't hear back from her fiancé. four more weeks pass and kitty finally receives a weird response from gerald, calling off the engagement and telling her to move on with her life. not ready to give up on her relationship and looking for answers, kitty hops on a plane and decides to pay gerald a visit. accompanying her on the trip is her level-headed aunt edith (katherine emery, best known for her starring role in the classic chiller isle of the dead). when kitty and edith arrive at the macteam estate they immediately suspect something strange is afoot. for starters gerald seems to have aged twenty-years in a matter of weeks. secondly, this once nice and charming guy has turned into a complete jerk who repeatedly demands they leave the castle and never come back. when edith comes down with a mild cold, kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there to try to get to the bottom of things.why is gerald being so cold and cruel to the woman he was just about to marry? why is gerald so opposed to having company? why do the house rules state that guests must be locked inside their bedrooms at night? why are guests forbidden to enter certain areas of the estate, such as gerald's bedroom and a large hedge maze out back? and what's making those strange dragging noises every night? these are just some of the questions the maze poses. the movie actually does a fine job building up mystery and intrigue. you genuinely become interested in what's going on and patiently await the resolution to explain the weird events that are taking place. and then it happens... i definitely don't want to ruin the finale of this film because you're better off not knowing, but it takes one of the most unbelievable and jaw-droppingly strange turns i've seen in any movie. it's wonderfully ludicrous in a way, but it also takes a pretty solid little b/w mystery and sends it straight into z-grade schlock territory. and yet, this ending seems so out of place, you're not likely to forget it once you see it.despite the ending (or maybe even partially because of the ending), i really enjoyed this odd bird. it's extremely talky and slow moving for the duration of the run time, but it managed to keep my interest throughout. director william cameron menzies (who made the much more famous invaders from mars the same year) is best known as a two-time oscar-winning art director and his set designs here are also really interesting. there's almost a silent movie feel at times, with model work for some of the exteriors, some painted backdrops and sparsely decorated interiors with very high ceilings. as with any good castle set there are also secret passageways and long staircases. this one also throws in a few rubber-bats-on-strings for good measure.a few of the actors are a little stiff and awkward, but i liked most of the cast. hurst is one of those obscure and mostly unknown actresses who unfortunately never seemed to catch on despite being both beautiful and talented. emery, who also gets to play narrator in framing shots at the beginning and end of the film, is decent enough as the overly mannered and cautious aunt. my favorite however was michael pate as the silver-haired sinister servant who does this hilariously upright zombie walk every time he ascends the stairs. also on board in smaller roles are hillary brooke (who played the title role in the sherlock holmes mystery the woman in green) and lilian bond (whale's the old dark house). of course carlson also starred in it came from outer space, creature from the black lagoon and some other horror flicks, so you've got yourself a pretty decent cast for genre fans right there. i say check it out!

i recently saw this film at a 3-d film festival in hollywood. it was in polarized 3-d (gray glasses not red & blue) it was so much fun to watch this film with an audience, the print was excellent and the 3-d perfect. the performances were over the top and that added to the fun, the surprise ending (that we aren't supposed to share with fellow movie go'ers, at least according to the movie trailer and poster) had people howling with laughter. by today's standards this is probably more comedy than horror but with the added dimension of 3-d (complete with cobwebs and bats coming out of the screen) this film was an entertaining romp into 50's horror.

is this a good movie? it's hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when "the old gentleman" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.yes, what lurks in the maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one. but the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact. not that it would ever result in what we see in the movie, of course.but working on what must have been a very low budget, one of the greatest production designers -- and the person for whom the term "production designer" was invented -- creates a very eerie mood that was strangely compelling. at times, of course, the movie is very silly, but it has its moments.

a woman and her aunt go to scotland to locate her evasive fiancé. this is a much-maligned film because of its denouement, but up to that point, it's interesting, well-acted, eerie, and with fine set design (by william cameron menzies, developed for 3-d projection). veronica hurst is captivating and genteel, sort of a chic british marilyn monroe, still in love with richard carlson, who is hiding a family secret in his forbidding castle; there are even bats in the belfry! it moves leisurely until the final extraordinary set-piece, when hurst and her aunt (katherine emery, also the narrator), sneak out of the castle in the night to venture into the maze and find what they're looking for in its center. as a kid, i always remembered this sequence - there's nothing scarier (or claustrophobic) than not finding your way out of a 10-foot high maze of hedges. naturally, the two women get separated, setting the stage for engrossing suspense with horrific music. the final result is mildly disappointing really, since carlson's epilogue at the end makes some sense to all the goings-on, even provoking sympathy. worth seeing.

i remember this film of old. it's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. and there are even stranger events taking place out back, in hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including "the shining." but the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. i certainly didn't see it coming. this is a fine example of how good and convincing a movie can be even when the premise is utterly loopy, bordering on laughable. i'd recommend it to anyone.

i liked it better than house party 2 & 3. the cast was hilarious and cool at the same time. chris stokes, who directed the film, has a very humorous cameo in it as a car repairman; look for his mom who plays the lead character, john john's grandmother. and you can hear her rap the title song "down to the last minute" at the end of the film as the credits roll. she's very funny and a really good actress, as well. the young actors who star in it (the main trio), and who in reality are part of the music group imx, did a superb job. before this film i had not paid much attention to this r & b group. now i'm a fan. the music number in the house party scene alone is worth checking out the movie. i was pleasantly surprised. i loved it.

the main reason i loved this movie is because imx (formerly immature) were in it. they were in house party 3 when they were 11, but they are all grown up now! i was a little shocked at some of the things they were doing in the movie (almost ready to tear my hair out), but i had to realize that they were not my little boys anymore. i think chris stokes did a pretty good job, considering that is was his first movie.

here in germany it was only shown on tv one time. today, as everything becomes mainstream, it's absolute impossible, to watch a film like this again on the screen. maybe it's the same in usa, or especially gb. the message is a brutal truth : find friends to make your ideas come a bit closer to reality, or you become a loser, if not an asshole instead.the whole film is not particularly as simple, as it may seem here. every little scene, every sentence, every behavior of the characters show a sharp look at what could happen, when one person is not accepted in a sadistic crowd, which calls itself normal.very well played by all this is a must seen. who is the main character? john (not cox, folks, remember ;-) ore niles (who still is bimbo) decide and you will get the plot as it is intended.a bitter look at what society becomes in a repressive system. kind of salingers catcher in the rye and goldings lord of the flies thought to the very end.the final maybe change your own mind. word

i saw this movie on late night tv out of buffalo about 30 years ago and i'm dying to see it again one more time before i... well.. you know. the interaction between the main characters after the tiger (eli wallach) "captures" his prey (anne jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. charles nelson reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. how many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end? this film reminds us that we are all in that same struggle regardless of class, race, sex or religion. and who can forget the scene of the suburban homeowner on his hands and knees attacking those few tiny weeds that have dared to appear overnight on his perfectly manicure lawn!

while i rather enjoyed this movie, i'll tell you right now that my mother wouldn't. it's out there. really warped little dark comedy that reads like a fairy tale gone awry. >neat treat with all the cameos too. if you want something "different", look no further.

(some spoilers included:)although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly here. to quote from encyclopedia britannica's, surreal means:"fantastic or incongruous imagery": one needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read james kincaid; but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, he'd surely protest, "no way!" what fantasies and incongruities the film offers mostly appear within the first fifteen minutes. thereafter we get more iterations of the same, in an ever-cruder and more squalid progression that, far from incongruous, soon proves predictable. not that it were, on the other hand, literally believable-- but it were unfair to tax motorama in particular with this flaw, any plausible suspension of disbelief having fallen precipitously on the typical film-maker's and viewer's scale of values ever since "raiders of the lost ark" became a blockbuster."hallucinatory": how do we know what a hallucination is if part of having one is not knowing that we are having one? at any rate, some people know that they enjoy "hallucinogenic drugs"-- but if motorama typifies the result of doing so, then i'm at a loss as to why anyone would take them more than once. there is, of course, the occasional bad trip. the movie must be one of those, pun and all."juxtaposition of words that was startling": how many times can a ten-year-old startle you by uttering "oh, my god!" when he likes something, or "damn!" when he doesn't? these two interjections are about par for the course with this script. sadly, any sense of the surreal in what passes for dialogue could only reveal, in direct proportion, one's naivete regarding the speech patterns of the rising american generation."a world completely defined and minutely depicted but that makes no rational sense:" motorama's world indeed makes no sense, but it is about as completely defined as a cartoon in an elementary school newspaper. the numerous guest stars in the cast all have cameo roles even less intelligent than our little hero who exclaims "damn!" in the blink of an eyelash but needs several seconds to concoct the lamest lie. and even *his* character, despite appearing in nearly every scene, gets no significant development. here's scant reward for any viewer who sympathizes, as i must, enough to wish to know him better and understand 'where he's coming from.' one vaguely senses a far better story and protagonist struggling to get out."fully recognizable, realistically painted images are removed from their normal contexts and reassembled within an ambiguous, paradoxical, or shocking framework." no, we see a succession of stereotypical and ever more dilapidated billboards, filling stations, greasy-spoon eateries, cheap hotels, and their lowlife habitues along country highways, exactly where they stereotypically belong."largely responsible for perpetuating... the traditional emphasis on content." there is little content, moment-to-moment, in motorama.to sum up: picture british millionaires dressed as clowns or pirates on the way to a posh costume party, sitting serene and mute as cautious chauffeurs inch their rolls-royces like fragile skiffs through a roiling sea of desperate humanity, chinese who implore them through the windows and smear the glass with blood. or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques, limousines like those above now rusting, and white pianos tinkled by ghosts. into this detritus wander an exhausted boy and an ailing woman to whom he clings as mother-figure becoming girl-friend, who fall asleep side by side on the grass. he is awakened-- on the feast of the transfiguration, "white and glistering" day 1945-- by a brilliant flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun. finding that his consort has become a corpse, he first believes that he has witnessed her soul going up to heaven. later he explains only a little less innocently, 'i learned a new word today: atom-bomb. it's like god taking a photograph.' now, *there* are just two samples of cinematic surrealism, surrealism whose ironies ripple out far enough to invade its film's very title: empire of the sun. if you seek surreal, *please* don't miss it. alas, however hard he treads on the accelerator to race his chariot through and beyond the desert, no scenes so exquisitely strange, rich, subtle, or gorgeous await motorama's poor little gus in his quest.none of the above necessarily constitutes a thumbs-down on this film. though somewhat disappointed, i can't dismiss it, in view of the respectability of another genre that it does exemplify-- one influenced, to be sure, by surrealism, but also by expressionism, existentialism, and franz kafka's pessimism amidst omnipotent power structures. let's try on for size: theater of the absurd.turning to e.b.'s article on this style, i am amazed by how, to the extent that theater of the absurd is a valid artistic style, the above objections to motorama vanish like a puff of smoke. i'm tempted to quote the entire text as support of the identification.theater of the absurd attempts to show "that the human situation is essentially absurd, devoid of purpose... humankind is left feeling hopeless, bewildered, and anxious.": having instantaneously achieved his purpose of getting away from a depressing home life among bickering parents, gus finds himself purposeless until he drives past a glittering billboard reading "motorama" and decides to win the lottery that it promises. as others have already revealed, this ambition proves illusory: although the game "never expires", the sponsoring corporation has no intention that anyone should ever win, and has ways to trick, confuse, and leave crestfallen any aspirant to the reward. he, like others, is ultimately disappointed in his dream."absurdist playwrights, therefore, did away with most of the logical structure of traditional theatre. there is little dramatic action as conventionally understood; however frantically the characters perform, their busyness serves to underscore the fact that nothing happens to change their existence... a timeless, circular quality emerges." "language in an absurdist play is full of... repetitions... repeating the obvious until it sounds like nonsense." underneath a sometimes "dazzling comic surface," we find "an underlying message of metaphysical distress." gus's obsession with a silly game, his inane language, the plot device wherein he divines a bleak future and/or returns to an earlier moment and takes a different but still bleak turn-- so much fits now. while an admirer of the surreal would do better with some films, anyway, of spielberg, admirers of motorama as it really is should find fellow-travelers-- not instead but addition-- in the works of beckett, ionesco, and genet.but one can't quite stop here. after his disillusionment with the game, gus returns to "phil" (i.e., love), the first attendant he had met and the one person who had treated him decently, although he had also scolded him-- at a service station advertising "be full-filled!". under phil's tutelage he learns a life of waiting for cars. we might note here that the absurdist playwright beckett had entitled his most famous play "waiting for godot," and that for godot we should read "god." god is one of phil's preoccupations, too. furthermore, as the indirect result of his previous encounter with gus, phil is badly maimed and goes about in a cast with his arms straight out horizontally. in the last scene, gus, now phil's protege, says that he wants to hear music. we hear none, but we see phil wiggling his fingers at the end of his outstretched arm, beckoning gus closer, and gus responds. the end.finally, on to an author whom i happen to be reading currently, the anglican theologian william stringfellow. if this rebel-lawyer is not acknowledged as an architect or undergirder of liberation theology, which is more a roman catholic than an anglican movement, perhaps he should be. police brutality and corporate greed are a cliche in cinema and literature, including motorama, but stringfellow supports and illuminates such sentiments with impressive warrants from scripture, tradition, and reason.his most significant work is an expose of the earthly activities of those fallen angels whom the bible refers to as principalities and powers. principalities, wrote stringfellow, are behind all of our popular three i's: images, institutions, and ideologies. all of these commend themselves to our worship by making false promises. the more deeply involved with an image, an institution, or an ideology any person becomes, the more his own personhood becomes "depleted" and be becomes a slave to them. promising power, control, and immortality, they inexorably deliver helplessness, chaos, and death. as essentially fallen, defeated powers, they can do no more than that. yet they beguile humans with that "dominion over the earth" promised by god in the book of genesis, while in fact no one of us controls an image, an institution, or an ideology bent inevitably on its own hegemony and self-preservation. they take on lives of their own. "dominion" happens to be a mistranslation: a more accurate rendering of the hebrew would be "stewardship." but this is a quibble beside a more fundamental problem: most of us neglect to notice that god had delegated this power to adam *before* the fall. we have no reason to assume that we, his descendents, still exercise it now: on the contrary, it should be obvious that demonic forces have stolen it from us.one might add two observations of c.s. lewis: first, that "man's conquest of nature" is a mere illusion, and a ruse to cover the fact that one is really talking about the conquest of some men by other men with nature as the instrument; and secondly, contrary to popular belief, satan is no kind of good-time charlie. he may dangle out pleasures at first, but he is very niggardly with them and will withdraw them from any human firmly in his thrall, perhaps leaving his prey sitting in front of the fire feeling miserably sorry for himself and seething with resentment.now, applying these insights to motorama, we seem them mirrored remarkably in gus's experience. he is, if not nice, at least a pretty little boy prior to falling victim to the motorama game. the first signs advertising it glisten glamorously. the longer he continues, however, and the deeper he journeys towards the sponsoring corporation's headquarters, the more shabby they become. he's lonely, meeting no one else who plays the game. the stations giving out the cards have either fallen into ruins or are staffed by zombies. the people he does meet along the way are more and more ugly, deceitful, and hostile. (the fact that the principalities answer to a common dictator does not mean that they can abide one another). gus's humanity is leached out of him as he becomes not only totally self-centered and oblivious to the needs of others but partially blinded... disfigured... prematurely aged while infantile in the literal sense of linguistically challenged. eventually even his precious mustang is taken from him in a crash, and he must continue in a dead man's wreck. yet at long last, having done everything he thought was expected, he presents himself to the principality in its proud tower to receive his prize. using the biblical power to confuse wielded by those who have built such monuments to their own vanity, its agents evade him, disappoint, insult, and finally throw him from the top floor. he falls long and hard, landing, finally in a body of water. in other words, in classic symbolism, he dies. he has met the inevitable bad end of anyone who has put his faith in such a deceiver.but this fate proves to be only a warning look into a mutable future. he repents and returns to phil, and upon seeing him performs the very first generous, selfless act we have seen from him for almost an hour and a half: noting that phil is now handicapped and hardly able to insert a hose into a gas tank, he asks, "can i help you with that?" then, seeing the "help wanted" sign, he decides to apply for the job, explaining to the motorist with whom he was hitch-hiking that he reckons he'll get out here, because it doesn't look like too bad a place to work.this interpretation is conjectural, of course, and it may surprise or even outrage the film's "cult classic" aficionados who see quite different points in it.if motorama isn't quite my cup of tea, i'm at least convinced now that it's hardly the worst film ever made.

this has got to be one of the most magnificent things i've ever seen on film. i don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters. this film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. the packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. look at the roadmap, for one thing! and where else in america can you see a ten year old kid swear as much as this one does and then get his eye ripped out by pervert the rival of pulp fiction's zed? and that food inspector scene is the best! the amount of well known to vaguely recognized actors in this film is one of the best things about it: soon, much sooner than you realize, you too will find yourself saying, "is that meat loaf? is that drew barrymore? is that the holideck doctor from star trek: voyager? is that flea? is that the sawmill owner from twin peaks gassing squirrels with car exhaust? and isn't this guy from the new rob zombie movie? he looks an awful lot like shrek." i think my favorite scene is at the very end, with phil in a full body cast. i mean, please, why aren't more movies like this shown in airplanes? this director hardly has anything else to his name higher than return to salem's lot, but he displays true stumbling man-child genius in this creation! if you're an intellectual looking for something to p**s away your evening on, i highly suggest this film for satisfaction. this movie's plot is all too ridiculous, but imagine it taken out of context: *boy arm wrestling an over aggressive meat loaf, who seems hell bent on taking out his anger at not being accepted into guns n roses, looks over his shoulder and sees the doctor from voyager enter the bar* can you imagine what any half brained channel surfer active through the last six years would think of seeing that? now imagine if you actually cared about meat loaf or voyager to begin with! or imagine if you're a flea fan. rocky horror picture show fans, this film contains notable music, mind you, but its soundtrack is more plasticine than mad max 3. what does that entail for you? this is the retarded, inverted mongoloid cousin-sister-mother-puppy of the rocky horror picture show. how about when gus' sleeve flies back onto his arm in an act of cable-access special effects quality mastercraft? when i saw this film, it was on the suggestion of my cousin who had watched half of it in a fit of half-aware childhood in the early half of the nineties and who has since been haunted by vague memories of it, i myself had not slept in three days. it made me laugh! of course, it's also an anxiety movie. the music doesn't encourage the suspense but it eventually gets to the point where it's been fully established that the american censorship committee has obviously missed this film entirely and absolutely anything can happen in it and probably will any time gus turns a corner or the view so much as changes camera angles. i found myself obsessing over the possibility of those cards flying out his window at any second. watch this movie. awesome!

although this film never attained commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. the story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. therefore, anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed; it is not intended to be "realistic." it is, however, intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail. in addition, the symbolic representations are left open for interpretation, which can be said of much great artwork. don't be fooled by the cover (if you happen to rent or buy this film)-- the movie is not what it might seem to be on the surface.

the first time i saw this movie, i just thought "what the hell?" a 10-year-old kid driving around bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called motorama! hell yeah! i enjoyed this movie a lot!jordan christopher-michael is a brilliant young actor! it's a shame he stopped act. he interprets very well his character gus on the movie.gus loses an eye, got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with flea, drew barrymore and meat loaf! want more? ok, don't even try to understand the story, but why this movie needs one!? just open your mind and let gus drive you into this journey."motorama gus, you won motorama"

motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as bagdad cafe or repo man (which more or less takes place in the desert). it also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric trail of characters) of writer joseph minion's comedy, 'after hours.' in a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, gus (played well by jordan christopher michael), a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents. it begins as a trip through salvation (which is apparent in the scenes with john diehl), but once he becomes hooked on a scratch-off game called motorama, he becomes easily tainted by temptation and looses his childish innocence. he travels from one crazy fictional state to another concocting ways of getting motorama cards from participating gas stations, just enough so that he might spell out the prize winning word m-o-t-o-r-a-m-a and be eligible for the $500 million cash prize.along the way, he is embattled with dozens of strange characters such as flea who plays a high strung busboy, meatloaf who plays a crazy biker, and mary woronov and sandy baron (a seinfeld regular) as two violent kidnappers. the dvd rerelease can be very deceptive, as have previous attempts to sell this film to the non-cult market first with taglines comparing it to home alone and thelma & louise. the newest calling it a love story with the tagline implying that the film is about jordan michael christopher on an adventure to meet the girl of his dreams...which, despite the size of her picture on the dvd cover, is actually only about a 1 second cameo by drew barrymore as the fantasy girl that gus dreams about. why didn't they just market it for what it was? thought it may seem totally bizarre on first viewing, it is actually a well-designed narrative. motorama is great material for fans of strange b-grade comedies. this was quite an interesting story, and particularly because of the strength of its lead actor--jordan michael christopher (who unfortunately has few other screen credits of note)--and the clever metaphor inherent in the plot. hopefully its re-release on dvd will make it an easier find for cult fans.

this movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. if you're anything like me, and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. one of the funniest parts is when gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like hansel and gretel then he and his wife go home with them. the soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: "inspection officer -- here!" and the lines to follow will stay in my mind forever probably. when i have shown this movie to my friends, they usually say "what was that?!?" so if you're in the mood for one of those types of movies, yippee! this movie is so oop it's not funny anymore, so probably the easiest way to get it would be online auctioning. the first time i saw it was from a rental.

i loved this movie, i saw it when i was about 8 years old and almost seven years later, this evening i got to see it again. i really thought it had an interesting idea, they only thing that upset me was the ending which i felt was a cop out. 'round here it's hard to find this movie and i was lucky enough to have seen it on bravo. i also expected to see more drew barrymore in here too!

this is an entertaining surreal road movie. it was written by joseph minion, who also wrote after hours, martin scorsese's excellent surreal film. the film follows the adventures of a ten-year-old kid named gus, who drives a red ford mustang across some fictional states with names like tristana (a tribute to luis buñuel's film, perhaps?), essex & south lyndon, in search of eight elusive motorama game cards from various chimera company gas stations. the film has a surreal feel to it because a lot of the things are unusual, like the money for instance, which is like blank paper with numbers on.most of the characters are nasty to gus on his trip. they tattoo him, punch him, but this doesn't stop the kid on his relentless quest. some oddball actors like david lynch incumbent jack nance, meat loaf & flea also make appearances. jack nance plays a motel owner, who when he first meets gus tells him, "if you see any squirrels, give them to me". this is a movie where a man and his wife abandon their young children because the man owes gus $100; and a mother encourages her son to raise his voice louder while speaking rudely. if you're a fan of twin peaks and surreal movies, you'll like this. an odd little gem of a movie.

this is a great, dark, offbeat little film, a modern day adaptation of the quest for the holy grail myth. it's a sleeper if there ever was one. i saw it on cable some years ago and taped it. i've loaned it to many of my friends and everyone loved it.

don't even try to figure out the logic of this story. but do ride along with 10-year-old gus on the most bizarre road trip ever witnessed. more weird characters and implausible situations than a twin peaks reunion! nothing makes sense, yet it's impossible to stop watching motorama! now, where can i find that 'r'????

little gus is a ten year old delinquent. he runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road-trip. reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him, so he creates a device to help him. his goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called motorama. he has to find all eight letters in order to spell m-o-t-o-r-a-m-a. dark laughter follows as it turns into the road-trip from hell. he runs into some deranged lynch like characters. most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that god will see it. later gus gets a tattoo and an eye-patch for his injured eye. he becomes one of the most rebellious bad-ass 10 year olds you may ever witness on screen. this is no kid's flick! look for cameos by jack nance, flea and drew berrymore. be warned although drew is on the front cover, she only appears in the film in a dream sequence for a couple seconds. also the film gets confusing towards the end reaching david lynch territory, you may want to watch it a couple times. "motorama" was written by joseph minion, most well known for his screenplays for "after hours" and "vampire's kiss" so enjoy this depraved surreal road-trip of fun!

let's start from this point: this is not a movie intended for the common audience. utterly bizarre, somehow incomprehensible, totally unpredictable, it just keep you stoned watching at the screen trying to figure out what will happen next. if that by itself doesn't make you agree it is an excellent movie, then go back to your "family" movies and forget about motorama. it has material to be considered a cult movie, it can be placed in the same category with movies that win awards in cannes or other intellectual film festivals, but, sadly, hollywood already let if fall in oblivion, simply because it is not commercial. the performance of young jordan christopher michael may not be oscar material, but he gives the right touch to the story. even the genre is difficult to describe; it is not a comedy in the proper sense, you don't know if you are supposed to laugh at the strange situations in which gus gets involved. it is more like an impossible adventure that some kids may wish to have, but don't let them watch it either... it is not a movie for kids. so, if you like disney movies or are looking for a "home alone" style, this one is definitively not for you. but if you enjoy reading edgar alan poe or the works of tim burton, then you will like motorama. so, jump in your red mustang, get a tattoo spelling "tora" and cruise strangeland with gus. i'd like that...

my favorite show of all time! yeah, i thought this was so cool, and larisa oleynik was the first crush i ever had (aaaawwwwww). it was well written, funny-except when it it wanted to be serious, and just a great show overall. but since we couldn't afford to keep nick, i couldn't see any episodes after feb. 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than i should. to me it's more the epidemy (now that doesn't look spelled right!) of having to say "goodbye" to someone that you love, and know you'll never see them again. and i still think that, because as far as i know, there are no plans to release this on dvd any time soon...yeah, life is mean! i've found that out for sure (though you can find an odd episode every here or there...but i never liked the bootleg copies of things much either).so enough of my sad life:(....most kids in 7th grade don't need powers like alex gets to get them through life (unrealistic--for sure) but then again, how many towns have a super-evil chemical plants that is willing to do anything for "progress at any cost"? gee this show was fun to watch! though i'd agree the diaglouge is a bit over developed (and even a little politically correct sometimes). my favorite parts were when the kids would have some reason to break into the plant (a video tape or something like that) like a kid's version of "tom clancy's rainbow six" (which years later i got hooked on that game series for probably the same reason) almost! then you've got the plant's "security" team who are trying desperately to find the "kid from the accident"...very mean dudes (at least when i first watched the show...they seem more sympathetic to me now). i feel rather sad for larisa oleynik, not sure if she minds this role type-casting her.....but it's what i'll always remember her by.oh and btw, the actor that plays aaron peirce from "24" is on here too as a school coach or something....too cool! maybe he can get the producers of that show to get larisa in next season of "24". i only bring it up 'cuz jack bauer is my other tv hero and i'd just love to see cross-over things, lol:). both are set in california, so i'll just keep on dream'n...i can see it now, "let me alone with that suspect for a few minutes....no, i don't need a car battery!"

i used to watch this show when i was growing up. when i think about it, i remember it pretty well. if you ask me, it was a pretty good show. anytime i think about it, i don't remember the opening sequence and theme song very well. in addition to that, everyone was ideally cast. also, the writing was very strong. the performances were top-grade, too. i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though i'm not sure if i've seen every episode. now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.

as with so many modern us films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let that go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell.we are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. beau bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub beau's nose. d'onofrio finds his rather surface bubba lifestyle cramped by having to look after his 'blessed' baby brother, joey, and is itching to escape the shackles of this dead hick town. their boss's business is closing down (much against his will) because of a lack of new customers and he is haunted by memories of his father as he builds up the tension towards his own attempt at self-destruction.joey, who had seemed to personify the curse on their lives, is lost at sea - believed drowned - in a freak accident. his miraculous restoration to them by the portuguese trawlermen whose boat they had just built and launched (perhaps symbolic of an angelic crew), is the sign they've been waiting for and they all decide to give life one last throw of the dice.there is a beautiful brooding mood throughout this work which excelled in holding our attention as brilliantly as 'the shipping news'. there are other parallels with the later work, too, which lead one to suspect a touch of a remake. i like 'signs of life' for its simpler, less contrived story and star performances from actors working at their craft rather than to be noticed as stars.

i saw this movie on pbs the first time. then i bought the video and watched it countless times. every time i watch it, i can get something else out of it. it's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good, but now the world is changing. but you don't have to be older to hold onto the past, even the young characters, like charlotte don't want things to change. the overall tone and mood is excellent. the cast is outstanding with all-stars like kathy bates, beau bridges and arthur kennedy. and its fun to see the upcoming stars before they hit more recognizable feature films, like kevin j. o'connor (the mummy) and vincent d'onofrio (men in black and law & order: criminal intent-one of my favorite shows). its just one of those movies that stays with you.

it's not real flashy, but this movie does a great job of developing a large cast of characters, and letting you know their hopes and desires, while still managing to be both funny and bittersweet. a very sweet movie. fun, also, to see vincent d'onofrio and mary-louise parker so early in their careers.

i first saw "signs of life" on pbs as an american playhouse presentation. it's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with terrific performances by michael lewis as joey and vincent d'onofrio as his brother, daryl. arthur kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. the rest of the cast which includes beau bridges, kathy bates and mary-louise parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.the direction is subtle and effective. i've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it. a beautiful piece of filmmaking.

it's showtime! showtime is simply a bump in eddie murphy and robert deniro's careers. it's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards, especially not robert's. showtime is directed by tom dey and features some small roles from guys like william shatner and mos def.showtime is about two very different cops, mitch preston (deniro) and trey sellars (murphy). one takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat. they are both after the same felons behind a huge caper of televisions, vcrs, etc. they then cross paths and a tv station wants a new reality tv show so they fight crime while they are on tv. mitch hates the publicity while trey loves it with his line, "it's showtime!" their tv antics and methods are shown on tv and they are the new "cops" show. the fun begins.overall, showtime is a fun action comedy. a good film but not quite up to the actors' expectations and standards. however, it's rolls along as it treads and parodies reality tv shows. a good break from shows like cops. truly at the end, just a guilty pleasure.my rating: 7/10eliason a.

this is actually great fun. i really enjoyed it, even though it wasn't that original at all, robert de niro and eddie murphy were great together!. all the characters are cool, and the story is pretty good, plus robert de niro and eddie murphy are simply amazing in this!. rene russo is excellent in her role, and there are plenty of laughs to be had throughout (especially when deniro spoofs clint eastwood and danny glover's lines), plus the finale is just great. yes it's just another run of the mil "buddy buddy" cop film, but it works due to the fantastic chemistry between de niro and murphy!, plus it had some great car chase scenes as well!. it's nothing that great really, however i found it to be great fun, and a perfect way to pass the time!,however the main villain was very weak and wasn't very good at all. this is far from being the best "buddy "buddy" cop film, however it's still a very entertaining one, and i thought it was pretty well made and written as well!, plus the ending was quite funny!. this is actually great fun, i really enjoyed it, even though it wasn't that original at all, robrt de niro and eddie murphy were great together, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is very good!. tom dey does a very good job here with great camera work, cool angles and keeping the film at a fast pace. the acting is a lot of fun!. robert deniro is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is hilarious, very likable, had fantastic chemistry with eddie murhpy did his usual awesome stuff, pulled some really funny faces, seemed to be enjoying himself,had some funny lines, and had a really cool character! (de niro rules!!!!!!!). eddie murphy is also amazing here, he is hilarious, like de niro did his usual funny stuff, obviously loved being in front of the camera, and while he can do this stuff in his sleep he was still a lot of fun to watch! (murphy rules!!!!). rene russo is fantastic here!, she had a cool character, and while she didn't have much to do, she added a lot of screen presence, and made her character interesting always, she was just great! (russo rules!!!!). william shatner is funny here surprisingly and didn't overdo it, and brought some good laughs into the film. the main villain is ok, but kind of weak and rather bland, still he did what he had to do adequately. rest of the cast do fine. overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5

robert deniro and eddie murphy, what a team. while rene russo, william shanter, and that guy from the everyday video are alongside for the ride. this is a funny and a great movie. not only is it that, but it's a good buddy flick.tom dey (shanghai noon) directs this hell of a movie. from start to finish, it was a masterpiece. no slapstick humor here. but good old time laughs. making fun of all other cop flicks (to name a few lethal weapon, beverly hills cop, fifteen minutes, and etc...)if you want to see a movie, see this one. you'll love it. it has a wonderful cast and crew. so, get off your a** from watching "cops" and watch "showtime" for a cop film. and remember, they'll be protrolling your neighbor at um...um...oh! at friday nights at 8:00 (man, everyone says i'm a bad writer).

showtime is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. the plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. but i laughed. a lot. credit goes to the inspired pairing of de niro and murphy. they have great chemistry. murphy delivers the one-liners, de niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. this movie will get a rush hour-like reception from the critics. don't listen to them. if you're a fan of de niro or murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.

dad (78) and i (46) both had a good time watching the flick today. for a guy primarily known for serious roles, de niro is a heckuva comic actor. of course, it helps to have his past film images to play against. consider that one of those roles, 15 minutes, was a cop having to deal with the interference of the mass media, and you have an interesting set of compare/contrast performances.murphy plays another of his axel foley sort of characters. shatner plays a burlesque of himself, a parallel world self who was best known for tj hooker and not star trek.it's interesting to watch how the film comments on the contrasts between the reality of police work and its fictional counterparts in tv and film. shatner lectures on the proper means of sliding across a car hood; de niro points out holsters scratch the hood finish. ironically, as the film progresses, de niro's character begins to incorporate the illusions of tv-cop reality into the real world case he's working.the film draws its inspiration from a gamut of sources, so one could make the comment it is derivative. well, so what? satire needs to derive its humor in order to exist. and besides, the film does have quirky moments of originality. for example, i'm reasonably sure the method of the villain's death has never been done before. one quibble about the reality of the weapons involved-- shouldn't those guns have had some kind of recoil? in order to penetrate steel, those bullets had to have enough inertia to penetrate. and any bullet's highest level of inertia is at the moment of firing. so.... firing a volley of these tank-killer bullets should have driven the shooters back onto their butts. oh, what the heck... it's a satire. maybe the guns' lack of recoil is itself a satire on the b-f-guns used so casually in thrillers. 

as many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot isn't exactly stellar, the movie doesn't move anyone, and certainly this won't warrant any award (outside of blockbusters' perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.eddie murphy and robert de niro team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that i really enjoyed. russo and shatner played their small parts well as well. man, i hope in the future my wife ages as well as miss renee has.moving along, this "buddy" cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time. the movie is enjoyable enough to avoid the wait for video/dvd release and instead to go ahead and check it out.eddie murphy is at his usual top-form and is downright enjoyable to watch. de niro has molded into this type of role perfectly.i really enjoyed this movie and think that any true movie fan in need for a good movie or just a good laugh will really enjoy showtime.top performance: murphy. hilarious. enough said. directing job: nice. nice action scenes, used murphy and de niro together like a charm, russo fed off in a nice supporting job.my rating: 7 out 10. it's not going to move you or anything...but it's an extremely enjoyable movie.it's showtime...was a great success.

"showtime" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what i expected months ago when i first heard about eddie murphy and robert di niro teaming up for a comedy. overall, it was pretty good! as "real life" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but duh--- this is a comedy. also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a schwartzenegger movie, i found it a bit tiresome and overdone. 9/11 sensibilities aside, for myself, all that pyro-techno hyper-effect stuff had been getting really old these past few years. it seemed a lame substitute for characterization, story, and engaging emotions. i hope the lesser quantity of it in "showtime" is an indicator of a trend in hollywood. a trend downwards, of less use of the silly, less use of the exploding building.di niro and murphy are two of my favorites. their screen presence and charisma-- and even their character depth-- have been "a joy to behold" for many years. that can't be dismissed here--- they are engaging actors, and entertaining and appealing in this movie. i can't put my finger on it, but perhaps the explosions, the excessive fx, and all of that diminished the final product??? perhaps, or perhaps it was something else, or a combination of factors that gives one the sense that the movie didn't achieve its highest potential. whatever it was, "showtime" was entertaining-- i probably will buy the dvd when it comes out-- but i had the vibe that it nonetheless wasn't all it could have been. at least not all i had hoped for.very good movie, but not a great movie. i gave it an 8 out of 10.

i'm not going to go into too much depth, but showtime was a pretty funny movie. there wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that i can remember), but it had it's moments. the cast is pretty good, robert de niro is good as usual and eddie murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. rene russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. there were two characters in the story that i liked that they didn't explain much at all. the first one was trey sellars' (eddie murphy's) buddy at the gym played by ken campbell. i supposed he was just a friend of trey's, but i wanted to know more about him. the other character that i liked was mitch preston's (robert de niro's) fellow cop/partner played by nestor serrano. i guess he was just another cop working with mitch preston, but i wanted to know if he was his partner or what not. i think maybe i'm putting too much thought into a movie, i mean after all, it's a comedy...who cares about the characters? i guess i do though. i was really pleased to see this was directed by tom dey, who also directed shanghai noon. ever since i saw that movie i was looking forward to his next work. i think he did a pretty good job with this film, and i again look forward to his next work.all in all, it was a good movie, but i wouldn't recommend paying full price for a ticket unless you're a die-hard robert de niro/eddie murphy/rene russo fan. it was worth seeing in the theater, but not for full price, i'd recommend seeing it at matinee price. also, here's some movie trivia for ya. the guy who played the camera man, played by judah friedlander is the guy in the music video "everyday" by dave matthews band. he was also the clerk in "meet the parents", also starring robert de niro. ...and on top of that he also played derek zoolander's brother in "zoolander" (both zoolander and meet the parents star ben stiller). just some useless trivia for ya.i hope you enjoy the film. thanks for reading,-chris

"showtime" is a funny film starring funnymen robert deniro (meet the parents,a bronx tale) and eddie murphy (shrek, dr. dolittle). the story is this: in the beginning of the movie detective mitch (robert deniro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. when the cops arrive, tray(eddie murphy)a cop, tries to arrest mitch not knowing he's a cop. during this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer chase ritz. she is so excited about their adventures together, she decides to make a tv show called "showtime" starring tray (the cop) and mitch (the detective). but that's just the funny part. the rest is strictly suspense and action. there is a foreign man who is selling and making extremely dangerous guns. while playing lapd on the show and doing it in real life, deniro and murphy have quite an adventure in this story. on a scale of 1-10, i give it a seven or 8.

at one time `buddy cop' movies ruled the box office. it seemed that every summer flocks of beverly hills cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. not any more. lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. the drought has eased a bit recently with the release of showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.mitch preston is a dedicated cop. he's not a dirty harry type by any means. he's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his dutieslike, say, a t.v. cameraman. mitch deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and so falls into the clutches of chase renzi, a producer looking for a killer hook for her `reality t.v.' cop show. she thinks that mitch will give her the `edgy' boost it needs to be a hit but feels he may be too unlikable to carry the whole show by himself. enter trey sellars, a patrolman-cum-actor who's watched way too many police story re-runs. of course mitch and trey mix like oil and water and much merry mayhem ensues.we know that mitch and trey are bound to become best buddies by the end of the movie. that's the way buddy-cop movies are suppose to work. in fact, it has to be said that showtime rarely deviates from the time-honored clichés as writ by lethal weapon and tango & cash. there's a high tech mcguffin to get the ball rolling (in this case an automatic rifle that fires rounds big enough to stop tanks.) there's a slick foreign baddy with an accent of undetermined origin. there are chases, shootouts and explosions. we all know this going in and we have a pretty fair idea how it's all going to turn out. you know what? there's nothing wrong with that. yes, we know the well-worn bases are going to be touched but the fun here is the trip, not the destination. showtime doesn't strain to be original. instead its energies are funneled into its characters and humorous situations. as a result, showtime does a competent job with the action sequences but really shines in its comedy.robert de niro is dryly funny as mitch. in the past i've thought de niro to be a cold and unexpressive actor given horribly to mugging when called upon to do comedy. lately, though, he's grown on me. he seems to be injecting more humanity into his roles. eddie murphy is hilarious as trey. the best way to describe his performance is that trey is what murphy would be if murphy weren't so talented and hadn't hit the big time. rene russo has a droll time playing motor-mouthed show biz shark chase renzi. she stalks through the movie chasing high nielson ratings with awe-inspiring determination. in her zeal she re-vamps mitch's life to make it more camera friendly. she even calls upon t. j. hooker himself, william shatner, to show mitch how be a more `authentic' cop. shatner is funny, playing himself precisely as we expect him to be, loud, oblivious and slightly obnoxious.i have to admit i was really looking forward to showtime and i wasn't disappointed. ten years ago this movie would have been a guaranteed hit. today it's doing moderate business at best. that's a pity because showtime is a whole lot of fun.

contains spoiler the movie is a good action/comedy but i don't know if the director cut too many parts but it seems that the bad guy die too fast. the end of the movie come, the bad guy dies and that's it.the special effects are good and i don't regret paying to see it at the theatre.

despite of all the negative criticism i really enjoyed this movie. i am not saying this lightly. i love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home dvd collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are ok, a few i do not like at all). and, to all those with criticisms: this is a comedy. i simply love this movie. it is light, funny, and very restful. i am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but i love it. the comedic talents of eddie murphy and robert deniro are tapped (fully - for this type of movie). do not compare it to other movies with these star actors, simply enjoy it. the cast is great and, i believe, that the purpose of this movie was fully accomplished. if you want a really "easy-going" and very restful night - watch this movie. deniro and murphy simply had fun making this movie, so should we (watching it). and, please, do not be so negative. do not expect godfather performance or meet the parents from deniro, do not expect comedy blockbusters performance from murphy... it is a completely different genre, and it made me relax after a hard day work. your sides may not split from laughter, but it is still very funny.

i've read a lot of reviews about showtime on imdb and many seem to miss the mark. i've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical "buddy" film. de niro is in no way murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. in fact, part of the comedy of this film is de niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.murphy really shines in this one. he is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. he is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. de niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid. i thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice. rene russo is also great as the tv producer. of course, she loves everything murphy does and tries so hard (along with murhpy) to get deniro going too.a lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with william shatner, reprising his role as tj hooker to train murhpy & de niro how to "act" like cops. but, my favorite scene involves murphy in the "confessional" hoping he could get a wesly snipes-like cop to team up with instead of de niro. man, that was hilarious! comedies often depend on your personal tastes. sure you could poke holes in the plot, most often you can with a comedy. i was psyched to see the pairing of murphy and de niro...i think it brought out the best in murphy, which was nice to see him at the top of his game again. i can only imagine it was a great honor for murphy to be paired with the great de niro. rating 8 of 10 stars.

it's exactly what i expected from it. relaxing, humorous and entertaining. the acting couple was awesome, as well as the scene selection. i personally recommend this. it's kind of the movie that can be seen by whole family at the same time without anyone feeling uncomfortable or getting bored. this cute movie will make you smile, and laugh too. and the action scenes are tasty. classics of modern american comedy. and very well done.

if you've seen the trailer for this movie, you pretty much know what to expect, because what you see here is what you get. and even if you haven't seen the previews, it won't take you long to pick up on what you're in for-- specifically, a good time and plenty of laughs-- from this clever satire of `reality tv' shows and `buddy cop' movies, `showtime,' directed by tom dey, starring robert de niro and eddie murphy.	mitch preston (de niro) is a detective with the l.a.p.d., and he's good at what he does; but working a case one night, things suddenly go south when another cop, trey sellars (murphy), inadvertently intervenes, a television news crew shows up and mitch loses his cool, which results in a lawsuit by the television station that's going to cost the department some big bucks. except that they may be able to get around it, thanks to chase renzi (rene russo), who works for the station and likes what she sees in mitch-- enough to pitch an idea to her boss for a `reality' cop show, that would feature none other than mitch preston, whom chase sees as a real life `dirty harry.'	her boss likes the idea and gives chase the green light. now all she has to do is convince mitch to participate, which shouldn't be too hard, since the station has agreed to drop the lawsuit if he will do the show. but mitch is a cop, not an actor, and he wants nothing to do with any of it-- that is until he has a heart-to-heart with his boss, captain winship (frankie faison), who puts mitch's future into succinct perspective for him. and just like that, the show is on. oh, yes, there's one more thing; for the show, mitch is going to need a partner. and who do you suppose they're going to come up with for that? let's put it this way: trey sellars is more than one of the usual suspects.	this is dey's second film as a director, his first being `shanghai noon,'-- also a comedy-- and he's definitely showing a penchant for the genre. from the opening frames he establishes a pace that keeps the story moving right along, and he allows his stars to make the most of their respective talents and personal strengths, including their impeccable timing. with stars like de niro and murphy, dey, of course, had a leg up on this project to begin with, but he's the one who keeps it on track, demonstrating that he knows what works, achieving just the right blend of physical comedy and action, and employing the subtleties of the dialogue to great effect. 	there isn't a more natural actor in the business than de niro, and he steps into mitch's skin like he was born to it. and after years of doing hard-edge, cutting drama (in which he turned in one remarkable performance after another), with such films as `analyze this,' `meet the parents' and now this one, he has firmly established his proficiency for doing comedy, as well. mitch is not an especially complex character; he is, in fact, something of an `ordinary' guy, but therein lies the challenge for the actor-- to make him believable, to make him seem like the guy who could be your neighbor and just another member of the community. and on all counts, de niro succeeds. he's mitch, the guy you run into at the grocery store or the bank, or say `good morning' to on your way to work; who likes to watch the game on tv and has a life, just like you and me, who happens to make his living by being a cop. it's the character mitch has to be to make this film work, because it makes the `ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances' angle credible. it's one of those role-- and work-- that is often wrongly dismissed out-of-hand, because it looks so easy; and, of course, this is what makes de niro so exceptional-- he does make it look easy, and he does it with facility.	as trey sellars, eddie murphy turns in a winning performance, as well, and it's a role that fits him like the proverbial glove. trey is a cop, but also an aspiring actor-- and a bad one-- and it gives murphy the opportunity to play on the over-exuberant side of his personality (reigned in enough by dey, however, to keep him from soaring over-the-top into jim carrey territory), which works perfectly for this character and this film. from his melodramatic take on a part during an audition, to his throwing out of one-liners-- delivered by looking directly into the camera (which as far as he's concerned isn't even there) while filming the `reality' show-- murphy's a riot. and he has a chemistry with de niro that really clicks (which is not unexpected, as this is another of de niro's many talents; his ability to connect with and bring out the best in his co-stars, all of whom-- evidence will support-- are better at their craft after having worked with him, including the likes of meryl streep, christopher walken and ed harris, just to name a few). most importantly, this is a part that allows murphy to excel at what he does best, and he certainly makes the most of it.	russo makes the most of her role as chase, too, a character who isn't much of a stretch artistically, but whom she presents delightfully, with a strong, believable performance. and william shatner (playing himself) absolutely steals a couple of scenes as the director of the show.	the supporting cast includes drena de niro (annie), pedro damian (vargas) and james roday (camera man). well crafted and delivered, `showtime' is a comedy that's exactly what it is meant to be: pure entertainment that provides plenty of laughs and a pleasant couple of hours that will have you chuckling for some time after. it's the magic of the movies. 8/10.   

this is a funny movie. the bob & eddie show feel of it could lead to a sequel but i doubt it will make enough money. deniro proves he can be a great straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of cgi animals and rodents. rene russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. this was worth seeing in the theater. we needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end. do not leave at the start of the credits!at least a 7.

i went to see this movie not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the teaming of robert de niro and eddie murphy. it was a fast paced movie and the hour and a half went by fast. this one certainly won't win any academy awards but it was a change of pace for mr. de niro. he is good in comedy. overall i enjoyed it.

i don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. the thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. this is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. the three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former tv cop, brought in by russo's character to coach the cops on how to be "tv cops." those are by far the funniest scenes. if you want to be entertained and just sit back for a laugh, then watch this movie.

i cannot understand why so many people did not like this film. robert de niro was on top of his game, delivering his lines with such aplomb, one has to believe this is his everyday demeanor. granted, the film seemed to take on many buddy-film conventions while trying to make fun of the concept, it goes without saying this film was genuinely funny. from the police dog, to the fact eddie murphy didn't annoy the heck out of me, this film is a real keeper. rene russo also evened out the rest of the cast perfectly, establishing her role so it does not interfere with the budding relationship between de niro and murphy.

several stowaways get on a russian ship bound for france. they were going to get off there and make new lives for themselves. after being discovered by the first mate and his henchmen, they were held captive. then things got very bad for them. good show based on a true story.

i was watching an nfl game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the hbo type channels. i missed the beginning but when i started watching deadly voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. you will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your la-z-boy throughout this one. if you get the chance take the time to watch it. every once in a while i think about having the cable company take off my movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them. happy holidays to all from cape cod !!!

i absolutely hate the idea of made for television films . for me tvms usually involve jane seymour or jaclyn smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying of a difficult to treat disease all done in such a sugary manner that the audience doesn`t need tissues it needs insulin . so when deadly voyage a made for tv film by the bbc and hbo based on a true story i vaguely remembered from a couple of years previously turned up on the tv schedules i sat down waiting to be bored senseless . i was surprised.no strike that last sentence , i wasn`t surprised i was shocked . here is a tvm that grips you tighter than a great white shark , in fact deadly voyage doesn`t deserve to be relegated to the tv schedules it should have been made and distributed by a top hollywood film company due its absolutely terrifying premise and what`s more it`s - unlike papillon and sleepers - completely true for those who don`t know the story !!!!! possible spoilers as to plot !!!!! sometime in the early 90s a bunch of africans stowed away on an ukrainian freight ship bound for france in order to work there. of course it was an attempt at illegal immigration but the crew of the freighter had already been fined for allowing illegal immigrants onto their ship from a previous journey and not wanting to get into anymore trouble with maritime and immigration authorities the crew murder the africans after discovering them hiding in the hold. all except one african , kingsley ofusu , who manages to escape from the firing squad but who must try and survive aboard the ship , but the problem is the crew are hunting him and france is still several days voyage away .just typing the above paragraph reminds of how good deadly voyage is . what a remarkable story , and once again it is - unlike many stories that claim to be - totally true . it`s very well written , directed and acted , especially by sean pertwee ( why isn`t that guy a big name star ? ) , and most of all it`s a tense claustrophobic disturbing thriller that i can still remember vividly six years after seeing it for the one and only time . i look forward to seeing again .but you`ve got to ask yourself how can a tvm be better than most of the hollywood action blockbusters that came out round about the same time ? oh hold on , i`ve just had a disturbing thought about jerry bruickhiemer doing a remake with tony scott directing and with denzil washington playing kingsley , brad pitt playing pertwee`s role , massive artistic licence taken with events etc. let`s keep deadly voyage a superlative tvm rather than a poor blockbuster

this searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious african nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families by stowing away on an outbound ship. they think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in new york to send for their families. unfortunately for them, the ship that they select is a rundown russian freighter which has already been heavily fined at a previous port for harboring stowaways. the captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line. the group of blacks begin their harrowing voyage in the cargo hold and are eventually discovered, forced out of hiding and murdered by the ruthless mate (an outstanding performance by sean pertwee.) a few (convincingly terrified leader omar epps among them) manage to temporarily escape and are mercilessly pursued through the ship with their lives forfeit if they are caught. altogether a riveting film which will have audiences biting their nails and gritting their teeth wondering how such dire events could take place in modern civilization.

if you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization, there is an excellent book called "outlaw seas" or "the outlaw sea", and it describes, in story after story, how these things do happen. the lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons. one, many of the world's freighters are of questionable registry (nationality) and it's difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners don't have an office in a real country. two, many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries. the crews are often (like illegal immigrant workers) threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices. three, there is often a language barrier, not only between the officers and the crew, but also between the crew members themselves. the crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence. four, once committing an illegal act, the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint. anyway, it's fascinating reading.horrifying story, excellent movie. does anyone else notice how hbo seems to make the best and most important movies? hollywood has trouble releasing enough oscar worthy movies in any given year, so that several of the top 5 contenders usually come from britain. jerry bruckheimer = the end of quality cinema.i loved the thoroughly evil performance by sean pertwee. i also, as usual, loved omar epps.

as an ex merchant seaman i was really interested in this movie : i personally have been involved in a stowaway search on leaving kingston jamaica where one person was found. we managed to get him ashore though as we were in territorial limits. on another ship i was on the stowaway was found and we could not land him anywhere due to passport/nationality issues. in fact he stayed on for a year as an almost "honorary" crew member and worked for his keep. africa is notorious for stowaway pickups. there is a great scene in the beginning of the film when the bulk carrier enters the african port : her size dwarfing all. the crew pop ashore for a little intercourse and inebriation. so far normal. the drama starts when the stowaways enter the vast cavernous holds of the ship. joss ackland is brilliant as the captain with a drink problem being harassed by his nemesis suchet right on form as the companys representative on board. the stowaway search is classic but we did not have guns. i question the use of guns in this film. this ship seemed to have a vast armoury. in my experience guns at sea are severely restricted due to customs regulations., also having a dog on board was odd.anti rabies laws especially in europe restrict carrying of animal severely. anyway pertwee is brilliant as the embittered mate. the horror which follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable : the grim metallic background of the ships holds and a feeling that there is no where to hide adds to the drama.some of the freighters crew are not into the murder and those who get involved are gradually sucked in to a world of violence from which there is no escape.the chase through the ship especially the engine room scenes are "edge on the seat" : the feeling of extreme claustrophobia abounds. the feeling of metal pressing in and death being only a gun barrel away. the film is brutal : my girlfriend had to give up watching it during the shooting and beating scenes. while this goes on suchet in the comfort of his well appointed cabin gets drunk unaware of the mayhem 3 decks below. its a tense film, flawed in parts but the real message is that we can all get sucked into violence like this. slowly and surely. think of the train drivers who took jews to auschwitz, the clerks who worked out those train timetable. i always remember someone who had visited dachau concentration camp at the end of the war and he said that one of the s.s. guards had put a bird-table outside the camp crematorium. this film is like that : ordinary people suddenly finding themselves in a world of unstoppable violence!

i taped the morrison murders on lifetime movie network and i watched the morrison murders on lifetime, lifetime movie network and on courttv. jonathan scarfe and john corbett did a great job of playing luke and walker morrison. i am glad that walker got his brother luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother bobby. i enjoy watching true stories on lifetime, lifetime movie network and on courttv. the morrison murders is a good movie to watch. next time the morrison murders is on lifetime, lifetime movienetwork or courttv i am going to watch the morrrison murders again because my favorite actor john corbbett is in the morrison murders. i give the morrison murders a ten because it is a good movie about walker who tries to find out who killed his parents and his brother bobby and at the end walker discovers it was his brother luke who murdered his parents and his brother bobby.

this film is an impressionistic, poetic take on the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating. these are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to america in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, that poor, illiterate sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the united states. they have some fantastic, unrealistic notions about the united states which are disseminated on the trip over. one is that the rivers run with milk, an image which is depicted in the movie to poetic, impressionistic effect. the film is devoid of sound and the silence seems to reflect the uneasiness of the ignorance the locals have about life in america, or if not ignorance of it, a vision significantly colored with superstition and fantasy. that said, the movie depicts with jolting realism, the boat ride to the united states and the intake process which arrivals at ellis island had to undergo. the boat ride is imagined as rather dull which surely it was much of the time. the quarters in which the incoming residents sleep is depicted as extremely crowded with beds spaced four or five inches from one another and lacking much light, which it was surely the case below deck. again, the film is not supplemented with undue music or excessively bright lighting and the effect is to create a fairly realistic imagining of what it was truly like for people emigrating to the united states. the villagers may not be worldly, but they are quite reasonable, and the interaction with the eldest of the emigrants, fortunata (aurora quattrocchi) with the immigration officer who insists on particular results, are quite bittersweet inasmuch as they are not diluted or softened for the benefit of a syrupy conclusion and one sees the melding of the realism of sicily with the extensive regulations which guide life in the united states.the immigrants and their story are very interesting and the combination of cold-eyed realism and the magical fantasy of peoples' imaginations make for a persuasive vision of the beliefs held by sicilians, or any people, with little formal education moving to the united states. the acting is similarly barebones; it is not at all demonstrative or showy, but seems the more realistic for it. that said, all the main performers, in particular salvatore mancuso (vincenzo amato), the clear leader of the group is excellent. while never smiling, his character's actions speak much louder and it is clear that (thankfully) the other members of the group, his two sons and the above mentioned elder fortunata, the boys' grandmother, have faith in his leadership abilities and respect his clear leadership. amato imbues his character with great decency and forthrightness and it is a testament to his abilities that his character appears so capable and confident while his character betrays very little emotion. one oddness of the film is a chance encounter with a mysterious englishwoman (the excellent and fittingly mysterious charlotte gainsbourg) who speaks italian and, during the entire film, we wonder why she is going to the united states or what connection she has to the otherwise unanimously sicilian emigrant group. at the end, this is finally revealed and the revelation is done typically realistically and does not seem particularly melodramatic or showy. the film is directed by emmanuel crialese who has a firm grasp on the realistic, if sometimes superstitious world view his characters inhabit and presents it competently and confidently. it is in fact fantastically confident given how awkwardly the realism and superstition might have combined in the film. it is a worthy examination of the immigrant experience.

i just had the opportunity to see 'nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the u.s. as 'the golden door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from sicially to the u.s. in the early days of the 20th century. it also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of homeland security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land. the (mostly) italian cast, with a few exceptions works well. this is a quiet,understated film that is lovely to look at (the occasional,but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure),while the screenplay is well written. this is a film for those who are sick & tired of mindless escapism from hollywood that serves little more than to sell popcorn (not that i have any burning issues with popcorn,mind you!---i actually love the stuff). you would do wise to seek out nuovomondo/the golden door (or whatever it's being titled in your area).

the golden door (nuovomondo) is for this viewer the finest film of the year to date. it is a masterpiece of concept, writing, directing, acting and cinematography. more importantly, this radiantly beautiful film is a much needed reflective mirror for us to view the history of immigration of 'foreigners' into america at a time when the very mention of the word 'borders' is a political fuse. writer/director emanuele crialese has given us not only a deeply moving story, he has also provided a touchstone for viewers to re-visit the history of each of our origins: with the exception of the native americans, we all entered america as 'foreigners' at some point in our histories, and it is humbling to view this film with that fact in mind.the film opens in turn of the century sicily as poverty stricken widower salvatore mancuso (vincenzo amato) and his brother angelo (francesco casisa) climb a rocky hill to present their tokens to the cross to ask for a sign as to whether they should continue to struggle for existence on the island or go to america, the land of dreams. mancuso's deaf mute son pietro (filippo pucillo) runs to the top of the hill with postcards he has found with images of america (money growing on trees, fruits and vegetables larger than people, etc), and salvatore accepts this as the sign that he should move his family to america. after convincing his reluctant mother fortunata (aurora quattrocchi) and his sisters rita (federica de cola) and rosa (isabella ragonese) to make the trip, he sells his only possessions (two donkeys, goats, and rabbits) and the man with the boat arranges their trip, giving the family shoes, appropriate clothing, and instructions to board an ocean liner as third class passengers. as the mancuso family prepares to board they are asked for a photograph, and as they pose behind a painted set, an englishwoman lucy/luce (charlotte gainsbourg) walks into the photo as though she were part of this peasant family. lucy cannot board the boat for america without male escort.the voyage begins and luce in her gentle way identifies with the mancuso family, finally solidifying her safe passage by proposing to salvatore to marry her 'for convenience, not for love' when they arrive in america. through a violent storm and living conditions that are appalling poor, the multitude of third class passengers survive, bond, and eventually arrive at ellis island, believing their dream of america has been fulfilled. but everyone must pass harsh physical tests, de-lousing, and even intelligence testing to determine if they can enter america: the officials let them know that america does not want genetically inferior people entering the new world! each woman must be selected by a man to marry on ellis island before they are allowed admission. the manner in which the mancuso family remains united until a somewhat surprising ending is the closing of the tale.few of us understand the strict rules and harsh treatment immigrants face (or at least faced at the turn of the century) on ellis island, and if we do we have elected to submerge that information. the golden door presents the case for immigrants' struggles in a manner that not only touches our hearts but also challenges our acceptance of current immigration legislation. but all political issues aside, the golden door is first and foremost a film of enormous beauty, exquisite photography, deeply felt performances by a huge cast, and a very sensitively written and directed story. the is a film that deserves wide distribution, a movie that is a must see for everyone. highly recommended. grady harp

this is christmas time! a nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the italian cinema. it was something like 30-40 years that the italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. this is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. and finally this is also a big production for italian standards of the time. in this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition. real poetry, real humor, real tenderness, real drama, real beauty. no rhetoric, no easy surreal shortcuts, no typical touristic tornatore-like picturing, no over acting, no director autoreferentialism. there is also a cool use of two heartbreaking nina simone's songs, whose music, i reckon has never been used in a proper way for a score. so if this will not be a real reviveing for the italian cinema it is an extraordinary evolution for emanuele crialese after his 'respiro' another definitive beautiful film. 'nuovomondo' is not to be missed, it is that kind of 'medicine film' helpful to enjoy movie-making, movie watching, helpful to enjoy and understand life. francesco cabras

enhanced by the expressive cinematography of agnes godard (beau travail), golden door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in sicily to ellis island in new york at the turn of the century. it is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by emanuele crialese (respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents. crialese's "magical, mystery tour" came about as a result of his visit to the museum on ellis island, the looks on the faces of the immigrants depicted in photographs he saw, and his research into the harsh policies and procedures used during the admission of immigrants.guided by letters he read of immigrants sent to relatives who remained at home, crialese identifies with those impoverished immigrants who were able to see the positive side of things beyond their ordeal. to salvatore mancuso (vincenzo amato) and his older son angelo (francesco casisa), america is a distant dream that they know nothing about. after climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the saints for a sign, they are rewarded when they are shown post cards by salvatore's younger son, pietro (filippo pucillo), a deaf mute, that depict the new world as a land where they can bathe in rivers of milk, sit under a money tree, or harvest giant onions and carrots.after disposing of their animals in exchange for shoes and suits, salvatore, his two sons, and his elderly mother fortunata (aurora quattrocchi) set out on their adventure with more hope than trepidation but the equation soon shifts the other way. as they board the boat and settle into their crowded third-class steerage compartments, the most-talked about scene in the film takes place. using an overhead camera that shows masses of people standing, as the ship pulls away, the frame is divided into those aboard the ship and those waving goodbye from the dock and the way they are separated implies they are being torn asunder from everything familiar.aboard the ship is a mysterious english woman named lucy (charlotte gainsbourg). crialese does not reveal her past or the reason she is traveling to america but she seems to stand for the onset of the modern world they are entering. though they eye each other cautiously, lucy becomes interested in salvatore and asks him to marry her in order to allow her to enter the country. the voyage is treacherous with a violent storm buffeting the ship. shot in almost complete darkness, passengers in steerage are tossed against the side of the boat and, afterward, bodies lie tangled and twisted on the floor as if in a macabre totentanz. the rite of passage through immigration processing at ellis island does not become any easier and crialese attacks the way illiterate peasants, in the name of preserving "civilized" society, are forced to put puzzles together, perform mathematical tasks, and undergo humiliating medical examinations to prove they are "fit".a marriage brokering ceremony feels like an auction block and the young women look despondent when they are matched with overweight middle-aged men. this is the only way they can enter the "golden door", however, since single women are rejected unless they have partners, ostensibly to prevent the threat of prostitution. through the fog the immigrant's can barely see the land of milk and honey and there is no statue of liberty asking for the tired and the poor, the humbled masses yearning to breathe free. in their imagination, however, the river is still flowing, waiting for them to jump in. though the ending is ambiguous and one door opens on to a blank wall, another door symbolizes a rebirth of the soul and the passage we must all take from the old world to the new.

emanuele crialese did a fantastic job with one of those films that linger in the back of your mind for years. it was respiro (see comments and synopsis here in imdb).now, carrying the magnificent young talents he had for the first time on screen then, he takes the audience into a dark void. a literal plunge into dangerous waters. the subject is migration. in this case, from italy to the new world (the name of the film). a big deal calling it for its american release "the golden door".the story of a family that leaves everything and risks the rest -that is, their lives, for a dream.i hate to spoil the show telling the story, so i'll dwell a bit in the work crialese and all his team did so brilliantly.first of all, choosing to stick to what he knows: direct sound as much as possible. this means, the whole film. the textures, the pain, the nuances of reality are always mingled with the smells, the heat or the cold, the sweat and the blood, life and death, as vibrantly as it is in real life.the squeaks of bent metal and grinding wood, the infamous drone of the wind and the ominous sounds of big engines and ship horns are among the points that make this film so involving.cinematography is in the hands of a french couturier. the symbolism of light is present from the very first shot (again, almost the very first shot from respiro) and pervades throughout the film with intimacy and a terrible sense of desperation. the subdued tones and the very gray and grim depictions of people suffering the cramped and filthy boat they sail to hope is mesmerising.light is used sparsely, almost to discover every character in the dark. the beauty of every shot, and every scene is accentuated by the period costumes and the perfectly selected physical features of the actors.again, as he usually does, vincenzo amato is definitely on his own. he plays the father of two sons (the same actors who were fifteen and twelve and now are nineteen and sixteen) with all the power he always conveys to his very complex characters.charlotte gainsbourg is so-so. i guess she's never achieved again the perfection she reached in the cement garden and in her very first film: l'effrontée.maybe it's just that she seems a bit awkward in her role.the locations and sets are harsh and compelling, almost playing a character on their own.maybe the most remarkable character is the one played by filippo pucillo, the mute younger son. the contrast here with his first role is complete. then, he played a supercharged kid that was as relentless as anything around him. now, his character is all expression. and just that: no words at all. his eyes tell the whole story with sublime power.maybe this is one of those films that will not be very well received in the states. it's absolutely italian in everything. it's so italian that most of the time, the language is one of the many dialects that is much older than italian itself. in the usa this film may be a bit too much for americans because of the subject. but anyone who remembers the story of their families when they arrived in the states, will see this films with awe.and, again, the minimalism that goes hand in hand with crialese's ideas is back with a closing scene in the water. only this time it goes from underwater photography to aerial.all in all, another great and very well told story from this filmmaker that only this year (2006) has collected 6 prizes and was nominated for the golden lion. not a small deed!

i never thought i'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning kenji miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, i'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the galactic railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--miyazawa wrote a children's book called night on the galactic railroad). however, this glimpse inside the mind of a writer who "sketched poetry and fairy tales from his imagination" is very intelligent, creative, entertaining, and emotionally powerful.all this despite the fact that everyone is animated as animals (like in many of miyazawa's stories).some of the visuals are truly astounding, especially considering that it was a made for tv movie. seriously, some of them (like the sequence with birds trailing blue light) rival parts of fantasia. however, i still can't stand computer animation when it is mixed with cel animation. the cgi trains are horribly obvious--even more so than the anastasia train.8/10

spirit and chaos is an artistic biopic of miyazawa kenji, a japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. the film captures and interprets his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination.the film integrated excerpts of miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. his relationships with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom. miyazawa's selfless compassion for the farmers in his village, his sister and other unfortunate people can serve as a lesson to us all. furthermore, miyazawa's devotion to science was also nicely portrayed. in a time when western ideas were still met with skepticism, especially in provincial towns like the one where miyazawa grew up, he understands its usefulness in helping his fellow villagers and is inspired by its elegance. the way the film presented moments of artistic passion and disappointment in the writer were truly intense and well interpreted.i felt that the cgi integrated into the film, while groundbreaking an innovative, clashed with the more organic animation. it could be argued that this was intentional to represent conflict within the main character, but i found it rather unaesthetic. i also wish that the film had discussed miyazawa's buddhist influence, but it worked fine without it. i though this film was very well done. i give it a 9/10, with the one point being deducted for the cgi. otherwise the animation, plot and dialog were all wonderful and heartfelt. i haven't seen any other films by kawamori shoji, but after seeing this one i will be sure to give them a chance.

odd but wonderfully original movie. genuinely frightening, creepy and ridiculous in equal measures. the setting of a high rise red brick apartment is a perfect backdrop for the haunting action. the thought of a secret sealed room in a place like this is good enough but when the lead naive couple start cleaning up the old bed they find in this room the scene is set for some classic chills. the cast is fantastic. tanya dempsey really gets to chew some scenery after being undervalued in other full moon films. joe estevez proves why brother martin sheen is so much bigger in hollywood - his rolling eyes during the making the bed scene are really hilarious. charles band co-produced with stuart gordon and this really is an exceptional full moon/darkwave release. danny draven also directed hell asylum with dempsey.

i guess by the time i saw this episode, i had seen enough twilight zones to have it figured out ahead of time. there is this odd assemblage of characters who find themselves at the bottom of a cylinder. they are fine until an overzealous soldier shows up in their midst. it is his prime directive to escape and so he garners the forces and puts them to work to reach the top of the cylinder. there is much discussion about purpose and reason and speculation on their pasts, but no one can remember anything. they represent different jobs: a piper, a ballerina, a clown, a man in a tattered hat. why are they there? it leads to an adventure and is resolved at the end, but i guess i had a pretty good idea before it all happened.

during the sci-fi tz marathon of january 31, 1999, this episode was the last one aired in the 20th century in my time zone(eastern). it was new year's eve, and when the clown starts singing, "we're here because we're here, because we're here, because we're here..." i realized that this was tz's clever nod to it being new year's eve because that tune is also the tune to old lang syne. coincidence? we will never know.i love this story for the little touches: the tear on the ballerina, the antics of the clown, and the hit-yourself-in-the-head ending. this and the art carney santa tz are the only ones that are about christmas. my personal top five episodes, after five characters...: 1. the hunt 2. the after hours 3. the hitchhiker 4. the lonely 5. little girl lost

it seems there are two kinds of people in the world: those who think that "five characters" is one of the best episodes in the series and those who are so cool that they know it sucked because they were so clever and already predicted the "lame" twist at the end (which apparently, in their small minds, is the only reason the twilight zone exists: to come up with twists).there are plenty of lame episodes in the series and i'm not one to rate all tz episodes ten. but this one is certainly one of those that merit such a rating. it is claustrophobic and colorful. the suspense is built up and we cannot wait for the reveal of the secret at the end. but whatever that secret is, what these people are, it doesn't really matter. most of the beauty of the episode is to lead up to that. it would be just as powerful if we never find out what these strangers in a strange place really are.

this is one of the classic twilight zone episodes, where with the simplest of situations the viewer was drawn into a seemingly symbolic conflict, only to find the solution surprising and strangely acceptable. five figures are inside a container/prison: a major, a ballerina, a bagpiper, a clown, and a tramp. they are certainly an odd choice of types to be in this isolation chamber, but they are all in it (nevertheless) and they are trying to figure out why they are there. what have they in common? none can figure it out. but gradually the major organizes them into working to bet out by standing on each other's shoulders. and the major, going to the top of the line of figures does reach the entrance, and .... i'll leave it like that, although one of the other critiques on this thread actually gives the story away.the title seems to be suggested by six characters in search of an author, pirandello's famous play. whether the actual purpose to the show was to spoof that play is questionable: pirandello's characters analyze their roles and relations with each other. but the five characters here, while they try to understand their situation, are totally in the dark - they are not in the situation of the six characters in pirandello who know their current situations. this uncertainty of what is going on allows the viewers to think it is an abstract drama.the actors, william windon as the major and murray mattheson as the clown in particular, give good accounts of themselves. and the conclusion, whether planned as a spoof or not, is quite effective.

i was one of the few who went out of my way to see this in the theater. i've thought about it frequently ever since. after two dvd viewings i'm glad to say it held up perfectly. like any great comedy, i laughed more on each viewing, both in anticipation of gags, but also after catching things missed before. mike judge does very well with creating insanely comedic characters and fitting them into their world so they make sense. in office space, the environment make the characters believable. idiocracy's future gives him liberty to write unbelievably dumb characters and make them work. i'll be waiting to see if they release a better dvd with some actual features before buying it. but this movie deserves the support on dvd not offered to it at the theater.

i recommend idiocracy to everyone. luke wilson is very funny, the movie is insightful and made me laugh so hard i had tears running down my face several times. until the end, when i took a breath and realized just how close we are to mr. judge's vision of tomorrow.keep an eye out for a cameo by the guy from the mac commercials (justin long)as dr. lexus. i found his performance oscar-worthy, especially considering what oscars have been handed out for in the recent past...besides, he's cute.in short, idiocracy is a fatally funny glimpse into a possible future where people are named after product brand names (the president's middle name is mountain dew), hospital visits cost $5 billion dollars, there are mountains of garbage because no one is smart enough to figure out what to do with it all, and nobody cares about anything but money. all because only stupid people are breeding. sounds familiar to me, somehow. oh, yeah; it's what i think of when i see professional wrestling...seriously, watch this movie. it's a good laugh and it will make you think.

this movie deserved better. mike judge's satirical wit brought to light something too many in this country are trying to deny... we're getting dumber as a society.could the 24-hour-a-day anna nicole coverage be any more proof? mike judge paints a frightening future, where the dumb survive and thrive. makes you stop and think, and laugh. can you look at the world and not ask are we getting dumber? are we being overtaking by the human trash as well as our own trash? (beware of landslides).the movie is really funny. i'd tell you more of the plot but i don't want to spoil it.so why release this film with zero promotion? could it be that the stupid are already taking over?

i like money! i stumbled on this brilliant film in a local video store last week. wasn't sure what to expect. brought it home, set up the player and then my journey in to stupidity began. the first viewing i did a lot of chuckling, no laughing out loud really. it wasn't until the second viewing the movie really started to take a hold on me and the humor was that much funnier. it reminded me of austin powers, first viewing it was all right, then the real fun began telling people about it, just talking about each scene and the set up. i'm making all my friends watch this movie, everyone i know. this movie may very well be one of the most accurate "future" movies ever made. this movie is more then just 84 minutes of entertainment, it's a warning to the future of our civilization. mike judge, the fantastic mind who brought us office space has brought us a vision of life in the automated future. luke wilson's dead pan humor as "average" joe enhanced the movie that much more. watch this movie then once you're done, read more! write more! think more! for the futures sake if not for your own!

this movie is funny and sad enough i think that it is kinda true. if you love office space then you will love this movie because it is another mike judge hit, but it is nothing like office space. i told every one to see this movie. i only wish that it would have been in more theaters so it would have gotten the recognition it deserved. i love this movie and would love to see more from mike judge. luke wilson is also what makes this movie what it is. i am so glad that i will not be alive in the year 2505, because if this movie turns out to be true we are all in for a lot of trouble. i just hope more people see this movie because i know that they will fall in love with it too.

2:37 is an intense and fascinating drama which has some similarities in tone and subject with films like bully, elephant and kids (although, by my point of view, 2:37 is a superior film to those three ones).before watching this movie, my expectations were neutral, but i ended up taking a very good impression thanks to the intelligent screenplay, murali k. thalluri's perfect direction and the excellent performances from a group of young actors.the sporadic instances of school violence around the world have inspired many movies, tv programmes and books which pretend to find and predict the external or internal reasons of those unbridled expressions of rebelliousness, discontent...and specially madness.some people may say that 2:37 arrives too late to that artistic movement; however, i do not think like that, because that delay permitted the movie to make a more artistic analysis, focusing on the situation with more subtleness and intelligence instead of the obvious reaction of cruelty and anguish which impregnated other movies with similar stories.on the characters from 2:37, we can find clichés from the juvenile cinema (from director and screenwriter john hughes -rip-'s movies to the teen horror films): the beautiful "princess", the clumsy "nerd", the antipathetic athletes, etc.it would have been very easy to make them become in hollow caricatures defined by their function in the screenplay; but it is something admirable that the screenplay transcends the stereotypes to make them real people with credible problems which, in more or less degree, any person can find on his/her road to maturity.2:37 is an excellent movie, whose only fail is that the ending feels a bit affected, but which compensates that with a lot of positive elements.it will be very interesting to see thalluri's next projects, since he has had a great debut with this movie.

this focuses around the lives of four women, all good friends, and their male companions. each has a story, the men as well, everything links everybody to everybody and everything is being brought to a quick change after a trip the girls take to palm springs.basically, the film is no different from other of the genre, but i liked the details. brooke shields is a divorcée that fears loneliness, therefore she bangs just about everybody to get to have a "warm body" next to her in the morning, but then can't really commit. as a man, i find these women are a blessing :), but she is not a happy person. everything else that happens revolves around this crazy woman, but in the end we get more clarity over life and relationships, which is good.i can't tell if the acting was bad. it didn't seem to me. the script was a little inconsistent, but not more than any romantic comedy. it's a bit more depressing than most, which is good, because you don't get dreary romantic comedies every day :)it's worth a watch with the missis, especially if you have cheated on her or plan to ...

this film is a tour de force from julie taymor who directs and does the stage design and masks. no-one comes near to matching her imagination on the modern operatic stage. since making this film in 1992 she has had much success in film-making and in directing musicals. one can only hope that she can be persuaded to return to opera one day. i would love to see a ring cycle directed by her. the current rheingold at covent garden has giants with over-sized hands just like the characters in this film. the current butterfly at eno uses japanese puppetry. coincidence maybe, or evidence that taymor's influence is pervasive.taymar uses fantastical costumes, masks, puppets, and origami birds to recreate the story of oedipus on a stage set on stilts above a lake. red ribbons are a recurring theme. they are used as an umbilical chord when oedipus is born, they hang down from oedipus's eyes after he has blinded himself, in a breathtaking effect they are used to make a crossroads when oedipus's slaying of his father is reenacted by puppets.this neo-classical opera-ballet by stravinsky enjoyed justified obscurity until this film brought it to life. the music is uninspired but inoffensive and philip langridge, jesse norman and a very young bryn terfel make the most of it. the singers are fairly immobile, in accordance with stravinsky's wishes. min tanaka is the dancing oedipus to langridge's singing oedipus. this creates some slight confusion towards the end when dancing oedipus pokes out the eyes of singing oedipus.the libretto is in latin but do not worry if your high-school latin is a bit rusty. there is a helpful narrator who introduces and describes each scene in japanese.

the music is by stravinsky (and not by stupid incompetent philip glass) and was written ten years before glass' unfortunate birth. the staging is simply extraordinary. the narrative in japanese adds a threatening quality and intensity that the latin version does not have. cf. terzieff's version. the giant heads and hands are totally justified by the mythic aspect of the tale. the props and make up used for the plague are simply spot on. it's taymor's best work. the singers are very good, especially terfel. langridge is quite moving and clean, and norman finds the right expression, and her beauty is magnified here and finds its right place: larger than life. simply a must.

the violent men is a good western. perhaps the story is not an original one -big ranch owner dedicated to run out small competitors out of a valley he needs for his increasing cattle- but the film has many ingredients that raises its level and makes it worth seeing.the cast is a highlight. there's the reliable glenn ford (john parrish) as a former army officer and now one of the small ranchers, who tries to stay out of troubles until he is pushed to hard. edward robinson (lew wilkinson) is as good as always as the crippled big man and barbara stanwyck (martha) plays his treacherous wife in one of her usual mean woman roles she deals with easily (others were in "double indemnity" and "blowing wild). brian keith (cole) does it perfectly as robinson's gunman brother, an ambitious man trying to take over his brother's big ranch no matter what. regular 50's westerns villain richard jaeckel (wade mattlock) is there too and ends as usual (no surprise there). dianne foster (judith wilkinson) plays robinson's daughter who does not approve his father, mother and uncle's way of handling things with their neighbors.rudolph mate brings a standard but acceptable direction, perhaps helped by beautiful and wide open scenery and a fine and appropriate music score helps too.the inevitable final showdown between ford and keith is one of the best in western movies. each man in his own dueling style (notice ford's shooting with his straight arm and aiming at its target in the military way) settle their differences then and once and for all.this is for sure one of glenn ford's best western appearances, second only to the classic "3:10 to yuma" he made two years later. it's probably the cast that puts the film as an "a" rate and, as for me, it enters the top 10 list of the genre.

this is one of my favourite westerns. what a cast! glenn ford plays his role in his usual mild, controlled but firm manner. ford plays one of the smaller ranchers in the shadow of the mighty anchor ranch that wants to swallow up the whole territory. edward g robinson plays the crippled patriarch of the anchor ranch and barbera stanwyck plays his sly scheming wife. there is plenty of action in this western that is quite impressive, the scenery is delicious and the letterbox scope photography is breath taking and the soundtrack is stereo! i would say that this western had a size-able budget it looks expensive. one of a series of great glenn ford westerns.

it's always interesting to catch a line in a film that winds up being somewhat prophetic for the future of an actor. in this case, i was intrigued by edward g. robinson's statement to barbara stanwyck - "i promised you the valley", as he discusses the lone hold outs to his attempt to control all the land in logasa. ten years later, stanwyck would star as the matriarch of the barkley family on "the big valley". somehow i thought she might have looked older in the earlier picture; i guess all those bright gowns and fancy riding outfits have a way of bringing out one's youthful side.as for my summary line above, that's lee wilkison's appraisal of john parrish (glenn ford), one of those hold outs mentioned earlier, shortly after parrish uses his knowledge of military tactics to take out a number of wilkison hands after they raid his ranch and torch his home. i liked the way the film explored his character, starting with the way he dealt with foreman wade matlock (richard jaeckel) in a calculated showdown. the set up for the ambush was also a clever maneuver, diametrically opposed to the strategy of rushing the bad guys head on with both sides fighting it out to the last man standing. for that, parrish also had something to say - "never meet the enemy on his terms"."the violent men" is a good title for this film, and was probably at the head of it's class in the mid 1950's, though by today's standards doesn't come close to the blood letting one will find in a "tombstone" or "open range", where the bullets exact a nasty savagery. but it's shaped by fine performances from the principals, with a sub plot exploring infidelity that seemed almost ironic considering it was stanwyck's character who was cheating.

this is the classic western. the good, glenn ford, the dashing hero, the ex-soldier, the man who would not hold a gun again. he eventually has to stand up the the evil land baron, edward g. robinson, who owns most of the valley and wants it all. then,there's barbara stanwyck, the real ruler of the roost. edward g. robinson's wife, who will allow no one to get in her way, even making edward g. robinson look weak. she is so evil that everyone else pales next to her blind ambition and ruthlessness to rule the valley and everyone in it. the gleam in her eye as she sees people face death for her is unnerving. it is worth waiting for.throw in a young brian keith and a few others and you have a drama that stands on its own. with the requisite stampedes, shoot-outs, ambushes and close-ups of hard riding cowboys and you have a heck of a western.without giving anything away, there are enough twists and turns within to make this not just a standard cowboy shoot-em-up.

this was a very good 1950s western, one of the better ones i've seen in a decade which featured that genre on screen and on tv. it certainly had three big actors on the marquee: glenn ford, barbara stanwyck and edward g. robinson. it turns out that ford was the star of this film while the other two stars were in supporting roles. ford had the bulk of the dialog. he also was the "good guy" while robinson was the "bad guy" and stanwyck was twice as bad as robinson. she played the real heavy in this film and the character she played was a little too contradictory at times. ford handled his starring status very ably, as he usually did - especially in westerns. he played a nice guy who didn't want to fight, was a peaceful man......but if you pushed him.....look out!the story had a nice mixture of action and lulls, not overdoing either. it had an expansive western setting which was put to good use with the cineamascope widescreen. it also featured realistic people in a realistic setting. that credibility with the characters, especially the supporting players, was most impressive. the men way out-shined the women in this film, acting and character-wise. dianne foster and may wynn were weak - the only negatives of the production. it's easy to see why these two actresses never became stars.even though it is over 50 years old, this western is one you'd still find fast-enough moving to enjoy, no matter how old you are or what you're used to seeing. for classic film fans, this is almost a must with this cast and good story. highly recommended.

this is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small ranchers and farmers. it's certainly all been done before and since. but the violent men is something special.what makes it special is barbara stanwyck playing the role of vixen as she often did in her later films. she's married to the crippled edward g. robinson who's the cattle baron here, but robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent. no matter to barbara, whose needs are being met by her brother-in-law brian keith. that doesn't sit well with either dianne foster who is robinson and stanwyck's daughter, nor with lita milan who is keith's mexican girl friend.the infidelity subplot almost takes over the film, but glenn ford as the stalwart small rancher who is a civil war veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here. he's every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often. i almost expect those famous words from wild bill elliott to come out of ford's mouth, "i'm a peaceable man." would have been very applicable in the vioilent men.the fifties was the age of the adult western, themes were entering into horse operas that hadn't been explored before. the following year glenn ford would do another western, jubal, one of his best which also explores infidelity as a plot component.there's enough traditional western stuff in the violent men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well.

one type of western i greatly enjoy is when the apparently weak, which is reluctant to fight and answer the challenge of the strong, finally decides there is no other way. there is a great moment in this film when john parrish (glenn ford) goes into the saloon and decides to stand up to the gunfighter wade matlock. it is the type of scene that makes the audience applaud. in my opinion the violent men is a great western, i would rank it among the best. it makes great use of the wide screen, a spectacular scenery of the mountains. the women have a crucial part. caroline (may winn) is engaged to parrish, but you feel that she is only using him as a means of getting out of there and moving east. she wants him to sell the ranch no matter what price. martha (barbara stanwick), is tired of helping her crippled husband lee (edward g. robinson) but she will do anything to have an always bigger ranch and more power. meanwhile she is betraying her husband with his brother (brian keith). her daughter judith (diane foster) is seeing all that happens but feeling impotent to react because she does not want to hurt her father. parrish unites all the small farmers and uses the strategy he learned in the army to go against the anchor ranch. like he had warned lee, "don't make me fight because you won't like my way of fighting".

"the violent men" marked the finest collaboration of rudolph maté with glenn ford in an intensely satisfying drama of rugged primitive justice ford is john parrish, a former cavalry captain who is itching to get married and start a new life his fiancée caroline vail (may wynn) is desperate to move east, and to see him selling his spread to lee wilkison (edward g. robinson).parrish is not even much of a cattleman but he do understand that there is something big building up in the valley in the army, they used to call it 'enemy pressure.' first, cole wilkison (brian keith) comes back from texas to help his brother run anchor then a tough kid with a fancy gun (richard jaeckel) shows up on the wilkison payroll then all the small ranchers are forced out, getting the same kind of offers parrish saw himself either running like they did, or stand and fightbut can he easily deals with a man who sends six killers to shoot an old man in the back? can he easily argues with a man who started with a few acres of land and now owns practically the whole valley? all that grass and sand ever meant to the ex-confederate army officer the past three years it was a place to regain his health out of habit of taking advice, parrish affirms: "what happen in this valley is no concern of mine." and much to the disappointment of the remaining ranchers and farmers, who pressure him to stay on, he decides to accept wilkison's offer to fulfill the promise he made to his fiancéewhen lee's younger brother cole made the wrong move, trying to push parrish make up his mind by lynching one of his ranch hands, parrish got mad and warns the two brothers that he is going to stay and will fight them for the privilege of being let alone brian keith plays the traitorous brother who's behind the killing... he dreams to have position and respect in running one day anchor lee's ambitious wife martha (barbara stanwyck) secretly hates herself and her husband stanwyck plays the part of a loving wife who can't bear the touch of her husband's hands edward g. robinson is good enough as the anchor's crippled owner who promised the whole valley to his wife, unaware that she is having an affair with his younger brotherdianne foster is too sensitive as the unsociable adult daughter well aware of her mother's burdens "the violent men" uses the wide-screen technology to emphasize the scope and power of this harrowing action-drama, making it a perfect example of the genre's most enduring classics

the warmest, most engaging movie of its genre, those lips, those eyes, made me smile and cry as it reminded me of the work it takes to pursue a dream and the pain of disappointment. hulce and langella are superb and the story seems to write itself. a brilliant screenplay by david shaber (one of my favorites! - see the warriors and nighthawks for more...) and beautiful sets filmed on location (i think) at the actual summer theater in which the story takes place. you can't see this movie and not want to drop everything and get into the theater! please check this video out if you can find it.

and what is its genre? the backstage expose story; what theatrical life is really like behind those broadway (and other) curtains. it certainly has a lot of competition: singin' in the rain both i and ii (1929 and 1952), 42nd street, golddiggers of (you name the year.); dames of 1934; noises off (1992) from the farcical side and a star is born i and ii from the 1930s and the 1950s from the tragical side: not to mention summer stock of 1950: the list keeps rollin' along. so what makes this movie so special? and why are there so few comments about this stunningly great movie? have so few people actually seen it? how amazing to see a younger frank langella pre-dracula and pre-frost-nixon by 30 years! how amazing to see the fresh and talented tom hulce so pre-amadeus! and yet another superb stiller! what a wonderful line-up of talented people at their very best from so long ago! and such a script! who was this david shaber? so full of realistic disillusion and pathos compared to the usual sentimentality and feel-good comedy! as especially exemplified by the star-is-born-like episode where the heroine achieves broadway while the langella character has to content himself with still another provincial tour.langella's subsequent hysterical and sadistic blowup against the star-struck latin teacher and his granddaughter in which he vents his fury and frustration is just one of many fantastic and psychologically real moments in the film. (the latin teacher and his love affair with backstage life certainly echo marlene dietrich and her seduced professor in the blue angel of 1929.) another in the series of mercenary and cold-hearted agents like kevin mccarthy who was preceded by burt lancaster in the sweet smell of success (1957) and succeeded by alan alda in clubland (2001) in movie history. the sexual liberation of the hulce character recalls similar incidents in o'neill's great comedy ah, wilderness.and what a tribute to the vanished operettas of long ago: the red mill of victor herbert; rose marie and the vagabond king of rudolf friml; the desert song of sigmund romberg etc. what satirical insertions of bits from the great plays like romeo and juliet. tributes to the theater itself as expostulated by the star langella. the richness and depth of this movie are simply endless. and to be saddled by such a title! who could have an inkling of what this great movie is about from such a ridiculous and unsuggestive title? but on the other hand, what title could one have applied to such a magnificent drama which might have lived up to its stirring, emotional content?ps: i just saw (2009) frank langella in his latest acting spectacular: as richard nixon in frost-nixon. how this great actor after 30 years simply goes from triumph to triumph!

i originally saw this film while i was working as a musician doing musical theatre in summer stock. if you've ever done any work in theatre - especially at a summer stock theatre - you'll really enjoy this film.yes, there are some moments of really bad writing in the film, but overall it's a lovely tribute to the theatre and why people love it.

"who do you dream of? hoot gibson ... howdy doody? i'm talking about the *theater*!" [harry crystal]nothing beats a great stage show ... nothing! and harry crystal lives that belief. a stage actor still waiting for his big break, harry brings the magic of live theater to a small town and to artie shoemaker (tom hulce) ... a young man who has big dreams (but just didn't know it until he met harry).with scenes and songs from many of america's classic musicals ... those lips, those eyes conveys both the ups and downs of the people that, for 2 hours, take us to a fantasy land, but who manage to keep that magic alive in their hearts all day long!like artie ... once you've seen those lips, those eyes ... "you're hooked, kid!" [harry crystal]

this is a great show with total freshness and innovation. that usual chair (couch for a woman) host, that mandatory band playing monotonous tunes, the same old jokes, the same pattern copied from the days of nebuchadnezzer ....probably the pattern of johnny carson, copied by one and all, latterman, leno, conan... daly, this show does not seem to have any of these.i fell in love with this show within the first 10 minutes and i am going to stick to it. though it's too early to say that, this show seems to be devoid of any intellectual pretension most talk shows try so hard to project, and i hope that that is what would make this show different from all the rest. i hope that this show will last long!returning back after months, i still love this show, and i love his self-deprecating humor (for example, his affirmation that only pothead loners would be home to watch his show at saturday midnight and thus, the jokes are funny only to the stoned guys) which, however, does not involve the usual monkeying of conan o'brien, for example (i know it's a cardinal sin to be repelled by o'brien's antics; but i do really dislike his style and repetitiveness). i again watched it the other night with tom arnold in it. ferensen's spoof of trading spouses (and nanny 911 in an earlier episode) are hilarious. idiot paparazzi are fun, especially when a security guard cautions them against taking people's pictures, and (if i am not mistaken) they start taking his pictures shouting "gary coleman".added on 16th april, 2007: coming back once again, i am left confused by the neighbor and her dog. i cannot decide if it is a joke or a real thing. either way, it was funny as hell.i do not expect spike feresten to read these pages, but maybe he does. he is crazier than a bunch of monkeys and so, i would better write down my suggestion here for him: i would like him to do a full 30 minute show with crazy gideon, the star of late night tv commercial. i would like crazy gideon to have an interview in spike's talk show, sing a song (and play guitar), do a skit in the line of snl, and also to answer questions from the audience regarding his potential mayorship of los angeles (i know, crazy gideon may not be aware of this, but there are websites detailing why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of la).god willing!returning back on 14th july, 2007: someone wrote here that the people who praised spike's talkshow must be bribed by spike. i confess that spike really bribed me, but i must also confess that rockefeller named me in his will and last night i had sex with cindy crowford.

i saw it last week and the sketch about the korea towns was funny . very tongue in cheek and suitable to the political climate. full points to the writers and spike for that. the part where he makes the translator pull a rickshaw and throws out korean words could have been pulled off only by spike. this is a brave attempt by fox . this is a brilliant show and i hope that it pulls off . my wife and i have been tivoing it regularly and although it clashes it with a couple of other programs we watch it now on myspace. i hope fox dedicates full resources to the show and makes it daily. i can't wait to see bobby lee on his show . with people like bernard abedalla behind the show this is on the right track. also mary mae as his wife looks beautiful.

talkshow with spike feresten is one of those shows that will definitely polarize audiences. either you like it or you don't. personally, i find most of the bits hilarious, but it does have some "huh?" moments. staples like "idiot paparazzi" are always good for a laugh, but my all-time favorite bit has to be the one-off "hollywood douchebag". "comedy for stoners" is the only regular bit that generally leaves me confused (which is part of the point!) spike and his team of writers manage to churn out loads of fresh comedy time after time so the show never feels stale. feresten's brand of humor may not be for everyone, but it's definitely worth trying.the masses have spoken! we like this show and want more. please note i am not a friend of or affiliated in any way with spike feresten, "talkshow with spike feresten" staff, or fox network and affiliates. it's just plain funny!

this is a catastrophe movie set in london . starting multiple hurricane,superstorm and tornadoes on scotland are displaced towards east , downing england coast and later the south. after several hours of heavy rainful , the london barrier above thames is short from running over, and it paves the way for disaster. then a colossal tidal-wave travel relentless down east causing devastation and lives of millions of londoners are in danger. at the center of the story is a climatologist(tom courtenay) a climatologist who tries to save london from the effects of giant wave , trying to convince the authorities that the town dike was unsafe, furthermore a marine engineer (robert carlyle) and his ex-wife samantha(jessalyn gilsig) . they are trapped into the barrier and dropped to sea .meantime the secret government agency hq ruled by nash(joanne whalley) under direct orders of deputy minister(david suchet) attempt to control many displaced and avoid more dead, approximately 200.000. they have a little time to save london from total catastrophe.perfectly acceptable drama-disaster with alright acting. magnificent tom courtenay as a climatologist who predicts catastrophe and excellent robert carlyle and jessalyn gilsig as ex-matrimony rekindling their love. the movie packs impressive flood scenes brought to life by the breathtaking computer generator special effects, better than the classic of the 70s , such as 'earthquake, inferno towering' and similarly to 'armaguedon and day after tomorrow'. although isn't a clear denounce, we know that the flood is caused by the greenhouse effect and global warming which originates the ozone hole. the motion picture is well directed by tony mitchell. i would recommend this movie to people who like disaster movies. another adaptations about floods, are the following : 'flood(1976)'directed by earl bellamy with robert culp and barbara hershey; 'hard rain(1998)' directed by mikael salomon with morgan freeman and christian slater; ' flood : a river's rampage(1979)' directed by bruce pittman with richard thomas

i recently purchased this on dvd as i hadn't heard of it and like robert carlyle.obviously this movie is not going to have hollywood blockbuster special effects,in saying that though the special effects were decent enough,and the acting was fine also.i found the movie to be enjoyable and do not regret buying it at all,at almost 2 hours long it is just the right length for this type of movie.do not expect thrilling explosive action from beginning to end though,it is a fairly well balanced movie with a decent enough storyline!

the essence of this film falls on judgments by police officers who, fortunately ethical and moral men, act on situations within situations in a city with a super-abundance of violence and killing. good compound interacting story lines and above-average characterizations.

my husband dragged me to this film as i had no interest in seeing some anime cartoon. i was absolutely delighted by the simple story and amazing animation. in a digital world where effects are computer generated it was refreshing to see gorgeous, imaginative hand drawn animation. the world of sosuke and ponyo is a vivid fantasyland intermixed with minimal reality. i haven't seen animation like this since i was a child and it is wonderful to see it endure and succeed.the actors supplying the voices in the english version were fabulous. the length of the movie was perfect, especially for children who tend to get squirrelly in films. overall a delightful experience worth the very expensive ticket prices we have nowadays.

few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability.(no. too many are focused on john lassiter's "amazing" ability to steal other movies plots, turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius . . . but i digress.)miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues (usually ecologically themed), and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance. still, miyazaki (almost) never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies- children.that said, i am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability. where else are you going to have a film where a three year old (my nephew link) will sit still throughout the move, enthralled, a 7 year old (my niece amber) loving it all her own (and able to appreciate the "star power" of frankie jonas and noah cyrus, a 12 year old (my nephew aaron) who's review was "of course it was good! everything miyazaki-san does is good!," a 32 year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation (er, that would be me), and a 58 year old woman (my mother) able to connect with the mother characters (and i'm betting the older charas too) and loving the "cuteness" of the child characters.and that is what i respect most about miyazaki-san. he seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker. on the surface, "ponyo" could be seen as a simple story about a little fish-girl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there, a little boy names soske (somewhat like "the little mermaid"), but there is an entire different level at play here. true to form, miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters ponyo's mother, soske's mother, the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed.but the girl who takes the cake is ponyo herself. once she decides that she likes the human world, she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams. her father is trying to keep her innocent, and keep her a magical fish, but young ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination. once human, she teams up with her friend, soske, whom she loves very much (although maybe not as much as ham). soske is asked to be the man of the house (at age five) when his mother lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by ponyo on her quest to become human. frankie jonas (yes. he's related to the jonas brothers. can we just get past that please?) gives, perhaps, the best performance in the film as young soske (which is good since he has the most lines). his character is also strong willed, but also very respectful and friendly- characteristics you're not likely to find in a child character on this side of the pacific.in the end, ponyo's father, fujimoto must cope with his daughter's decision and his estranges wife's wishes to allow her to be human. he hopes that ponyo and soske will "remember him fondly." and once again, miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the stereotypical "bad guy." although miyazaki has (for some reason) received some criticism for this, it is, honestly, what makes his movies magical and yet relatable. no one in real life is completely a "bad person." all humans are various shades of gray. and that is exactly what miyazaki does with his characters. and then there's the animation itself. in a time when cgi would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film, especially the water, miyazaki has chosen to incorporate no cgi whatsoever. certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means, but every film in this was hand-drawn and i, for one, was extremely grateful for that. the character animation was extremely fluid, and there even appeared to be some lip-sync going on (quite unusual for an anime film). the backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience. this is what animation used to look like- and what it should look like. in the end, i found ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable. certainly not miyazaki's best (in my opinion, that honor is still held by kiki's delivery service), but still a 10-star fun movie for the entire family.

hayao miyazaki has captured the imagination of audiences young and old across the globe, and his most recent cinematic work of art is "ponyo," a children's fairytale borrowing on story elements from the little mermaid. of course like other miyazaki classics such as "spirited away" and his last film, "howl's moving castle," "ponyo" is full of a creativity that can only be truly appreciated by adults, but this it is distinctly more a children's story than those recent efforts. it's a magical story best described as beautiful and lovable, aiming for charm instead of conflict."ponyo" is the story of a bug-eyed childish-looking fish of the same name, the daughter of an undersea sorcerer, who longs to escape the sea and become a little girl. when she does, she quickly befriends a young boy named sosuke. in the process she gains a strong magic and unknowingly throws the world out of balance between land and sea, and a giant storm drowns most of the cliff-top town where sosuke lives with his mother, and it threatens to end the world.like "howl's moving castle," walt disney picked up "ponyo" for an american release and dubbed it over with an impressive selection of western voices, even choosing homegrown products in the youngest siblings of disney band the jonas brothers (frankie jonas) and miley cyrus (younger sister noah) to voice sosuke and ponyo, respectively. also voicing characters are liam neeson (fujimoto, ponyo's father), tina fey (lisa, sosuke's mother), matt damon (sosuke's father), cate blanchett (ponyo's sea goddess mother) and a trio of hilarious elderly women are played by betty white, cloris leachman and lily tomlin. the effort is definitely there to make this film appeal to american audiences and disney is getting close.but voices are of little significance in a miyazaki film, which is all about visual creativity. a fan of transformations and animating liquid and fluid motion, creating a fairytale taking place partly underwater must've been a joy for miyazaki to work with and maybe even his entire motivation for choosing this story. among the highlights are droplets of water that fujimoto sends after ponyo that move like living waves, as well as a variety of other magnificent sea creatures and breathtaking storm scenes make "ponyo" as awing as any other miyazaki film.as a children's story, however, "ponyo" concentrates its efforts on being adorable. the discovery of true friendship and love between sosuke and ponyo is heart-warming, even if noah cyrus shouting childishly when ponyo excitedly embraces human life can get a bit annoying. but as delightful as many of the imaginative elements and loving relationships are, there's very little antagonism or danger. past miyazaki films have clear villains, but the conflict in "ponyo" actually shrinks as the story goes along. sosuke believes he's lost his mother at one point and in the background is the idea of the world going out of whack and that humans should be ashamed of polluting the sea, but "ponyo" is mostly tension free. most glaringly, its climax is uneventful despite how overall likable all the characters are."ponyo" will surely satisfy miyazaki's fans in every way with its imagination, and newcomers will still be smitten by his simple yet visually ambitious storytelling, but this is distinctly more of a children's movie, best for families and others who love fantasy regardless of its form or target audience. it's not quite what you'd expect from miyazaki considering his recent work, but it's sure to be remembered as another of his beloved stories. ~steven cvisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com

have just seen this film, in australia on satellite. as i have been avoiding the news more so than usual over the last week coming from the us of a regarding gunmen, well to be absolutely blunt, this film is a prescient gem. a big bravo to all involved. i had only a small idea of what the film entailed as is most often the case for good effect and this certainly came up with cinematic goods. the setting of the scene is effective in the truest sense of the word, with all the hairy confronting subjects of today's world in relation to one's own faltering family, albeit suburb. the first forty minutes sets such a professional theater i was not ready for the out loud laughs when they came. although the cathartic moment built via comedy and character as the family and neighbors came together in an extraordinary way.all in all a foreseeing of who and what we are. a most meaningful film and a must see.please note the date of this review.

this film does not have the outstanding visuals that american beauty or the ice storm offered and because it was made after those films, it cannot be marked as very original either: the music, though subtly brilliant, sounds very much like that of american beauty. the story has some similarities with the ice storm in particular (as well as sigourney weaver). without intent perhaps, the film seems to try to recreate the success of the two aforementioned movies too much. at times, the story tends to stay a bit more shallow than it's bigger, more successful "brothers" by having too much going on, or by not delivering the most effective dialogs. here, the writing cannot measure with that of american beauty. but that can be said about most movies ever made, even the best and there is still a lot to like: said music score and (expectable, given the cast) effective performances. of note is emile hirsch who would shine a couple of years later in the outstanding "into the wild".overall i can recommend this film if you like suburban dramas though it's not the first one on a list of must-sees, which would be topped by: 1 american beauty 2 the ice storm 3 little children.after you've seen and liked those, check out this one.

"imaginary heroes" is a 2004 film starring sigourney weaver, jeff daniels, emile hirsch, michelle williams, and kip pardue.the story concerns a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the oldest child (pardue) commits suicide."ordinary people" has been mentioned often in relation to this film; it's sort of "ordinary people" with a role reversal. the mother in this case, sandy travis (weaver) is more accessible than the father, ben (daniels) who is clearly devastated and unable to cope. like "ordinary people," the younger son tim (hirsch) is the focus of the film.for me, the film was absorbing enough to keep watching but has a curious detachment about it. there were some wonderful interactions - mother and son, mother and neighbor, brother and sister (williams) and some good offbeat moments. what never clicked was ben being any part of that family or having any chemistry with sandy. this seems to have been the goal of director/writer dan harris. in one scene in a grocery store, the checkout kid assumes sandy is "about 30" and gives her his phone number. in almost the next scene, daniels asks sandy if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday. weaver was 55 when this film was made, actually probably 54, and looks phenomenal. so what is ben looking at? however, there's something askew about ben's complete detachment because the viewer doesn't really see how daniels ever was attached to that family.the end has a couple of twists and also some very touching scenes. everyone is very good, with weaver and hirsch being the standouts.there's not a tremendous amount of dialogue in this movie and lots of stares. the script could have been sharper. but "imaginary heroes" is a good effort.

another slice of darkness and denial hiding beneath the surface of american suburbia, imaginary heroes chronicles the lives of the travis family, all recovering following the suicide of their eldest son.the pair at the center of the film is mother and son sandy (sigourney weaver) and tim (emile hirsch), both acting out in different ways as a result of the death. while tim experiments with prescription medication and his own sexuality, sandy regresses to her former self, smoking marijuana and coming to terms with an old act of infidelity.the relationship between sandy and tim is explored well, especially when references are made to both of them being outcast from their own family: sandy due to her affair and tim, initially, due to always being in the shadow of his more successful older brother. considerably less time is allowed for sandy's husband ben (jeff daniels) who, in a devastating depiction of denial, orders sandy to make an additional plate of food for his dead son and place it in his old spot at the dinner table. michelle williams' older sister penny is underwritten and could easily be taken out of the film.despite its long runtime, imaginary heroes doesn't explore its many subplots as much as the individual stories deserve, while some of the movie's black comedy doesn't translate as well as writer/director dan harris may have liked. and the depiction of a disturbed family dynamic isn't depicted as strongly as the many other films out there with similar ideas. but despite some issues, the central performances from weaver and hirsch are stunning, and easily carry the film to its successfully subdued conclusion.rating: b-

as salinger's "a perfect day for bananafish" ends with the suicide of a prodigy, this movie opens with the death of the star high school swimmer legend, matt, who shoots himself in the head with a revolver after in the opening scene. but the death of matt travis serves as a key to unlock the door of another prodigy, his brother, tim who never in his life seriously bothered with the question, "what am i going to do?"when he finds his brother dead, his head broken like a dropped watermelon, the travis family starts vomiting out its secrets one by one. the film focuses on tim. he is a victim of bullying, domestic abuse, family alienation, heartbreak, issues of sexuality and friendship. tim reveals his wounds by physical bruises, but these are not the only injuries to his person, as we slowly come to realize, as the script painfully unveils the origins and outcome of tim scars. everyone who loves him hurts him. hirsch plays out the character quite well, revealing frame after frame in the visual expression of his body, a host of conflicting emotions inside the soul of a kid whom no one seems to listen to or know very well, unknowing and unaware of his depth of soul and prodigious talent. two siblings sharing a doobie, curled up on a red, spinnable playground saucer, tim asks penny, "what am i going to do with the rest of my life?" the scene is framed in a familiar, recurring image of the film: the comfortable playground where tim obviously feels at home, filmed from a bird's eye view, because with every character tim feels comfortable to share a part of himself, and we view these intimate moments he shares in the red, spinnable playground saucer, complete with childish graffiti carved in pencil, from above. after advising him curtly to pass the joint, penny tells him, "tim, well, the secret to the success of life is to find something you love. and you have to do that for the rest of your life  and you better hope to hell that you're good at it because if you're not then you'll probably fail." this simple line of advice from penny serves as the movie's central theme, the responsibility of talent and the possibility of failure. why does one person have a talent he cannot stand, like matt, who hated the attention his swimming fame brought, but no one notices tim's talent  no one  because no one bothers to ask him? not even us. the film makes us aware that we ourselves do not know tim as well as we thought we did when we first meet this handsome, sad, guy; in our intimate understanding of tim, as it progresses, we are reminded that not everyone is as they seem to be. this is the other side of the film, the failure of those who should  parents, friends, teachers  whoever  to notice and see the gifts of the people they claim to love. not even his mother sandy, played by sigourney weaver, sees tim's gift, despite her love for her son. weaver does a deft job of a middle-aged woman grappling with her own inner demons as she haphazardly tries to play the roles of domesticity and support. when tim is found to be bullied at school, she storms the boy's trailer, threatening his life, "you can tease, torture, punch, drive drunk with me, i can forgive you. hell i can understand it, i'm a good christian, you know, i can forgive and forget, but you mess with my kid and may god himself descend from heaven to protect you because as long as i live  and i will outlive you all  i will wake up and go to sleep at night just dreaming of ways to make your petty insignificant lives into hell on earth." after flicking a paper cup into the mother's face, she looks around the trailer, and looking at them both, the kid and his stunned mother, comments, "nice trailer" and leaves as quickly as she came. weaver scores in her ability to match gusto with visceral wit that is acid and witty. and tim's father, played by jeff daniels, is blind to who his son is, treating him like a stranger, not telling his family that he took time off from the office, spending his days in the city park, listless, a carved out soul, and sleeping in matt's bed, tucked in with his high school letter jacket. jeff daniels does a superb job of making us believe that he can be both a bastard and lovable because, we grow to see that even an inept father can show his love for his son. in an emotional scene, tim confronts his father. just when you think his dad is going to hit him, he grabs for him to embrace him. not letting him go, he tells tim, "i am your father and you're are my son and i'm here okay but you've gotta talk to me. i don't know how to do this by myself". it is here at this moment in the film that a father tells his son, you have to tell me what's going on inside of you, you have to tell me who you are; i want to know who you are. it is in this scene that the film reaches a cathartic moment, the visual movement from tim, angry and alone, to his father embracing him as he breaks downs and weeps, revealing the emotions hidden beneath his shell. tim experiences this moment of cleansing with his dad as a catharsis, especially when you consider the mistreatment, manipulation, disregard, violence and betrayal he has been dealt in the long year the film encompasses. i recommend this film.

it occurred to me while watching "imaginary heroes" that any screenwriter attempting to make a drama about family relationships should seriously consider killing off a kid or two in the opening reel as a way of getting his characters to open up and reveal themselves. there must be something to this storyline, for it seems as if every other family drama that comes down the pike uses this device in one form or another ("paradise" and "moonlight mile" are just two of the more recent examples that spring immediately to mind, although one could reach back to a golden oldie like "who's afraid of virginia woolf?" to make the point as well). it's not that the death of a child is an illegitimate subject for serious films to explore. far from it. it's just that, like any topic, it can be so overused that it becomes just another movie cliché, a convenient bit of narrative shorthand to get the ball rolling and to give the characters something to grapple with for the remainder of the time we get to spend with them.the latest such work is "imaginary heroes," a film that borrows heavily from what is one of the earliest and, perhaps, best known examples of the "family coping with the death of a child" genre, the academy award winning "ordinary people." like the characters in that earlier film, the travises seem, on the surface, to be the ideal suburban family, until, one fateful day, their oldest son, matt, who is the "golden boy" athlete and, thus, the apple of his father's eye, kills himself with no explanation (one minor difference is that the son in "ordinary people" dies as a result of an accident, not a suicide). it is matt's younger brother, tim, who winds up finding the body, and who assumes the role of protagonist in the film. each of the remaining family members copes with the tragedy in his or her own way. matt, who has always lived in the shadow of his older brother, becomes more and more estranged from the father who has virtually ignored him all his life and begins to turn to drugs for surcease. ben, the father, becomes swallowed up in feelings of remorse and guilt, turning away from both his job and his family. his wife, sandy, is the most complex character in the film, a free-spirited child of the '60's who feels oddly adrift in the role of mother and wife as she endures a basically loveless marriage in sterile suburbia. she spends most of her time after the tragedy trying to reconnect with her pot-smoking past.as written and directed by dan harris, "imaginary heroes" emerges as a wildly uneven film. for every scene that feels real and authentic, there is another that comes across as arbitrary and inauthentic. one sometimes has the sense that harris would like to cram every possible life situation he can think of into his screenplay, an admirable goal, perhaps, but one that makes the film unnecessarily melodramatic in the process. instead of identifying with the characters and being caught up in their plight, we often find ourselves thinking, "oh, come nowwhat next?" for teen suicide is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hot-button topics covered in this film; the screenplay also touches on drug and alcohol abuse, physical abuse, sexual identity conflict, life-threatening illness, even inadvertent gay incest. it is this "everything but the kitchen sink" mentality in the writing that robs the movie of much of the credibility it needs to really make us care.that is not to say that "imaginary heroes" is a bad or unrewarding film. much of what it has to say about familial relationships and values in the 21st century is insightful, original, pointed and profound. prime credit for its success goes to the actors, emile hirsch, sigourney weaver and jeff daniels, who deliver incisive, sensitive performances in their respective roles. it is they who triumph over the narrative excesses to stimulate our brains and touch our hearts. moreover, harris, in his direction, achieves an effectively melancholic tone throughout, but one that is frequently augmented by some badly-needed flashes of daring dark comedy."imaginary heroes" may appear unfocused and derivative at times, but its fine performances and subtle mood shifts make it a film worth watching.

the kinks warned about media heroes. outside the movies, most heroes are also "ordinary people." society demands some role playing, but what happens when that extends to the parent-child relationship? do some parents try to improve themselves through their children rather than vice versa? how do you provide a role-model but not a role? a brilliant swimmer who hates to swim; a brilliant musician who won't play. offbeat, funny (despite depiction of "serious" problems), very good multi-dimensional acting by everyone. lots of plot twists complement the emotional tension. celluloid heroes never feel any pain. i don't recall ever being disappointed in a sigourney weaver film (i even liked "the village"!).

it is hard to judge 'imaginary heroes' without referring to the fact that director and script writer dan harris is only 25. you can hardly believe seeing this film, which is not only a mature piece of work, professional and deep, but also with some of the defects of routine specific to older directors.the setting is the american suburb, too familiar from 'american beauty' or 'desperate housewives'. as in 'american beauty'the film turns around a suicide, but here it happens at the beginning of the movie, and we are left watching a mid-class family coping with the death of the gifted sportsman brother and son. emile hirsch plays the younger brother, sigourney weaver is the mother, both are excellent trying to cope with the loss, to find the reason and motivation to survive. harris drives his actors with a sure hand, and the first two sections of the film (there are four in total, as the seasons of the year) build a wonderful tension, with credible dilemmas and real questions. it is the second part of the film that disappoints slightly, it looks too tired and conventional, and i suspect that the producers may have interfered in the work of the young script-writer and director, trying to bring him closer to the hollywood convention. that's how this film fails to be a somber version of 'american beauty', with a different focus. i am sure however that we will hear a lot about dan harris in the coming years.

imaginary heroes is clearly the best film of the year. it was a complete and utter joy to watch. i was riveted. the whole audience up at the sunset five was riveted, when the film ended no one moved, spoke, nothing. i think this film is a perfect example of the of the power that drama has. especially in so much as it sets an example of the quality of drama/ work of this younger generation. there were moments in your film, many, like at least seven, where i was struck by such a great amount of beauty, emotional beauty, that i actually couldn't breathe for a while. and for a catharsis junkie like me, that's about the best censorial experience i could ask for. it is the result of powerful, masterful storytelling and direction. like heavyweight stuff, like burtolucci and those guys. each element of the film fit tightly together. there were no missteps at all. the cast was amazing. i have been a huge fan of emile's and ryan's for a long time, and i thought they have never been better. i was/am/will be continuously stunned by this film. and i promise i will drag every person i know to see it. it should be seen. it should win awards.

wow. when i went to this film at the toronto film festival i had no idea what i was in for. this movie takes you on an emotional roller-coaster in the best sense of the term. sigourney weaver was better than i've seen from her in years; emile hirsch was great and jeff daniels broke my heart. i can see how this won't be every person's cup of tea, as at times it deals with some pretty harsh things that can happen to a family. don't get me wrong -- it's really funny too -- at my screening the audience burst out in applause after laughing over and over again. i just think if you're open to examining your own life, imaginary heroes will sincerely touch you. i can't wait until it comes out in theaters.

great characters, great acting, great dialogue, incredible plot twists in plain language one of the best shows i've ever seen in my life. do yourself a favor and watch this show, you won't regret it. this show re-writes the book on sci-fi!

faqrscape is truly one of those shows that just has it all, great acting,great cast,great writing,sets,chemistry,muppets...it's got it all and then some, except a home. this fantastic series it's seem has it all except and ending. tptb seem to think this is a series that is consecutive single set shows, when anyone who watches know this is an ongoing ,one epic, love story, that has an end that must been seen. if you have never watched farscape do youself a favor and check it out on dvd when the season 1 will be released in october....and season 2 is the best there is! watch the reruns on the scifi channel to catch up and then the new season starts in january through march when most shows are going in to hiatis and be sure to watch. if all goes well we will get our ending!

farscape totally rules! in my opinion it's very close to babylon five although there are only 7 main characters in the series (spaceship included). the humour is excellent and the writers manage to keep the show interesting though pretty much everything happens on the ship.what i really love and appreciate in farscpae is,that they don't use cgi for the alien characters or if they do, it's unnoticeable. they use those lovable, crappy rubber animatronic puppets very similar to the ones used in the original star wars.farscape is something you definitely want to look into, if you already haven't.

ladies and gentlemen: the show begins with this documentary film. it's structured in three chapters, each one chronologically arranged. the first presents the classical physics and links to einstein. the second studies in depth the quantum physics and enters in string theory. the last reveals the everything theory... the difficult concepts used here are introduced in a very simple way, with daily objects; although you must believe them without checking by yourself -if you are not a scientist- (and even if you are a scientist!!). the film is not a masterpiece by its fabulous technique or the way it's produced; what really imports is the story, and what a story!!!

many of us who went through high school probably made it through alright without having to take a physics course - i know i didn't. but after watching this program, i surely wish i had.this documentary is a guide to the 'holy grail of physics' - the quest to unify all the fundamental forces of the universe into one 'master equation' that eluded einstein during the last years of his life. brian green, a professor at columbia university, introduces us to this mind blowing theory in a wonderfully simple way and leaves us with an even greater appreciation for the universe we live in.we start with the tantalizing possibility of a 'master equation' that could unite and explain everything... *everything!* in this universe, including the four fundamental forces that we know that exist: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and gravity. green takes us on a tour of how our understanding of the universe came into view with the work of newton, then einstein, and then later on to the revolution of the physics at the quantum level.but it is at this point that we run into a problem that has plagued physicists for years, and one that no one has been able to solve just yet. how can we unify all these forces that we know together? we find, as green constantly points out throughout the problem - that the answer to this perplexing problem could be in the theory of strings. however, if we are to describe the universe in terms of string theory, there is a very big price to pay.it turns out that out of the mind numbing mathematical equations of string theory, that, as a consequence, we find that we could possibly be living in a universe filled with, not just 3 dimensions that you and i see every day plus 1 (for time), but rather, that we may actually live in a universe of *11* dimensions. but the math that arises out of that theory doesn't stop there - the possibility exists that there may actually be parallel universes; some of them right next to you and me! could we possibly take such a theory that leads to such consequences seriously? as green points out; we have yet to fully find out, but we do know that the math that has arisen from these equations are already showing us that the universe still has much to show us.for those of you who fear that you won't be able to understand the concepts in this program - fear not. professor green does a wonderful job of doing away with the math and harder concepts of physics and instead focuses more on the *concept* - which, when you take away all the math from it, transforms from a monstrous beast into an incredibly simple and, as green constantly points out, 'elegant' concept. viewers of this program need no prior background in science; the concepts are so simple even a child could understand them.when you finish this program, you will truly come to understand what a wonderful and mysterious universe it is that we live in.

this program was quite interesting. the way the program was displayed made it all the more interesting. string theory is also very interesting to listen too. the whole three hours in my opinion were well worth it. i enjoyed listening to the ideas given by the physicists. extra dimensions really boggle the mind. if you have the chance, watch this amazing documentary.

my local pbs station whyy philadelphia recently showed "the elegant universe." after three hours of watching it, besides having my brain hurt, i learned all about wormholes, quantum mechanics and parallel realities and alternate universes.the last hour of the show was about "string theory" physics, a semi-new branch of physics which makes many of the the ideas of science fiction not only possible, but probable. with the "string theory" it sounds like wormholes, alternate realities and alternate timelines are possible and it could just be a matter of time until we get the knowledge to use them.although it may not have given new information to someone familiar with the topic, i found the show very interesting and informative. it was very understandable to anyone who is just being introduced to this subject.

the elegant universe brings to light many ideas of the universe and existence. after watching this documentary, one can't help but take a step back and rethink their view on the existence of everything. there is a large cast of scientists, mathematicians and others on both sides of string theory. it is continually brought into question as untested, untestable, and possibly dead wrong. the closest to proselytizing that anyone does is to explain that quantum physics, the set of mathematical ideas that give extremely good approximations of what happens to sub-atomic particles, has never made an incorrect prediction. not so with string theory; no one is willing to say, on-camera, that string theory is the truth, and in so doing, the piece retains a certain respectful distance from the subject.

i cannot believe someone gave this movie a 1 rating!!! and it is only a 3. average... what is not to love about this film? it is original, it has lots of scare scenes that actually made me jump out of my seat, and it has some great special effects. the story is fresh, there is some nudity, and it is very campy. the killer was scary in his own demented way and the end is very unexpected. i must admit that i really love this film, one of spain's best horror films ever. if you consider yourself a true horror fan you need to get out there and try to find this film. you will be pleasantly surprised to do so.

bit of a curate's egg, this one. i started off hating it, with it's predictable' old dark house' set-up, it's constant references to recent us horrors and regular trips up and down dimly lit corridors.but it does get going and has it's moments of originality.i began to wonder , once the killing started, how they were going to last out with only a cast of six but then we get flashbacks to a previous visit to the building and see a whole slew of gory killings which is pretty effective.naschy is fine and by the end it's been an enjoyable enough movie. it just does not jump up and grab one, hard enough.

six teenagers go to an old remote abandoned school where 27 years ago a horrible massacre took place for a night of fun and pranks. instead the kids run afoul of the vicious crazed security guard (excellently played with supremely creepy menace by spanish horror icon paul naschy) who committed the nasty killings. director carlos gil relates the intriguing story at a brisk pace and does an adept job of creating a compellingly spooky and mysterious atmosphere. the witty script by tino blanco and mercedes holgueras offers a clever and inspired blend of slasher and supernatural elements that keep the viewer guessing to the very end. the slick cinematography by fernando arribas makes expert use of light and shadow. david san jose's moody score likewise does the trick. the attractive and appealing young cast all contribute lively and engaging performances, with especially praiseworthy turns by carlos fuentes as ringleader ramon, olivia molina as the panicky maria, zoe berriatua as obnoxious joker jordi, and carmen morales as spunky goth chick sandra. the murder set pieces are every bit as bloody and brutal as they ought to be. terrific whammy of a surprise dark ending, too. a solid and satisfying shocker.

why has ramón(carlos fuentes)brought his five college mates to a spooky abandoned school building which used to service the black sheep children of wealth? that answer might just lie in a diary in his possession supposedly written by his dying father. what they come in contact with is in fact a relived episode involving another group of six, with five of them presumably meeting graphic fates at the hands of a sadistic security guard(paul naschy)which occurred 20 some odd years ago. but, as they seek out a way to escape from this place, terror awaits them as that horrifying moment in time replays as the group run for their lives, often in states of panic as the killer begins to hunt and destroy them in a various bloody ways. will ramón and any of his pals survive this night of horror or becomes ghosts forever repeating the very same night like those before them?stylish spanish slasher has that professional gloss and potent, shocking violence to match. some witty exchanges between the characters..layered in their dialogue are pop-culture references to american horror films which might annoy some viewers. a demented naschy is really ferocious with the kiddies as he attacks them gleefully..quite a bloodthirsty maniac who carries out his violent acts with relish. i found the loud musical cues a bit annoying and the filmmakers often use flashbacks from previous events in the film as reminders to the audience. i don't think these tricks are necessarily needed, but felt the director wished to communicate in depth with the viewer hence the use of cues and flashbacks. a minor diversion for this film's plot keeps moving and the camera follows the pace of the characters and how they react to the chaotic situation presented to them. your enjoyment of this film may ultimately come down to your acceptance of the paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot. moments in time relived and a killer who continues his work seemingly from the grave. the twist does seem a bit jarring and abrupt, but this might(..or might not)work considering how the story plays out regarding why ramón's father is shown amongst those ghosts re-enacting those grisly events two decades prior. i will say that this film probably wouldn't hold up if scrutinized in detail, but as a slasher flick, it's a breath of fresh air.

this zany film rivals the ghost and mr. chicken as one of don knott's finest film performances. knotts is an accountant for a podunk city hall that is good for swindling the citizens. they fire the "three competent bookkeepers and keep the dumb one" (knotts of course is the dumb one). when his garbage collecting cohort accidentally empties the wrong trash can, knotts finds himself wrapped up in a bizarre trap set by the city council for him. funny moments in the movie include the bowling alley restroom scene, and the cemetery scene is absolutely hilarious. typical knotts, the nervous ninny act is well used, and as usual he is surrounded by lots of crazy character actors from the sixties. such actors as frank welker, and pitt herbert add to the mayhem. as one may expect knotts's armed with a big car, a pretty girl, and no real clue of what he's doing. fun for anyone, especially nostalgia buffs, but just about anyone will love it.

a good documentary reviewing the background behind our societies oil addiction, the problem concerning our present energy usage and finally discusses the effects of the coming energy deficit originating from the peak oil production problem.this movie should be educated to all students as part of their education. show it to your children, parents, relatives and friends. they will thank you eventually.after reviewing the contents of this documentary and comparing its mentioned sources i would say that the facts in this movie are well scientifically supported.

i'm giving this film 9 out of 10 only because there aren't enough specific scientific references to the amount of energy it takes to produce food to satisfy the science haters. mdixon seems to believe the admittedly biased commentators are making this stuff up, but even an elementary understanding of resources and the laws of thermodynamics will indicate that at the very least, they are on solid scientific ground when they state that we cannot continue to depend on oil, we must transition to different types of energy, and do not have a plan that will replace the amount of energy we get from oil. other civilizations have refused to face the facts of life, and have perished. read jared diamond's "collapse" which is a popular book, or any elementary ecology or earth science textbook and you can verify the basic premise of this movie. go ahead, fiddle while rome burns!

i have been most fortunate this year to have seen several films at my university's art museum. on occasion, well, more like half of the time, i am unable to watch the films there. i have systematically attempted to view each of the films that i have missed. so far plagues and pleasures on the salton sea and who killed the electric car? are the other films that i have had to watch this way. the film covers an intriguing subject matter and is well-theorized (emphasis on this later) but not as successful as plagues and pleasures, but far superior to electric car. the film's thesis concern's the future of the american concept of suburban living. it questions the feasibility of such a practice as oil prices rise. so, the film discusses the origin of the suburb, and it's evolution until the early 2000s. one theme the film discusses at length is the alienation the suburb creates among its inhabitants. while several people may live together, they do not "know" each other as we define the word. this, to me, represents the strength of the film: its appeal to actual human emotion. we are able to understand the filmmakers' argument so much easier because they do not have to convince us of their argument's legitimacy. this is also one of the reasons salton sea is such a wonderful documentary. unfortunately, suburbia loses its message in firebrand explanation in support of its central argument. as those interviewed speak, their arguments become progressively more akin to those made by militant environmentalists. we are told that oil production will hit its peak in this decade, but are given no scientific evidence (professional reports, statistics, graphs, etc) in support of this claim. we are given little information as to how this date was calculated. fortunately, this was the only significant flaw that i was able to detect in the film's argument yet it's a glaring one nevertheless. another less-important discrepancy i noticed was the liberal (political) bias which could polarize some viewers. however, this bias is revealed thorough clips of various events and not the filmmakers themselves. the clips, especially those from the 1950's, seemed a tad unnecessary to me. the film was no better with their presence, and would have been more concise in their absence. as i thought more of this film before composing this review, i thought about why i found its argument more convincing than other documentaries that i'd recently viewed. finally, i realized that the filmmakers actually offered analysis to the suburban problem. they propose a decentralized village-system where pockets of people would live together. they posit this practice would lower the necessity for fossil fuels and reduce wasted space. they define wasted space as the long stretches of parking lots between shopping areas, for instance. what is incredible about this supposition is that it's actually conceivable. most documentaries vaguely state that some problem should be ended but offer no method of doing so. thinking more about the film, i decided that this analysis is what saved the film for me and why i give it a favorable review. while neither perfectly convincing nor fluid in presentation, the end of suburbia is a worthwhile investment of one's time. it not only addresses the contemporary problem of sprawl, but it also provides realistic insight on how to amend it. the audience can also enjoy the high production value with various clips from the 1950's spliced with the modern arguers. people living in atlanta, georgia or the triad region of north carolina will particularly enjoy this documentary as sprawl is the most established there.

the end of suburbia (teos) is a very useful film. it's also important and provocative. there seems to be no middle ground with either the film or its main source of entertainment, the anti-sprawl meister, james howard kunstler. while i am not a big fan of the new urbanism, my criticism of it is because of its small vision. in the case of new urbanist peter calthorpe - another talking head - you finally hear what's somewhat obvious in and amongst the special added teos out-takes... calthorpe just doesn't understand peak oil. i've used this as a teaching tool in economics classes to get at the importance of land as a factor of production - a fact long diminished by neoclassical economics - and also as a vehicle for educating about: peak oil, our wastrel land use, global warming, our threatened food production, public transit our compromised futuremove over south park! .... made by canadians from toronto for $25,000 and released in may 2004, this video sold over 24,000 copies by october 2005. one major dvd rental vendor recently ordered almost 400 more copies.the end of suburbia sales were actually climbing 1 1/2 years after its release and it has also been available on one of the major online video services since september 2005.a sequel, escape from suburbia, is in the works with a possible release by august 2006.

okay, so i've read most of the reviews on this movie, as well as comments left by visitors to this site, and the feeling i get is that most people who wrote reviews really didn't like this movie. that's why i'm writing now-i represent the minority because, i did. i admit, i went to see the movie because i am very impressed with ryan gosling's compelling abilities, and the projects he has been a part of lately have been nothing less than incredible. he is an amazing actor. that aside, i wanted to see this movie because it seemed intriguing to me... why? because it's a whodunit where you know `whodunit' from the start, and that's kind of unusual.as the plot goes, two teenage boys endeavour to commit the "perfect crime" because they believe in a twisted philosophy that only through committing acts of crime are human beings truly free-the uninhibited, and let's remember, guiltless, acting out of one's will. the relationship between richard and justin was complex, hinted at homosexuality, and was brilliantly acted by ryan gosling and michael pitt. gosling was the manipulating, controlling smooth-talker, and pitt was the extremely book-smart, socially awkward outcast. enter sandra bullock's character, who it seems most people didn't particularly appreciate. i think when people see she was the executive producer they automatically assume any role the actor has in it is a self-glorification thing. i didn't see that as the case here. without "cassie's" personal history about the ex-husband that nearly killed her, who, not surprisingly, shared similar traits with richard hayward, she never would have pursued her instincts about justin and richard. the case was seemingly airtight against ray, the unsuspecting school janitor and friend of the boys. even when the boys are questioned near the end of the movie neither bullock nor her partner have much solid evidence about them other than the fact that they lied about knowing each other, and the vomit justin left at the sight. therein lay the genius of the movie because the philosophy the boys were trying to prove through the act of killing, the guiltless acting out of will as `true freedom,' ended up working against justin, who ended up having a conscience after all (and ended up leaving part of his conscience at the body dump site). without that crucial piece of evidence, they almost had a "murder by numbers." and to readers out there who have puzzled over the title as much as i have, i looked in to it and found that something done "by numbers" (such as a painting) suggests careful and critical planning and exacting. there's also a song by sting called "murder by numbers", but that's beside the point. :)many readers questioned the necessity of the relationship between cassie and her partner, but i think it really meant to show how cynical and manipulative she had become because of her history. like it or not, her history does play an important role in this movie because without it, she would likely have never followed her instincts about justin and richard. yes, it was a bit of the cliche `women scorned, woman acting out vendetta in every facet of her life' plot, but i think without the depth of cassie's character you have just another movie about teenage killers, and they just may have gotten away with it. there's no movie there.and to the reader who commented that the teenagers obviously didn't commit the perfect crime because the police were on to them from the beginning, can i remind you that the reason was because of the purposely placed, and totally traceable shoe prints. the boys wanted to be involved-it was a game. they were so confident that they had committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see first hand the difficulty the investigators would have in uncovering what they think is the truth. what they didn't expect was that cassie mayweather had an overactive case of instinct working on her side. a little unbelievable? maybe. but many crimes have been solved by police officers who have followed their instincts. however, this is a movie!i saw this movie in theatres about three times, and each time it revealed a little more to me, and i liked it a little more. the more i watched it, the more i was captivated and frightened by the psychological depth richard hayward-there are people really like this. my main complaint about the movie would be that they should have had justin and richard's interactions a little more central (because, let's face it, there lays the intrigue in the entire film) and my main props go to characterization-each character was very distinct and interesting in his/her own way. it was very well acted, although i would have given ben chaplin's character a little more depth to work with (he's a good actor) and maybe pared down bullock's character a smidgen.i think everyone should keep in mind that for a hitchcock type thriller like this to basically tell you the "whodunit" at the beginning, it poses a very big challenge for the writers to keep the attention of the audience until the very end. i think they did so quite well by utilizing a few small plot twists throughout, slow revelation of the different character dynamics, and by lighting up the screen with some really emotionally charged performances by the young actors ryan gosling and michael pitt. i think if we remove our innate cynicism and attempt to see how psychologically complex the characters and their interactions are, we may be able to look beyond any apparent plot holes and see the real texture and quality of this movie, if only in the characters who were brilliantly portrayed. especially richard hayward. not that i'm biassed. :)

i liked this movie. unlike other thrillers you learn to know the killers very well. you also get to know the two detectives hunting them. the killers are two high school kids. they are very intelligent and want to prove they are smarter than the police so they plan the "perfect crime". we all know this crime will not turn out perfect. what we don't know is if they will be caught, or may be just one of them, or even none. in a way i kind of hoped they both would get away with it, although i don't know if this was the movies intention.the story is told in a nice way. you are starting to get to know the people involved. the character of sandra bullock is likable but has her own secret, which works against her. ben chaplin is pretty good as sam and the two kids are both great. the scenes between them are the better scenes in the movie.i think you can say the movie is pretty good and not as predictable you would think. for a nice evening with a movie, 'murder by numbers' is a good one.

not bad but could be loads better, also seems to follow a staple diet for crime drama. you've got sandra bullock as the cop who finds it difficult to work with others, you've got her placed with a new partner. there's a closed case but a cop who works on it anyway, and there's so many corney lines in the film it makes you want to scream.however, if you can look past the formulaic elements there is a good film hiding underneath. it's gripping and the subplots worked for me. well worth a rent but maybe not a purchase.

this thriller has so many twists and turns it had me on the edge of my seat. i saw it on video, some of the landscape at "the bluff" might have been a bit more spectacular on the big screen. cast has sandra bullock, ben chaplin (from "the truth about cats & dogs"), michael pitt (henry parker in "dawson's creek") and ryan gosling (???).

this multi-leveled thriller kept my attention throughout. it is disturbing and informative to see how perverse human behavior can be. it is also instructive as to what past wounds can motivate present behavior. no one, save sandra bullock's partner, is very likable. however, all are believable. sandra did an excellent job. her character, cassie, comes alive with all her pain and fear and defenses. she is a survivor and so her life experience finally brings her to a healing moment. i enjoyed this movie very much. tom landers

billy wilder created a somewhat conventional biopic about the charles lindberg flight. he structures the film using flashbacks extensively to tell the lindberg story leading up to the famous flight across the atlantic, which happens in present time in the film. flying an airplane for hour after hour is not the stuff of excitement, and wilder is not going to deviate from his theme of lindberg as hero of the common man, so things are predictable. however, james stewart is well cast and quite believable as lindberg, and the many obstacles he has to overcome just to get his plane in the air keep one watching. the film comes through most successfully as wilder weaves the parts of the story together in a way that create tension, then relief, then tension again. the cinematography is quite good, score by franz waxman enhances the scenes, and stewart really seems to make lindberg come alive, makes one believe he could be lindberg. there is a bit of 1950's religious schmaltz at the end, but overall the direction, acting, and high production values overcome the predictability of the story (would anybody really see this picture and not know that lindberg made it across the atlantic?) to make an enjoyable film that has aged better than most films from that time. billy wilder made films of a wide variety of types, and this is one that is representative of his craftsman-like best.

everyone knows that lindburgh succeeded in the first transatlantic flight. so how can there be any suspense or intrigue in this film? well, there is. don't ask me how, but there is. partly due to the director's expert telling of the tale but mostly due to jimmy stewart's thoroughly engaging performance, we are drawn into the story as if it were unfolding for the first time right before our eyes. despite the fact that half the movie is filmed in a cramped cockpit, it is as dynamic as any action flick out there. so if you are apprehensive about seeing this movie because you think you know the story already, give it a shot. i think you'll be impressed.

stewart's age didn't bother me at all in this movie, although he was portraying a much younger person. i still recall my fascination with lindbergh's story and while i was thoroughly adult by the time this biopic was made, i had to see it.not only does this boast a great performance by stewart,it also gives a lot of fascinating technical data,making it understandable to those technically challenged such as myself. and the look of the plane itself was great.i quite loved this depiction of a period before my birth and reawakens the childhood love i had for airplanes and for the idea of air travel.

others have harped here about james stewart's age when playing lindburg (he was 47 linburg was twenty five.) but stewart does not look his age and the film, for him was a dream come true. an actual pilot and a retired air force reserve general at the end of his life, stewart had the feel for the character and understanding of his passion, which other actors could not bring to the role. added to the cast was co-star murray hamilton, who was also to be featured in "the f.b.i. story with stewart) and such other well known character actors as richard deacon, of the later "dick van dike show" and robert cornthwaite of "the thing from another world" the 1951 sci-fi classic.billy wilder captures the flavor of the lindburg autobiography and the telling of what was to become a major event in the history of aviation. this story and film are a testament to the soul of determination and perseverance to realize a dream. a box office failure at the time of it's release, it has since become one of the great classics of american film and another in a long line of outstanding performances by an actor that has been called america's everyman. no student of film history should miss seeing this one. there have been over 500,000 films since the beginning of motion pictures, and this one belongs among the top 500.

this is one of those movies that showcases a great actor's talent and also conveys a great story. it is one of stewart's greatest movies. barring a few historic errors it also does an excellent job of telling the story of the "spirit of st. louis".

jimmy stewart was a real life pilot, wwii flier and a one-star general in the air force and therefore a natural for how real pilots react when they fly. when you see the faithful recreation of the actual plane, you begin to understand the real-life bravery and courage of lucky lindy when he flew the atlantic solo in 1927!

what you bring to the movie influences your view of it. i brought 30 years in the air force to this, and every time i see it i am moved by the ending. would a youngster of 15 who's spent their life flying in jets feel the same way? yet, i can only just its impact on me. jimmy stewart gives a wonderful turn as--jimmy stewart. considering he was a pilot, and an air force reserve general, he probably comes as close to being an expert on how a pilot would act as any man alive. one can't fault his delivery, or his acting. he is a pilot being a pilot, that's enough.---spoilers---it's the final minutes of the film that continue to grip my heart. lindbergh has been flying without radio communication and has no idea if anyone is even expecting him. when he flies into the paris airport, the uncertainty of the landing field draws you in. what is it below? those shifting circles that look like cobblestones or a field of corn, must make you wonder, is he in the right place? they go on and on, streaming past his vision until he gets low enough and see that in the paris night, what he was seeing was the light of the city reflecting off the upturned faces of the thousands of people waiting for him to land.

from director billy wilder (double indemnity, the seven year itch, some like it hot), i can see that this is a bit of an under-shown and underrated film, one to be seen. this is the biographical story of charles augustus 'slim' lindbergh (james stewart), who in 1927 wanted to be the first man to cross travel solo flight from new york, crossing the atlantic ocean, to reach paris, in a small cockpit. the first half hour or whatever is seeing lindbergh getting permission to do it, and the construction of the plane, named "the spirit of st. louis", and making all necessary preparations. then of course the rest sees his perilous journey crossing the journey, overcoming tiredness, near fuel loss, and moments of losing sense of direction, but he was successful. also starring murray hamilton as bud gurney, patricia smith as mirror girl, bartlett robinson as benjamin frank mahoney, robert cornthwaite as harry knight, sheila bond as model/dancer, marc connelly as father hussman, arthur space as donald hall, harlan warde as boedecker and dabbs greer as goldsborough. apparently lindbergh was a bit younger, so stewart was a shade too old to play him, but then again, you can't think of anyone else that could do better. it is a witty and emotional drama, with stewart (as always) being fantastic, great music score by frank waxman, and good direction from wilder, a good little known gem. it was nominated the oscar for best special effects (the only award it was ever nominated). james stewart was number 12 on the 100 greatest movie stars, he was number 3 on 100 years, 100 stars - men, and he was number 13 on the world's greatest actor. very good!

it's a thoroughly successful example of a 1950s biopic. it has the stalwart and handsome young hero -- well, not so young anymore on screen; superb, if unlikely, direction by billy wilder; a stirring fully orchestrated musical score of uplifting scales and, when required, heavenly strings by franz waxman; strong supporting players; a gripping story; stunning photography by hitchcock favorite robert burks; and a narrative about a singular historical event.the film begins with jimmy stewart as charles lindbergh trying to get some sleep in a long island hotel before his epic solo flight across the atlantic, from new york to paris. and he can't sleep.the flight itself is filled with flashbacks to lindbergh's personal history and the purchase and construction of his unique high-wing monoplane, the spirit of st. louis. st. louis, missouri, is the home of the partnership that sponsored the flight. (even in 1927, money talked.) anyway, the movie had to have multiple flashbacks and stewart's narration. what's the alternative. observing the unities? thirty-three hours of watching jimmy stewart sitting silently at the controls of his noisy airplane while days and nights come and go? i found the script and the direction impressive for their time. unpleasant things are of course left out, so as not to introduce more ambiguity than the contemporary audience might manage.my bet is that the howling mob that surrounds lindbergh at le bourget ripped the airplane to pieces for souvenirs. and of course nothing about the pilot's relief tube, though it would have added more opportunities for humor. some of today's viewers will find some incidents corny if they think too much about them. aloft, stewart chats with a friendly hitch-hiking fly that, in its own quietly concerned way, wakes him up by landing on his cheek at a critical moment. later, the st. christopher's medal that father hussman gave him taps gently against the glass crystal of one of the instruments just as stewart is desperately trying to land. the atheist stewart is saved twice -- once by a fly and once by god.but never mind that. it's an impressive film. that landing at le bourget, with an exhausted stewart behind the joy stick, confused by searchlights, sweaty with fear and collapsing with fatigue, is really convincing. "i'm going to tear this airplane up," he tells himself, and we can believe him.flying a light plane is not at all like driving a car. there is no smoothly curving highway to tell you where to go, no lanes to provide guidance. you're busy every second. you must watch the instruments, check each wingtip to see that they touch the horizon, ditto the airplane's nose, and constantly watch up, down, and sideways for other traffic, although that last wouldn't have been much of a problem for lindbergh. he was all alone over the ocean.why? in one of the movie's folksier moment, stewart and murray hamilton, two gypsy barnstormers of the 1920s, are lounging near their airplanes in a midwestern field. "what is it? what makes us love flying so much?", asks hamilton. (no answer.) later, his financial backers try to talk him out of the flight. five other aviators have already died trying it. "but don't you understand? it has to be done," says an impassioned stewart.well, that's not much of an answer either. why does it have to be done now, and why by lindbergh? why not wait ten years and stop wasting lives in the meantime? the answer, dear socrates, lies partly in our glands. pilots are a placid and confident lot, given to occasional arousal jags. their chief problem may be an addiction to an internal rush of adrenalin. just kidding. some of my best friends are pilots. still, lindbergh must have been quite a guy. he deserved to be treated as a hero. not just because of the flight itself but because of his later demeanor -- quiet, modest, a family man. we can easily forget his admiration for hitler, since he more than made up for it by testing corsair fighters in the pacific and advising the navy on how to tweak the airplanes and get the best performance out of them.see it if you have the chance. if nothing else, it's a history lesson told with visual splendor.

biographical tale of the life of charles lindbergh, the first man to fly solo non-stop across the atlantic in 1927, aboard his plane the spirit of st louis.while not amongst director billy wilder's best films it does boast some very impressive production values especially for a film made 50 years ago. the story is well told and the performances are also good though not outstanding.one definite limiting factor upon the storytelling is that lindbergh flew alone and without a radio, which meant he has no one to speak with. this necessitated a few different story telling techniques such as internal monologues, speaking with a housefly, and the occasional bouts of talking to himself especially once the exhaustion sets in. also in order to avoid an extended sequence of the famous flight, it is interspersed with flashbacks from his life and the methodical preparations for the flight.charles lindbergh was a huge hero of his era but his controversial beliefs would taint his legacy somewhat. despite this he would continue to contribute to the aviation field and assisted as a civilian aircraft consultant to the us effort in wwii.jimmy stewart certainly had the flying background to back his portrayal of lindbergh. he rose to the rank of colonel in us air force during wwii and while in the reserves following the war would reach the rank of brigadier general.

this film recreates lindbergh's historic flight across the atlantic while touching on episodes in his aviation career through flashbacks. stewart was about 20 years too old to be playing the young flier, but his fine performance, particularly in the solo flight sequences, makes this a minor quibble. waxman's rousing score is a big plus. despite the long running time, wilder manages to make it quite exciting and is able to sustain the drama even though the outcome is known. what a year 1957 was for wilder: besides this, he also wrote and directed "love in the afternoon" and "witness for the prosecution." and his next two were "some like it hot" and "the apartment." what a run!

despite its many faults, hallmark's 1995 version of gulliver's travels is still the finest adaptation of jonathan swift's satirical classic - largely because it not only includes all of gulliver's many travels but also includes the satire that's often overlooked. unfortunately the twin problems of the book's highly episodic structure and a television budget (even a fairly lavish one) remain. the book is a somewhat rambling collection of traveller's tales moving simply from one surreal landscape to another, but simon moore's adaptation tries to impose some order on the chaos by providing a parallel plot that sees gulliver returned to england clearly deeply traumatised and trying to prove his way out of the insane asylum where the rival for his wife's affections has had him committed. the england scenes at once mirror and comment on the travels, elements of which occasionally spill over into the real world. the trouble is that for the first hour or so it acts more as a distraction, constantly pulling you away from the story just as it starts to get interesting. the lilliput scenes suffer worse here, with the feeling that the home scenes are too often designed to save them from filming the more expensive setpieces - this has to be the only version where we don't see gulliver pulling the blefescu fleet behind him.yet once gulliver makes his escape, the tone becomes more consistent as he finds his situation reversed and himself the pet of the giants of the utopians of brobdingnag, a guest of the wise men of the floating island of laputa who are so engrossed in science that they have no common sense left, the guest/prisoner of a historian who leans history directly from the source, offered immortality with all it's terrible consequences before finally finding a world he wants to belong if only he can convince the sublime talking horses the houynhnhms that he's not an uncivilized yahoo, each new destination convincing him of what an absurd and petty species humanity is. for the most part it's a darker set of travels than expected, with only gulliver's curiosity and commonsense and disappointment keeping it from plunging into irretrievable bleakness - and even this is offset by the scenes in the asylum where it becomes more obvious that even if he is telling the truth it may well have driven him genuinely insane. it's in these latter scenes that ted danson's gulliver really shines, never more so than in an extraordinary speech where he turns his trial into a disappointed judgment on the whole human race.being made for television, the yahoos are rather less literally scatological here than on the page, but for the most part this is a more adult treatment than you might expect with no real dumbing down. the star cast is certainly impressive, and for the most part well-used (if somewhat briefly in a few cases) - mary steenburgen, james fox, peter o'toole, edward woodward, omar sharif, shashi kapoor, edward fox, ned beatty, alfre woodard, kristin scott thomas and isabelle huppert among them. it's hard to imagine the upcoming jack black version even coming close to being a fraction as impressive as this.

this production was quite well done for a television original, providing a very appropriate original slant on swift's work. to make the frame story work well the film begins with gulliver arriving home. everyone who has read the book knows that will happen anyway. the frame story of the book has gulliver's crazed confusion in sections. for example, he is horrified that he will trample little people in england because he has just returned from a land of giants. but the film has all the book sections within one long voyage. when gulliver narrates his travels the editing cuts from england to the travel are very effective. i confess i found them intrusive and irritating at first, then they became natural. by the end, moreover, they have become a welcome addition to the story. as he tells his adventures to a larger and larger audience, more and more people listen to his compelling fantasy even though they doubt its truth. for example, his hatred of filthy yahoos and admiration of pure logic from the fourth section comes across well when he is defending his own sanity. the intercuts between events in england and similar events or scenes in the tale is very effective. for example, ripping the cloth from the table to suggest the motion of towing a group of ships is inspired filming. the addition of gulliver's family threatened by the lecherous doctor works well. swift only hints at this by having the long-suffering wife protest against further voyages. it becomes a natural part of this story. the casting and acting were competent throughout. some roles were exemplary. omar sharif's mad magician is superb. o'toole's little emperor is doddering delightfully toward senility. many specific complaints made by other writers here strike me as simple personal preference, which, after all, is what we are about here. i read the abridged version several times a year from fourth grade on. i may have escaped the complete version until a college class but have read it a few times since. and i had to start it again as i began reading about this film. while the danson version is superior to any previous film, it does not replace the book. however, i think it will bring many readers to the book. if you have not read the book, enjoy this movie then go to the source. if you appreciate the satire in it, find swift's "a modest proposal" and his "drapier's letters." both are satires attacking the wretched treatment of ireland and the irish during swift's time. the drapier protests cheap, inflated copper coins being dumped on ireland. these were wood's light weight coinage, not good for face value in paying taxes and official debts. the outcry from swift's satire caused the coins to be sent to another mistreated british territory, the american colonies. the universal satire in swift's book and this movie just poke fun; they cannot change human nature. give danson's torturous experiences a chance. i think you will find them thought provoking and entertaining.

i first saw this when i was a teen in my last year of junior high. i was riveted to it! i loved the special effects, the fantastic places and the trial-aspect and flashback method of telling the story.several years later i read the book and while it was interesting and i could definitely see what swift was trying to say, i think that while it's not as perfect as the book for social commentary, as a story the movie is better. it makes more sense to have it be one long adventure than having gulliver return after each voyage and making a profit by selling the tiny lilliput sheep or whatever.it's much more arresting when everyone thinks he's crazy and the sheep do make a cameo anyway. as a side note, when i saw laputa i was stunned. it looks very much like the kingdom of zeal from the chrono trigger video game (1995) that also made me like this mini-series even more.i saw it again about 4 years ago, and realized that i still enjoyed it just as much. really high quality stuff and began an excellent run of sweeps mini-series for nbc who followed it up with the solid merlin and interesting alice in wonderland.

excellent story-telling and cinematography. poignant, biting social commentary.superb effects. well-filmed and acted.however, the parallel action between the present and the travel adventures (though very well done) at times drags on a little too much (about 3 hrs), and over-interrupts the flow of the story.i first read the book as a child, and enjoyed the parts about the giants and the tiny people -- but the book lost me when it got to the floating island and the land of the "yahoos"! well, although the adventure plot may sound like a children's story, it's in fact a very adult story, full of symbolism about the moral decay in england at the time of jonathan swift, the author of the novel that the film is based upon.

yeah i watched this mini series with my mom and dad as a kid. it was one of the few mini series that my 9 year old mind actually could follow. i recall it was very well done, and didn't necessarily have the feel of the typical crap mini series. it was more or less an original concept that really grabbed your attention. i would recommend this miniseries to anyone who is a fan of history and plot twists. although most twists in this movie are either spelled out or predictable, it is still worth the time. i haven't checked to see if you can get it through netflix yet however. i would imagine not. they should play it on the history channel or something.

like most other reviewers, i really enjoyed this tv miniseries. i didn't see it when it first came out, but my grandfather - a big fan of mysteries and war films - happened to record it in 1989. i remember watching it at my grandparents' cabin one night and i was completely drawn into the story! it has a very intriguing plot and a good mix of drama, romance, and espionage. i've seen lots of films that are set during wwii, but none with a twist like this! thankfully, i was able to make a vhs copy of the film several years ago. i've watched it several times since then and i still enjoy it. i would love for this film to be released on dvd. it would be so much easier to view with chapters.

i have been looking for this mini-series for a very long time. i saw this movie when i was living in back in russia many years ago. i'm curious if somebody who has the recorded copy of this movie can send me the copy. i'm willing to cover all the expenses and pay for the extra tapes or dvds. this is one of the best tv series that i have ever watched. i would recommend it to anybody who is somewhat interested in israel history and world history after wwii. i'm also trying to find a book (i have heard that its even better than the movie)however the new one costs around $50 on amazon and i have never purchased a used copy. my e-mail address is yurets777@hotmail.com thank you very much for you help.

i agree with so many of the other reviewers here. this was a great film and an even better novel by robert fish. unfortunately, i believe the author died before he could see this film made. the performances are all top rate, with the three principles (john glover, ben cross, and veronica hamel) seemingly made for their roles. the exteriors, both in europe and israel, seem very authentic, and the 4-hour miniseries length was just right for the telling of this story. fortunately, i did tape this when it was on television and have enjoyed watching it ever since. i can say unhesitatingly that it holds up even to this day. i gave it a rating of 10. if you haven't read the book, you should really find a copy. this would be an outstanding film to release on dvd with extras that could easily include interviews from the cast.

i watched this on tv in 1989 and regretted not taping it. i was very intriguing and suspenseful. it is amazing as the events unfold and this man's past catches up with him.the acting is first rate and the story is exactly what the title claims... "twist of fate"... but no one could run away from a life that this man had at the beginning of the movie.

william m. thackeray once said "a good laugh is sunshine in the house." when i watched take away, i must say that the sun did shine in my house. this film was superb, the opening was very cleverly done, the story held together well, in a nutshell two fish'n chip shop owners who normally enemies are forced to form an alliance of sorts to engage in a david and goliath struggle against a fast food chain which builds a restaurant on their street. the ending was hilarious even though i have found many who disagree with me on that one.the film was though very discreetly, portraying contemporary australian ethnic stereotypes, in particular the collision or culture clash if you will between the traditional anglo australian and italo australian stereotypes, and how they found a sort of "unity though adversity", very nice.i found vince colosimo's performance as "tony stilano" an italo-australian fish 'n chip shop owner in his thirties to be first-class, his acting was very genuine and convincing, through his performance he managed to really bring to the surface the essence, or i should say the soul of the italian australian stereotype, which in reality is not too italian but not too australian either, colosimo found that balance, breathed into its lungs and gave it life.the cinematography could have been better, more shots of the local area would've been nice, from what i can see it was in melbourne, but where in melbourne? to me it looks like somewhere between ivanhoe to bullen, though i am not 100% sure on that one.i don't know why so many people are comparing this film to "the castle" though they have similar themes running through them, take away stands in a league of its own.i think the film was excellent with a capital "e" it has everything, it's funny, the jokes are great, it deals with contemporary issues facing australian society, the story holds well, i loved it! i highly recommend it.

i hadn't planned on seeing this movie, however i wasn't disappointed when a friend dragged me along. although there are no real surprises here, the guys do reasonably well with their obviously modest budget.if you've seen the trailer you probably know what to expect from this type of movie and there's a pretty constant stream of jokes here, with a couple of classic moments, with the highpoint probably being an excellent flashback to what the guys were like in the 1980's. also, i've read elsewhere that the ending was a disappointment, but i found it refreshingly different from what i had expected from this genre.overall, this movie wont change your life, but it's got enough laughs there to keep you entertained throughout.

though several scenes of wirey spindell can be described as "over the top". i thought that it was refreshing to see something that was willing to go to a level of near-taboo twisted comedy.wirey spindell is a great film with great dialog. i wouldn't say that this film is for everyone, but the film is on my top 10 list.if you can look beyond it's occasional offensiveness and watch it for the film that it is, i would hope you could see it in the same light that i do.

i like the earlier description of this movie as a life poem. i caught this totally at random on the movie channel last night, and was captivated enough to stick with it the whole way. there's really just a toally unique voice to the film, a poetry of narration that's meaningful without straying into pretension. there's also many hilarious moments from wirey's middle-school days that are crude without being potty humor. it's sad that this movie is so low-rated. the fact that there are so many 1's makes me think the numbers are cooked- i can't see how anyone could see the movie as that abysmal. sure, this is by no means a typical romantic comedy, but it is a very unique viewpoint of a very unique life, of a man whose very appeal comes from his detachment, a detachment he must overcome before it destroys him. give this flick a chance. it came out of nowhere for me, and i feel the richer for it.

i was surprised to read the comments of the person who so disliked this film. it really is quite funny. there are definitely a few laugh out lines that my boyfriend and i quote to each other. some of the situations might be unsettling (bisexuality, drugs, a particularly strange child's view of sexuality) but believable at the same time. it's about communication and miscommunication between men and women.

i saw this movie on a night i couldn't sleep, i loved it and searched to find out when it would be on again, probably the best movie i have ever seen, at the time, and even now the cast is full of people i had never seen before but it seems like a real life story based out of nyc, this is the kind of movie that elevates the viewing pleasure because you see it, hear it and feel it, from the moment i saw wirey drinking a beer and watching the game i imagined what it must be like to grow up without a father, there are so many lines from this movie i use on a daily basis like "the personal alone time" in the bathroom drinking a 7-11 beverage, great film

i, as many imdb patrons seem to have, stumbled upon this little film when it appeared on the canadian "showcase network". i was, as many of you, also sucked in and watched the entire film. i was hooked, at first, by the literate dialogue and wry sense of humour that the film is rich with. i was coasting along comfortably on a sort of "kevin smith meets killer films" wave until half way through when the movie really buckled down and explored it's themes in more detail... with a decidedly darker and more poignant edge. far from being taken out of the experience, i was brought further in. this is not the best film of it's kind and will certainly not have universal appeal... so i do understand some of the more negative reactions to it. but i bought in... and enjoyed it immensely. the "flash back" type movement in the chronology was effective, the characters were well-realized and the issues raised were human, accessible (to my experience anyway) and interesting. i was quite impressed with the film's ability to remain sweet, funny and entertaining while not shying away from controversial subject matter and raw emotional language, dynamics and situations. this movie is a great antidote to a lot of the schlock that has permeated the witty/clever romantic genre. a kind of male brigitte jones for the literate sect. take 2 hours out of your busy schedule and jump into wirey's world... or you could go rent "you've got mail", 'cause if that appeals to you, you won't like this anyway! those of us who did like it will be alright without you on our side...

wirey's journey through the final days of bachelorhood, liberally sprinkled with flashbacks to a sexually active and diverse childhood.it's definitely not a feel-good romance movie. it is a romance movie, but one without illusions. everyone's an adult here, not your cup of tea if you want another sleepless in seattle or notting hill.

as i watched "wirey spindell" i couldnt but laugh at what was taking place on screen. wirey sure got a lot of play from both boys and women but i was confused as to why the actor that played wirey in h.s. was 10 years old. then the actor changed age to like 20 to play wirey when he was a senior in hs...but whatever, i thought it was funny.

an example of genius filmaking. the epic story of three major stages of life for a young boy told with eloquence and raw fearlessness. rarely does a film come along that causes me to out loud say during most of the viewing, "this is a really good film...." again and again. that is exactly what happened when i watched this film. i really do not understand how anyone could not like it. i found myself at moments crying and laughing at the very same moment, unable to control how i felt about the scene. the acting is outstanding. eric mabius- why is he not all over movie screens? he was really extraordinary. his seemingly effortless attempt on the screen impacted me in deep visceral ways. i thank him. in my opinion, eric schaeffer is one of the best filmakers around, and i hope he continues to rise to the challenges that he faces while trying to give us art in the face of ferocious commercial filmaking.

i disagree with the imdb.com synopsis that this is about a bisexual guy preparing to get married. it's more about all the crap we go through - self-induced and because of our parents - that we have to "get over" when we grow up. like the linda mccarriston poem says, "childhood is the barrel they throw you over the falls in." this movie is much more like a narrative poem. it's about life and the mistakes we make and hurt we inflict and experience over the years, and how in the end, it's all about love (i'm not trying to be hyper-sensitive or schmoopy) and finding and being with one special person.

instead of watching the recycled history of "pearl harbor" with nothing new to reveal except for a couple of real events involving a few individuals thrown in so the makers of the film could say they contributed to the spread of history, along with nothing but cgi explosions filling in for a sappy romantic triangle. one should go see dark blue world.this film takes place during the historic time in wwii which the czech pilots left their homeland and went to fight for the raf instead of laying down their arms and giving in to the nazis. it was a part of history that should at least be told once to the outside world. a love triangle takes place between the main characters, but one of them does not die off conveniently like in pearl harbor, but through sacrifice for true friendship. the movie is tragedy after tragedy, with not even a bittersweet ending, with our hero not enjoying glory of taking his country back, the return of love by his current lover, the return of love by his reunited lover, or even the return of unconditional love by his life long pet. he is utterly heartbroken and feels no worse off in the russian labor camp. this kind of ending is something that hollywood would probably change if it was their script.the movie does play on the sentimental sometimes, but it also shows the humanity of people. overall, a worthwhile movie.

this is an excellent film. the aerial scenes were well-done. it was also the right balance of war and love. the film gives meaning to the phrase, "never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few."

this feels as if it is a czech version of pearl harbor. it has a same story, both guys fall in love with the same woman. and add to the twist, the woman is actually a married one whose husband has been missing for a year. i don't think that the story line is too strong. the younger guy is quite naughty, that is cute. it kept me watching because of the emotional music, and the pleasing scenes one after another. it also has some strong visual special affects. best of all, the love stories is seamlessly integrated with the story. i think that if it was in english, it would be such a big shot all across the states. it is too bad that not that many people are open for foreign movies.

"for a squadron leader - normally the only guy trained and equipped for navigation in a squadron and very hard to replace - to risk an expensive plane and himself to pick up a crashed fellow pilot, no matter how close a friend he is, in the face of oncoming enemy troops, is hard to believe, especially when they both have to share a cramped spitfire cockpit - two into a skyraider, ok, but a spit?! come on, this part of the film is a biggles adventure, not fitting a film that one is supposed to take seriously!" as said by tord s eriksson (gothenburg, sweden) is rubbish. not at all biggles. one true story of the war comes to mind of two grounded spit pilots, who planned and flew (illegally) a strafing mission over france. one had to crash land and his friend landed his spit under fire, while german infantry was moving in on them, and flew them both out of there. in a spit. they were both severely injured in former fights, one had an artificial leg from the knee down. now that may sound like something out of bigles, but it happened. ill get sources if needed

this is the movie that finally pushed me over the line into registering with imdb so that i could vote for (and comment on) it. i've only recently come to appreciate well-produced "war" movies, and this is one of the most thoughtful i've seen."stunning" is the word that comes to mind when i think of this viewing experience. my husband and i watched this film last night for the first time. it is gently moving, yet exciting at the same time (not a contradiction). this story in the hands of hollywood could have become just another smarmy, action-packed, top gun time-waster.the two lead actors playing frantisek and karel played off of each other marvelously well; and krystof hadek is a very "pretty" boy without seeming to exaggerate or exploit that fact. in terms of hadek's acting ability and appearance, my husband said (tongue-in-cheek), "well, he's no tom cruise." i replied, "thank god!" if you appreciate beautiful and understated acting, see this one.

i saw this film in wales in july. it deals with the courage of czech pilots who flew numerous missions for the raf after their country had been occupied by the nazis. in this film, the action takes place both in the early 1950's when these pilots are being beaten in political prisons in czeckoslavakia and during world war ii in britain. they were imprisoned after their return to their homeland because the communist regime viewed these warriors as a threat to their occupation of czeckoslavakia. the pilots maintain their dignity in prison and during numerous air battles against nazi pilots. this film contain a love sub-plot that does make sense because it helps us to understand that both civilians and soldiers made great sacrifices to preserve democracy. the end of this film indicates that the heroism of these czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990's after the restoration of democracy in the country then known as czeckoslavakia. this powerful and moving film was made with financial support from the czech government. i highly recommend this film.

a surprisingly beautiful movie. beautifully conceived, beautifully directed, beautifully acted, beautifully acted and most beautifully photographed.....the cinematography is nothing short of splendid. it is a war movie but is epic in it's scope and blends romance, tragedy and comedy into a story that is as harrowing as it is provoking.

yet another foreign war movie that puts hollywood to shame. real in the same proportions that hollywood productions such as harts war and windtalkers are unreal. a moving story backed up by strong acting and great film making.

along with having minor flaws to it, this film is a masterpiece, and most definitely the best war film i've seen. not the mention it's one of the best films i've seen in all genres. i might have written this for no man's land before, but now i think this one's better. it's very sad in the ending, and i almost cried after the two shocking scenes that came within 5 minutes close to the film's final. karel's performance as the main character was fascinating although he's supposed to be a rookie considering his age. this film makes you think a lot, makes you cry (or at least gets you close to it), and makes you hate any kind of war and political bs. the flashbacks to the prison-hospital make the film even more delicious. one tiny flaw about the film is the non-british accents of supposedly british people. most of the british people on screen were actually british, but how about the ones who are supposed to be british and speak with a foreign accent? that really didn't fit into this adorable film. but it's pretty much the only flaw i've noticed. effects could also be a bit better but then again, we all remember many films from one particular land that have tremendous fx and absolutely nothing else. briefly, this film is a total masterpiece and every single individual should see it. if you want to travel to the czechoslovakia of 40's, and if you want to virtually witness a tremendous amount of emotions at once, this film is for you. if you don't want to do those, this film will make you want to do so.

engaging entry from europe about czech fighter pilots flying for the raf during ww2. it's always interesting as an american to see a new point of view on familiar events in history. there's nothing terribly original or revolutionary about the style in which this is filmed or the romantic love triangle that anchors the narrative. still, it is compelling all the way through. there is a good balance between drama, romance, humor, action, and symbolism that is understated beautifully by the director and cast. this is a breath of fresh air after sitting through overblown and boring hollywood epics like "pearl harbor." a solid production all around. this is definitely worth your time if you are a fan of foreign cinema.

nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film. the fact that you keep seeking and hoping for more flying sequences, tells you that they have just enough. the acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid.............a must rent, view, or see.don't be afraid of subtitles........its worth a little aversion therapy10/10

this is such a beautiful movie! not only does it portray war, it also has friendship & love. the life of slama is filled with sadness, every aspect of his life fell apart. i can only imagine how he would feel when his friend make the ultimate sacrifice.i see a slight similarity to 'pearl harbor', which is also about two pilots falling in love with the same woman. however this film is much better made, because this does not portray the woman to be unfaithful & easy-going. the friendship between the two men is also much more convincing & well built-up. i definitely recommend this movie to all people.

this is one of the best czech movies i have ever seen. the director did excellent work, there is great camera and the actors are really great. i like war movies so i really liked this one. i would recommend it to anyone who wants to know something about czech pilots during 2nd world war and their life after the war, in communism.

a nicely paced romantic war story that should have got more exposure. the czech pilot who played piano gives a mellow touch to the story. the flying footage may not have been enough for aviation buffs like myself, but then again, this really isn't an action movie. though it does not have anything in common with the james salter novel "the hunters" that became the movie about korean war f86 sabre pilots, dark blue world had a similar feel but with more of a romantic element to it. better in some ways than battle of britain in that it doesn't rely on big name actors. suggest viewing this movie with some czech beer and some czech dumplings called kneldniky(sp).

to say i wasn't expecting much sitting down to watch "the couch trip" is an understatement. i had no idea what it was about - i thought it was going to be a journey into the realm of sexuality when i heard chevy chase played a condom man and the movie's title involves the word "couch trip," *wink, wink.* then i figured out that it had something to do with a mental institute and a patient escaping. my expectations dropped even lower.i was literally expecting a grin movie - the type where you grin once and walk out feeling a bit cheated. and in a way, this is cheap comedy - it doesn't have the greatest gags, the plot is ludicrous, but you know what? i had a big dumb smile on my face the entire time i was watching it.dan aykroyd plays john burns, a patient at a mental hospital who may or may not actually be mental. he gives the psychiatrist, lawrence baird (david clennon), plenty of grief and misery, which leads us to believe he is a sane person after all.following a little bit of a riot in the mental institute's cafeteria, burns is awaiting a tongue-lashing from baird in his office when the phone rings. burns picks it up, pretends to be baird, and finds out the caller on the other line, harvey michaels (richard romanus), wants the real dr. baird to come fill in for a radio shrink named george maitlin (charles grodin), who is taking a vacation with his wife, vera (mary gross). michaels wants baird so bad he has even booked him a ticket on an airplane.burns escapes the institute with the help of a receptionist, and drives to o'hare. he gets dr. baird's ticket, gets on the plane, and eventually poses on the air as dr. baird. his show is a phenomenal success. "people love him!" one man says, and the other man replies, "it's because he actually cares about them."donald becker (the late, great walter matthau) is an ex-mental patient who recognizes burns' clothes to be confinement-issued pants and shirts. to keep him quiet, burns promises becker a percentage of his income. the secret is kept closed.meanwhile, maitlin and his wife get in an argument. he flies home to end his vacation short and realizes that the man on his talk show is not, in fact, dr. baird after all, but no one believes him. he gets the real dr. baird, but unfortunately he has lost his id so the police take them as nutcases and don't listen to their story.let me name just a few of the plot holes i noticed while watching this film: burns poses as dr. baird, but is never asked for his id, even when claiming his plane ticket (he was robbed, he says, but they would still make sure he is baird). if burns becomes so very famous, how come the real dr. baird in chicago never heard people talking about him? word travels. and finally, why would the police ever arrest maitlin and baird (the real baird, that is) without following up on their stories?to be frankly honest, i couldn't care less. i went into this movie with a closed mind and it surprised me - i really liked it. it entertained me. its ideas are essentially ludicrous and not at all realistic, but dan aykroyd gives a truly spirited performance as a half-a-loon that makes "the couch trip" a trip worth taking. 3.5/5 stars -john ulmer

this is a strange, little, forgotten movie from the late eighties. it's one of those "large-cast kitchen sink" movies that delivers some good gags. if you like the people in this one, give it a shot.

does anybody know why this movie is called the couch trip? i was just watching it and am still not sure why this title was picked the movie was very funny and its probably my favorite dan aykroyd performance it even beats out his ghostbusters performance i had never heard of the movie before i seen it in a sears store i read the back and thought it sounded good so i bought and when i finally got a chance to watch it, i thought it was better than what i had originally expected. this movie rates as good as animal house and national lampoon's vacation in my mind i wish comedies that have come out lately were written as well as this one was nothing sad happens in it and the bad stuff that does happen are also funny parts if anyone else feels this way and would like to read a comedy script for a movie that doesn't have a sad situation in it email me at killer2511@hotmail.com

a lot of people don't think dan aykroyd is funny. this movie proves otherwise. aykroyd is brilliant delivering his one-liners in this comedy. the only major problem with this is that it wastes far too much time near the end jumping back and forth from aykroyd's character and the doctor who is pursuing him to prove he's a fraud. the doctor goes nuts like doctor leo marvin (richard dreyfuss) in "what about bob?". the scenes where the doctor is desperately trying to get back to los angeles are silly, unbelievable, and unfunny. other that this aspect the movie really is funny, especially the first half.

i would agree with the comments already posted to this site by the previous rater.i first stumbled across this movie back in the '80s, when i was employed at a psychiatric hospital. unfortunately, many of the barbs aimed at the psychiatric profession do hit home. i especially enjoyed the ending, where the psychiatrist would speak thru the door to the hospitalized grodin. trust me, its fairly accurate.of course, doors at most psych hospitals are not locked, nor are straightjackets used much these days, and any hospital must be licensed to have a "padded room".but a wonderfully underrated film, and certainly one that is quite amusing.jeff

i first saw the couch trip (1988)on late night television years ago and instantly fell in love with it. the funny thing is i usually catch all the comedies made but have never even heard of this one until i saw it. dan ackroyd is plain and simpley hillarious period. he has made a couple great movies with belushi and don't forget saturday night live. but i think the couch trip is probably his best and funniest. with a good supporting cast of charles grodin, david clennon, and walter matthau this piece of cinema shines with comic gold. ackroyd's wife donna dixxon even does a fine job here. my favorite moments of the film involve ackroyd and david clennon's charachter lawrence baird. those two played well off each other. so if you haven't seen a good comedy in awile take a trip back to 1988 and rent or buy the couch trip. i just did, amazon 78 cents. what a bargain, too bad i got hit with a 2.50 shipping fee. oh well still well worth it. any guy will love this flick check it out.

i am surprised that this, well above average 80's comedy scores only a 5.2 from all the imdb voters. dan ackroyd does his usual satirical turn as a con who seizes a great opportunity to steal a contract from his prisons physician. he retreats to california to start his work giving advice on a radio show pretending to be the infamous dr lawrence baird. the only person that knows he's an imposter is the drunken priest (walter matthau) who comes along to be pampered by ackroyd's new found wealth having blakmailed him. charles grodin throws in a good supporting performance too. for its genre i think this film deserves the same crediblity as 'ferris bueller' or 'trading places'. 7.5 / 10

as a fan of dan aykroyd, i watched this film when it was recently shown in the middle of night on tv. i wasn't expecting much, so it came as a big surprise that i loved it so much.this is the type of film that dan aykroyd seems to love to make. a chance for him to 'ham it up' and not take things too seriously. if you loved him in the blues brothers or ghostbusters you'll know what i mean, and you'd be wise to check out the couch trip.avid fans of aykroyd will also have fun spotting all the tiny links to his other films in the script!i can't describe this film without spoiling it for you, so all i can do is tell you to check it out. i can't praise this film highly enough, and it must surely be time for a dvd release!!

michael ritchie's "the couch trip" is a wonderfully anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist. it is so subtle and wicked that you start to realize what a stinging satire it really is. it is also dan akyroyd's best movie, made in a particularly great film year (1988)for him. first, "the great outdoors" and now this.akyroyd stars as john burns, a career crook who fakes insanity to escape prison. now, a dumb comedy would just be about this. but "the couch trip" uses this as a springboard for everything else. beverly hills psychiatrist george maitlin (charles grodin, subtly hilarious here)has a nervous breakdown and a replacement is selected: lawrence baird, who happens to be akyroyd's psychiatrist! you can pretty much guess what's going to happen, but the great thing about "the couch trip" is not what happens, but how it is done. "the couch trip" gives dan akyroyd the best role he has ever had. his john burns is one of the truly original comic creations in movie history. wicked one liners and physical humor are a part of it, but what makes it special is that akyroyd makes burns a lovable character. we root for him and grow to like him a whole lot during the 98 minute running time.but akyroyd isn't alone here. he gets strong support from other great comic actors. walter matthau joins the hilarity as a con artist minister who catches on to burns' secret and commits genteel blackmail. charles grodin "slow burns" his way to another great comic role as the burned out psychiatrist. grodin has been one of the most underappreciated actors in hollywood. it's criminal they haven't used him more often. richard romanus plays grodin's slimeball lawyer to perfection."the couch trip" is one of many films made by the now-defunct orion pictures corporation that are currently unseen. mgm spent a fortune buying the orion library but have yet to truly cash in on their acquisition. "the couch trip" joins "dressed to kill", "blow out" and countless others in gathering dust rotting in the vault. shame on mgm for their inaction. hopefully, with new management, "the couch trip" will find the audience and respect it deserves.**** out of 4 stars

i loved complete savages! why did they cancel it anyway? they should have made a second season and so on... god! they always cancel the good shows... and leave all the boring stuff. nothing interesting at tv since complete savages is gone. this show was a great idea. a single firefighter father with five crazy sons and a lazy dog... each and every one of them has his own madness in that house. tj is always the kid...always the smaller one... kyle rocks! he breaks everything he touches! he's always on detention, he's always doing the wrong stuff... but still, he's so funny by all the things that he does. sam is the smart one. he's always shy and stupid when it comes to girls... finally he ends up by dating angela. chris is the sports guy who doesn't have much to do with school, studying, and stuff like that. he's always funny. and finally... jack! the rock of the show. the oldest of all, the macho guy, "the rock star"... but still, as crazy as everybody else. nick is...helpless with these guys. oh! and i almost forgot! uncle jimmy... he's the man! he's like a 30 year old kid. he's like doing the same stupid things that the boys are doing. i always wondered how did he end up by being a firefighter... and the dog is the image of all the savage family. the thing is... this show had everything to become something really big. it had everything, man! but, of course...they canceled it...

a great show.first, to the people who don't like it..don't like it, then don't watch it...this is(was) an awesome show. better than according to jim (a favorite of mine). it shows a real family household (as opposed to 8 simple rules,etc, where everything goes peachy).they're loud, they're messy....i can sympathize with their dragging all the garbage into the kitchen. it happens in real life..sorta like the "portal to hell", and everyone growling like dogs over the fast-food boxes.it's a "been there" show....you know what's coming, but fun to watch, because you have been there before.a good cast, they work great together, a admirable enough show to warrant a dvd release. mel gibsons "safety videos" were a highlight of the series as well.opinion? good show, really deserving of a dvd release (deserving to not be canceled as well).

am glad that i am not the only one to find this series very good. this is the best series for young ladies! i have so strange taste on comedies and i find so hard one to please my intelligence, and i am so happy that their humor is exactly what i need. love the gang of actors! if anyone knows a series or just a movie similar to this one, i say pretty please write back because i miss the series.and kindly ask the writers and the producers to continue it, even if the actors are now all grown up, i guess!have a nice morning/day/evening/night! (because i do not know the exact time you will be reading this post)

each show is excellent. finally, a show about something other than why it sucks to be married or good looking people talking about why they are like normal people. shame it got canceled.mike scully and julie thacker, formerly of the simpsons, wrote or executive produced some of the funniest episodes of that series and a lot of the similar style humour seeps in here. take officer steve cox and think troy mcclure. however, it does come with its own unique brand of humour and let's face it, a teenage girl will love it just by on the faces alone.what is it with television that cancel most good shows and we are spoon-fed with such abominations as who my mother almost slept with or whatever that show is called? please learn a lesson. not everything has to be about cuteness or romantic travails or especially reality shows on how to demystify every aspect of life. some people actually like to laugh and not have to think afterward. well, my griping is done for the day. now back to the simpsons. when is it on? oh, yes! all the time.

i think that complete savages is a very good tv show and they should make many more episodes. it is one of my favourites!!!! it is very funny and it is really good acting. i say that you should give them a chance to do more episodes. iknow that they can and they should!!!! they should put complete savages on nickelodeon more than what they do! i'm sure that many people will agree with me!!!!! i like the tv show because it is a very good programme for people our age and it is very funny. i also like complete savages because it isn't always about the same thing and things that happen could be real, unlike other yv programmes. when they advertised it, i didn't like the sound of it, but i watched it for the first time and i loved it. complete savages is an excellent comedy and i miss it being on tv!!!!!!!!!! i can't really compare complete savages with any other tv series because it is different!!!!

teen deviyaan is a great film. a very breezy entertainer and a very modern film for its time in the 1960s. the music and songs are terrific though the lyrics of majrooh are meaningless at places. dev anand is a tremendous star and as usual does great justice to his role. kalpana is sexy and nanda is ok. simi too is just about ok. the film has terrific dialogue by vrajendra gaur who wrote most of dev anand's films like mahal, duniya, warrant, jaali note, manzil, etc.etc.it is a story of dev getting attracted to three females - the mod kalpana, simi and the homely nanda. he eventually opts for nanda. the story is about ok but its been narrated in a gripping way and the dialogue and songs and the great dev anand are the highlight of the film. a must watch film for all dev anand fans.

one of the best romantic classic,teen deviyaan is a film which is all about selecting among equals your most soft emotion,love.this is a simple story of a middle class man who came into limelight by his poetic talent and charming personality. he is attracted towards three women and vice versa, one a hindi movie star, the second a rich lady and the third who lives in his neighborhood.the situation put him in confusion as he has to decide one of them as his life partner.he asked for few days from all of them.ultimately he goes to a astrologer and asked him who he loves most.his confusion is no more and he came to know the lady living in his neighborhood who really cares for him and loves him is his true love.devanand played the lead character and has fully justified his contemporary romantic image.

i saw teen devian in 1993 telecasted in doordarshan on a friday night, and could scarcely believe that such a remarkable film was ever made in bollywood. it was mind blowing  a film with a "modern" storyline, superb music, three lovely ladies and my fave superstar dev anand.in this unusual storyline, dev falls in love with three women  the simple nanda, the ravishing kalpana and the sophisticated simi. they too are enamored with him and want to marry him. this puts dev in a dilemma (which is the crux of the storyline)- whom to marry?. he consults a hypnotist who asks dev to gaze into a crystal ball. dev finds the answer and marries nanda. beautifully directed (most probably by dev saheb himself & not by amarjeet the official director) the b&w classic has evergreen music  some of sd burman's (helped generously by rd burman) best compositions. "uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth" is the probably the most sexiest song ever composed in hindi films. credit should also be given to majrooh sultanpuri for penning the memorable lyrics teen devian is a breezy musical which completely suited the style of dev anand and he did full justice to the role. unfortunately teen devian has never received the recognition & popularity it richly deserves.a must see for any hindi film buff, i will rate the eternal favourite 9.5 out of 10.

i think it was way back in 1987 that we had our exams and my friend and i saw in the papers that one of the theatres was playing 'teen deviyan'. we decided to go just for the heck of it without hoping anything great. but we were in for a pleasant surprise. the movie was made in 1965 but even by today's standards, the plot was absolutely modern and way ahead of its times. the music was wonderful and dev anand as a city bred looked and acted his best. i still remember that elated feeling when we came out of the theatre after the movie was over. whoever thought of this story of one man falling for three very different girls at the same time? no he is not three timing or fooling them but he genuinely likes all three of them for different reasons. one is homely, one is an actress and the third is a 'high society' girl who can also help dev in his career as a poet. the question is which one is the 'one' for him. what makes the matter worse is that all three of them like him too. when things come to an impasse, a hypnotist takes him in and in his hypnotized state he dreams of his future with each one of them and reaches the right decision.this dream of his which is the only colored part in an otherwise black-n-white movie is the crux of the film but surprisingly is edited out from most of the versions available today. if you want to watch this movie make sure that this part is intact. in case you watch this movie without this part and get confused, don't worry because you just watched an incomplete movie.

for all intents and purposes, 'teen devian' might seem like just another lightweight bollywood musical. to some extent, this might even be true, especially because the producers had to be sure that the film succeeded with the masses. but somewhere behind the scenes, either sadashiv brahmam (who had the 'idea' for this story) or amerjeet (who directed the film) decided that there would be a twist to the usual formula, and succeeded perhaps beyond even their own expectations.this is not simply about a handsome man flirting with 3 women, undecided on whom to choose as his life's partner. dev anand's character was really in love with each of the 3 women at various times, and they with him, despite being aware of the other two. dev anand's relationship with simi and kalpana is particularly interesting - in that each of the women comes to depend on him heavily. there are quite a lot of suggestive teasers in the stars' body language that lend themselves to imagination depending on the viewer's maturity. the theme is surprisingly adult and after all that it was ashame that the ending was tame, obviously designed to please the masses and deflect criticism.

this flick is strange but i liked it a lot. its about a good girl who loves her bad boy and their messed up honeymoon. he doesn't love her back and he's a mean son of a bitch. he starts to love her after some really whacked stuff happens on their honeymoon i wont give it away. its weird yeah!! but different than other movies in a good way i think. i don't know what to compare it to but its a love story. but has lots of funny stuff too. like get to see james franco in a wig. i liked the notebook a lot and it kinda felt like that because of the love story. but the rest is way different. nothing like that. sienna miller is really good. i saw this movie at a test screener because i like her a lot and her fashion. i liked her in factory girl but this is a better movie than that was. her and james franco look really in love in this movie and i hope they are together in real life but don't knowsee it!!!!

i saw this at a test screening in chatsworth a week or so ago, and went with a bunch of my girlfriends. we all really loved it a lot. james franco is amazing and so hot, i would see it just for him!!!!!!! but sienna miller is also really good and plays a southern girl who is in love with him so much that she can't let go. david caradine who was in kill bill plays a cowboy and he is perfect for that. the story is kind of strange but if you believe in the power of love and magical things you will love it!!! it is really original, and it is also very funny and everyone laughed a lot but by the end it gets more serious and we all ended up crying. i am going to see it again with my friends as soon as it comes out, it is really good!!!!!!!

this movie rocked!!!! saw it at a screener a coupla weeks ago. kinda a strange story, where james franco plays this jerk who marries sienna miller just to get out of the country and they go to niagara falls for their honeymoon. don't wanna give it away cuz the movie isn't released yet but its totally cool and you would never expect the stuff that happens. i kinda thought i would hate it cuz its a romance but its also kinda twisted and stuff which i like a lot. the acting is really good and sienna miller is totally smokin' and plays this really sweet girl. i think she should do more roles like this. james plays a jerk but you end up liking him and the end of the movie is really good. david carradine plays a cowboy and he is good. i gave this movie a 10 because i came out of the movie really liking it and wanting to see it again which i didn't expect and my girlfriend really liked it and cried. good date flick

i saw this movie at a screener and its the best movie i have seen in a loooong time. i loved it!!!! james franco is sooo hot and him and sienna miller make the perfect couple. i don't want to give away what happens but they play a pair of newlyweds who go off on their honeymoon to niagara falls and some pretty wild stuff happens along the way....the movie is really really funny and sad and original. i can't even say what it reminded me of, but go see it! i cried so hard but really loved it and wanna see it again as soon as it comes out! my friends cried too. i hope it comes out soon - does anyone know when? i would really go see it if i were you

i loved it. others have revealed spoilers, but i won't. it was an unusual premise, actually sort of weird, but i went along with it completely. camille was a difficult part to pull off convincingly; maybe that's why some people hated it. but i think sienna was excellent and her acting skills enabled her to nail the part perfectly - without being maudlin or ridiculous. i don't know why she was even interested in a loser like james franco, but married him anyway. i like him as an actor and also thought he did a terrific job. he has nothing to be ashamed of. there have been movies with with similar setups e.g. "ghost". i simply love sienna miller and went along with the situation as written in the script. i feel her great acting talent is vastly underrated, and hope it becomes more recognized by the public. i thought all of the actors played their parts very well, and hope more people get to see the movie. i highly recommend it. i was surprised that my local block buster store had about 10 copies available. i definitely plan to buy it.

an unusual movie, which starts off with the classic premise of a hooligan who marries a girl who loves him in order to escape the country. but a twist soon turns the tale upside down. most of the film hits the right buttons: the story develops smoothly, acting is solid (sienna miller's drawl is priceless, she really can act!), chemistry between both leads works, and rolling american rural scapes and quirky side characters really make for a good time. the mood, which starts off as light and romantic soon moves into something darker and downright eery at times.at times though the pace slows just a tad more than we would like, but don't let this stop you watching this unusual little cinematic treat. alexandre montin, paris

as most people i am tired of the by the numbers clichéd movies that hollywood makes. there seems to be no creativity in hollywood. companies only want to spend money on remakes are sequels that have an audience built in.this movie is a welcome change. it could be classified as romantic comedy for it's genre but don't let that turn you off this movie. this is a very original movie which is not like most things hollywood produces.if you are reading this, you already know the basic plot so i will not bother going over that. the only movies that come to mind to compare this to are "interstate 60" and "art of travel" which are little known gems that take a different path than most of the hollywood garbage.this is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching more of the same.dean

super original. really great movie! james franco and sienna miller really do go so well together on screen. i sure hope it comes out soon. i first saw this movie at a screening. because of my age and gender, i was asked to stay for a "talk." we all got to comment on the movie and a lot of people didn't seem to like it. i really loved it and i don't know why so many people didn't think it was that good. go see it when it comes out and decide for yourself! one thing that you might want to do if you are going to see this movie is to go into it not knowing anything about it. i had not known anything when i went to the screening other than, it was called, "camile." it really is worth seeing.

i'm not a fan of scratching, but i really dug this movie. it gave me a real insight into a world i never had a clue existed; and what else is a documentary for? funny, clever, hip - just like pray's previous film, hype! about the grunge music scene.

-that's pretty much the whole soundtrack to this film. i just saw this baby at the munich film festival and it rocked the house. director doug pray is never seen in this documentary, nor i think he is even heard, but he has done a very intimate look into the lives and history of the "mixer." he has segmented his film into about eight chapters and then his motley group of enthusiastic interviews will be spiced throughout according to what they are talking about. i was never big into "scratching" but the film does a wonderful job of keeping elementary for those who know little, and infusing in-jokes for those who are experts themselves in this area. mix master mike from the beastie boys is in this film, but it wasn't until after the film that i could name several heavy hitters in the industry (dj shadow, q- bert, etc). the extreme fascination for turntables by these talented and quirky djs is evident in their explanations of what their music means to them. the film also sheds some gratifying light on these guys (and one woman) to be classified as musicians. pray doesn't let his film idle and if there exists a slow scene it is soon re-energized by hardly ever ceasing music. if nothing else, this film will increase your slang vocabulary. i have to get back to "digging", so i'll end this review. see it, it will be of interest. good stuff man. good stuff.

okay, i think we're all agreed that michael jackson was the low point.and the special effects too. but, please, keep in mind that this was not a big-budget film, okay? not every film gets as much of a budget as harry potter or star wars.however, i thought it was pretty funny altogether. b-? nothing that would, in my opinion, waste your time.parodies are always fun to watch, and just because it wasn't big budget doesn't mean it's bad.i think this was a good movie, if weak at some points.hope this comment helps. ~angela

if you like silly comedies like airplane you'll love this movie! it's definitely in the style of airplane and scary movie. a fun film! it has the strangest cast of characters all in the same movie. michael jackson, evan marriott, joyce giraurd, stuart pankin, charlie schlater and eric roberts. the special effects are hokey, but i think they're supposed to be since it's a silly comedy. there is apparently two versions of the film, one at blockbuster and one on the official website: misscastaway.com. the one on the website appears to be a preview release version signed by the director. there's some fun behind the scenes material filmed at neverland with michael jackson as well. the movie was filmed in 2003 and says it's pg rated fun on the box.

i don't understand why this movie has such a low rating. it totally deserves more! sure, it's completely ridiculous, but that's what it was supposed to be. don't expect cinematic transcendence from a movie about beauty pageant contestants stranded on a caribbean island! what you should expect is a huge spoof of pretty much every relevant sci-fi, fantasy and block-buster movie in cinematic history, and even references to other spoofers. all completely exaggerated and sometimes totally unnecessary, but that's exactly what makes this movie stand out. if you like parodies, and enjoy say, leslie nielsen or mike myers, you're gonna love this. i sure did!

actually, i have more a question, than a comment. i loved z-boys, and the lords of dogtown. saw lords first, then the doc, and while i loved the story, i am curious as to why in the movie, sid was an important character, but in the documentary, he wasn't part of the team, and only merely mentioned as just some kid they knew. does anyone know the story on that? the story of these boys was amazing. i never experienced the skateboarding craze where i grew up, but my kids have enjoyed it. what i have seen in local skate parks is what these boys had invented. i never knew that. when the film showed the competition, and z-boys did their thing, they put to shame the others in competition.

right there. good, entertaining and accurate era-feel to most scenes. enough personality variations to cover the real people around those days without story distractions from the exceptions. the credits show peralta from mar vista, california.. up the hill from venice and south of malibu. i lived there in the heartbreak hotel days, pre-beachboys, next to that surfer kid bob cooper up on wasatch avenue, where the alley was used to burn surfboards that didn't work. old skatekey skatewheels were used on plywood cutouts to roll down sidewalk waves. things were different in each succeeding decade as the cool innocence of the fifties broke into the warmth of the sun whitewater freedom and exhilaration of the electric sixties and then into the assertively innovative playtime and inventive evolutionary madness of the weird seventies. the movie gives you a piece of that kind of magic moment in time; in a place where the imaginary wave was real.. the source of culturally significant influences. and btw, there's another movie that has a similarly american street edginess to it, and has the same genuinely unique goodness with laid back realness that helps refine that elusively eternal sense of cool.. "two lane blacktop" (with one of the best examples of freesouldoit attitude in west coast california history.. dennis wilson). like monte hellman did with that one, thanks, sp, for being right there with this one. gwr

i hate films about sports. i guess the pre-fabricated hollywood sports film is a bit tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year, what i am trying to say is that there isn't much creativity in this genre. use exhibit "a"  "the game plan" as evidence of this if you want. so, needless to say, i was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element, but at the same time i couldn't wait because i love surfing documentaries like "step into liquid" and "billabong odyssey". i took a step, i plunged into the unknown, and to be honest, at first i wasn't happy. i didn't like the direction, the people, or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs. with my first viewing, i thought that history couldn't be fully recorded, so i thought stacy peralta was splicing stock footage with faux-actors acting like they were from the late 70s. the music was intense, it matched well peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment, but the visuals were anything but stimulating. the elongated scenes, while using amazing music to support, just seemed flushed and too long for my attention. i wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool. i wanted a combination of who these kids were, where they went during their rise of fame, and where they are now. it felt like i was watching the birth of our nation with a great score to the settlers just rowing their boats all day. i wanted to know the men behind the myths.then, with a thought that i would have another negative review under my belt, i watched the film again with peralta's audio commentary. his passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished "wow-ed" me. this suddenly transformed into the film i wanted to see. peralta lets us know more of where these kids are today, what they are still doing, and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera. he hadn't seen many of them in 20+ years, so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface. he was sincere; he was sympathetic, yet he showed so much dedication to this project. while i do not agree with everything that he chose to do (i.e. the sean penn mess up is not punk rock), he revitalized this film for me. it was due to this commentary that i rate this film much higher than originally thought.jay adams. tony alva. jeff ho. peggy oki. wentzle ruml. these are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned, and continually praised, if skateboarding is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees. while tony hawk's name sells products, it is these guys, these mild-mannered pavement slackers that redefined an entire sport. sure, others were probably doing it in the stone ages, but these guys did it with style, grace, and moved it to the next level. this was a hobby for them, but it also propelled them in a direction i believe none of them were ready for. "dogtown and z-boys" is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted, and about friendship. we have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity, and this is definitely a story that should be added to that. i cannot say that i loved this film, nor will i, but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend. it was sad, it was emotional, and these guys aren't multi-millionaires over again  they are people with a passion, and very rarely do you see that in documentaries.overall, i cannot watch this film again, but i will suggest it to friends and family time after time. i think the downfall for this film, to me, was the filming  the attempts to be avant-garde with the style, which ultimately drew away from the characters and events. as mentioned before, there were some elements that dragged on too much, which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now. peralta obviously had a passion for this sport, for the people, but he seemed out-of-focus at times. the music was intense, and worked perfectly with the film. sean penn, while he was decent with his voice-over, wasn't needed at all. they could have spent the money elsewhere. on the positive, the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing. peralta's voice, instead of penn's, brings a stronger human element to the scene, while he tells us better stories of the people, places, and events. watch this film, but don't expect to be blown away. listen to the audio commentary; i think you will be impressed.grade: *** ½ out of *****

my son, an avid skateboarder, sat me down and made me watch this with him. as i love documentaries, it didn't take a whole lot of pressure on his part. the whole amazing story of it all - a bunch of dirt-poor kids drift together and end up creating something revolutionary out of thin air - well, more out of some wood, wheels and lack of waves to surf - it just floored me. it still does. i didn't think i would enjoy it the way i did, nor did i think i would tear up watching stacey peralta tear up over the fate of jay adams. and just watching jay adams himself.....the sheer genius of the kid skating and the shrug of the adult remembering. i watched it again last night for what has to be the 10th time and i still get goosebumps watching him fly down the hill with jimi hendrix's "freedom" playing in the background. and i teared up, again. not too many movies have the same impact with me after several viewings. brilliant.

dogtown and z-boys is a documentary about the zephyr skateboarding team, and their influence on skateboarding. it also focuses on the history of skateboarding. it was directed by stacy peralta, a member of the original zephyr team, and was written by stacy peralta and craig stecyk, another member of the team. the documentary stars the members of the zephyr team and is narrated by sean penn.the documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding, and how it evolved from surfing. it discusses skateboarding's popularity in the late 60s and the 70s, its decline in the 80s and its 'rebirth' in the 90s. skateboarding was introduced in dogtown, the nickname of the poor side of santa monica, california. the zephyr team originated from the zephyr surf shop, which manufactured the first modern skateboards. the documentary mainly consists of the original zephyr team members talking about the past in the zephyr team, the competitions they won, and their popularity and prestige. it focuses on three particular members of the team; peralta, tony alva, and jay adams, three virtuosos of skateboarding, and probably the best three members of the team.the interviews in the documentary were usually voices over archival footage from dogtown in the late 60s and 70s. very rarely to you actually see the people being interviewed, but when you do, they are shown in black and white, while the archival footage was in colour. i think stacy peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past (i.e. the glory days of the zephyr team) and not the present. the documentary is very fast paced, in that we often see clips of impressive skateboarding over up-beat music of the era (such as jimi hendrix, led zeppelin and david bowie), and the interviews tend to be quick and to the point. knowing nothing about skateboarding (i.e. not even knowing how to ride one straight along the ground) i was very surprised that i found this documentary so interesting. the reason is that this doco was more about the zephyr team than the actual sport of skateboarding, so while i couldn't relate to skateboarding, i could relate to the boys in the team. because it was made by actual members of the team, it gives it a little more depth and authenticity.all in all, i would have to say this is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen. it gave me a whole new insight, not just into the zephyr team, but into skateboarding as a whole. for those who love skateboarding, i can only imagine how it must be even more interesting. seven and a half stars out of ten.

dogtown and z-boyssummary: dogtown and z-boys is a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers that changed the world of surfing and skateboarding in venice (dogtown), california as we know it today. with their low pivotal style, they embarked on a larry bertlemen influenced journey that would lead to countless successes and a couple failures. after the dogtown articles were featured in a reinstated skateboarder magazine, the sport was revamped and the members of the zephyr skateboard team forgot about jeff ho, and looked to be on summer vacation for the rest of their lives by joining other skateboard teams that could afford to pay them like movie stars. the original zephyr skateboard team put together by jeff ho (zephyr surfshop owner) and craig stecyk (photographer) included jay adams, tony alva, stacy peralta, bob biniak, chris cahill, shogo kubo, paul constantineau, jim muir, peggy oki (the only female), nathan pratt, wentzle ruml iv, allen sarlo, and david ray perry. all of the original members except jay adams and chris cahill are still well and surfing/skating. jay adams, at the time of the documentary, was serving time on drug related charges. chris cahill, at the time of the documentary, was last seen in mexico.themes: the themes of this documentary are kind of read-between-the-lines, but if there were a clear-cut theme it would be that even kids can spark revolutions. other themes would include extensive partying in one's past may lead to an unfulfilling future, and by planning and being careful with one's assets a very rewarding future could be at hand.other works: stacy peralta (writer and director) has a fairly wide range of documentaries that he has either written, produced, or directed. most with a common theme of surfing or skateboarding, such as riding giants, sk8 tv, the bones brigrades, and lords of dogtown. he has also done films with a theme of growing up in america as a teenager, films such as: influences: from yesterday to today, crips and bloods: made in america, and the 70s: the decade that changed television.subjects: the subjects of dogtown and z-boys are the original members of the zephyr skateboard team excluding chris cahill. peralta included jeff ho and craig stecyk in the interviews. other subjects were people who grew up during the 70s reading the dogtown articles as well as skateboard enthusiasts. skaters from the dogtown area, but not on the team were interviewed.editing: the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion. there were scenes of the subjects talking so that the audience could see who was speaking and get a sense of the character, but would immediately cutaway to archival footage that would explain what the speaker was saying. when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song old man by neil young was played, which evokes many emotions. sean penn was the narrator for the film and he explained the transitions throughout the film. the film was presented chronologically from the time the zephyr surf team was put together, to creating the skateboard team, to all of the z-boys leaving the team to join other skate companies or create their own company. cinematography: the film was shot in an interesting way. the film of the subjects speaking were all in black and white and all of the archival footage of the z-boys surfing or skating were in color. of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film. the interviewees were mostly shot in the same area it appears, but all were outside. all of the footage was very well-controlled even the archival footage which i found very surprising. music: "seasons of wither"-performed by aerosmith "toys in the attic"-performed by aerosmith "generation landslide"- alice cooper "one way out"- performed by the allman brothers "lollipops and roses" and "whipped cream"-performed by herb alpert "into the void" and "paranoid"- performed by black sabbath "godzilla"- blue oyster cult "aladdin sane" and "rebel rebel"- david bowie "fastcars"- the buzzcocks "gut feeling"- devo "i'll give you money"- peter frampton "funk 49"- james gang "ezy rider" and "foxy lady" and "freedom" and "bold as love"- jimi hendrix "sidewalk surfing"- jan and dean "achilles last stand" and "hot on for nowhere"- led zeppelin "six underground"- the sneaker pimps "surfrider"- the lively ones "cat scratch fever" and "motor city madhouse" and "wang dang sweet poontang- ted nugent "us and them"- pink floyd "bad boys"- the pretenders "maggie may"- rod stewart "i wanna be your dog" and "gimme danger"- the stooges "children of the revolution"- t-rex "bad reputation"- thin lizzy "disco inferno"- the tramps "hannah"- rob trower "rocky mountain way"- joe walsh "old man"- neil young "la grange"- zz topthe music in the film make the movie. every one of these songs contributes to what the subjects are saying and evoke emotions that would not have been called to mind otherwise.

a dozen bored surfers, mostly kids in venice, california, not only reinvent the skateboard but remake a once-forgotten-about suburban fad from the 1950s into an action sports revolution.narrarated by sean penn, dogtown depicts life in the more rundown "locals only" beach communities circa 1974, which consisted of mostly of surfing in the early morning tides and loitering. the zephyr team (or z-boys as they are called) spend one summer combating the boredom by building their own boards with the help of a local who owns a surf shop. after they enter re-emerging skateboarding competitions in socal, they transfigure it all into their own scene; one that rouses a generation of skateboarders consisting of greats like tony hawk, shaun white and the creators of the of x-games.dogtown puts chronological perspective into skateboarding, and the up-from-the-bootstraps history you never knew it had.from andy frye at mysportscomplex.blogspot.com

take a subject i didn't know much about and make it exciting, why don't you? it so happens that back about 1979, director robert altman said that he didn't believe he had ever made a real movie and that he expected that one of these kids riding skateboards--if he doesn't break his neck--will make the first movie. well, i wouldn't put such an expectation on stacy peralta, but he is a skateboarder who has made a good movie. of course, he was forced by the nature of the film he was making to use existing footage, and it is certainly a good thing that so much archival footage existed. peralta edited it together well with not-your-usual talking head shots of his erstwhile colleagues as they are today. the whole effect is post-modern in the best sense, but that has been done. altman's prediction hasn't quite come true. what peralta has done, however, is capture enough of the energy of those heady days that we can appreciate what it must have been like when modern skateboarding was invented by the z-boys. this is all good. i highly recommend "dogtown."

excellent piece of work!i am not a surfer nor a skate board fan, but work this good about sorting sock drawers would have been riveting. a must see!there is a lot to enjoy here. excellent visuals. great sound track mix. huge body of documentary work both pictures and film.the life work and love of the subject is captivating.

solid documentary about edgey kids who first surf then skate in the face of the american dream. sadly some of the youngest and most gifted succumb to the lure of drugs while others become slaves to the crass marketing of their go for broke instincts. few come out on top. but the die is cast and fruit of it all is the new national pastime, skateboarding (the new york times notes that "it was once considered a snub to authority. now, however, skateboarding has its own summer camps, video games, magazines [actually it always had these] and corporate sponsors.") commercialism co-opts another kid birthed cultural node.

in the groovy mid 70's a scruffy bunch of brash young venice, california adolescents from broken homes and the bad side of town known as the z-boys turned the previously staid world of professional skateboarding on its ear with their fierce punk attitude, radical unconventional riding style, and unbridled spirit of pure in-your-face aggression, revolutionizing the sport in the process and paving the way for the many extreme variations on sports that popped up in their influential wake. director stacy peralta, who's one of the legendary z-boys himself, relates the incredible exploits of this amazing ragtag crew in a ferociously punchy and visceral manner that's both informative and wildly entertaining: the snappy rapid-fire editing, ceaseless speedy pace, and raw, gritty photography deliver one hell of an infectiously kinetic buzz, projecting a sense of sheer joy and full-on bustling energy that's a total pleasure to behold. better still, this documentary neither sanitizes nor romanticizes its subjects: these rough'n'scrappy lads were so fiercely competitive and out for themselves that they all went their separate ways when the lure of fame and fortune manifested in their lives. the ultimate fates of certain guys is poignant and heartbreaking, with gifted and spontaneous ace skateboard rat jay adams rating as the saddest and most tragic: he blew his chance at the big time and wound up doing time in jail. the other dudes are very colorful and personable as well; charismatic ball of cocky and defiant fire tony alva in particular comes across as one arrogant, yet impressive piece of furiously assertive work. marvelously narrated with delightfully easy'n'breezy nasal nonchalance by sean penn. the terrific rock soundtrack likewise seriously smokes. but what really makes this documentary such a winner is its refreshing complete dearth of pretense: it's every bit as dynamic, exuberant and larger-than-life extraordinary as the gloriously outrageous z-boys themselves.

this film to me deserves a lot of praise, because even though i am not a surfer or skater, i remained inspired throughout the whole documentary.the depth of history and development of these two extreme sports emphasised what they were able to do for two groups of individuals. the dedication that these individuals had/have is truly inspiring and it was because of them that others can now enjoy and do what these guys founded.unlike most other documentaries, this one was cleverly put together, the amount of footage that was recorded and survived throughout the decades is outstanding and it was because of this that some of the greatest editing i have ever seen was put together and resulted in the subject remaining focused. without the urge for them to retort to recent footage of the more famous surfers and skaters that remains popular today.the film explores areas such as the success, such accomplishing new tricks, winning competitions and gathering fame. as well as failures such as injury or burning out.it was also fulfilling to hear the experiences come from the skaters and surfers themselves and not from second hand information. this resulted in a better picture to be drawn.overall, a truly outstanding effort.

i saw this movie on the lowlands festival (23, 24, 25th of august) after a friend of mine said this is a very cool movie about the history of skating. i didn't now what to expect from this movie. was it recorded by a couple of skaters who thought they could do a couple of cool tricks, or was it a documentary about skating.so i went in, after waiting for about an hour, whit out any expectations.this movie is really a nice piece of work about the beginning of skateboarding. it started with the zephyr team, who where a fine group of surfers. this is taking place in a not so nice area to live in. at a certain point the waves are not so good any more to surf on. so they try something else. skateboarding was a fact. if you were a part of the zephyr team in that time, you where one of the cool guys/girls. because a lot of people saw an escape from the place they were living in with the zephyr team. so they were trying all there new tricks now on a skateboard. in no time skateboarding was popular again. there were a couple of competitions and one national competition. the zephyr team was taking part on several competition and also the national one. but what they were doing on there skateboards was unbelievable. but the jury didn't now how to judge them. so they put the whole skateboarding world on it's head.anyway i can tell you the rest of the film/documentary, but you must see this one with you're own eyes. because then you can feel the vibe of this movie. this movie got a lot of style for me, so i rewarded it with a 8.greetings from gijs and the rest of holland. see you.

this film moved me at age 39 in the same way that all the footage and coverage of dogtown affected me when i was 13. for all of those who criticized the self promotion of the z boys interviewed, they have the last laugh on you. that was their whole deal, "we're better than all of you and here's why....(insert footage of the smoothest pool carve imaginable)" this was a film to tell their story and that was their story whether you like it or not. it was their opinion of their skating that mattered..... not yours or mine. i thought the film captured their attitude and influence exactly as i remembered it in the 70's. the reality is that they did revolutionize skateboarding, they were the impetus behind extreme sports and they did inject a cultural paradigm that reached into every corner of americana. this movie gave rebirth to images of bertleman on a wave and alva and jay adams ripping up the coping that was the california dream to an entire culture of young american teenagers that just wanted to have fun and get rad! as i watched this film i realized that it was these images that i lived with every day until i was old enough to move out and back down to so cal after my family had moved to nor cal when i was five. until i could get back, my buddies and i built and thrashed ramp after ramp, searched for every empty pool possible and mimicked everything stecyk covered about these guys. we are all educated and have family's and careers now but this film reminds me who i was at that age and why i still surf. this is an inspired film that anyone who has an interest in pop culture, extreme sports, the 70's or even just good documentary film making will enjoy completely. whenever it comes on cable i can't change the channel. kudos to stacy peralta for making a beautiful piece of art!

i remember when skateboarding had it's rebirth in the 70s. i begged my parents for money to by a second-hand skateboard from a friend. it was a piece of junk, complete with clay wheels and everything. i also remember reading skateboarder magazine and being both completely impressed and totally terrified of the dogtown crew. skating never became a way of life for me, but in some ways it has always been a part of my life, whether it is using a board for transportation or just having a bunch of friends that skate.this film is a brilliant documentary of the real birth of modern day skating. watching this crew turn skating from the flat boring hobby it was into the vertical lifestyle it has become had me sitting slack-jawed for 90 minutes. it's amazing that enough footage from this period still exists to have created this film, and thank god for that. the footage is brilliant. it gave me the feeling of watching an old buster keaton film: i've seen some of the tricks keaton did repeated countless times in other films since then, but when you go back and see the first person to perform that trick it's amazing that, not only were they the first person to try it successfully, but that they lived through it and made it seem effortless. that's the feeling this film gave me. yeah, i've seen people skate pools before, but to watch the first people skating pools and inventing the tricks that eventually became the basics of modern skating is like watching the facade of the house fall on keaton, leaving him standing safely in the frame of a window. it's absolutely brilliant to watch something that, up until that point, had never been tried before, but since, has been tried by almost everyone.this film is beautiful to watch and incredible to listen to. the soundtrack is one of the best i've ever heard in a film. this is a film that will appeal to people whether they like skating or not. i've talked to a couple of friends of mine who made their girlfriends sit through this film after heavy protest, and they all said that their girlfriends were mesmerized by the end of the film and loved it as much as they did. as for the previous comments on this board that complain about the film being too self congratulatory, i think that's an unfair disparagement. i liked seeing these guys get excited about their past. they created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever. they have the right to pat themselves on the back. they were stars for doing what they loved to do. most of these guys/girls never achieved the staggering success tony hawk enjoys today, but that kind of success wasn't available to skaters then. sure, they had some success, but more importantly, they have been able to live a life doing what they love to do, and, as we see in the end, almost all of them still surf, skate or work in the surf/skate industry. how many of us can say that we have been able to live our lives and have been successful by breaking all the rules and doing what we love to do? they can. my hat's off to the dogtown and z-boys for being themselves and changing the world of skateboarding forever.

this is one of the greatest documentaries i've ever seen along with "dark days". i have skated for maybe an hour my entire life, and i still love this movie. peralta and his excellent editor captured the feeling and atmosphere perfectly, helped in part with some incredible archival footage. tony alva is one of the coolest individuals in existence. love those knee high striped sport socks, you rock tony!not only is this movie a visual feast, but the soundtrack has to be one of the best in history, if you're into 70's rock. buy the dvd, you won't regret it.

i have seen this movie twice now on cable. the first time i saw it, it caught me by suprise. the skaters i was seeing were the guys we followed in the pages of skateboarder magazine back in the late 70's. these were the guys we copied and tried to become while skating. i am glad that a film was finally made that gives an accurate account of how it all came to be. i am almost 40 years old now and i guess a pretty uptight kind of guy with all of life's problems, however; this film did a great job of taking me back. back to the vacant pools, the backyard halfpipes and the road trips to cherry hill nj. i suspect that in order to really understand this movie and appreciate it, you had to live it. otherwise, it probably won't have the impact on you as it did me. but for those of you (and you know who you are), who did live it, you know exactly what i am talking about! in any event, i don't care who you are, if you get a chance to see this movie...do it! i give thanks to the z-boys of dogtown for the memories of my youth and thanks to stacy for making this movie! job well done!

let me say first of all that i spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard before i realized i was totally uncoordinated. i've always thought it was cool watching cats that know how to get extreme on 'em do their stuff, but i've never been a skateboarder and have never really followed the sport. that being said, i thought this was a very informative and interesting documentary. some reviewers have said that these dudes were sort of waving their own flag a bit, but what the hell? it looks to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as anyone for giving the skateboarding world a jolt and they've provided some good footage of their innovations to back it up. it's great the way viewers are allowed to see these guys both then and now and the footage they shot while they were teens growing up in california provides some interesting nostalgia that goes a bit beyond the sport of skating. i never would have realized where extreme skating came from, but this films sort of ties all the pieces together and gives us an informative documentary. i'm sure it's at least a tad biased, but aren't all documentaries? worth watching for anyone interested in the sport or, as in my case, anyone who grew up in the 1970's.

this documentary traces the origins and life of the zephyr skateboard team, using original film shot in the 1970s (mostly by craig stecyk) combined with interviews of the team members and other influential people today.the first part of the film documents how the "dogtown" section of venice, ca came to be, starting back around the turn of the century when the town was created to be a venice, italy-like european city. by the 1970's, the one remaining local attraction, the pacific ocean park, had been abandoned, leaving a beach with lots of exposed piers and other hazards. the poor kids living in the area had nothing better to do than surf, and they excelled despite (or perhaps because of) their surroundings. because the waves dissipated in the afternoon, they took up skateboarding to fill their time, and the empty swimming pools caused by the drought during those years plus their surfing backgrounds led them to create the vertical skateboarding style that is mainstream today. i found that the film covered much more about surfing than i expected, which seemed like a bonus since i really didn't know much about surfing or skateboarding before i watched the film. the soundtrack, not surprisingly, was good as well. i also liked how these kids were just following their passion and generally ended up better off for the experience. the parts that didn't work so well for me were the drama that they tried to create, which seemed somewhat forced, and the team's somewhat overinflated sense of self-importance (although this is probably just left-over street attitude from where they grew up). this is not to say that they didn't have significant influence, but only that it seems extremely likely that there were other factors as well. one note: my wife is more affected than most to nausea when films use what we refer to as "spasticam" (wiggling camera movements). this film is often guilty, so if you are so afflicted, be warned. i would recommend this film to anyone, but especially to anyone with skateboarding and/or surfing in their history.seen on 5/11/2002.

back in the day, i was one of the rn's in the emergency rooms, these skaters would occasionally land in. they were not treated well, and some of it was brought on by their asocial personalities- but we all knew they were a talented bunch of "wonderkids" even then. they deserved better care than they received, i'm afraid. they had "attitude" in spades.i'm so glad i caught this documentary on ifc tonight- it will be on again at 1 am and i'll be watching again!little attention was given to them until the rich dying kid was able to talk his parents into draining the pool- and the film really highlights that as the taking off point....it was an amazing time, and deserved to be recorded. stacy peralta is due all the praise heaped on him, and long may those z-boys enjoy their memories and contribution to the real sport of skateboarding. as for the few "sour grape" reviews contained herein, there always were and there always will be "wannabees" and hangers-on who never do more than dream...the z-boys lived it, breathed it, were it.nice to see the vintage films and even the lone girl, "peggy" who was so talked about as being the only female to win their respect.thanks to ifc i get to really take the occasional drug-free head trip of my youth and relive the heart pounding excitement again.

if you have ever been, has a friend, or a kid that is or was into skating at one time, then watch this flick!. i have seen it several times and i get something new out of it every time that i see it. it reminded me of why i got into skating in the first place (a long time ago) . it reminded me of what skating brings to a person and i have found will also help a person who doesn't understand why skaters, well, skate. sure there is a very dark side to the whole seen, which the movie does touch on slightly. but it tends to focus more on what is at the core of skating. just a person on a board, doing it because they love to do it. this movie was so inspirational to me that i'm now skating once again (i'm 32) and i haven't been this happy with my self in years.. give this one a go, you will not be disappointed.

being in the suburbs of new york when the z-boys were creating history in dogtown, i was only exposed to a glimpse of what was going on. i had a p-o-s black knight skateboard with clay wheels. it is long gone, and on the ash heap of my personal life. but i never forgot. it's like watching long-lost brothers and friends, and it hits me right where i live. i cannot watch this film enough. every time i view it, some other aspect rises to the top, some other viewpoint come into sharp focus. the vintage footage, the incredible stills, the current personalities intermeshed with the vivid shadows of the brightly lit past, the heartfelt and not over-done narrative, all beautifully edited together in such a way as to make a landmark documentary of a genuine slice of american history. in the words of glen friedman - "it was f-ing unbelievable."

my skateboarding career ended in 1974 when my two-by-four skateboard with steel roller-skate wheels hit a rock and i tumbled, for days it seemed, down the sidewalk outside my parent's house in boston. by the time the cast came off my arm, summer was gone.but i have always admired the x-games types and surfers especially. i think i spent the first month after i moved to southern california on the beaches and piers watching the surfers, bemoaning that fact that i had missed my calling. it's the sort of thing you should learn young, before the horrible senses of self-preservation and self-awareness burrow in. or else at best, you'll be so worried about not getting hurt or laughed at, you'll wind up looking like a trained bear.i always admired how a good surfer seems to not care about anything but that moment, that wave, that experience. at one with the forces of nature. a good surfer makes it look like there is nothing else but that wave right there, and the way you interact with it. there's a lot of zen in it to me.this documentary outlines how a few young folks took the surfing concepts and extended them to skateboarding. ramps, downgrades, low sweeping curves while interacting with the cement waves beneath their feet. in their day and time, this was all new. radical. prior to the zephyr skate team the idea apparently was to go as fast as you could in a straight line on a skateboard, hence my long "evel knievel at caesers palace" like tumble down the front walk.this film is a look back through time, to an america before everything was labeled, tagged, marketed, and jam-forced down our throats as "extreme". (seriously, what's so "extreme" about an "extreme value meal" at taco bell? other than the fact that it is an extreme hazard to your colon...) watch this film and watch the birth of 'extreme sports'. before there was an x-games, before boom-boom huck-jam, before crusty demons, before the asa...there were these young street urchins who created 'extreme sports' without really trying. they were just doing it for the purity, the pure pleasure, of skateboarding in the sun with friends. i hope they get a cut of the 'extreme' money out there. goodness knows they don't get the credit they deserve. maybe this film can correct that.excellent film with a great soundtrack, a portrait of a southern california, indeed an america, that no longer exists.i don't care for sean penn but he does a decent job narrating.

anyone looking to learn more about the development of skateboarding should find dogtown and z-boys adequate research material. this is not to be confused with lords of dogtown, that sorry hollywood attempt to cash in on the success of the original dogtown revival. directed by stacey peralta, a former z-boys himself as well as pro skater and mastermind behind the 80s bones brigade, and co-written with skateboarding photojournalist craig stecyk, this documentary traces how a group of surfing kids from southern california's mean streets (known as dogtown) who formed the z-boys skateboard team (actually there was one girl--peggy oki) revolutionized skateboarding. the film contains interviews from nearly all of the z-boys (chris cahill's whereabouts are unknown) with the most noteable being bad ass tony alva and the youngest, jay adams, who's talents (along with perlata) seemed to transcend the rest of the teams. there are interviews of the team's (and the dogtown shop) founders, surfboard designer jeff ho, skip engbloom, and craig stecyk. there are also interviews of folks like tony hawk (obviously), ian mckaye (fugazi), and henry rollins, who were young kids in the 70s when dogtown was making it's influence on skateboarding (skateboarding was a whole other context in previous years as the documentary explains). it really shows you not only who the dogtown team was and how they formed, but why their style changed not only skateboarding tricks (pool skating became immensley popular, and thus gave way to vert skating), but also facilitated the sport (though not into the extreme commercialism it is today) as more than just the fleeting fad it had been earlier as these surfing kids who's waves ran out in the early morning needed ways to spend their time and eventually got into skateboarding. the days of russ howell and alan gelfand were long over as the dogtown, at least through the publicity of their skate team, paved the way for the new generation of skaters. because dogtown got all the attention, they were able to push skating to the next step.it's a great documentary in the way that it is put together, though stacey peralta always knew how to do this even when producing the bones brigade mini movies/skate demos like "ban this" and "search for animal chin." narrated by sean penn, the film is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, contains lots of terrific archive footage, and lots of interview to give you a genuine feel of who the z-boys were and how they made their mark on skateboarding.

after watching ingmar bergman's skammen, i had many feelings, but most notably, i felt unsatisfied. i have heard so much hype about this movie but i came to find it lacking. don't get me wrong, i can fully appreciate the artistic value of such a film, but as far as depth and emotion, i was not so impressed. i found the characters to be disagreeable and unrealistic, which detracted from the dramatic effect. in addition, the fact that the war was fake led me to feel that the emotion was not real. dramatic war movies, in my opinion, are much more effective if the events (not necessarily the story itself) really happened. i find that of all the movies that try to show the brutality this one falls in the middle as far as effectiveness.

oh, it's an excellent piece of work, to be sure. in fact, several of the best scenes in cinema, or at least in bergman's cinema, are to be found in this film. liv ullmann and max von sydow are as good as you would expect. do these two give bad performances? sven nykvist delivers some masterful, although unconventionally masterful, cinematography. the script is quite good, especially in individual scenes. sometimes the film lags, and the pace is uneven, though probably intentionally. so what's the problem? well, the film is too bleak for its own good. other bergman films are similarly bleak, but nowhere near this harsh. eventually, i just gave up and i started to become a little irritated. i was greatly affected often during the film, but, by the end, i felt uninvolved. it's a great film, but i doubt i'd ever watch it again, nor suggest it to friends. or, if i did suggest it, i'd be very sure to warn them of what's ahead. 8/10.

it came as no surprise to me that this was a very depressing and draining movie. after all, it's all about the impact of war on civilians and it's by the "king of depression", ingmar bergman. in other words, so many of bergman's works delve deep into human misery and angst and so this movie seems not so extraordinary coming from this director.even though it is more difficult to watch, the last half of the movie offers perhaps more insight into the lower depths of humanity. that's because initially, the main characters (liv ullman and max von sydow) try to overcome adversity and are basically decent (though a bit stupid) people. however, as deprivation after deprivation occurs, they (especially von sydow) become less and less humane and more animalistic--doing anything in order to survive.fun to watch, no freaking way! but, an interesting insight into human nature.ps--1 thing i loved about this film is that it avoided a stupid movie chiche. when the couple sat down with the shopkeeper to drink a glass or wine, they finished the wine completely! in most movies, they barely touch their drinks or leave them untouched. it drives me crazy, as i would never leave a $4 alcoholic beverage without drinking it unless it tasted terrible or had a bug floating in it! bravo!

shame, is a swedish film in swedish with english subtitles. the film is about a husband and wife named jan, and eva. they live on an island working as farmers. there is a war going on and soldiers start attacking people on the island. once the war subsides a little jan, and eva are arrested as going along with the opposite side. once released even more trouble ensues and the film shows how two ordinary people will act in a situation of war and life or death. winner of the cec award for best foreign film at the cinema writers circle awards, the guldbagge award for best actress (liv ullman, who plays eva) at the guldbagge awards, the nbr award for best foreign language film and best actress at the national board of review and the nsfc award for best actress, best director (ingmar bergman) and best film at the national society of film critics awards. shame, has good direction, a good script, good performances by both max von sydow (who plays jan) and liv ullman (who plays eva), good cinematography and good production design. shame, is a well acted and well made story of how people in a desperate situation will sometimes do whatever they can do in order to survive. the film has a powerful message and is a good film. the reason i'am not rating this film higher is because it is not a masterpiece like some other ingmar bergman films like wild strawberries, the seventh seal or persona, for example. the film didn't have as big an impact on me as i thought it would and it lacked ingmar bergman's thoughtful and philosophical dialog. while nowhere close to being one of his best films there is still a lot to like about shame, and it is a good movie. i just probably would have liked it more having not seen some of those other bergman masterpieces.

bergman´s tale about how the hell of the war can drive a sensible couple of musicians to the barbarousness. with many memorable scenes throughout the film, i found particularly remarkable that close to the end where ullmann and von sydow go in a boat completely surrounded by corpses of soldiers floating on the sea. a fascinating masterpiece!

wildman head counselor tripper harrison (bill murray in peak nutty form in his first lead role) presides over the various wacky hi-jinks at north star summercamp. tripper befriends sad and lonely misfit kid rudy (a nice and affecting performance by chris makepeace). director ivan reitman relates the amusingly off the wall comic vignettes at a ceaseless snappy pace and maintains an engagingly good-natured tone throughout. this film astutely nails the breezy'n'breezy essence of summer: making friends, first love, pulling pranks, competing in sports with a rival camp, campfire singalongs, and, of course, the inevitable scary urban legend about the escaped psycho killer with the hook hand. the sense of gleefully raucous fun this picture generates is positively infectious. moreover, the humor is always goofy and occasionally gross, but never too nasty or mean-spirited. best of all, there's a winning surplus of pure heart to go along with said humor (the warm relationship between tripper and rudy in particular is genuinely touching). the cast have an obvious ball playing their likable characters: murray's gloriously gonzo and galvanizing presence keeps things constantly humming (his crazy pa announcements are absolutely sidesplitting), plus there are sound contributions from harvey atkin as hapless camp owner morty, kate lynch as tripper's sassy old flame roxanne, russ banham as the amiable crockett, kristine debell as the sweet, foxy a.l., sarah torgov as the feisty candace, jack blum as klutzy bespectacled nerd spaz, keith knight as tubby slob larry finkelstein, cindy girling as the fetching wendy, and matt craven as the hip hardware. donald wilder's cinematography gives the movie an attractive sunny look and makes nifty use of wipes. elmer bernstein's lively and melodic score likewise does the trick. a real riot.

... the reason i like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has. it's a genial summer camp movie, so the jokes aren't mean minded in a lasting way that makes one character the permanent butt of ridicule. pranks do take place, but you get the feeling that the respective fall-guys would be able to look back and laugh, having been dopey enough to fall for them - and without being too cheesy, it's actually kinda nice that everyone still remains friends in the end!it's an extra special bonus when the ringmaster of all these jolly japes is bill murray. for me, he's still looked upon as the comedy god without peer when he gets a chance to cut loose. no one's better at generating a sense of freewheeling wacky anarchy without really hurting anyone. the tone of the entire film has the same style as its leading man, established with a great opening scene showing the murray way of getting ready for the day. everything's silly, yes, but more important than behaving like an adult is to have a whole lot of good-natured fun. "meatballs" promises such and ultimately delivers a nourishing watch.

i just saw this for the first time in 10 or 15 years...maybe close to 20. in some ways, it was better than i remembered...in other, it was much worse.first of all, there's the music. it's just plain awful. there are only 5 songs in the movie, most of them used more than once. the opening song is shrieked by a chorus of annoying children, and the disco-y title track is performed by rick dees. it doesn't get any worse than that. even the background music is terrible, with much of it repeating the themes of the other nauseating tunes. we also get some truly lame slapstick, mostly in the opening credits.on the other hand, bill murray is spot on brilliant as usual...you have to wonder if he ad-libbed the whole thing, or if the writers just gave him all the funny lines. or maybe he's just that great- turning a weak script into comic genius. the best part are his surreal pa announcements. ("lobsters...get out of here...you're a menace!")you also get a lot more character development than you have any right to expect in a movie like this. at least half the characters seem like real people...and mostly real people you would like to have around. even "spaz" gets to do a more than any other eddie deezen-type character ever did, and when he gets the girl, it's plausible. (she's not absurdly hot, but he doesn't automatically pair up with one of the nerd girls- see "revenge of the nerds" for examples of both cinematic phenomenons.)and when the plot seems clichéd...well, ya gotta wonder if it wasn't a cliché yet when they made this. while it wasn't the first summer camp movie- ya gotta go back at least to "the parent trap"- it's certainly the movie that made it it's own genre. in fact, i was surprised that there was no talent show scene..."wet hot american summer" spoofed the summer-camp genre so perfectly, i just assumed everything in it came straight out of meatballs. (i also half-expected jon cryer to pull up in a convertible with a chimp, thanks to "mr. show's" epic camp-olympiad spoof "monk academy") anyway, this one seems to be vanishing a little as far as the late-70's/early 80's comedies- it's not a cable staple anymore, and certainly doesn't have the cult following of caddyshack or animal house. i was pleased to catch it on showtime today- and in high definition at that! sure, it's pretty awful in spots, but you could do a lot worse in a 70's/80's teen comedy. and again, murray is a genius.

yes, it feels, and for the most part plays like an "after school special", for a slightly more adult audience, alright maybe a teen audience. but add in bill murray (already showing some dramatic as well as his usual comedic talent), a nice supporting cast, and an unexpected sweetness about growing up, and remembering those great, or not so great days at summer camp, and you get a heartwarming, funny, sleeper hit.it does get a little too smarmy for its own good, but that is also one of its charms. when you hear the title "meatballs", and see the poster, you expect a teenage sex romp, but what you get is a sentamental, yet sometimes sexy look back at those formative years at summer camp. the sentamentality, and the remberances of simpler times reminds me of "a christmas story", which i also love. the rememberances of summer camp were never so well stated. the only movie i've seen that comes close, is "indian summer", which i like almost as much as "meatballs", and also stars matt craven. let's hope he completes the trilogy. maybe he could come back for "return of the meatballs", and bring some dignity back to the franchise (meatballs 2 through 4 bare no resemblence to the original classic)."meatballs" is easily on my top 10 guilty pleasures of all time (not really guilty either). it's a wonderful little film, that always makes me smile.

camp north star and it's camp counselor extraordinaire, tripper harrison(bill murray)sure would like to end a decades long losing streak to rival camp mohawk, an ivy league type place where only the wealthy kids can attend. meanwhile, we watch as tripper tries his hand at love when he flirts aimlessly with fellow female counselor roxanne(kate lynch)as other teen counselors pair up and also fall head-over-heels. the film comes to head at the camp olympiad as the rivals square off in competitive athletic contests with tripper almost realizing their doomed to fail yet another year. the film also shows the growing bond between tripper and a quietly lonely, puppy-dog eyed rudy(chris makepeace of "vamp" fame), whose dad is often away all the time. rudy doesn't seem to fit in with the other kids his age and he seems to spend most of his time either jogging in the mornings with tripper or taking his peanuts at blackjack. the film mostly contains hi-jinx of fellow teen camp counselors cutting up and goofing around.you have hottie counselors, total nerd spaz(jack blum)with his taped glasses and bad acne, beak-nosed "hardware"(matt craven)who likes to blow things up, fat kid fink(keith knight) who is often stuffing his face, amongst others in the film. there's a basketball game where poor spaz can barely bounce the ball against rival camp mohawk much less shoot an accurate shot with poor fink tossing underhanded, between-his-knees fly-balls that sail over the back-board. there's camp fire coupling(with a spirited scary tale by tripper about a hook-handed killer)and boys drooling over the lovely ladies.yes, i know it's desperate at times trying to squeeze out every laugh it can and occasionally indulges in lapses of sentimentality(such as the scenes with a sad makepeace and murray), but just as much as this recent viewing, i found myself giggling away. i'm licked and just can't help loving this. it's a summer camp movie through and through which simply wants to entertain you. i can't explain, or reinforce enough, the overwhelming joy that floods forth when i see a sleepy murray's hand reach from the covers for the alarm clock that's piercing loudly pronouncing a summer camp movie is about to begin. his intercom jokes are especially amusing. but, the flick is, let's be honest, a series of comic vignettes with murray dead-panning endlessly..not that there's anything wrong with that. the film, though, couldn't quite survive without him, could it? hard to even think of this movie without murray in the lead. it's a happier time and i think nostalgia of that summer camp experience plays quite a hand in why we grown-ups still connect with "meatballs" warmly. and, poor morty(harvey atkin), the camp head who so badly wants things to run smooth, and to beat camp mohawk for a change, is the constant source of tripper and gang's amusement as they often play gags on him..especially when he's sleeping on his bed! great enthusiastic cast who seem to be having as much as us.

this is easily the best of the summer camp movies. in fact, few of the others are even fair, let alone anywhere near as entertaining as this one is. the film is just simply out to have some good, clean, fun. many people who went to summer camp as kids will see that it is presented here faithfully to the way it usually was, but with slapstick comedy mixed in. bill murray, as the chief counselor of the camp, tripper, leads a fine ensemble cast, and is usually at the center of the riotous nonsense. tripper has great one-liners throughout, usually broadcasting his jokes as pseudo-announcements over the camp's public-address system.several great supporting actors played the campers and counselors to build a myriad of fun and interesting subplots, all the while sprinkled amongst the many incidents of camp hi-jinx. spaz (jack blum) and fink (keith knight) were two characters particularly well done. the adventures (and misadventures) of these two are hilarious. each has classic lines, and they are characters you like and root for. look for spaz in the scene of disco dance pandemonium.the girls in the story are realistic characters, too. they're not dumb, naive, freakish, oversexed, nervy, or any of the other overused, abominable teen character stereotypes. kristine debell, kate lynch, cindy girling, and others make these characters believable. the requisite pranks abound, usually at the expense of camp director morty (harvey atkin). the nature of these pranks start at outrageous and progress from there. however, with all the silliness going on, tripper and the others have their serious sides. for example, tripper befriends a shy, lonely kid, rudy(chris makepeace), and takes him under his wing.the story culminates with a sports competition against a rival camp. it's a great "root for the underdogs" finale. when the chips are down, tripper's motivational "it just doesn't matter" spiel is inspired, and one of the best moments in the movie. and get ready to root: "spaz. spaz! spaz!!!""

seeing this movie always reminds me of what i remember summer being like, god! such a long time ago. the entire scene involving the "overnight", from the canoe procession to the end of the trip, is precious, and tripper's story about the homicidal maniac is urban legend right out of my youth. a highly entertaining movie, made many times better by the awful sequels that followed.

this film marked the end of the "serious" universal monsters era (abbott and costello meet up with the monsters later in "abbott and costello meet frankentstein"). it was a somewhat desparate, yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the wolf man, frankenstein's monster, and dracula one "last" time.i say desparate, because in the previous film, "house of frankenstein," both dracula and the wolf man are killed according to how the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be (dracula by the sunlight, and the wolf man by a silver bullet). yet somehow they return in house of dracula with no explanation. this movie could have played as a kind of prequel to house of frankenstein if the frankenstein monster plot wouldn't be continuing chronologically into house of dracula from house of frankenstein, and if the wolf man didn't get cured. then there'd be no plot holes. but since this is not the case, the plots of dracula and the wolf man make no sense.however, ignoring these plot holes, house of dracula is a classic atmospheric horror film that's fun to watch. it has many high points. especially seeing the wolf man get cured. i know i just said that this shouldn't have been included, but it was nice to actually see him get cured after all this time. and the scene with the lady playing "moonlight senada," on the piano then all of a sudden playing a haunting melody when under dracula's spell was very eerie. dr. edleman's transformation into the "dr. jekyl/mr. hyde" type character was also done very well.and it's great to see dracula, frankenstein, and the wolf man together, one "last" time.*** out of ****

in the seedy streets somewhere in new york city, a lonely punk named tromeo ( will keenan) has little friends but all they ever do is get tattoos, piercing and just party all the time. he does fall for a beautiful rich girl named juliet ( jane jenson) whom is also troubled as her father is being quite an abusive son of a you know what, but as our title characters meet and fall for each other things start becoming quite magical for them. unfortunately their fathers are at each other as juliet's dad wants to take over tromeo's dad's movie studio, but could love really conquer them all and stop this feud? hilarious and gross horror comedy drama satire from the wacky and disgusting people at troma is a wonderful modern day take on william shakespeare's romeo and juliet. this was released in theaters in 1997 and got some good reviews for this is a dark humored satire of the legendary story that started it all, it's got some good laughs, piercing, graphic violence and gore such as a head being smashed on a fire hydrant. for me this is the third best troma movie next to the immortal "toxic avenger" and "troma's war" being second, yes the acting can be a little bad like some troma flicks but the stuff above makes it up for that and this is a must see movie if you like horror comedies, peter jackson, and troma or if you wanna see a comical version of a beloved story, btw also look for a couple of amusing appearances by the toxic avenger and sgt. kabukiman nypd.also recommended: "the toxic avenger", "meet the feebles", "ichi the killer", " re-animator", "terror firmer", "class of nuke'em high", "romeo and juliet ( 1968 and 1996)", " pieces", " troma's war", " citizen toxie: the toxic avenger 4", "basket case", " riki-oh: the story of ricky", " demons", "new nightmare", " freddy vs. jason", " cabin fever", "nightmare on elm street", " battle royale", " pink flamingos", " perfect blue", " rabid grannies", "surf nazis must die", " hostel", " evil dead ii", "serial mom", " dead alive ( a.k.a. braindead)", " street trash".

tromeo & juliet - 10th anniversary editionwilliam shakespeare's play romeo & juliet has been interpreted hundreds of times on stage and in films. sometimes literally following the original text (which is, at times, vague in stage directions), sometimes in new interpretations where directors chose to show their own view on the piece. some are good, many are mediocre. lloyd kaufman's film certainly stands out as one of the most original, modern versions of the bard's creation, it may be placed in a modern-day decaying new york and full of the modern-day anti-social behavior, body piercing, dismemberment and kinky sex (which, for the more than casual reader, shakespeare himself wasn't shying away from), but at the same time it stays incredibly close to the overall feel and point of what the play is all about, which is quite an effort. kaufman wrote the script with his co-director on the film james gunn, who is now famous for writing two successful scooby doo movies, doing the impossible by making a perfect remake of an already perfect film with his script for dawn of the dead and directing one of the best horror-films of the year: slither. lloyd kaufmans innovative directorial view alongside with james gunns original and unrestricted writing make for an interpretation of shakespeare's play that maybe not everyone will "get" immediately, but will certainly be recognized by a truly unique and highly important view on a classic play. with a script that is written entirely in iambic meter, appearances of motorhead's lemmy and an outrageous forceful soundtrack watching tromeo & juliet is something no one will ever forget. apart from it's historical significance, tromeo & juliet is a treasure for film-lovers of all kind. not only for the script by james gunn, now a good influence on hollywood while working from the inside, but also because it features an early part of legendary actress debbie rochon. well known by everyone familiar with films that are made on lower budgets. the 10th anniversary edition on dvd adds to all that by including so many as-yet undiscovered gems that not only all the information one could wish for about the film itself and the experience of making it is presented in ways that make it impossible to turn off the dvd, but also a very honest (and disturbing) look is given into the ways independent cinema has to surviver these days. in many ways the extra's on the disc are an invaluable addition to the already impressive amount given on kaufman's film-school "make your own damn movie". furtermore historical items from the troma vaults which include james gunn, debbie rochon and all other contributors to this masterpiece are included, and the film itself is, apart from looking better then ever, accompanied by no less than four audio-commentaries, each and everyone informative, excruciatingly funny and all done for serious addition to the film instead of the boring and nonsensical commentaries that are so common these days. there are new commentaries (one with kaufman and gunn together), but also the one james gunn did for the original release of the dvd but couldn't be included there for some of honesty he displays about some other people is present on this disc. with fan-recreations of a few of the scenes from the film, a video diary of lloyd kaufman's visit to the set of james gunn's slither and a visit the two brought together to eli roth's hostel birthday party and much more, this is the ultimate set everyone must own. weather you are a film historian, someone interested in interpretations of the great bard's work, a fan of great cinema, a fighter for independent cinema, a fan of james gunn, interested in learning more on making films on a low budget, a fan of lloyd kaufman or whatever: this is the most important dvd-release of this millennium!

this outlandish troma movie is actually a very good movie. it is known as their epic and best and most highly rated production. their version of shakespeare's play is extremely funny with the usual dose of troma nudity and gore. troma has made some very good gore films, one of my favorites is "street trash" and of course the toxic avenger movies. i have one troma movie, "terror firmer", which has a reputation as their goriest and nastiest movie. i enjoyed "tromeo and juliet" so much, that i need to finally watch "terror firmer". this is a 2-disc collector's version with four commentaries and many many features. "tromeo and juliet" is an absolute hoot and highly recommended.

once upon a time, troma, the company that brought us cinema classics such as: the toxic avenger, rabid grannies, poultrygeist, redneck zombies and surf nazis must die, decided long ago to adapt shakespeare's famous play, 'romeo and juliet.' this adaptation decided to spice up the story by adding kinky sex, extreme violence, genital monsters, body piercing and incest and it succeeded in creating a bizarre yet hilarious film. anyone going into a troma production should know what to expect, and that is irreverent and perverse comedy with plenty of political incorrectness. expect plenty of nods to other troma films and plenty of re-used gags (flipping cars and head squashing). many may think it sounds like utter crap that only morons would find funny...they may be right, but at the same time they may need to lighten up and enjoy the insanity and mind-numbingness that is tromeo and juliet.with a great cast, a funny script (by james gunn and lloyd kaufman), a fitting soundtrack and plenty of great visual gags, kaufman has yet again succeeded in turning what is right upside down and grossing the hell out of everyone. get some popcorn, grab a beer, invite your friends over and enjoy tromeo and juliet for what it is, a shakespeare adaptation with plenty of balls. the end.4/5

i like this movie. i may be biased because i love dolphins. however, my 3 and 4 yr. old will sit and watch the whole movie.... it's not oscar material, but definitely entertaining. the dolphin cinematography is well done with a beautiful backdrop of ocean scenery and sunsets. my favorite scene is when flipper "flips" the pop can out of the water striking sandy in the head. it's an endearing funny moment that makes me laugh every time. on the other hand, the villainous banterings of the bully boatman (forget his name) are a little hard to take. and the shark scene is far from reality. question: do dolphins really make that much noise? or is there some serious dubbing happening here? bottom line: my kids like it and it keeps recycling through our vcr.

flipper is a nice heartwarming movie for whole family. it's obviously not a great movie, free willy looks much better almost in every component of film making. possibly, at times it becomes a bit naive , and the writing and the script are not the best part of the movie, but it's a entertaining film with very good cinematography (including underwater shots) and some important moral messages. elijah wood proves himself one more time as an incredibly talented and underrated actor. he can make bad movie watchable, okay movie - good, good - great and great movie becomes all time classic. paul hogan performance also was very good and he is completely fit to his role. as i already say above, whole cinematography was very good. but underwater shots definitely is the best parts. so flipper is a perfect way if you want to see nice, sweet and entertaining movie. if you like me become sick and tired of modern hollywood trash, filled with sex, violence, vulgarity and profanity you most likely would like this movie. my rating: 7,7 out of 10. feel free for mailing me about any of my comments and posts here. sorry for my bad english.

i thought this was a beautiful movie- very brave. such beautiful imagery-and i liked the use of breaking glasses w/ applause. also how the best friend repeated the line about "..and she's one year older than me.." showed that their friendship has rekindled and grown, but maybe some competition is left...i loved the footage of hands feeling the fabric. the dance concert was beautiful. the beginning seemed slow, though..it took awhile to feel for the characters-the husband could have been more abusive-he just seemed absent so when other characters talked about him-it didn't really fit. the affair btwn. the best friend and husband seemed random..the doctors meeting seemed to hint that there was not much time left(to live..) so when the infidelity was revealed, i didn't feel as much sympathy for the character-more like relief! the ending was so great- the lines btwn. her and the husband, and the scene where she is pulled over is brilliant!

this is one of a very few movies with terrific acting, wonderful story line and worthwhile to watch. it is about changes in life. it is about how happiness can be found when one is true to oneself. it is about accepting oneself and others. it is about life challenges. it is about coming to term with reality. it is about courage. it is about love. both actresses are very true to their role. the actresses had very good chemistry between one another in the movie. this is the key of the movie that made the movie. it is rare to see an independent film like this one. one could tell the hard work that the film crew had to have while producing this movie. i wish to see more movie from this producer/writer. see the movie, you will love it.

i just saw this film in austin texas at the austin gay and lesbian film festival and it was my festival favorite. the gymnast is a film not to be missed. it is an honest "coming to terms" story about relationships, self discovery , growing older and having the courage to change and move forward. not only is this a good story but the glorious aerialist performances by dreya weber and addie yungmee will take your breath away! see this film! it will be coming soon to a festival near you. this film deserved to be picked up right away by a major network or studio. i will certainly purchase this when it becomes available on dvd.

wow what can i say it was a good movie, very different to all the boring remakes we see lately the only thing i would have liked to see a bit more of an ending like when jane left her husband im guessing she was going to serena cause she fell for her,not just her but everything that she is,i so wish producers would actually show that sort of ending instead of leaving to it your imagination sort of ending i really hate it when they do that. the aerial acts looked like fun but i guess you'd have to be light and muscly, i would like to see more movies like this one, maybe the could do a sort of sequel of jane and serena.if i were in jane's shoes i would have went for the girl too she was attractive.

...this one. what came to my mind immediately was loving annabelle, as it has this same kind of mature mood and distanced dealing with the subject. we simply observe as the story unfolds, without taking sides, or having to confront any "moral" issues (or of course we are, but are not spoon-fed them). sure, there were some difficult facts to face, and choices to make, but it just flowed. basically it was just like any other love story, in any other life, with any other sexes.i personally found the girls having a good chemistry, and had fun with them on their night outs. the only thing i could really pinpoint as a problem would be it just felt kind of...retained. held back. it's not about the sex scenes (or those missing), but given that i felt the film at its liveliest during the moments they were together having a good time, it kind of contrasted with the rest. lowkey is good, but it just never quite sizzled like loving annabelle, nor touched me quite as much.this said, i heartily recommend it, it's by no means a waste of ones precious time, on the contrary...7/10

this movie was beautiful and touching. it touched a place deep inside me and i'm not sure why. i am a happily married woman and i've never had lesbian tendencies, but my, this movie almost made it something i crave. the choreography, the storyline, the dialog... the movie was a work of art. the synopsis without spoilers is that a woman gymnast unsatisfied with her life and looking for... something, anything. she is with a man who does not want a baby, but she does. he's not mean to her, but he doesn't treat her the way a woman should be treated either... i guess he doesn't really appreciate her. all these years she has stayed in shape and decides to go back to the gym. she meets another woman during her acrobatic training and an intimate and beautiful relationship unfolds. throughout the movie she has another woman friend that she trained with in her younger years, and they have stayed close friends.the relationship that unfolds is.. i don't know quite the word, but very understanding, comfortable, intimate but sexy... something that could only exist between two women. the kind of relationship that could really bring meaning back into your life. someone that makes you feel special, exciting, beautiful, confused even.the relationship with her close friend is beautiful in an equally different way. they have a close and intimate relationship. her friend showed me what a true friend really is. someone who is understanding, easy going, real, fun to be with, someone who is there for you no matter what. someone who is supportive, and you can huddle with and tell your deepest secrets. someone who shares your past but does not share your secrets. the story is simple in the fact that it was not overdone, but not underdone in any way. it leaves a lot of sensual imagery to capture it's moments. the dancing and choreography was stunning. i could watch it over and over. the way the artist captured the main character's feelings and emotions was. the dancing and the imagery was very dazzling and mesmerizing to watch. what a cozy a wonderful story! i fell in love with this movie. if you have a chance, rent this and watch it!!

"the gymnast" unfolds in short shots and short scenes, revealing its characters and message over time. the spare editing is accompanied by a beautiful, simple score. this intimate approach is wonderful for feeling like you're on a path of discovery as much as the characters are.the spare approach is also its drawback; there are a few scenes that are confusing because they don't have enough context. there are some decisions made by the characters that seemed rather flip until i watched the interviews that were in the bonus materials. i'm glad i did, because the actors' descriptions of their motivations gave me a much more well- rounded understanding of the film overall.aside from the story itself, it was wonderful to see women so comfortable and strong in their own bodies. the shooting was very tastefully done; very matter-of-fact. one has the feeling of seeing a love story and a life story unfold, not a voyeuristic sleaze film. the physicality of the athletes -- their realness -- is a great contrast to the sometimes ethereal nature of the plot.not a film i'll need to see again anytime soon, since the storyline is simple but its delivery is powerful enough to stay with me for a long time.

everyone who worked on this film did an amazing job. this is honestly one of the best lesbian films i've seen in a long time. the acting, writing, cinematography, music, visuals, everything was top notch. as an avid fan of the genre (both lesbian films and gymnastics), i was so unbelievably pleased by this film. it truly gave me so much more than i expected across the board. hearing the q&a with the cast and crew was great, the lead actress has so much positive energy and is so humble and gracious, it's a pleasure to see people who can be talented and not lose sight of what's really important. and the writer did a hell of a job, as well as directing and the editing was awesome. thanks so much for making a great film! thanks also for the line about 'if you're going to slap a label on yourself, it would be bisexual'. i'm so tired of movies where characters who have a relationship with both sexes get passed off as gay or straight, it's wonderful to see bisexuals getting recognition for existing and being part of the gay community, and it was nice that labels weren't even necessary at all in this film. what an ending! just when i thought it couldn't give me more, it did. beautiful work and my applauds to all. i will spread the word, this is definitely a film not to be missed!

the gymnast (2006) was written and directed by ned farr. dreya weber portrays jane hawkins, a former world-class gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns her living as a certified massage therapist.the promotional material leads you to believe that the plot hinges around jane's accidental reunion with a former teammate. although this meeting takes place, that plot line is secondary to the main plot, which involves jane, her husband, and a professional dancer named serena (addie yungmee). the two women develop an act of the type performed by cirque de soleil. the two complement each other--jane is more experienced with heights and has tremendous upper body strength. serena is more elegant and artistic, although, obviously, also capable of incredible physical feats.the film works because we can understand how jane would turn to addie, who is caring and compassionate, while jane's husband has taken her for granted for the many years of their marriage.both women are incredibly fit and athletic, and dreya has the lean body and well-defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts. they clearly are truly performing their act, and the results are so excellent that we can believe they would indeed, be a success in las vegas, or anywhere else they traveled.the sexual tension between the women is obvious, and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while suspended in the air. a woman with a neglectful husband and an attractive woman partner make for an explosive situation, which isn't resolved in a neat and tidy fashion.of the six films we saw at the rochester ny lesbian and gay film and video festival, we thought this one was the best. it will work on dvd, and is definitely worth seeking out on large or small screen. note: stay for the credits!

thankyou for making such a wonderful escape . that's what i love about movies. i'm so impressed with the aireals , the way they were shot and the timing was so dynamically perfect with the music .being a dancer myself , and having been a part of many dance films choreography is usually chopped ,diced and sometimes not even to the beat....."showgirls" the movie . the relationship between the ladies was ever so present in the movement .my favorite scene is the last one, when she is pulled over . i've seen the movie before, a different version ., and i disliked the husband more last time . i felt a little more sorry for him this time . it changes how i feel about the female love birds. its all so magical .

whatever you do, don't stop watching when you think the movie is over! hang around for the first batch of credits or you'll really miss something! we saw this movie at the savanaah film festival and thought it was the best of the bunch. dreya weber is a marvel really, not only because of her performance, but because she can pull it off so far above the ground. at the q&a she said there were no wires or effects, so everything you see is really her going for it. addie couldn't make it to the festival because she was dancing with madonna. she was excellent and, my gawd, so beautiful. i was amazed that the film went over so well with the blue haired lady crowd, but there you have it, savannnah isn't a backwater.

somehow, somewhere, someplace.. you gotta see this film. breath taking aerials, and incredible outstanding performances from highly gifted actors.you think cirque du soleil blows your mind,wait till you see what these 2 women do - most importantly, the emotional journey and struggles jane(dreya weber) faces are universal in theme to many women. a superbly directed film which deals with the complexities of relationships,and holding on, until you're ready to let go. this masterpiece will touch women and men alike. ned far (director/writer) and ridiculously talented dreya weber (star/producer) just had the guts to tell it, honestly and sincerely. this film will hit big - see it however you can - or you won't be "in the loop" when it becomes one of the most talked about films.

now maybe it had something to do with the fact that i saw this movie at a low point in my life, when i was really trying to figure out where i was going and what i needed to make myself happy, but this film really spoke to me. jane is an everywoman: although she has so many positive things going for her, she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life. she is strong and intelligent, but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a second-choice life. she seeks out new challenges and happiness, seeking desperately to fill the hole in her heart. dreya weber is an exquisite jane. as we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair, the torture of her desperation and, eventually, the strength of her conviction. the beautiful addie yungmee is also very well cast and an asset to the production. allison mackie is a scene stealer as a saucy character with impeccable timing. i highly recommend this film; although it's low budget, it has big budget writing and production values. ps- great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women. women will love the story and characters, but there's something for the men here, too. :)

this film tackles the subjects of loss, personal struggle and transformation in such a smart, artful, sensitive, and visually stunning way that i was completely transported. it is a rare gem of a film in the way it honors beauty and women. you'll have to see for yourself. dreya weber (jane) masterfully portrays the subtleties of a remarkable if not somewhat broken personality, in a way that every woman will relate to. i found the honesty of the emotional interactions among characters to be very refreshing and profoundly engaging. there was nothing in this film that said to me "low budget" as far as quality is concerned. nothing. the fact that it is a low-budget film is a tribute to the film's creators. the final sequence during the credits will also knock your socks off. it is a brilliant celebration of jane's choice. unexpected and inspiring.

the relationship between the main characters i thought was very realistic. how the two end up involved is believable. it doesn't have that whole "oh yeah right" that most hollywood movies have. not too mention how they captured the sexy, beautiful and painful side of trapeze. i am a trapeze student and i love that they showed how hard it is on the body, hands and yeah those fabric burns are brutal! definitely a must see for the relationship as well as the art that is made in the movie. i loved it! i'm happy with the way the movie ended but i definitely wanted to see more. be sure to stay seated through the credits for a special treat hehe. great scene!

i truly enjoyed this film. it's rare to find a star who can pull off the physical aspects of any sports/dance themed film convincingly and do a first rate acting job as well. in this film you find two stars who rise to the occasion. both women deliver warm, touching and at times humorous performances. the film also touched on a number of topics, from racial issues to sexual identity. and yet the approach wasn't heavy handed. the production values were also top notch for a small budget film. i saw this at the philadelphia gay & lesbian film festival and went back to see it a second time. it was a real crowd pleaser. everyone i spoke to seemed to enjoy this film.

pepe le pew can either really creep you out or totally sweep you off your feet. either way, you can't help feeling a little awe on beholding this classic wb character. this commentater personally believes that pepe was the inspiration behind other would be animated casanovas today from cartoon network's "johnny bravo" to disney's lumiere from "beauty and the beast". his unique brand of love making is to be wondered at in today's world where his antics would normally be slapped with a sexual harassment warrant and at least a 50m distance from all his victims. in this particular cartoon, a world weary cat decides to do an ultimate makeover and earn some respect for a change for pretending to be a skunk. all goes well, until pepe arrives and promptly pursues the unfortunate feline with his overwhelmingly enthusiastic love-making.the groundwork for pepe's many trademarks are laid in this cartoon. from his adorable "frenchified" love calls to that aggravatingly calm hop-chase of his. this cartoon only goes to show that as far as the world of cartoon fantasy is concerned, the most ardent wooer can go the distance...and have his beloved "pig-eon" leaving dust trails behind them.

i just watched this film, and i have to say it surprised me. it was very well done, with good acting and a deep look at high school students from japan, in adolescent love.the look and feel is a lot different from many movies, and you can easily get into the film. much of the emphasis seems to be in the story itself, which is extremely subtle. the main theme and relations with other characters are a bit complex. but the the overall sense of realism and dimensions still pulls you in.a main draw back is of course, those who like something simple. which is not here. you have to be open to many things, including a new culture, to get more into the film.i did enjoy this film though. it is worth watching.

watching this movie, i can't help drawing the comparison between it and wild reeds, another thoughtful film about teenagers coming of age.like wild reeds, this movie is slow and the director would not be hurried. so if you want a quick resolution to things, don't watch it. this movie is like a slice of life, beginning imperfectly and ending imperfectly. there's no resolution to anything, no happily ever after for anybody, just like real life.this movie is as real as it gets. the acting is surprisingly good. the director is fond of long, really long, shots and the actors and actresses excel at showing subtlety and inner thoughts.i love this movie. i almost didn't watch it but now i'm very glad that i did. it's not a movie for everyone but if you're willing to let it grow on you, you will be rewarded.10/10

writing about something so wonderful is completely hard. actually, it's almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this movie. this is a marvelous story about sex and gender, and it's almost unbelievable that we have not to deal with obscene scenes of sex. feeling, this film was made for people that like to feel, and just to feel, life in all its complexity in a gorgeous simple way. we look at it, and something starts growing inside our minds, even our hearts: it a pure poem. i've watched some "gay" movies, and i almost always got really unsatisfied with unnecessary scenes of sex, not because i don't like scenes of sex, but generally they are so pornographic that i'm forced to think that the director or the producers or the writer of the script thinks that homosexuality means perversion. nagisa no shindobaddo is totally different from that ones. three are the main characters. we have ito, yoshida and aihara, two boys and a girl in a peculiar love triangle. ito likes his best friend yoshida, yoshida likes aihara and aihara likes ito. imagine what this could turn in unprepared hands? but in the contrary, hashiguchi makes a magnificent story which goes profoundly in the philosophy of life, adding a question in our mind that made me think, astonished, in the end of the movie: why? and that why expanded in multiple questions inside of my brain and inside of my heart. the scenes, actually, sometimes tending to be boring, are moments of the most delightful poem which we are able to feel, but totally unable to write down in words. and maybe because of that, we are unable to understand the question in the end of the movie. i'm sure this movie was not made for us to discuss every piece of it some people want to understand a film almost dissecting it. others are so used to common "american gay" movies that can't appreciate the real value of this master-piece. watch it, close your eyes in the credits and feel, everything, feel yourself, feel the wonderful song. for all this and much, much more, i give a nine. and i just don't give ten, because ten of ten is perfection. but i confess i almost did it.

"nagisa no shindobaddo" or "like grains of sand" is an amazingly beautiful story about teenage boys and girls dealing with the state of becoming one with who they are. this movie isn't about homosexuality, but it is about sexuality.aihara, an aloof girl, will definitely make the viewers ponder who is behind the aloof girl. does she love yoshida? or does she love ito? or did she somehow turn into a lesbian because of the "incident"? (i doubt it).and what about yoshida? does he realize that he loves ito in the end? well, we all know he loves him as a friend. but you'll never know once you see this movie... haha :) in the end, aihara (along with ito) delivers an exceptional message to the audience: which is that it does not matter if you love a boy or a girl. and i have to tell you, i'm so dense that i didn't get it at first. ^^;; it's because of the whole no talking scenes... you have to try to understand what the characters are thinking and saying through their actions and not by what they say (especially the final part... whew, boy, that was confusing!) it's a confusing story, but it is beautiful nonetheless. :) this movie is certainly one of the best japanese movies i have ever seen (and trust me, i've seen plenty).

there are other movies about boarding schools and the antics of the students and staff, but "the belles of st. trinian's" towers above them all! the plot has been thoroughly summarized by other posters, so i won't cover the same ground. i just want to say that it's a shame that it's finally out on dvd, but in a format that can't be used in the u.s.! :-( enjoy, fellow fans in new zealand and australia! and if anyone reading this has any pull in such matters, please help get it released on dvd with region 1 encoding! also, is it possible to be notified via e-mail when (i won't say "if") it is released on dvd in the united states? thanks!

alistair simms is a wonder in this. he makes such a good headmistress. the role given here for george cole was made for him. hence, the casting job on this film was perfect. i think it was one of those rare occasions where everything clicked. the story line was good, the comic dialogue a scream and the older prefect girls a delight!! each character you are endeared to, even the villains. why can't we make films like this any more. basically, this is a very english comedy with good movement and fluidity.

this bright hilarious english comedy about school girl antics is a neglected gem. the significant question is where is the audience? the film is rated 10 by most voters, but how many voters is that? they don't make comedies like this anymore because the films don't get distributed or seen. i would never miss a chance to see this old art house classic again. but where are the art houses?

this comic classic of english school girl antics is and was one of the great art house classics. then the art house disappeared with the arrival of videos. and so did the audience for this movie. the loss is not to the art houses or to this great film. the loss is to those who will never have a real opportunity to view this memorable laugh filled cinematic masterpiece. but i am preaching to the converted aren't i. who else would search for this flick?

the first of five st trinian's films (although the last is usually discounted) was based around artist ronald searle's schoolgirl characters, and features the wonderful alastair sim in drag as millicent fritton, headmistress, as well as her own brother. much of the humour is dated, yet curiously touching and outrageous in today's pc world - the girls drink, gamble, smoke and are later sold off to rich arabs, yet always remain in charge, defeating bureaucrats, police, judges and other establishment figures as they maraud across england. perhaps because the films have been so regularly seen on tv, st trinians still inspires fancy dress parties and club nights. the films have recurring characters that include pc ruby gates (joyce grenfell) and flash harry (george cole). the precursor to the entire series is a charming film called 'the happiest days of your life' (1950).

so udo kier earned like nine bucks and free food for this so that is a victory in and of itself. more importantly this movie tells a very interesting tale about a group of salvage guys coming across the broken down demeter. i should warn you, i'm gunna bounce around through this review real quick so buckle up. first thing's first. coolio plays a guy named 187. 187 likes drugs. 187 finds a bunch of caskets on board and... now i don't know anything about the future but maybe they smuggle drugs in caskets. not gunna say that was the craziest thing in this movie. later on the vampire gets out of his mist filled coffin and then the real hilarity begins. first, although this movie has the word dracula in it he is actually not in this movie. i have a theory though. out of the blue you see the salvage crew's ship leave without them. my theory is that dracula was on board with his retarded brother orlock. dracula told orlock he'll be right back. dracula got the hell out of this movie before he could be seen leaving orlock to play the vampire for the six or so minutes he is in the movie. the best part of this film, and for those of you that have seen this you know what i'm gunna say, is after 187 gets sired, embraced whatever. he has this huge monologue about ejaculating on various parts of erika elaniak's body and... other super cool stuff. coolio, seriously you are the best thing ever. some other stuff happens in this movie too. like casper van dean gets some work. orlock screams a lot and loses his arm and then we kinda lose track of him for the rest of the movie. and thank god really. we find out erika's character is a police bot. as the movie comes to a close we find out that the ship is on a course to ram into the sun. the police bot and one other surviving character are doomed. rather then avoid certain death erika's police bot reveals she's also a whore bot and they decide to screw each other and die. before they die in the sun they die for no reason, yep that's right... their ship blows up for no real reason. this movie got the amazing rating for one reason, coolio. my god, if they gave academy awards to black rappers then he'd be the first to get one. the only reason this didn't get a perfect ten is because there was not a drop of nudity. now i know what your thinking, how can you judge a film by whether ladies show their goods or not. well easy. a movie like this pretty much requires it. its part of the process. gore, gore, monsters, nudity, gore, end of movie final shock at the end. its the formula. this had some gore, the monster was awesome because he sucked so hard he actually did us the favor of staying off camera. that was considerate of him and i respect that. nudity, not a drop even though there was a length conversation about... well see the above statement and as for the shock/twist... i certainly didn't see the end coming. that counts. i hope hollywood doesn't think coolio gave this film his all and has nothing left. he deserves more work. well, until dracula 4000, i'm out.

i rented this movie not knowing what to expect but whoa was i in for a treat!for anyone who, like myself, was waiting for a good movie that combined horror and sci fi, it is time to rejoice because the wait has finally ended. writing, acting, filming and directing - all top notch. i hate to admit it, but i actually cried at one point (when dracula was talking to the crippled guy). truly an emotional roller-coaster from start to finish. the corridors of the ship provided the perfect spooky setting for this tale and the actors were really able to make their fear come alive to me. and coolio as a vampire....very nice!and believe me....as great as the bulk of the movie was...the ending will blow you away! i know this movie gets a lot of flack on this site for some reason but i know none of you saw the ending coming. brilliant!

unfortunately, many great films on imdb such as this one have their scores "adjusted" by imdb. this is truly a fine and intriguing film by the accomplished director of bonnie and clyde, little big man, night moves, mickey one, and the chase.if you click in the user rating area, you'll see that the actual median for four friends is 7.6. however, imdb has "adjusted" (dumbed down?) the rating to 6.4.per imdb: "imdb publishes weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages. various filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts at 'vote stuffing' by individuals more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion of it....the exact methods we use will not be disclosed. this should ensure that the policy remains effective." in other words, we won't disclose our methods, so you can't question how we arrived at the score! what a shame to see fine thought-provoking films like four friends fare no better than lame formulaic comedies due to imdb's "filters".

four friends was first billed on hbo in 82 as a sleeper hit. having heard the term 'sleeper' when 14, back then - i was anxious to see one. (!) boy - was i surprised! that film! i hadn't really fallen in love with a non-special effects film outside of treasure of the sierra madre - much less a 'hippy flick'...but having had grown up with a couple of hippies - i understood the power behind mr. penn's film. four friends is definitely one of a kind. the script is so personable - and that cast!!! craig wasson defines danilo prozor so well! he just personifies the 'writer type' to a tee - both smart and clumsy (the scene at the window...) and strong yet so very vulnerable. for me - he captures what it's like to be so taken with agirl that it lasts over a decade...and i have always found solace in the character - and in the film. throughout the 80's four friends was a partner in crime to me - and i caught the movie whenever i could on hbo - even if i had to stay up until 5am! and still, always at the end - there is a sense of loss when all those wonderful characters part from the viewers on the beach. jodi thelen personifies "that girl" to the hilt - it is so hard not to be charmed by her. this movie really stands the test of time. every once and a while i check out my video of it...or show a friend...and it still gets a solid reaction. i've known women who absolutely fall in love with georgia! so many levels..! just an incredible little 60's piece of humanity. very special, very magical. i recently found the novelization of four friends by robert grossbach - and it's even more detailed that the movie! actual dates of events, etc. a real find! and what's more - haha - i found the novel while thumbing around in a used book store...in omaha, ne of all places!!! guess you have to have an eye for her! when i was in l.a. in 92 working as an extra - i went into a ruddy lil memorbilia shop - and there were a ton of stills from the film!!! unfortunately - i was broke and couldn't indulge...but boy, those photos of georgia and the guys all together just went right through me! i met director joe sergant on the set of skylark in emporia, ks in summer of 92...and we spoke about four friends - very cool! also...working at a video store in omaha in 98 - waited on a female who was a relative of jim metzler..! told her to pass the word on that there was some kid in omaha who was just fanatical about the film - and had gotten the utmost out of it. once again - the movie captures everything that's in danilo's character's heart...great, great work --- one of mssrs tesich and penn's finest efforts. steve tesich is sorely missed. an incredible writer. "isadora duncan!!!"- c.

four friends is one of those films that you go to without any expectations, only to find yourself knocked for a loop. you sort of file it away, but then you hear the song "georgia on my mind" by ray charles, and images and vague feelings begin to flicker on the edge of your consciousness, and then you remember this crazy film which made you laugh and cry, almost at the same time.why is this film so memorable? first, at least for people who lived through it all, because it captures so well the tenor of the times - its dashed hopes, its successes, its sincerity and above all the emotional roller-coaster ride that leads to a poignant nostalgia. and then, the acting is just so amazing. danilow, all angst and passion, georgia, as difficult to grasp as a will 'o the wisp... but enchanting, nevertheless, and louis, the handicapped room-mate with charm to spare who attacks life with gusto and takes each moment with a wry smile, because he knows only too well that it just might be his last.how long has it been since you saw a film that made you really care about the people in the story? even if they were far from perfect? the film presents you with people whose choices are not necessarily commendable, but the film never moralizes, it just allows us to appreciate the human condition in all its variety... even the minor characters have a well-defined personality and a history, which is why this film seems so real even when some of the actions and reactions might seem over the top... because that's the way life is, when you think about it. and why this film engages you with a complexity that is defined by character. truly an amazing and satisfying experience.

i first encountered arthur penn's "four friends" late one night on hbo. having never heard of it, i expected very little, but watched because i was interested in seeing what a creation by a teaming of penn and screenwriter steve tesich would be like. for the next two hours or so, i sat mesmerized, watching this incredible teaming of talent and the story they wove. a semi-autobiographical tale of a young immigrant to america growing up amidst the turbulence of the 1960s, "four friends" follows the story of danilo, an eastern european immigrant (the brilliant craig wasson), from his arrival in the united states through a decade that changed the american landscape. accompanying danilo on his journey are his friends georgia (the radiant jodi thelan, in a role that sadly, she has never had the opportunity to equal), tom (jim metzler) and david (michael huddleston). "four friends" covers way too much territory for me to attempt to explain it here, but if you haven't seen this film, i urge you to find a copy (it's just been released on dvd) and watch it. you won't be disappointed. tesich's script is wonderfully poignant  at times funny, at times incredibly sad, but always fascinating and honest. penn directs with a sure hand, and an obvious love for the period and the people whose lives we're following. the cast is uniformly superb. this film should have made a major star out of wasson who is truly one of this country's most wasted talents. jodi thelan, not your standard brainless hollywood sexpot, heats up the screen in a performance that makes the audience fall in love with her character as easily as the characters in the film. metzler and huddleston subtle performances could easily be overlooked in the shadow of their co-stars, but they are excellent and help anchor the film. also superb are miklos simon and elizabeth lawrence as danilo's parents, as well as reed birney and lois smith. i have not been without a copy of "four friends" since the day after i first saw it on hbo those many years ago. it has been and remains one of my all-time favorite films for more than 20 years now. i can't recommend it enough and feel, if you give it a chance, you'll feel the same way.

this may be one of the best movies i have ever seen. it has anything but a trite plot, and leaves one wondering which way it will go next. it is an interesting portrayal of the struggles of youth, youth who are interested in more than immediate gratification, youth who show some concern about the desires and needs of others.

during the civil war a wounded union soldier hides out in a isolated confederate ladies' school; where the head mistress and the teacher of the school decide to care for him and keep him about, until trouble starts brewing between the lonely and sexually frustrated women and girls. the soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but it all comes at a price in the end. "dirty harry (1971)" (which was made about the same time of "the beguiled") might be my favourite collaboration between eastwood and siegel, but after seeing this, i tend to think this to be the pairs' finest work together. a very atypical, savvy and stylish vehicle for eastwood is always on the mark with richly controlled direction by don siegel and a hauntingly rousing music score by lalo schifrin. standing out strongly is its sultrily lurid and bleak nature that's intrusively planted into the film's psychological makeup and manipulative strangle hold in sexual depravity. it's assiduously played out and makes it more the brooding and blood curdling when those random shocks and saucy intentions take hold with gripping tension. the way siegel illustrates john b sherry and grimes grice's alluring bold, slow-burn screenplay (taken from the novel of thomas cullinan) is effectively done through stark emotions and the script's tight, lyrical context. siegel's strong direction captures the idyllically southern victorian setting with such potently garnished photography and he sets up some strangely piercing imagery with great clarity and restrained. while the performances, are truly commendable and high of quality. clint eastwood as the smoothly suave, sweet talking chameleon union soldier is very impressionable and delightfully assured. a profoundly eminent geraldine page steals the picture as the hardened head mistress and the elegant elizabeth hartman adds a delicate sincereness to her innocent character. mae mercer is strongly tailored as the black maid and jo ann harris is the pick of the crop from the young pupils with her seductively sly persona. honestly while eastwood's charismatic character plays the field for his own selfish needs, there's still mixed intentions there that the one's being played (where rivalry between the women creep in) turn out to be no better than their guest at the end. throughout there's a perversely dark sense of humour and ironic touch settling into the material. what's demonstrated here, is simply more than your basic little minded shocker, but one that's thickly layered with intrigue and a sense of realism that's hard to shake. that also goes for its extremely eerie title and closing song. a effectively chilling, low-key item that's hard not to be tempted by it's swinging hospitality.

let us assume for a moment that you haven't experimented with the psychotropic mushroom and you're wondering about the so called bad experience and just how something like that might play itself out well go ahead and pop in a fresh copy of the beguiled. see, with film you have your clean trips (solaris and anything else directed by andrei tarkovsky), whack trips, i.e. the experience-from-which-you-never-recover (sweet movie and el topo), and you're bad organic trips, a category specifically reserved for a film like the beguiled which is the sort of content those keen writers at the times who made all the right decisions with their lives and graduated from the harvard department of english refer to as "hallucinogenic in tone." by the third act of this don siegel directed movie, you may not exactly observe that your two lead-heavy hands have become shrunken and assume all the characteristics of a burrowing insectivorous mammal, nor will you exactly fall under the suspicion that your spine has achieved the same sinuous shape and knotty texture of a pomaceous fruit baring tree incalculable in age, but you will feel something.in 1970, when this film was filmed, most americans were looking for an anodyne for their collective pain, a movie like the graduate perhaps, a lot of world-endism was going on and, of course you had the nightmare break down of war in vietnam. what you get with the beguiled, banal drug metaphors aside, is a screenplay adapted from a novel by a guy who at least for the moment wanted to be known as grimes grice, and direction from the director who helped bring about the work and career of sam peckinpah. in the beguiled, donny siegel, born in 12, chicago, il., less than 45 years after the great fire is showing his attempt at grappling with all that contemporary cultural madness of the early 1970's in the form of a classical film artifact. the beguiled is an incredible film and an outstanding contribution to the cinematographic arts in almost every aspect: the shooting, editing, direction and story are all fantastic, and you're not likely to see anything else like it. undoubtedly, a sinister film, its effects, as i've said, both dizzying and adulterating; frankly it's hard to believe would ever universal attached its name to this picture, but you are going to see upon viewing some of the sweet, sweet camera moves, and cinematographer bruce surtees exploiting every bit of dark myth you harbor in your head about the american plantation south, conflating beauty with evil in every location shot. clint eastwood, needless to say, has never been like this. old clint, he moves at instant from coy to livid, his eyes like two archimedean spirals in medium close up. the rest of the cast is equally exacting and uncanny.this beguiled will never make the afi 100 in my lifetime, but that doesn't stop me from positing that it's one of the best american synch sound films ever made. while most people catalogue it as a western, to include the folks at the western channel, the beguiled is a problem because you don't really know what it is: a sort of war movie? a drama? psychological thriller? maybe the answer to all those emotionally wrought noir films starring kirk douglas? i actually call this piece a horror film because when my old man, who likes to kick back with the cheap, gratuitous violence projected in entertainments like the wire, saw that high angle medium long shot of geraldine page wrapping a tourniquet around clint's bloody leg, pa was pretty quick to suggest we watch something else like the outback bowl, right before he absconded to another room. my advice: watch this one, and make sure it is on a very large screen, preferably run on that dpl home theater projector you're contemplating. i would put the beguiled right on order along with that important consumer purchase, turn the overheads out, throw some cinematic light up on the big blank wall, and try not to lose your grip because just like norman bates, "we all go a little mad sometimes," even the beguiled.

the beguiled was one of the few early eastwood films i hadn't seen until i gave the dvd a spin today. and from it's opening sepia-tinged shot to the macabre climax i was utterly enthralled. too many film-makers these days substitute special effects, fast editing and dizzying camera-work in place of character-driven stories, but director don siegel knew how to get the maximum effect from this relatively simple plot, and the characters are believable and compelling.the story concerns a ladies finishing school which happens to be situated on the edge of various skirmishes during the american civil war. the south-supporting ladies find a badly wounded union soldier (clint eastwood); nursing him back to health he begins to manipulate the sexually frustrated women for his own ends.geraldine page is excellent in the role of the headmistress with a secret, and her descent into madness is subtly conveyed. for a film that virtually takes place in a single location it never loses visual interest. there's even a chance that the normal status quo, long abandoned when eastwood's machinations are uncovered, could return; but the mistresses and pupils descend upon a darker road...this is a totally different style of film from the same director's dirty harry, made in the same year, and yet they are both equally superb. eastwood is great playing against his usual stoic anti-hero image, yet there's also some mysterious quality attached to his character. we never really learn much about him prior to his incarceration, and the viewer is free to decide upon his well-shaded persona. villain or victim? whatever you think, all i can say is that i thoroughly enjoyed it.

this film has some rather shocking scenes and subject matter considering it was made in 1971.clint eastwood, geraldine page, and elizabeth hartman do excellent work in the film, as do all the cast members.set during the civil war, the film begins when a wounded yankee soldier, johnny, portrayed by clint eastwood, is given refuge and help at a girls academy located in the south.the headmistress of the school, ms. farnsworth (geraldine page), the one teacher-edwina (elizabeth hartman), and a small group of half grown girls have been without a man in their midst for perhaps a little too long.while their loyalties lay with the confederacy-- their emotions and physical needs definitely lead them in the opposite direction. johnny immediately uses his masculine charms to try to win the women over to his side--and keep them from turning him over to the patrollers.however, feelings previously stoked by incestuous behavior, an adulterous father, a brutal rape, and adolescent inexperience combined with jealousies--turn things upside down with some unexpected consequences for both johnny and the school's residents.10 stars

i was amazed about this early performance of clint eastwood. i had not read a summary of the film, when i decided to watch it on tv. due to mr. eastwood, i expected some nice shootings and no deep story. i was quite mistaken. i found a couple of topics unusually explicitly addressed, and until the end, i couldn't make up my mind about who's good and who's bad. this movie is definitely not typical eastwood, but surely worth watching.

this is a good movie, i won't go into any details as the other user comments do a good job of taking care of that. however, i disagree with the statement that this is eastwood's best work. that is just not a very defendable position based on the volume of strong movies he has directed and starred in. i would like to note that i find it interesting that two of the actresses who played in this movie, pattye mattick and peggy drier, never again appeared in another film or television show, in spite of giving good performances. my curiosity has me wondering what happened to these two actresses?

i thought that eastwood's most unusual role was that in the bridges of madison county, but that was until i saw the beguiled. he manages to pull it off, giving a very good performance and so does the rest of the cast. the direction is imaginative given that the film was made in 1971 and had there not been some plot holes - which the director seems to struggle to cover up at times - we would be talking about an excellent film. it remains powerful, nonetheless.8

a tough life gets tougher when the three children of a single mom are scheduled to be sent to separate foster homes after her untimely passing.to stay together, the older boy plans a daring, high risk escape to find a distant lost uncle- their only remaining next of kin.their trek takes the three fearful runaways on a chase through the desert in a classic beetle, penniless, hungry, desperate, terrorized by delinquents and too young to drive, hunted by the ever threatening civil authorities.what the movie lacks in acting and plot realism, it makes up for in the honest human need to be a part of a fulfilled and complete family- even if that family is cobbled together with spare parts of broken lives.sure, the ending is forced and too over-dramatic for the critical movie goer, but every heart beats the same cry for family togetherness and belonging.with all its weaknesses, i still give this movie a strong recommendation.

this 1955 producers' showcase version of the musical peter pan with mary martin has the benefit of showcasing most of the original broadway cast, including kathleen nolan as wendy, who was more natural an actress than the girl they hired for the 1960 color televised play. it's a shame that most people won't sit through anything black and white anymore because in many respects this earlier production - which doesn't even show up in the imdb listings when you put "peter pan" into the search engine! - is superior to the cutesier color version most people have watched. i obtained the original on disc and then did work on it to make it look and sound better digitally. now when i put the 1960 color version on it looks garish in comparison. i suspect mary martin herself no doubt preferred this original 1955 b/w producers' showcase televised version.as an added plus the disc i got also showed the original commercials and opening promo. how far away the 1950's seem now - such an innocent time compared to today. i miss it.

finally i discovered what i thought i remembered as a four year old. after seeing the 1960 color version on vhs, i kept saying i remembered seeing it in black and white 2 times before. now the imdb has helped me to know the truth, that it was broadcast twice (2 productions) in black and white in 2 successful years, 1955 & 56. these are the ones i remember best as a four year old. i didn't realize the 56 broadcast was not the same as the 55. in 1960, i was 9 and the color production just didn't do it for me. the black and white version was wonderful with just as much awe and wonder impact as the high tech films of today, even without any computer effects. you had to have been there! please comment if you had a similar reaction to the b&w version.

considered by many to be a strangely overlooked chabrol it seems to me the reason it has been cold shouldered is its sleaze factor. not as overtly sexy, violent or gory as many films of this period it nevertheless starts rather startlingly and although becoming more measured continues to ooze a rather unpleasant odour. ms audran, not here the ice maiden but a drunken mother, donald pleasence does a cameo as a child molester, david hemmings has his eyes on underage sex and the central theme involves the relationship between a brother, sister and niece. no not very nice at all and chabrol treats it all as if it is very normal (like it might be in some small french village!) instead of ed mcbain's new york city. had this been treated in a more sensational manner then it would have been a more acceptable but lesser film. here we really have to choose between the likelihood of various unpleasant options before the final denouement. very watchable

evocatively directed and slickly photographed psychological mystery thriller with an exceptional lead performance by a sombre donald sutherland, and potent support roles from donald pleasence and david hemming. the material decides to keep it all glum, and moves from the investigation period into the back-story of the victim. the seldom, and quite sullen nature of investigation pulled me in, but when it flashback to the victim's side showing her final days weren't as compelling, and became somewhat stodgy and stock-like. while the script is strongly detailed and to a certain degree complex in stringing us along, however the final and surprising revelation should have been more bone-jarring and it's not helped out by its sloppy execution. howard blake's music score has an emotional sting to its cues that simply linger, and director claude chabrol's capable handling (well for most part) has a strong stylistic and tight manner, which gets the best out of moody locations and flexible cast. the young faces lisa langlois and aude landry do an incredibly good job as well.

i honestly can't believe that this film isn't more highly rated. claude chabrol could be described as something like a french alfred hitchcock, and while this film is only the second one of his that i've seen (the first being le boucher), i can already see that this guy is something special just on the strength of these two films. the film is a french and canadian co-production, and takes place in canada. the cast is made up of british and canadian stars and the high quality performances bode well with the rest of the film; most of which is high quality also. the film is a murder mystery and begins when a young girl covered in blood is brought into a police station. after being questioned by inspector carella, it emerges that the young girl, patricia, and her sister muriel were attacked by a man who killed the sister and only just allowed patricia to flee. however, as the investigation goes on, patricia goes back to the station to give new evidence, which reveals a far more shocking identity to the murderer.the performances in this film are excellent. donald sutherland is subdued as usual, but he suits the role he's given here very well and i wouldn't hesitate to name his performance in blood relatives as one of his very best. the film also features supporting turns from british stars donald pleasance and david hemmings who both give good turns; pleasance in particular who shows just how great an actor he can be and highlights what a shame it is that he went on to waste himself in halloween films. the unknown aude landry also gives a great performance in her role as patricia. the movie is very mysterious for the first hour and really keeps the audience hooked. when inspector carella discovers muriel's diary, the film turns into more of a drama in which the girl's last actions are shown; and while this section of the film is not as good as what went before it, it's still interesting and leads into a great twist at the end! overall, blood relatives is a great film that really deserves to be better seen. le boucher is a better known effort from chabrol, but for my money this is at least as good! highly recommended viewing.

when patricia newell is attacked after witnessing her cousin's murder,detective carrella searches the city for her killer.identifying the murderer after an intensive manhunt,patricia is sent to live with relatives in the country.for carrella the case is closed...or is it?"blood relatives" is an overlooked masterpiece.donald sutherland plays a cop and it's nice to see donald pleasance in a small role as a child molester.the conclusion is pretty disturbing.still "blood relatives" is more of a mystery than a horror film,so fans of gore will be disappointed.a must-see for fans of old-fashioned mystery movies.9 out of 10.

eisenstein's first sound film retells the battle of the ice of 1242, when the russians under alexander nevsky defeated the livonian knights, eager to bring russia under roman catholicism. made in 1938, nevsky can be seen as a piece of propaganda: the germanic knights, with their sinister (and somewhat goofy) helmets are obvious stand-ins for the nazis. the butchery by the knights when they enter a russian town seems a prophetic warning of the massacres of world war ii. the film ends with a warning: those who came to russia with the sword will die by the sword. made in delicate black and white (somewhat reminiscent of a daguerreotype), it also marked eisenstein's return to official favor. by the late 1920s, stalin wanted soviet filmmakers to stop experimentation and made movies that would be more populist and palatable to the russian public. that stopped eisenstein's career in russia for a decade, and in nevsky he came back with his more accessible film. nevsky's strong point is in its second half, which features the battle itself, and it is justly seen as a milestone in movie history: never before (and probably never after) a battle would be so vivid in the screen. another strong point is prokofiev's beautiful, haunting soundtrack (using a composer to score a movie was completely unusual at the time). one of its weaker points: the comic relief (in the form of two simpleton russian warriors trying to woo a beautiful russian peasant) is really jarring.

at school i was taught how some shots were called and there were two directors constantly mentioned : orson welles and sergei m. eisenstein. i didn't care that much then (i was a kid!) but now i know why, eisenstein is a genius and it is a shame to see what was possible in 1938 where as almost more than a half century we're stuck with countless blank movies! some say this movie isn't worth the genius of eisenstein (then they have to watch it over and over till they can say anything bad) or even worse that it is just some propagandamovie for the russians. let's say it as it is, it is indeed pure propaganda for patriotism but isn't "saving private ryan" or "the longest day" so? i could sum up so many movies in where america is being raised to the top so why not russia, and besides every war is fought for itrs patriotism why else would they raise flags? aleksandr nevsky is a must for anyone who cares about cinematography as almost every shot is a sublime picture. perhaps it's all overseen but i am in wonder why this isn't included in imdb's top 250 where as there is so many overrated oscarcrap in it as well.

i like the phrase "british post war suburban paranoia" that one of the reviewers used. it describes so well the kind of films john mills excelled in ("the october man" (1947), "the long memory" (1952)) in between "big" pictures ("scott of the antartic" (1948) and "war and peace" (1956)).this distinctly "eric ambler" style plot had john mills playing dr. howard latimer, who promises his friend, charles, (unseen) to meet a visiting german actress, frieda veldon (lisa daniely) at the airport. a creepy "reporter" jeffrey windsor (lionel jeffries) is in his consulting rooms at the time and offers to give him a lift but while he is tracking the actress down windsor informs him she is already in the car waiting!!! (something fishy is going on!!!). howard is dropped off for his date and thinks no more about it.the next night he finds her body when he arrives home from work, further more, he finds his friend charles could not have rung him as he is still in new york and windsor doesn't seem to exist. earlier on a patient, mrs ambler(rene ray) who has been referred to him by doctor george kimber (mervyn johns) tells of her recurring dream about finding a dead body and a brass candlestick with a square base. it is a nightmare that is coming true for howard but of course when detective inspector dane (roland culver) interviews her, she denies all knowledge of the conversation - the candlestick is later found in the boot of howard's daimler.when howard is lying low, robert brady (wilfred hyde-white) visits him. he calls himself a "friend" - he has a photo of windsor that he wants to trade for a box of matches frieda gave howard at the airport. howard returns to the flat, charles rings and while howard is on the phone an unknown assailant knocks him out and steals the matches!!! who can he trust - who hasn't something to hide!!!this is a top thriller - not quite in the same class as "the october man", but with john mills doing what he does best - playing ordinary men caught up in impossible mysteries!!!highly recommended.

the film is a remake of a 1956 bbc serial called'my friend charles',& as such gallops thru the material in a relatively short time.i found it fast moving,enjoyable & unpretentious.did anyone else notice the scenes,towards the end,where john mills was being gassed?-the producers obviously decided to omit the scenes-maybe censorship?,but notice when he's sat by the window of the flat,deep breathing closely followed by similar scenes with the car window open. the francis durbridge serials all seemed to inhabit the same universe,that of unexplained happenings,people being not what they seem & the villain being someone close to the hero/victim.a predictable universe in some ways,but one with its own rules & regulations.

"the vicious circle" is a very unknown british mystery story. like many hitchcock movies, it's about a man who is being accused of a crime he didn't commit, and does everything he can to prove it. this time it's a dr. latimer (john mills), who finds a murdered german actress from his floor. as an honest man, the doctor calls scotland yard, which turns out to be a big mistake...there's really nothing special in this little movie. still, watching the film is an entertaining way to pass time. i enjoyed following the plot development. fine actors are a plus.

this is a plot driven movie and extremely entertaining. nothing startling or original within the plot, but crucially, it moves along at a great pace and therefore keeps your attention. i didn't really notice the acting which i guess is a good thing. john mills was fine but did seem to take everything in his stride somewhat considering how his life was falling apart around him. he would be clumped on the head, stand up 20 seconds later, dust himself down and carry on as if nothing had happened. a minor quibble in a film with a strong story, authentic locations and a plot that continually keeps you guessing right up to its conclusion.

yes, i am sentimental, and yes, i love movies where kids are the better humans. true, klatretøsen does have some logical or even plot shortcomings. these are more than compensated by the kids' great acting (julias first movie role at all!) and the charm of a dogma film (i liked this kind of cinematografic art long before the dogma; ever since herzog's 'herz aus glas'). well, i cried through the last fifteen minutes which is a higher tear factor than bambi or fly away home had for me.

klatret©ªsen(catch that girl) is really great movie! it's a 'happy' movie. i watched this movie in 'puchon international fantastic film festival(pifan)' on july 12nd, 2003. there is action + adventure + comedy + thrill + happy + romance(cute kids' love triangle!). you must see this movie. :)

i just saw this movie at the berlin film festival's children's program and it just killed me (and pretty much everyone else in the audience)! and make no mistake about it, this film belongs into the all-time-250! let me tell you that i'm in no way associated with the creators of this film if that's what you come to believe reading this. no, but this actually is it! nevermind the "kid's-film" label on it, "klatretösen" ("climber girl") is on almost every account a classic (as in "biblical")! the story concerns 12-year old ida (magnetic: julie zangenberg), who is devastated to learn of her daddy's terminal illness. special surgery in the us would cost 1.5 million and of course, nobody could afford that. so ida and her friends jonas and sebastian do what every good kid would - and burglarize a bank! sounds corny? don't forget: this is not america and "klatretösen" is by no means the tear-jerking robin-williams-multiplex-plat-du-jour nobody takes seriously anyway. director fabian wullenweber set out to make a big-budget-action-comedy for kids and, boy, did he succeed! let me put it this way: this film rocks like no kid-film and few others did before. and there's a whole lot more to it than just the "action". after about 20 minutes of by-the-numbers-exposition (well, granted) it accelerates into a monster that:- effortlessly puts "mission impossible" to shame (the numerous action sequences are masterfully staged and look real expensive - take that, mummy!)- dwarves almost every other movie suspense-wise ( no easy-they're-only-kids-antics here )- easily laces a dense story with enough laughs to make jim carrey look for career alternatives- nods to both damon runyon and karate kid within the same seconds- comes up with so much wicked humor that side of p.c. that i can hear the american ratings board wet their pants from over here- manages to actually be tender and serious and sexy at the same time (ohmygod, what am i saying?? they're kids! they're kids! - nevermind, watch that last scene!)- stars stafan pagels anderson, who since last years "mirakel" is everybody's favourite kid actorwhat a ride!

this movie is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is. it is a movie both for children and parents, and it is "timeless". i saw this movie before ocean's eleven and must admit that the actors in oe has class in advance, but the play of klatretøsen is much more down-to-earth and moving. why i say ocean's eleven, is the fact that these 2 movies has many things in common and klatretøsen is that good ! that it can bear comparison with oe. the 3 youngsters play their part in a perfect way not to believe, compared to what we are used to in denmark. the different cases of impossible acts, is handled in a way that you wouldn't belive from many young actors (and sometimes not even from the "old boys"). the story ? again it has things in common with ocean's eleven except for the reason of stealing the money and in klatretøsen they need to climb up to the strongroom. the part in which the young people has to take care of ida's younger brother, gives a fine element in the movie. try to imagine how to rob a bank with a 2 year child with a nappy, on your arm :-).this movie can bear comparison with most "grown up" movie like mi2 and ocean's eleven. yes i do believe it is that good. it is best to see it in a theater, as all the children in the room comments the movie and these comments will stay in your hearts forever :-).regards klavs.

this satire is just really, really dead-on, and nobody is spared. but even though this movie has plenty of laughs within the silly story and the grotesque imitation of hitler (here cleverly renamed as "hynkel", and speaking in a hilarious kind of pseudo-german), the general tone is pretty sad, maybe because of the movie's place in history. and the actors aren't even exaggerating that much i suppose. one of the greatest movie moments of all time must be the jewish barber's ending speech, if only things could have ended in that way. it's not even really the character talking anymore, it's chaplin saying something he really wanted to say. if you ignore the technical aspects, the movie doesn't feel dated or old, it actually moves at a pretty nice pace. and the sharp humor we find everywhere in this work will never die, the only thing i don't care for is the slapstick, but that just comes with the era i suppose. this is an incredibly daring, harsh take on fascism, it's so hard-hitting still after all these years.

this was charlie chaplin's first all-talking film. yes, there had been a little bit of sound and speaking inserted into his previous film, modern times, but it was still essentially a silent film. so, it wasn't until 1940 that the public got to hear chaplin speak on film.the movie is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation. while i enjoyed the film, i was not nearly as impressed by this as chaplin's other full-length films of the mid-20s and 30s. that's because i really felt annoyed by some of chaplin's dopey over-acting when he played adenoid hynkel--especially when he was giving his speeches. the silly pseudo-dialog just seemed akin to something a lesser comedian would have used (such as the three stooges). plus, playing a funny hitler is hard for me to take.however, when chaplin played the jewish barber, he wasn't especially funny (he really wasn't intended to be a funny character) but he was a tremendous voice for reason and decency. this film should not be remembered as a comedy (especially since it doesn't really excel there), but for its excellent acting and humanity. the final speech by the barber (impersonating hynkel) is brilliant and almost brought tears to my eyes. watch the film for this reason alone.

great comedy from charlie chaplin. i've seen chaplin's 4 major films (gold rush, city lights, modern times, and the great dictator), and i think it is easily the funniest of the four. this movie had me laughing more than almost any other i've ever seen. from the very opening disclaimer ("any similarity between the great dictator and the barber shop owner is purely coincidental") the movie is a laugh-a-minute with a blend of wonderful slapstick and verbal humor. and at the same time, chaplin manages to portray the evils of totalitarian persecution. maybe a little short on the ending and the lasting timeliness of the subject matter, but easily a 9 out of 10 for me.

this was chaplin's first all-talking picture, and the results are mixed. the movie is a biting satire of hitler and mussolini, their henchmen and their fanatical way of life, especially regarding the persecution of the jews. it was daring and forward for 1940 and must have made a lot of people squirm.when compared to chaplin's earlier works, this is quite pale in comparison. the sweet, funny style of his silents, in my opinion, is far superior to his first talkie. there are lots of meaningless bits that drag on. if this was a silent, it probably would not have happened.i find one of the funniest moments to be the musical barber moment and the globe dance. one of the most touching moments is, obviously, the speech at the end.the great dictator is an effective and at times moving film that is a very big part of both chaplin's history and movie history. it is flawed, but chaplin is in great form.

most of this film is an alternately hilarious and brutal satire on nazism and fascism, made at the height of those movements' success.sadly, in the final moments of the film, chaplin abandons all pretense of making art (not to mention comedy) and switches completely to propaganda. and not anti-nazi propaganda, either, but some of the most mawkish and idiotic "progressive" propaganda ever to ooze out of hollywood.never mind that nothing we have seen so far indicates that the barber is even capable of giving the speech we see him give (delivered, ironically, with a disturbing wild-eyed fanaticism); such trivialities must not be permitted to interfere with the message.

written, produced and directed by charlie chaplin, this is the great actor's anti-nazi propaganda piece, skewering adolf hitler.chaplin plays adenoid hynckel, the dictator of tomania, as well as a jewish barber who is hynckel's spitting image. his parody of hitler is brilliant. anyone who has ever seen newsreels of hitler speaking will recognize the eerie resemblance of the caricature. i thought the movie got off to a slow start with some typical chaplin slap-stick focussing on the first world war adventures of the jewish barber. having never seen it before i must confess that after the first 20 minutes or so i was wondering what all the fuss was about. but the movie picks up steam quickly. there are some very funny moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-jewish nature of "hynckel-ism" to make the propaganda point. the climax of the film is a brilliant anti-nazi speech given by chaplin at the end of the movie.as good as chaplin is in this movie, though, i thought the whole thing was stolen by jack oakie, playing the dictator of "bacteria" - "benzino napaloni." our first look at oakie shows how well he had studied his subject - he had mussolini's arrogant posturing down pat. the scenes in which hynckel and napaloni negotiate over the fate of "osterlich" had me in stitches.this was a very good movie, and well worth watching.

although i haven't seen it yet, i know that chaplin is a genius, and only someone of his talent would take on this daring subject matter--a comedy about hitler. all great satire is based on going out on an edge. also, all great comedy deals with the other side--pathos. this film seems like it will skirt both sides. like kubrick's dr. strangelove, the great dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire. the only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it. and hopefully, through laughter, we can learn to view the world in a new light. another film that does this that comes to my mind is emir kusturica's underground, and fando and lis. so, let me watch the film first.

a good, but not great film, "the great dictator" is chaplin's first talkie. it's a good effort, and at times a remarkable satire on hitler, but unfortunately the moments of chaplin brilliance on offer here are let down by a tendency to use too much unnecessary dialogue. yes, chaplin, the silent screen master, just uses too many words in this film, and his tendency towards writing long speeches and extraneous passages of dialogue would carry over into his other talkie films, such as (better) "limelight". still, chaplin was extremely daring in even making this film and his performance in dual roles is certainly memorable. paulette goddard doesn't have the glow she did in "modern times" (her off-screen affair with chaplin was cooling at the time), but she is always worth seeing, and jack oakie just about steals the show as a rival dictator to chaplin's famous creation hynkel.

this must have been one of chaplin's most ambitious projects; he throws in virtually everything, from visual gags and blackout comedy sketches to social relevance, romance, even some violence. the mixture is challenging and intriguing, and the film has many entertaining and clever sequences (like the one where chaplin and four other guys try to avoid finding a coin that will order their self-sacrifice), but the ingredients don't always click together, and the mix (and tone) seem kind of disharmonious. as for the famous final speech, though undeniably honest, it also seems a bit naive today, with its allusions to "a better world where man will overcome his hate and brutality, and his soul will fly". great perfornmances by jack oakie and the beautiful paulette goddard. (***)

being quite a fan of charlie chaplin following good vibes after seeing first 'the gold rush' and then 'city lights', i was eager to see 'the great dictator' as i had been told this was, arguably, his best film. i was also intrigued at the fact it was a talkie; my first one, chaplin-wise.the start is typical chaplin and blatant proof that when it comes to sound, chaplain can cut it whilst not solely relying on music to set mood and to do the talking; it's funny, well timed and the elements of slapstick such as falling off an anti-aircraft gun are well tied in with the jokes. it was good to draw the viewer in with this 'classic chaplin' opening and at the same time, kick start the narrative of characters getting to know one another. what was also well done was the way in which hitler is spoofed. any scene involving hitler or 'hynkel' in this film, was funny and even now; makes you think back as you know exactly who he's spoofing and does create an internal reaction of some kind. the way in which english in mixed in with the mock german during the dialogue scenes is further proof of the way chaplin managed to adapt to the talkie era. my favourite joke was the five minute speech hynkel gave, only for the english translator to translate it into a mere few words; making you think back to footage of hitler you may have seen giving a speech at some point in your life and, indeed, laugh at him.historically, the film got a few things right as well. hynkel is seen getting his photograph taken with children; something hitler did for recognition as he manipulated the media but here, hynkel is seen to yawn and act bored; stabbing at hitler's underhand technique of winning over the german public through sympathy (oh, he hugs and kisses children. he must be ok!). the film is also given a fantastic premise of a jewish civilian reinstalled into the ghetto amongst all the travesties going on but with the catch that he is oblivious. films such as 'the pianist' and 'come and see' are two good examples of nazi cruelty towards 'inferior' people which nowadays, we can all look back on and shake our heads at whereas back in the late 1930's when this was filmed, the fact he had the cruelty going on and was exploiting it makes it even more an astounding achievement. chaplin has managed to replace guns and truncheons for tomatoes and saucepans and still pulls it off.what i didn't like about the film, however, was the fact it settled into an actual narrative after the opening. this slowed the film up and this is very noticeable as the foot was taken off the gas somewhat. the film started to hint at stories and sub-stories. these included the barber and the female neighbour falling in love and the supposed destruction of hynkel's palace whereas none of these were actually developed. the 'giving a woman a shave' and the 'whoever has the coin in their pudding does the deed' gags were hinting at these plot paths but in the end, just materialised into nothing but excuses for drawn out, unfunny gags which was disappointing.during the final straight, the great dictator gets a boost from the fact the italian dictator is introduced who adds some much needed life and excuse for comedy to the film. it works a treat as we see them argue and more underhand tactics are exploited when hynkel attempts to 'overpower' his italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks (although, they are humorously foiled). despite a few weaknesses in pacing during the middle segment and the fact i felt the message at the end was a little forced down my throat, the great dictator holds up for viewing today but that's only because he took the gamble of exploiting things nobody else really knew were there.

chaplin stars in a dual role as a jewish barber who, with amnesia, is mistaken for the dictator adenoid hynkel, (i.e hitler) a movie made in 1940 when the war was in its dark days and was in no way won by the allies..it was banned in germany by hitler and was a risk in a way for chaplin because if the war was lost, he surely wouldve been sent away to be "reeducated"a funny satire with the classic scene of hitler tossing around a giant balloon of the world..good fun but with a message..a little preachy in the end. this was the last movie with chaplin's trademark little mustache. on a scale of one to ten..9

okay, it's too long and it's too satisfied with itself. still, "the great dictator" is a fascinating movie. chaplin does a terrific job satirizing hitler and trying to portray the oppression of the jews in nazi germany (this was before the concentration camps were common knowledge). not a chaplin masterpiece, but still worth seeing.

one of the best and most exciting of all conspiracy thrillers, (there were a number of such film in the 1970's). this one is about an accident at a neuclear reactor and of the attempts to cover it up. jack lemmon is the employee who realizes just how dangerous the plant is and jane fonda is the crusading television reporter who takes the story on board and both players are at their best.the events portrayed in the film are, of course, terrifying and not in the least bit far-fetched, (much of what happens here happened in real life at three mile island), and although it now looks like something a period piece it, nevertheless, highlights just how fragile and dangerous a world we have created for ourselves. expect a number of similar films about the effects of global warming any time soon, (and not rubbish like "the day after tomorrow" either).

i thoroughly enjoyed this film when it was first released, and on each occasion i've seen it since. the political drama is effective, if not especially new or inspired. the decades since the release of the film have demonstrated that the willingness to cut costs at the expense of public safety is definitely not just something imagined by a screenwriter.however, i think the most impressive element of this film is jack lemmon's performance. it is absolutely astonishing to watch him at work. he has the gift to be able to communicate so much, at times without saying a word. next time you watch this film, check out jack's face at the times he is not saying anything. he does not need to speak (or worse yet, to mug) to let you know what's going through his mind.i am calling this a spoiler, because of the impression it made on me when i first saw the film: in lemmon's last scene in the film, as he is lying on the floor, he feels a slight vibration. the terror in his eyes is one of the most frightening images i have seen in any film. it is perfect acting, because it conveys instantly the threat about to occur--if jack's character is so terrified, there is certainly something awful about to happen. and it does.

tv newscaster kimberly wells (jane fonda) and her radical camerman richard adams (michael douglas) are at a nuclear power plant when a serious accident happens. the plants managers play it down but adams has filmed it all. wells and adams try to get it on the air but the corporation that runs the plant prevents it. plant executive jack godell (jack lemmon) realizes there are serious problems and tests have been falsified. he tries to get executives to believe him--only they know it. wells, adams and godell find all their lives are in danger.i saw this in a movie theatre in 1979. i was only 17 and it scared me silly. to make matters worse the three mile island accident happened around this time making the movie all that more real. seeing it over 20 years later it doesn't scare me but it still is an excellent film--it works as a mystery, a gripping drama and an expose on the nuclear power industry. fonda (with red hair) has one of her best roles as wells--she perfectly conveys her character's growing suspicion and horror when she realizes a nuclear disaster could happen. lemmon is (as always) excellent. he starts out believing in his company and the job and slowly starts to unravel when he starts finding things out. he was rightfully nominated for an academy award for this. douglas is good but he has a small part and is completely overshadowed by lemmon and fonda.a really great film--one of the best of the 70s. don't miss this one!

bridges's drama about a reporter who discovers some flaws in the safety precautions taken at a nuclear powerplant is directed well and a pretty interesting film from the late 70s. its not amazing, but its solid, the acting is pretty good especially jack lemmon, but douglas and fonda were good too. it was a pretty good screenplay and bridges's direction was solid and suitable. this is definitely not one of the best films of the 70s, but its one of the better ones. a good early michael douglas film and lemmon in his prime.--- imdb rating: 7.2, my rating:, so in simple words, solid but not amazing... thats what this film is, solid but not amazing 8/10

all the right elements seemed to conspire here to make this a memorable thriller for years to come. you have the stellar cast - michael douglas in an uncharacteristic 'free-spirit' role that pretty much launched his movie career, fonda playing her typical forthright female doing her bit for womens lib, and jack lemmon as assured as ever showing us a man with a crisis of confidence. give them a hot-button topic about big business being duplicitous, and that's encouraging for a kickoff, but to have life imitating art so soon after is a marketing man's dream.the script is impressively taut, intelligent but mercifully keeping the jargon to a minimum, and there is a genuine sense of sustained tension brought in play by the director as our three protagonists race to beat the clock. if you like 'whistle blowing' dramas, then this is not quite as good as "the insider", but the whole thing is more than nervy enough.

when the china syndrome was released, plenty of right-wing critics and pro-nuke supporters blasted this film, particularly since its three leading stars were all known for their liberal politics and their overt distrust of nuclear power. but it only took two weeks and a near-catastrophic accident at three mile island to shut those critics up.fonda and douglas are the l.a. news crew that witness a potentially nasty accident at the ventana nuclear power plant. douglas films the event through the plant's soundproof glass; but the tv station will not air the footage, fearing a massive lawsuit. it is thus up to fonda and douglas to get at the truth, despite a massive attempt by the plant's owners to cover up the accident.but a conscientious shift supervisor (jack lemmon) has uncovered certain defects in the plant's pump support structure. he believes that these defects were the cause of the accident and that, though it would be extremely costly and lengthy, if repairs aren't made, the next accident could be apocalyptic. but he can't get anyone who works with him to believe his story. the result is a nightmarish climax that pulls various political, technological, and human interest stories together in one disturbing package.while obviously quite politically liberal in nature, the china syndrome, well directed and co-written by james bridges (the paper chase), is also fundamentally a message movie about the inherent dangers of putting technology and nuclear power together. fundamentally, nuclear power can never be made safe because people can never be perfect. that is what the film is saying; and in a highly entertaining and suspenseful way, it says it brilliantly.

the first thing you see in this film is a static angle(one which will be repeated later in the film), depicting the chaos going on(unseen to the audience) in a studio that airs news. soon after, fonda's character's typical story is shown, in that same angle. don't let this mislead you; the film is not about a female reporter, a woman struggling to succeed in a male-dominated profession. that is merely a lead-in, a way of starting the film(though it's used later). the actual point to this production is revealed gradually, and the first we see of it is in a deliberately long scene early on. the entire film has that pace; not slow or drawn-out, but deliberate. it's never really fast, even in the few sequences that one would normally expect to be so. this pacing(especially because it seems to slow down further as the plot is revealed, as the disturbing, unsettling nature of the film is unraveled) is strong, almost painful to the viewer. it inspires you to, if it had been possible, jump into the screen, grab the people responsible by the collar and yell at them to *do* something about it, to remedy the situation. never once did i feel like getting up or even taking my eyes off the screen for a moment. the subject is extremely important to be aware of, and it's handled perfectly here. no over-dramatization(well... very little, anyway), just an accurate presentation of the issue. the direction is astounding. the empathy felt for lemmon's character is profound. the editing is masterful... one scene near the very end illustrates that perfectly. the editor, judging from his filmography, is vastly underrated. the writing was excellent. the acting was great, in particular by lemmon, fonda and douglas(who also produced it). the lack of a score is perfect; no music is needed to enhance. the ending is sublime and effective. the movie does have a few negative points... among them, some of the dialog is obviously and undeniably mainly exposition, one particular part of the film, whilst dramatic, doesn't seem to mesh with something that follows it. not everyone will watch the film because of two features of it which are commonly (and rightfully so) attributed to bad movies; the pacing(which can be mistaken as being slow) and the (lack of) score. one could argue that to be a negative thing, as everyone ought to consider the points it presents, but maybe it's better this way; handling the heavy subject with the intelligence and respect(for the topic as well as the viewer)... something like this, maybe it shouldn't be spoon-fed. i was mesmerized with the film, and left very taken aback. i recommend this to anyone who believe themselves strong enough to handle it. 9/10

intelligent, nail-biting drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and soon was on the cover of every newspaper in america (when life imitated the film). a nuclear power plant employee in southern california is threatened by superiors when he decides to go public with the real story behind an accident at the plant. ostensibly a stuck valve problem, a tv news-crew's film shows that it was an accident verging on disastrous proportions--and worse, that safety conditions are being scrubbed to save millions of dollars, a cover-up that endangers everyone's lives. the movie occasionally gets too technical (especially in the second-half) and could use more human interplay, however the performances by jack lemmon, jane fonda (as a puff-piece news-woman in the right place at the right time), and michael douglas (as a freelance cameraman) are superb. the throwaway bits involving nuclear protesters is both entirely accurate and bitterly satirical, and the news-biz (with its corporate structure and vapid yes-men) is vividly captured. ***1/2 from ****

i normally don't comment on movies on imdb, but in this case i feel like i should. i love movies, and i want to make them, and this movie is a perfect example of fine filmmaking.this is one of the few movies that i have seen on the small screen (originally seeing it air on amc, i believe, and then on the dvd i just watched) that made me get that feeling in the pit of my stomach. that little gnawing sensation that the director would hope you feel while watching his thriller.jack lemmon's performance is a fine one, and jane fonda and michael douglas follow. i felt so much empathy of lemmon, who's character jack godell, only wanted people to listen to his warning.but what impresses me most about this film is the lack of a score, and this is also what makes it beautiful to me. apart from the opening titles there are no background music to increase the tension, because none is needed. and while the credits run, white on black, in silence it drives the point home.i use the movie as an example to anyone who says music makes the movie. i think the movie should make the movie and the music should only amplify that. but for the china syndrome music is not necessary to get across the realism and the urgency depicted here. the characters portray all of this far better than the music ever could.i highly recommend this movie, it is one of my favorites. if you like movies, you won't be disappointed. if you like movie soundtracks more, you might not want to give this one a go.

although the premise of the movie involves a major "coincidence," the actors all do a creditable job and look great bringing the story to life. i found myself rooting for the characters played by mary tyler moore and christine lahti, empathizing with both, and wanting them to reconcile. sam waterston and ted danson are fine in their roles as well, doing a decent job with the stereotypical buddy relationship. while the story tends to leap through time, occasionally leaving the audience perhaps a little hungry for missing detail, it still flows and avoids any real confusion. this interesting storyline has all the elements for a good "chick flick."

christine lahti (sandy dunlap) and mary tyler moore (holly davis) worked well with soapish material, ted danson did his best with a thankless role of chip davis the premise of this that the two ladies' friendship, one a seemingly happily married woman and the other a career woman who is aware of her biological clock ticking. i found the relationship that ted danson's character had with the single woman played by christine lahti's rather sordid. he behaved in a caddish way, yet he left two "widows" pining over him, bawling. i found it revolting when when sandy told him she wanted to break it off after meeting his wife, he calls her saying he misses her (did he call his wife? there was no sign of that). he behaved like a heel. it perhaps would have made a more interesting film had he not been killed off. perhaps both ladies would have wised up and dumped him. i liked the friendship between the two ladies but it was spoiled by what they had in common: the cad of a husband.

saw this movie when it came out and then a couple more times years later. i'm watching it now 20 years later and it's still a very good story. does it wreak of "lifetime movie network"? yes, but alas lifetime was not even in existence back then so it needed somehwere to air.the cast was excellent. the story was a little schmaltzy; two women become close friends and unbeknownst to either one friend is having an affair with he other friends husband. she's invited over to the house for a dinner party which is how she discovers that her lover is the husband of her best friend. she is horrified and tries to break off the affair. shortly afterwards he is tragically killed in a car accident which is devatating for both women. of course the wife finds out by accident about this affair and wants holly out of her life now, but their friendship is able to prevail because they need each other.i thought it was a very good story a great cast and perfomrances. i really enjoyed it.

ever wonder where that episode, "tuttle," came from in the middle of the first season of m*a*s*h? well now the cat's out of the bag: they got it from this soviet film, a satire on how dumb the tsar is, due to the slip of a pen (rendering the phrase "the lieutenants, though ..." into "lieutenant kizhe" which has no meaning) and nobody being honest or gutsy enough to contradict him and just tell him the truth -- kizhe doesn't exist and never did. so they make up an imaginary life for him and eventually kill him off. and 40 years later, david ketchum and bruce shelly borrowed this zany plot and gave us essentially the same story, only on the other side of what had become the cold war, proving that people in high positions can be equally dumb no matter what their loyalties may be!

i went to see this film out of curiosity, and to settle an argument. the film is now best known from the suite of music sergei prokofiev extracted from his incidental music to the film, the troika movement even turning up in pop arrangements. the general outline of the plot is well known from the sleeve notes on various recordings. a clerk accidentally generates a non-existent lieutenant kizhe in a list to be presented to the tsar. the tsar is interested in this person, and rather than tell him he doesn't exist, the courtiers and officers maintain the pretence that he is real. kizhe is exiled to siberia, recalled, promoted, married, promoted again, dies, is given a state funeral, revealed as an embezzler and posthumously demoted to the ranks.i had heard conflicting stories about how the clerk invented kizhe, involving ink blots and sneezes, but i'd heard the film was lost, so there was no way to find out what happens. then the film turned up at the barbican in london as part of their prokofiev festival. for the record, it turned out that all that happens is that the clerk confuses two words whilst writing an order and turns kuzhe into kizhe. as the tsar is in a hurry to see the order, there's no time to correct the mistake.having gone expecting an historical curiosity, i was pleasantly surprised. the film is very funny, and the audience, myself included, laughed continuously. although most of it is filmed straight, set mostly in the palace, there are a few "trick" shots where multiple images appear on the screen. for instance, the tsar's army is represented by a small group, repeated across the screen. four identical guards perform perfect drill in perfect unison. two identical servants scrub the floor.one slight drawback was it was very difficult to work out who everyone was. there were two women who might have been the tsar's daughters, or a daughter and a servant or something else. and very few people were named. but all in all, an enjoyable film and i'm surprised it's not seen more often.

this is the true story of the great pianist and jazz singer/legend ray charles (oscar, bafta and golden globe winning jamie foxx). he was born in a poor african american-town, and he went blind at 7 years old, but with his skills of touch and hearing, this is what would later in life would lead him to stardom. by the 1960's he had accomplished his dream, and selling records in millions, and leading the charts with songs and albums. but the story also showed his downfalls, including the separation from his wife and child, because of his affair with a band member , his drug and alcohol use, and going to prison because of this. also starring regina king as margie hendricks, kerry washington as della bea robinson, clifton powell as jeff brown, harry j. lennix as joe adams, bokeem woodbine as fathead newman, aunjanue ellis as mary ann fisher, sharon warren as aretha robinson, c.j. sanders as young ray robinson, curtis armstrong as ahmet ertegun and richard schiff as jerry wexler. it is a great story with a great singer impression, the songs, including hit the road jack, are the highlights. it won the oscar for best sound mixing, and it was nominated for best costume design, best director for taylor hackford, best editing and best motion picture of the year, it won the bafta for best sound, and it was nominated for the anthony asquith award for film music for craig armstrong and best original screenplay, and it was nominated the golden globe for best motion picture - musical or comedy. it was number 99 on 100 years, 100 cheers. very good!

brilliant biographic film..well this certainly is one of my very fav. biographic movie. this movie came as a total surprise to me. i had been avoiding this movie for a very very long time. now that was because i am not a fan of jamie foxx. i still am not a big fan of him but i sure am a fan now.well he deserved every bit of that oscar. his performance is one of the best performances i have seen in a long long time. he is truly sensational!well the narration, or the flow of the story is brilliant for a biographical movie. i am a drama fan so i wasn't bored at all.i was way too much surprised to have being liking the movie so much that i did not see any flaws in the movie. i think there isn't any flaw in the movie. maybe some events errors but hey who cares?the performance by the woman who plays ray's mother was also really good. and well kerry washington  she has so much potential.. if given the right role she might just be the next oscar winner.well the story of them movie was so emotional so touching.. i cried i cried very badlyi don't give a damn if the things were mad- up or not cuz this movie mad me cry and that's a lot for me!all in all a superb film. one of the very best of this century!10/10

ray charles robinson (jamie foxx) is a extremely talented pianist and singer as well. ray is an smart man as well. ray started his career in the late 1940's before he finds his distinctive style. ray is certainly popular at the night clubs with his music. things changes, when he meets an ambitious music producer (curtis armstrong). who knows ray got what it takes to be an strong performer and he also meets an woman (kerry washington), he loves as well & marries along the way. ray's album becomes an hit, when he mixes soul music and gospel together. which makes ray an controversial man during in the 1950's to the 1960's. ray has love for all kind of music, including country. but ray isn't always the perfect man as he seems to be. since he had plenty of failed relationship with other woman, while he's married. but he also had to battle with racism, people who double-crossed him, his music ideals and of course, his drug addiction. which it made ray's life extremely difficult for him and as well for battling the tragedy of his childhood. which ray always blamed himself for.directed by oscar-winner:taylor hackford (against all odds, devil's advocate, dolores claiborne) made an fascinating true-life story of the always interesting of the late "ray charles". foxx won an oscar for his touching performance of the late entertainer. foxx brings heart and soul in the film and humour as well. but this film has plenty of rich performances by an top cast including:regina king, clifton powell, bokeem woodbine, aunjaune ellis, warwick davis, terrence howard and sharon warren as ray's mother. this is probably the best film of hackford's career to date. the film has plenty of song of charles's best music as well.dvd has an sharp pan & scan (1.33:1) transfer and an excellent dolby digital 5.1 surround sound. disc 1 has an informative commentary by the director and the dvd also has the original theatrical cut and extended version as well. but u are better watching the theatrical version instead, because the bonus footage is in bad shape at times and u have to click on a logo if you want to see these deleted scenes. disc 2 has deleted scenes with optional commentary by the director (which is seen in the extended version), featurettes and more. but the featurettes are disappointingly short for this dvd. since the movie is extraordinary good. this film was nominated four oscars including best costume designs, best director, best editing and best picture. this is an amazing true-life story well told but of course, charles' life was even more controversial and outrageous than the final film. still, it's pretty damn close. screenplay by james l. white. from an story by white and director:hackford. oscar-winner for best sound. don't miss it. (**** ½/*****).

a lecture over the life of the tormented magician named ray charles. his pulses on the piano made fire music and his nostalgic voice created exciting, cool tunes. each barrier that ray was facing never kept him down, and he found his way all over conflicts. a real lesson. a great team of producers help recreate the era and armed with great costumes, hairs and settings one will follow ray's story believing its true, direct filming! an icy music freezes and goosebumps the audience with clever sound editing. but, the most important part of the movie is jamie foxx. his acting is really superb, the most diamond polished acting ever seen. he lives his role. he is the ray of light.

the filming is cheesy. some of the actors overact. some of the actions are unexplained and unexplainable. but...this movie is in the mode of the psychological dramas of the 50s.it is a morality play. similar to the movie in which a "method" actor becomes the evil character he portrays on stage, ed is forced to watch slasher movies because he is the film editor. it gives him a nervous breakdown which leads to a complete psychotic break.

on monday, earlier this week, sometime in july, i happened to be under the influence of the sweet leaf, and me being a horror fan, wanted to see something scary. i was thinking of the ammityville horror 2, but i got something way better. i was at my friend's house, and he had the vhs evil ed. no cover or anything, he didn't even see the whole thing himself, but he told me it was about "a guy who goes crazy and kills a lot of people." well, this movie was very shocking,i've never seen the actual brutal nature of sadistic violence until this movie, it buries ted bundy and ed gein both! it is pretty funny too, with references to the evil dead trilogy( and plus the evil dead 2 poster is everywhere in the movie!) the movie is about edward, a obsessive-compulsive, nice guy, who happens to be a film editor. he is then lent to another department in the building, and he is sent to the posh yet violent world of sam campbell, the splatter and gore department. sam campbell, eddy's new boss, is telling eddy about the big break on his movies, the gruesome loose limbs series, and he needs eddy to make the movie somewhat less violent so they can be shown all over europe. eddy has his regrets soon, as the images and scenes that are displayed to him from the lonely suburban house he is sent to work in, and then, what happens from there is truly nightmarish. imagine yourself in his place! the acting is great, the overdubbing is little funny (sam campbell's voice is often found funny, same with the other actors). however, the overdubbing job was done pretty good, i give this movie a 10/10, and it's a good introduction to the gore sub-genre to horror. very good, nightmarish, bloody.......you just have to see it for yourself.quote from movie: "where in the f**k is my beaver rape scene?!"

i think this is the best norwegian movie i've ever seen. it's about 40-year old andreas who gets hit by a subway-train, and suddenly finds himself in a strange city, however, everything here has been made ready for him. he has got a job, a house and clothes. at first, this city seems perfect, no death, no pain and no problems. everywhere there are men in gray suits who cleans up and fixes everything that doesn't fit into their definition of perfect. however andreas can't really seem to fit in and starts to long back to his old world, and tries with all means to get back. the thing that impresses my the most in this movie is how they way of making the city seem so surrealistic, even though i have seen a lot of these places in real life they seem so distant. another thing that contributes greatly to the is the performance from the actors. trond fausa aurvaag is just the perfect guy to play the confused and bothersome andreas. and all the other characters are also doing a great job by playing apathetic (sounds like a hard job, doesn't it?). the strong difference between andreas and the others leads to very amusing situations as well. all in all, this is a fabulous movie. the plot may be a little confusing, but the movie has such a great atmosphere i would recommend that everyone should go see it. and i wouldn't recommend listening to "ccscd212", as it seems he has seen too many commercial american movies and seems to have became too used to just getting served the moral on a silver plate. the way i see it there is not much in this film that tries to tell us about suicide being right or wrong. i consider it more of a warning of a direction our society seems to be taking. but sure, everyone can see a film in their own way.

totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it. this movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way. what it is about? estrangement, i believe. probably up to the viewer, but i found that this movie tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and perfect facades. don't know if i'm right. but this movie really got to me. see it. i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style. and i forgot: the casting here i superb, with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why. the acknowledgment of not understanding the purpose of life (in the city), is what makes him bothersome. all the others do as they are told, and pretend (?) to be happy. this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.

i heard an interview with the main actor who said that the film was not intended to be a horror movie but he himself would describe it as mental horror. i strongly subscribe to that.it is not clear why he travels to this place, but everything there is monotonous, no bright colors, no honest smiles, nothing personal. everything is ordered and everyone seems to be satisfied living this kind of life. our "hero" though from the beginning seems to be misplaced and feels it himself. what makes this film so important and good is the remarkable similarity to life in many large cities or even countries nowadays. you have to function, you are not supposed to let your colleague know your weaknesses, you show off on your wealth, your car, etc., and most of all you lack the true love of life that children have. naturally, in this film you see neither children nor old people - they simply do not fit in a society of strong workers.i would recommend this film to everyone - and make sure that this utopia does not come true!

imagine a world, in which everyone treats anyone nicely, no foul word is ever uttered, office bickering is nonexistent, and your boss invites the office crowd regularly to self-cooked dinners where you can chat about latest interior design styles. everything is neat, pleasant - well, just nice. in other words: you are in hell. after being dropped off in the middle of nowhere, mid-thirties andreas (trond fausa aurvaag) starts a new job as a book-keeper in a small, clean city. from the beginning he feels foreign in this proper, impersonal world of superficial kindness, surrounded by pleasant but lifeless interior architecture and likewise colleagues. food tastes of nothing, drinks don't get you drunk, no children anywhere; after initial steps of fitting in, andreas searches for ways to escape the bland new world. he doesn't know where he came from anymore, but still remembers rich tastes, true feelings - anything beyond the non-committal flatline life he's leading now. the bothersome man resonates ideas of huxley and kafka, but here the cruelty is the omnipresent noncommittal neatness. unlike pleasantville this is not about narrow-minded bigotry, more a fable of our urban free-world civilisation of fitting in. it mostly reminds one of the ingenious fight club scene, in which edward norton walks through a mock-ikea catalogue. spiced with macabre humour, this scandinavian laconic tale convinces on every level: story, characters, and relevance. a true screen gem. 8/10

andreas arrives in a strange city. he doesn't remember where he came from and how he got there. he is ordered to arrive at work, and gets his own apartment in the city. all his co-workers are nice and polite to him, they say hi and smile when they pass by him. but then later on andreas discovers that the city isn't that pleasant as it seems. going home from work, he see some people wearing grey suits, cleaning up the bloody mess of a dead body, apparently a suicide victim that had thrown himself out of the window. the procedure is done with a calmed mind, as if they were emptying a trashcan. the following day, andreas meets the suicide victim fully alive at work. more and more andreas discovers the feelingless atmosphere of the city.den brysomme mannen might be the best norwegian film i've seen. original, artistic directing is usually missing in norwegian films, with only a few exceptions. the plot is also very original, and could even be called post-modern horror, as the film present us a terrifying thought of having to cope with a world that is completely feelingless. and the more you try to fill your life in this city with a meaning, the more meaningless it becomes. i am fascinated by how the director manages to create the feeling of a disembovled universe, a nightmare, that you simply cannot escape from, not even with death.go see it, its really worth it! i gave it 9 out of 10.

i read most of the comments here were everybody saw only the flaws of the movie. i agree, the director it's not kuprik, the actors are not oscar winners, but it has something everyone could relate to. i don't want to spoil but telling more then the plot - the finishing of school and the trip to a big party, or if you like to see beyond the metaphor, is choosing the way trough life. remember that days of youth? the days when you or our friend acted like the characters? or do you think you should acted like one of them and now you regret you didn't? if you can go back in to that time and if you can ask yourself any of this questions maybe the movie wasn't so bad.

of all the 48 films of brigitte bardot, "une parisienne" is widely regarded as (one of) her best. what we see is special: for once the plot has a value of its own, does much more than only providing a cheap vehicle for bb's sex-charged appearance.this film is your true & well worked-out light comedy, with a good and coherent story. set in france's government circles in the late 1950's, it entertains from beginning to end. providing many amusing twists & turns and some slapstick -- all acted out by at least three starring leads, including bardot."une parisienne" (= french for "female inhabitant of paris") focuses on telling a story, not on showing brigitte bardot. brigitte serves the plot very well by using her talent for acting in light comedies.when you settle on your couch on a friday-night, tired and weary from a week's slaving away, just turn on "une parisienne". this film will make you feel better.

bridgette bardot, looking as sexy as ever, plays a spoiled but innocent daughter of a french ambassador. she cons one of her father's top aides (womanizer michel) into marrying her and it turns out to be the best thing for both of them. michel is soon flirting with his old girlfriends and in order to teach him a lesson, bridgette flirts heavily with a married prince charles. michel is surprised by his jealousy. a cat-and-mouse game ensues between brigdette and michel ("i'll have an affair"..."no you won't"...) and finally michel realizes she just might and vows to give up all the other ladies in his life. bridgette and michel settle comfortably into their happily-ever-after while prince charles jets home to england.it's an admittedly light piece but it's incredibly charming. while some may fault it as a product of it's time, i found that completely enjoyable. worthy of a rental.

most of the brigitte bardot movies i've seen have failed to take full advantage of her captivating screen presence. unfortunately, she was given few really good roles in movies of undeniable quality, which was a real oversight. she deserved them and was able to demonstrate her full cinematic power when they came her way. as genevieve in "love on a pillow" we had a clear exception to the trend of light, fluffy vehicles, for it was an interesting, artistic film by any reasonable measure, and in it, a 28-year-old bb was at her most alluring. "une parisienne" is another, featuring an extremely captivating brigitte in an interesting, well-crafted comedy that explores how an ambitious lady's man can be convinced to remain faithful to an incredibly beautiful young wife. there are several good performances here. her playboy husband, michel, is one, "the prince," played by charles boyer, is another, with entertaining efforts by a good supporting cast. as for brigitte bardot, the way she looks in this movie is the way i remember her as a kid in the fifties. she was 23 in 1957 and way ahead of her time, more beautiful than any other actress of the period, including marilyn monroe. her curvy, coquettish sexuality, amply displayed in several bosom-baring, skintight dresses, simply jumps off the screen. she was more hip and cute than the women of america are today, nearly fifty years later. obsessed with their careers and still desperately clinging to feminist politics, they come off like a bunch of clueless lesbians. in stark contrast, the sex kitten was sexually liberated, intelligent, and clearly independent long before it was fashionable, yet while fully understanding the power of her exceptional femininity, she used it for a higher purpose than mere self-interest -- she believed in love. a still photo simply could not do her justice. you had to watch her slender yet voluptuous form (with its 20-inch waist) lightly cross a room. you had to see that wild blonde mane, gaze into her big, brown, seductive eyes, and listen as her full, pouting lips spoke french. in a closeup at the end of this movie she winks and flirts with the camera, her beautiful orbs twinkling. what a babe! for fans of brigitte bardot, "une parisienne" is not to be missed.

i have to agree with all the previous commenter's--this is simply the best of all frothy comedies, with bardot as sexy as marilyn monroe ever was, and definitely with a prettier face (maybe there's less mystique, but look how marilyn paid for that.) i don't think i've ever seen such a succulent-looking female on screen, so perfect that even a gay man like me got excited by it--and not just for purely aesthetic reasons (if the idiot evangelicals really want to do their 'convert-a-queer' number, they are really going to need to up their standards, as no church mice need apply here...)her breasts, the rest of her figure, her adorable voice, the hilarious way she shakes as she walks across a room...only to arrive in front of a man, breasts literally pointed as if in exquisite confrontation...i think boyer is one of the greatest leading men in all of film history. no one played opposite more great female stars than did he: garbo, dietrich, k. hepburn, colbert, and here bardot, among many others. and he was also in 'fanny' with leslie caron, and had small parts in 'how to steal a million' with a. hepburn, as well as being in the deneuve movie 'the april fools' (although not opposite her.) the only thing i could disagree with in remarks is that even the loud, obnoxious music over the opening credits is appropriate--i mean, bardot is not meant to be subtle on top of everything else, and her essential loudness (i don't mean her voice) is part of her irresistible and, one might even say, exemplary charm.vidal is thoroughly handsome, even if pouty brigitte says toward the beginning 'i don't know why i am in love with you, you're not even handsome.' dear, dear bardot! truly one of the wonders of the 20th century, not to mention the joy that she is still with us, when so many of the truly characterful are passing away so fast, in all her eccentric glory.

vadim changed brigitte's image and way of life from that of the young society beauty he had married to that of a rebellious and challenging teenager of the 1950s "une parisienne" succeeded in launching her ravishing figure as the teenage goddess, the casual sexuality, the provocative gaiety in confrontation with men charles boyer  as prince charles  was the perfect, ideal choice of those magically romantic moments his deep and vibrant voice spoke a promise of new adventures in love his deep, wondering eyes bespoke a worldly knowledge untarnished by cynicism he had the boudoir grace of valentino without the hysteria or the sometime effeminacy of the great lover under michel boisrond's direction, boyer was an old-style romantic without the grand manner

i was lucky enough recently to see ingrid bergman's name attached to a film i had never seen (or even heard of) on amc. what a stroke of luck.to marvel at her flawless and seamless performance isn't the only reason to stay up late and watch this movie. the writing is wonderfully comical and the performances are excellent.walter mathau (not my favorite) was nearly perfect and goldie hawn (suprisingly) was fabulous. tender at times, demanding, then just plain goofy. there are times in the film that even the most hardened film viewer will get caught up in the story and forget that it is a movie.that bergman can steal a dance scene among a crowd of 20 year-olds was amazing to watch. she is effortless in her return to the screen (at age 54?). the supporting cast was great and the lines... the lines are exquisite.a top 5 romantic comedy of all time.

another "oldie but goody" from about the same time as "out of towners" is "cactus flower", with a great cast: goldie hawn, in her first film appearance (pre-facelifts), ingrid bergmann in one of her later ones, and the ever-funny walter matthau. the story is about a dentist who pretends to be married in order to have an excuse for not marrying his girlfriend, leading to the need to come up with a fictitious wife for proof. he cajoles his spinster receptionist (bergman) into taking the role, leading to multiple comic disasters and surprising romantic turns. it's in the same vein as the doris day/rock hunter comedies. fans of those - as i am - will like this movie; if not, don't bother.

swinging bachelor matthau, a successful dentist, is stringing along his blond mistress hawn, having told her that he's a married man with three kids. after she attempts suicide matthau decides to get responsible and marry the girl. worried that she's going to be a "homebreaker", bright eyed hawn wants to meet his wife and explain everything to her. matthau employs his faithful nurse bergman to act his wife and that's when things really get complicated.a farcical comedy with irresistible leads quite often hits the mark but isn't for one second believable. the script asks us to believe that us men are such one-dimensional turds that it's truly beyond belief. but maybe this comedy doesn't need to be analyzed too deeply, just sit back and enjoy the ever so funny matthau, the ever so charming bergman and débutant hawn, who here basically created the dumb-blond girl role.

aside from the discotheque scenes that epitomize the swinging sixties (especially with everyone dancing to instrumental versions of monkees hits), i am surprised how well this lightweight farce holds up 37 years later, but indeed it does thanks to the breezy execution of its deception-based plot and the sharp interplay of the three leads. directed by the redoubtable stage-to-screen expert gene saks, this 1969 comedy is about julian winston, a successful manhattan dentist and confirmed bachelor, who pretends to be married in order to avoid long-term commitment with his young girlfriend of a year, toni. in response to toni's half-hearted suicide attempt, julian agrees to marry her, but toni first insists on meeting his wife to alleviate her conscience. enter julian's devoted nurse stephanie to play the wife, and the inevitable complications ensue with white lies growing into major whoppers that lead to presumed couplings and de-couplings.as julian, a relaxed walter matthau dexterously plays the deceptive dentist in his typically sardonic manner, but he lets his two female co-stars walk off with the picture. in her big screen debut, a pixyish 24-year old goldie hawn is still retaining her giggly "laugh-in" persona but provides unexpected savvy and depth as toni. she and matthau have great, unforced chemistry in their scenes together. screen legend ingrid bergman, still serenely regal at 54, is obviously having a ball playing stephanie, initially starchy and quick-witted but blossoming into a liberated spirit as the story evolves. i particularly like how casual she appears after her overnight romp. there is nice supporting work from rick lenz as toni's bohemian neighbor igor and jack weston as julian's smarmy actor buddy harvey. billy wilder's longtime collaborator, i.a.l. diamond, provides the sparkling screenplay and opens up the story beyond its stage-bound origins for saks, who is not the most cinematic of directors. other than a couple of trailers, there are no significant extras with the dvd.

what an absolutely charming movie. the cast is wonderful, and the story is witty and fun. an all around pleasant movie experience. although the plot is somewhat predictable, it doesn't make the story any less enjoyable, in fact i didn't want it to end. i've always been a ingrid bergman fan, and i was interested to see her in a comedic role. she didn't let me down, ingrid bergman's performance as ms dickinson is fun to watch. i loved her interaction with toni at the music store as well as her dancing and doing "the dentist". it only further proved what i already knew, that she is one of the greatest actresses of all time. goldie hawn is also delightful to watch. her fun, gentle-hearted and lovable toni is the driving force of the movie. you don't even question why she would be so concerned about her finacee's wife, you just accept that she's just that type of person who wouldn't be happy unless she knew everyone else was also. and walter matthau is great as julian. his actions never create a feeling animosity for the viewer, in fact they almost make him more enduring. there wasn't an unlikable character in the bunch. this movie has definitely with stood the test of time, i watched it just last night and i think it's one of the best romantic comedies i've ever seen. if you're looking for a fun, lighthearted, romantic comedy look no further.

as much as i like walter matthau, i felt that the majority of his roles were tailored towards his personality. this role is one of the exceptions. he plays a dentist who is both charming and dishonest. this role does require much more acting than in most of his other roles. i liked the fact that the movie was honest about how a professional can be dishonest in order to avoid commitment in a relationship. his whole aim was to find a way to be in a relationship with a much younger woman, but not to be committed in any way. the alibi - using his secretary (ingrid bergman) to pretend to be his wife. at some point in the movie, the pretend mr. and mrs. actually are deluded into believing that they were actually really married. the ending was good, because a middle aged man found that pursuing someone in his own age group was more worthwhile. the movie was funny, entertaining, and didn't sell out by being preachy.

i knew next to nothing about this movie until i chanced to rent it. it was a very pleasant surprise. the cast is excellent including matthau whom i do not normally care for. he makes a credible romantic lead. hawn is a sweet kook and bergman is touching as a woman coming out of her shell.

well i would say that this is a very enjoyable and somewhat touching movie despite its flaws. i didn't believe for a minute that matthau knew the first thing about being a dentist. also, hawn's character seemed to recover from suicidal depression rather quickly at the beginning of the movie. not to mention the entire thing seemed rather ridiculous. however, the film does succeed due to a good pace, humor, and its stars. matthau may not have been a dentist, but he was as amusing as he usually is. bergman brought a great deal of sensitivity to the film (especially during the scene where her and matthau go out for a drink after work) and also a good deal of humor. i believe it was her performance that made my brother take notice of this movie after overhearing a couple scenes. hawn's performance is noteworthy, although an oscar may have been over doing it a bit. basically, don't take this movie too seriously and you will enjoy yourself.

goldie hawn, in 1969, was best known for playing in television comedy shows - in particular rowan and martin's laugh in, where she was the giggly cookie young blond. she did make movies before cactus flower, the most notable being a walt disney feature, the one and only genuine, original family band. but cactus flower picked up on her character from laugh-in, and (due to a good script by i.a.l. diamond - billy wilder's second partner - based on an abe burrows play) she was able to develop the television character so that a real performance was fleshed out. as a result ms hawn won an oscar for best supporting actress in 1969, and her career took off to such future hits as private benjamin and the first wives club. although other stars of laugh-in did well on television (henry gibson has a recurring role as a judge on boston legal) only goldie was able to have a career as a bonifide movie star.on laugh-in goldie's personality would show a naiveté that would be embarrassing. occasionally she realized it, and would laugh loud to cover, but sometimes she just did not see her error (example: goldie is introduced to the 1950s variety show host gary moore, and is told, "goldie, this is mr. gary moore." she shakes his hand and says (much to his confusion), "i've always wanted to meet mr. john gary moore!"). but as toni simmons it is quite different. she is desperately in love with dr. julian winston (walter matthau), a successful dentist, who can never marry her. julian has told her that his wife (with whom he has had two sons and a daughter) will never give him a divorce. so at the start of the film toni tries to commit suicide by the gas of her stove. but she is rescued by her neighbor, igor sullivan (rick lenz), a struggling dramatist, who breaks into her apartment and turns off the gas. toni is resigned to live, but she has sent a suicide note to julian. igor tries to deliver a message to ignore the note but julian's receptionist/nurse/assistant, stephanie dickinson (ingrid bergman) won't stop julian's work schedule to pass him the phone when igor calls. instead julian finds the letter and races to toni's apartment, only to find her alive. when igor supports her story that she tried to kill herself, julian realizes the depth of her love, and decides he must marry such a woman. unfortunately toni has swallowed julian's lies, and believes in his wife and children. you see, julian has no wife and children. since toni is a firm believer that she can't marry a man who would lie to her julian is stuck on a weakening tree branch.julian comes to solve it by getting stephanie to pretend she is mrs. winston. stephanie is opposed to it at first, but on her own, on her first free saturday, she confronts toni at the record shop toni is at. they talk, and toni notices all the fine strengths of character and personality of stephanie (and since stephanie has her two nephews with her, toni thinks they are julian's kids). toni tells julian they have to see who is the man that stephanie is supposedly going to marry. so the lie starts spiraling for julian, stephanie, and toni. soon a lover is given to stephanie in the form of julian's friend and freeloading patient harvey greenfield (jack weston). greenfield is so sleazy (stephanie loathes him) that toni feels that he is unworthy of stephanie.and so it goes, with one complication (most caused by the well-intentioned, misinformed toni) following another until the conclusion. the script is full of first rate situations and one-liners (example: julian to reward stephanie for lying about their marriage, buys two record albums from toni's store. he has given a mink stole to toni, but she decides to send it to stephanie with julian's card. stephanie is quite happy at getting the mink, but she does not say a word about the nature of the gift she got - when she profusely thanks matthau, he says the thought she'd like horowitz - meaning vladomir horowitz. but stephanie thinks horowitz is the name of the furrier!). bergman must have enjoyed the filming, as several scenes shows that earthy radiance that was a trademark for her in the later 1940s films. but there was also the resemblance to her 1958 film comedy smash hit, indiscreet. there cary grant lied to make sure the pair would concentrate on the romance of their affair without having to think about marriage. when grant's lie is revealed to bergman she decides on a lie of her own to convince grant that she was making him a cuckold. here, instead of being the passive lover believing matthau is telling the truth, bergman gingerly tries to get matthau out of his mess by little white lies, only to find one leads to another to complicate everyone's lives. bergman is seen as a nice woman who becomes part of the problem, despite trying to be part of the solution.all the leads perform well, in particular bergman, all business thoroughness at first but gradually reclaiming her sexuality. matthau is delightful as a man who finds a useful lie is an impediment that just can't be kicked aside. the supporting cast, especially weston as the mooching and sexually slimy harvey, and vito scotti as the u.n. ambassador who actually has the hots for bergman. it was a clever comedy, and a really good way for goldie hawn's movie career to push forward.

goldie hawn's depiction of a simple young lady caught up in a love triangle with an older man, a dentist, played with such relish by walter matthau, that she won the best supporting actress oscar for 1969.the film, however, is another tribute to ingrid bergman. rarely, did we ever see her in a comedy and she literally kicks up her heels here as a dedicated dental nurse who is thrust into a scheme for matthau to tell hawn that they're married.it is such a joy to watch matthau and bergman fall for each other here. theirs is an accidental love affair in the making.as matthau's friend, jack weston is fabulous as his partner in the scheme as well. rick lenz gives ample support as hawn's newly-found boyfriend as well.

anyone who has ever doubted ingrid bergman's ability to play comedy need only look to "the bells of st. mary's". ok, so she's a nun with tb who's probably in love with fr. o'malley, (think what luis bunuel could have done with that), but she also displayed a wonderfully sly sense of fun that made you wish directors had cast her in comedies more often. in "cactus flower" she's a starched dentist's nurse, (walter matthau is the dentist), in love with her boss but keeping it buttoned up. when she's forced to act as his 'wife' in order to hoodwink his mistress, (don't ask), she lets loose and the buttons pop. and she's a joy to behold.the movie itself is a hardier than usual translation to the screen of a broadway hit, (you can see it's three acts). it's a french farce, (it was originally; it's taken from the play 'fleur de cactas' by pierre barillet and jean-pierre gredy), and it hits all the right spots. matthau uses his great hang-jowl expression to wonderful effect and a klutzy blonde newcomer, as she was then, called goldie hawn almost steals the film as the dizzy mistress who decides to give up her meal ticket because she feels sorry for 'the wife' even though 'the wife' is having a ball. hawn made such an impression in the role that what she did steal was the academy award for best supporting actress.

i am surprised by the relatively low rating this film has. it is a screwball comedy & romance film rolled together by someone besides billy wilder but it does a really good job & even won an oscar.it is ingrid bergman's first film in the us since the 1950's & even though she is no longer the young bombshell she was in her early films, she brings off a difficult role quite handsomely. this film proves she had multiple talents beyond her good looks.goldie hawn who won an oscar in this, her first film, as supporting actress is very good as the modern sophisticated yet quirky latest mistress to dentist playboy, love them & leave them walter mathaw. goldie is delightful to all the senses in this role which with a great cast set her up as a slam dunk for this early career award.this film is not real deep, but is a gem that has stood the test of time very well. not sure why it's average is so low as i give it a solid 8.

far more sprightly, and less stage and set bound than gene saks' previous efforts barefoot in the park(67) and the odd couple (68), cactus flower is not a work of art, but compared to most of the tired farces from the 60's like the apartment, how to murder your wife, goodbye charlie, a guide for the marrried man, divorce, american style, any wednesday, kiss me stupid, boys night out, it's a masterpiece. director saks and writer i.a.l. diamond have effectively "opened up" abe burrows' broadway hit, and the film benefits greatly from new york city location shooting and excellent performances from ingrid bergman and goldie hawn. bergman is charming, looks great, and demonstrates a flair for comedy. hawn in her oscar winning role has never been better or more appealing. matthau is ok though it's hard to believe that hawn's character would be so enamored of him. and in retrospect, hawn's attempted suicide at the start of the film is out of character and unbelievable. nonetheless, the film has a plausible farcical set up, and once it gets going it generates laugh. rick lenz, jack weston, eve bruce, and vito scotti provide good support. the film is likable and fun, and hawn and bergman make you care.

i was very surprised to learn that goldie hawn won an oscar for this film. she seemed very lifeless and completely schooled by the 54(!) year old bergman in the scenes where they are side by side. if it had been written today, i think that bergman and the young man ivan would have wound up together (ingrid is so much hotter than goldie...) and the two self-absorbed characters played by matthau and hawn would be left out in the cold. but it was written at the end of 60's and feels like plaza suite or barefoot in the park. however, matthau's one-liners, hawn's innocence and bergman's classy performance make this quite pleasant to watch.

cactus flower was a delightful 1969 comedy based on a neil simon play about a dentist (walter matthau) having an affair with a young free spirited woman (goldie hawn), totally unaware that his devoted nurse/assistant(ingrid bergman)is in love with him. matthau can play this kind of role in his sleep and he doesn't disappoint as the philandering dentist, dr. julian winston, who is dating one woman but really has no clue that he's in love with another. goldie hawn won an oscar for her sparkling performance as toni simmons, the aging flower child who slowly comes to realize she is trapped in a dead end affair and is not as dim as she appears on the surface. but the real pleasure for me in this film was the performance of the legendary ingrid bergman as stephanie dickinson, dr. winston's completely devoted assistant, who is willing to to bury and sacrifice her own happiness as long as dr. winston is happy with tony. bergman is luminous in this film, looking absolutely beautiful (though the camera has always loved her) and showing an unforeseen knack for light comedy. yes, the dialogue and the settings are slightly dated, but the story is timeless and the performances by the stars make it imminently watchable.

i've been playing this movie incessantly this month, and i just love it. i was around in the 60s (oh dear), so it is nostalgic in one sense. however, it's the funny premise, the snappy dialogue and the great performances that keep me watching.dr. winston's reactions to stephanie at the end of the movie are priceless. (i'd be more specific, but don't want to spoil it for anyone.) who other than matthau can play a man not entirely on the up-and-up and yet have us still love him? as for bergman's costumes, i think she looks as dowdy as she's supposed to. i think "she was robbed" the one time that she appears in an evening gown. it doesn't suit her at all, which is too bad. i never liked it when i first saw it on her and i still don't.goldie won an oscar for her role. people thought it was a groundbreaking performance at the time, and yet it's the one performance that i don't love as much as the others. she does have the right amount of sweetness and likability, however, which is important for this role.and i agree - i thought rick lenz was great in it and it's too bad that his movie career didn't take off after this.i hope more people watch this movie ... they'll love it!

when i saw lauren bacall do cactus flower on broadway, i never dreamed that one day i would see an actress like ingrid bergman playing the bacall role on screen. but here ingrid really lets her hair down for some good comedy moments as the dental nurse pretending to be walter matthau's wife so he can go on with the fib he's told goldie hawn.it's a story played for laughs from beginning to end, good-humored stuff that never runs out of dry humor and wit throughout its running time. there are plenty of one-liners or gags that are way above the usual situation comedy stuff one hears on tv--the lines ring true because they blend so well with the characters and their motives.as the daffy girl who contemplates (in the beginning) committing suicide over her unhappy affair with matthau, goldie hawn (fresh from her days as a star on tv's "laugh in") does a dumb blonde role to perfection. easy to see why she won that supporting actress oscar.ingrid is surprisingly fetching in a rare comedy role, although there are times when she seems just a bit too matronly for the part. at any rate, she's a surprising choice to play the nurse who puts on a freeze act at the office but is considerably warmer off duty.as goldie's next door neighbor, igor, rick lenz acquits himself admirably, and makes a suitable match for her in that final scene.matthau plays the kind of character that became his stock in trade in all those neil simon roles he had--a lovable cad who gets caught up in his own messes when he tells lie after lie.it's the kind of rib-tickling comedy that'll have you laughing out loud at some of the amusing lines that abe burrows and i.a.l. diamond have managed to scrap together, based on a french farce.

everyone told me to see "cactus flower," and i finally did. what a wonderful movie -- the perfect pick-me-up for a sunday night/dreading monday morning. matthau and hawn were good, but ingrid bergman really made this movie -- after all, it was really about her. the truly great actors can do anything, and miss bergman proves it. she shows us -- in the course of one film -- a range few people display in their entire career. the scene in the dance club was as hysterical as it was touching. even as the film drew to its obvious conclusion, i found myself cheering for miss dickinson as if she were the boston red sox. thankfully, she made out (no pun intended) much better. ;)

i discovered this late one night on turner classics. i kept saying to myself "i'll turn it off as soon as it stops being funny", but needless to say i watched the whole way through.i am a movie junkie but i had never even heard of this movie (or if i did in 1971, i forgot). it's worth watching just for the performance of goldie hawn as the tart-tongued ingénue. her acting is a revelation in this movie. yes, the script is sharp and excellent (when was the last time they made a hollywood comedy with a smart script?) but her acting is extraordinary. i never realized how funny goldie could be, and it makes her later appearances in roles such as laugh-in and private benjamin a little sad. in her later career she is far too over-the-top compared to her minimalist, wickedly funny appearance here.it's a pleasure watching the young matthau, the great bergman and the stellar supporting cast, but it's goldie hawn that will make this movie worth watching again.

walter matthau is wonderful as the "philandering" dentist dr. julian winston whose frequent fibs to girlfriend goldie provide textbook proof of the dangers of lying. goldie hawn's touching kook toni simmons certainly deserved to win her oscar. ingrid bergman's work as the stiff-as-starch nurse stephanie is also touching to watch as she comes out of her shell, slowly and nervously. this is a great movie to watch in the springtime, or any time for that matter. it's very underrated; i never heard about it until i found it in the video store, and what a find!

cactus flower is what i call a "pizza movie" -a personal favorite that never fails to satisfy. perfect for an evening at home with a pizza. knowing all the lines (and what lines!) by heart only enhances the enjoyment.since so many others here have retold the plot, i'll simply add the correction that bergman's character, miss dickinson, was a nurse-receptionist, meaning she was a skilled nurse -and therefore an educated person -not "just" a receptionist.bergman's performance in this film -and the film itself- was largely dismissed at the time, but today's audiences will marvel at her range; not just the impeccable comic timing, but the ability to make us believe her character is unaware of her own feelings while revealing them so clearly to toni and to us. while the general plot stretches credibility, bergman's performance is compelling: honest and utterly believable.also a standout is jack weston's performance as the matthau's old friend and co-conspirator, harvey. no one could deliver a zinger like weston, and i.a.l. diamond's script gives him plenty. for example: "that's such a big, dirty, rotten lie it has class." weston excelled at slightly seedy characters because he exuded a warmth that allowed you to forgive his characters' flaws. the film is a fairly straight adaptation of the abe burrows play (which was itself adapted from a french play by barillet and gredy). on broadway matthau's role was played by barry nelson. bergman's by lauren bacall, and hawn's by brenda vaccaro. it ran for 1,234 performances (three years) and was nominated for two tony awards (vaccaro and burt brinckerhoff, who played igor).for me, the film's score, written and adapted by the legendary quincy jones is another highlight. the main theme (a time for love is anytime) is performed by sarah vaughn over the opening and closing credits. it is also insinuated in different arrangements throughout the film, most notably as the romantic piano music underscoring berman's speech to hawn in the record store. jones also created covers of popular songs from the period (to sir with love, i'm a believer) for the night club scenes. as with all of the film's elements, there is a tremendous amount of talent, taste, and professionalism evident. in my opinion, few modern romantic comedies can hold a candle to this classic. it's great to finally have it available on dvd. time to call for a pizza...

ingrid bergman, playing dentist walter matthau's faithful receptionist who harbors a little crush on her boss, is absolutely wonderful in this film. she handles the witty repartee in the script with aplomb and steals a terrific scene where she and goldie hawn talk in a record booth (ingrid's monologue is a front, but her face tells you she believes in it with all her heart). matthau is an odd choice for the leading man (he's too old for goldie hawn and too unrefined for bergman, not to mention too unfocused to be a dentist), but i liked the way he tries hard to please goldie and stumbles around trying to free himself from a lie. hawn (who won a supporting oscar) is just as fresh and bubbly as she is today. this bedroom farce isn't terribly sophisticated (and faintly reminds one of "any wednesday" besides), but it's a welcome relief from the noisy, teen-oriented comedies they turn out today. "cactus flower" is a lovely sigh! *** from ****

this film has not exactly remained fresh in the minds of film buffs, and it's a crying shame. its witty screenplay adaptation should have netted oscar nominations for the great screenwriter i.a.l. diamond's adaptation, and ingrid bergman's flawless performance. it must have been an honor for goldie hawn at such a young age to work with bergman, looking more than a decade younger than her 54 years--fifty four! when she's on the screen, it positively twinkles.this is a film which may appear dated at first, but it actually made me wish i was around during the swingin' 'sixties. hawn's fashions are as tacky as bergman's are chic. (that's one minor flaw--isn't her character a little too soignée for a gal who still lives with her sister? but then again, would we have ingrid any other way?) and who wouldn't want to hang out at a nightclub called the slipped disc?the best compliments i can pay to this film is that it somehow made me nostalgic for a decade that i never saw, and that it left me wanting more. speaking of wanting more, i wonder what ever became of sexy supporting actor rick lenz? (he resembles griffin dunne in this film.) this was his film debut, and i don't see any other major roles in his filmography. as for goldie hawn, she's done so much since then it's easy to not be impressed, but i can't imagine any other actor in the role, either.since the movie is based on a play, the line delivery may seem a bit stage-y, but it did not inhibit my enjoyment at all. in fact, i am amazed at how funny it still is after over thirty-five years. because this film represents a bygone era, it has unjustly slipped from the consciousness of film buffs. it is more linked to the era films that came before it than the ones that followed. but don't let that stop you from savoring the delights it has to offer. grade: a

starting on or around 1965 american movies took a turn for the shocking and the iconoclastic which was great for the times -- sort of the seeds that would pave the way for grittier, daring dramas. however, because the very decade that gave birth to these films was so ruled by its own convictions, most all of the films released at this period have dated. cactus flower is no exception. its very title suggests a "sunny" romantic comedy with occasional lapses into the risqué. this is not to say that it's a bad thing: quite the contrary, films about risqué subject matter have to begin somewhere and america being a culture rooted in specific traditions, themselves laced in deep hypocrisies, shocks itself for the sake of it when seeing an indirect reflection of the mores of the time. meanwhile, european films address these same situations, walk off looking like a million bucks, and have a longer shelf-life because what we consider scandalous, they shrug off, say "next," and move on. toni simmons (goldie hawn in her breakout role), a young, very sixties bright young thing, is carrying on with a much-older dentist named julian winston (walter matthau), who has commitment issues. he can'r marry her: he's already married. toni decides instead of wilting away she actually wants to meet his wife and "set things straight." into the picture comes his assistant, stephanie dickinson (a luminous ingrid bergman, returning to american cinema after a twenty-year absence), a woman closer to his age who acts as if she and he had the perfect marriage and household. there is a reason for this: she has harbored quiet emotions for julian, emotions he is unaware of, even when he asks her to play his wife to ward toni off from wanting to step their relationship further. and then he steps it up a notch when toni's blissfully innocent actions veer the action off into the unexpected and he introduces harvey greenfield (jack weston) as stephanie's "lover". by the way, harvey is also an older gent who is having an affair with a much younger woman (eve bruce) whom he also lies to in one very funny scene.it's funny how the person whom we're looking for is the one who's always been there. what could have been a thankless role for rick lenz who plays igor sullivan, toni's next door neighbor, turns into the man who not only sees the true beauty in fellow outcast stephanie but the one who saves toni at the start from killing herself. (not the stuff of comedy, suicide. then again, this is not your average comedy.) and needless to say is ingrid bergman's subtle, poignant portrayal of a woman who's somehow missed her chances at love, who's become prickly, who due to a lie said to another she becomes the real person she was always meant to be. i can't imagine anyone else in this quiet but deep role.movies like these can be enjoyed at face-value and seen as escapist fun -- a product of its times -- or be viewed for the deep symbolism that, like its title, it carries deep within. it's a tricky film, the same way hawn's and bergman's performance are equally tricky because in seeming so simple, devoid of flourish and pose, neither come out and proclaim what they are about. their acting becomes "not really acting" but playing real people, warts and all. cactus flower is a story that never appears to take itself too seriously, but reveals itself to be deep and very human after all.

in a phrase, moral ambiguity. in the soderbergh remake, there are good guys and bad guys. benicio del toro's character is clearly the good guy, morally clean and uncorruptable. his counterpart in the bbc original, fazal the farmer turned dealer, is realistically flawed and conflicted over his fate. the two relentless cops are similarly different. in the american one, they win our hearts. in the bbc original, they are over-zealous, nearly obsessive.the best moment for me in soderbergh's was when the college student rhetorically asked the drug czar, "what would you do if you were poor and black and rich white people came into your neighborhood looking for drugs?" that point was insinuated throughout the bbc show, and crystallized in jack lithgow's final speech. both are excellent, but the bbc towers over the remake. my conclusion after seeing both shows is that dealers are innocent pawns who are only supplying a demand, and it is the demand that causes so much suffering.

charlie wilson's war is an excellent example of how films should be made. this movie is of the highest quality and is cast perfectly. tom hanks play the lead and delivers an exceptional performance. furthermore, tom hanks is complimented by the unparalleled acting ability of the incredible philip seymour hoffman. i have never seen him in a role that suits him so perfectly.the film is witty, intelligent and well written. julia roberts also stars in this film but is easily over-shadowed by the other two leads.i rated this film 10/10 and am pleased to recommend this film to anyone that is interested in quality cinema.

it's possible to have a good time with this film while, at the same time, regretting all that it isn't. in the 1980s, a raffish u.s. congressman (tom hanks) engineers support for afghan partisans resisting the soviet union.hanks is in breezy, hail-fellow-well-met form as roguish, politically incorrect charlie wilson, first glimpsed sharing a hot tub with three deeply available looking women. if only the film had the same air of insouciance; but apart from philip seymour hoffman's turn as a cynical cia agent, it tries to be perceived as patriotic too. aaron sorkin's trademark staccato dialogue serves its purpose, but the story is no more plausible than one of wilson's tall tales. and there's an oddly unspoken subtext: wilson's afghan pals later mutated into the taliban and other anti-western groups, leaving the world worse off than it was when these events occurred.

well we definitely did see and i and many other people were actually expecting worse. it did have some good parts too it that i was not expecting it still did fail in other areas though.first off the acting was above average. i love phillip seymour hoffman in this movie and i liked tom hanks. hoffman was the glue to this movie. if it were not for him this movie would have crumbled and hit rock bottom. his performance was by no means stunning but absolutely necessary. he gave a good witty, cynical performance in what most other actors could have easily made his character into a cliché. tom hanks really gave a nice loose performance and did not disappoint but he certainly did not impress. what i could not stand was that julia roberts was involved in this movie. she was as big of a miscast as i have ever seen. for one she is a bad actress, at least to me, she was to young for her character and was to phony even for the character she was playing.the directing was average to me. i'm not really a big fan of the recent mike nichols movies and i'm not exactly impressed by this one either. it was made with such a hollywoodish, cartoonish touch hat i could not stand. the worst part about it was that he tried make it be a really meaningful movie at the end. i love meaningful movies but not when a movie tries to rush a scene or two at the end and show something that tries to justify the rest of the garbage spread throughout the whole movie. that is something that mike nichols has seemed to have done a lot in his recent track record.the one impressive part of this movie was the writing. the dialog was put together very well and was able to let the story play out. the writing was what was able to really able to take this movie to an above average level. in so many scenes i found myself laughing in part by the writing.well that is some of what we saw at least. a lot of the scenery was good in the movie if you get what i mean but not a lot other than that. i did like that this movie did not glorify everything america had done. it is obvious that during this whole war in afghanistan the u.s. gave weapons to the people who are now against us. this movie kind of show we are too blame for that. it shows that what may seem good in the short term may turn into something horribly wrong in the future. this movie did have a good original message but it just did not deliver it right. overall though it was entertaining.

nice to see a comedy for grown ups. masterfully structured by aaron sorkin via mike nichols's own mastery. mr nichol's mastery is to present characters in all their shocking truth, from the sad and riveting richard burton and elizabeth taylor in "who's afraid of virginia woolf" to the sad and riveting julia roberts, clive owen, jude law and natalie portman in "closer". in "charlie wilson's war" the shocking truth is outside the characters and the sad and riveting tom hanks, julia roberts, philip seymour hoffman and amy adams are at the service of something else, it's personal only to a point. hanks has to bury his brilliance in single malts and julia roberts throws parties and introduces characters with blatant straightforwardness. amy adams witnesses and exist as a character, witnessing. an insurmountable task that miss adams manages to surmount, beautifully. it is philip seymour hoffman's gus with a t, however, that monopolized my attention. his character may not be a first but it is a first the way that hoffman presented him to us. someone who survives the disregard with which he's treated by the absolute conviction that he's smarter than all of them put together. hoffman is superb. the pacing of the tale helps enormously not to fall in a myriad of useless questions. a sharp, short, smart, sad comedy and when was the last time i was able to say that?

aaron sorking raises the same questions as shakespeare did or does. how could they possibly know so much about the inner workings of palace life. here like in the west wing, sorkin opens surprising doors that are hardly a shock but seem ton confirm our worst fears. everything is so casual and at the same time so directly responsible for so many people's lives. a puffy tom hanks tells us one way or another that things can be manipulated with semi pure intentions but without weighing the consequences and julia roberts in a blond southern hairdo reminds us of the powers harbored in the sidelines. the subject is serious but the treatment is light, intelligent but light. philip seymour hoffman, as the invisible middle man, steals every scene he is in, just like charles laughton did in every movie he was in.the dialogue is fast but not fast enough for us not to catch up and discover that this is not an ordinary comedy. the seemingly casual pace filled with strokes of wit and provocation grants another badge of honor in the mike nichol's collection.

the greatest movie ever.how's that for a contention? however, if we look at it through purely cinematic terms, it is clear that three colours red is a masterpiece. it is not enough to merely say this - three colours red is the masterpiece of world cinema. if you accept that citizen kane is not human enough, if you accept that star wars is not actually very good, if you accept that ozu and mizoguchi both have to take a step back - then three colours red is the foremost masterpiece of all time. as a discussion into human morality, three colours red works on an intensely metaphysical level, with a depth that none can match. blue went almost as far into the human psyche, but stopped as it was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat. white forced us to reflect on the humanity of equality - this, in retrospect, was better still, but still not quite there. red, however, is the real thing. what he expresses in this movie, is an expression of what it is to be human. in fact, what he expresses is _how_ it is to feel human. it forces us to examine up to the minutest detail, the very nature of our souls, of our ethical selves. in red, one may find meaning on one of its several levels. on the first level, red achieves a high level of verisimilitude - we could have no trouble in calling red an exceptionally entertaining story. however, the coincidences inherent in the film and its conceits force us to examine the movie as a movie. it is as if kieslowski is saying: "ceci n'est pas la réalité". in effect, in pursuing a humanistic goal, kieslowski can also challenge reality. it is a trick that kieslowski has been attempting since le double vie de véronique, but not until this, his final film, did he finally manage to reach this divine intertwining of fate, philosophy and circumstance. the actors and actresses, too, appear to be at the mercy of a greater power. valentine (irène jacob), is aptly name, for she seems to represent an almost pure love. meanwhile, the idea of first impressions is challenged by jean-louis tritignant's judge kern, a cantankerous man, who, by the end, becomes an almost all-knowing observer of events - a character who symbolically seems to possess the power to bring characters together - a power to make people happy, a power which he could only achieve through valentine.we have a capability to see films as more than just a series of pictures. in fact, films have the potential to possess more meaning than literature. it won't happen, of course, but at least we have the power to view this film, knowing that it gives us the power to achieve the something that we can't define, but all possess. a synopsis of this film read: "a film about a woman who runs over a dog". well, it is.isn't it?-simon huxtable

this is a classic continuation to bleu, the likewise excellent film, with juliet binouche as a main star, moreover, she is a cameo appearance here, in rouge, just for a second at the very end. but this film, truly red and very sweet although very sad, is a real winner. the main heroine, played by ever great irene jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model. she leads a full, active life, only darkened by her traumatic relations with her weird friend mike, who is in england. by some lucky chance, she gets friendly with the old judge, who spends time listening to the private telephone talks of his neighbors. the story starts to weave even further, and we see him in court, being almost universally condemned for his pastime. she is the only one who feels sympathy for him, for his cute doggy rita and her pups, and for all the people who surround them. we also witness the break-up of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his lady, and their quarrel is also fueled by that telephone scandal... but the film is not about this, even. it is mostly about the loneliness and deep rifts between people, far and near. when she sails to england on a ferry, with that lawyer as a chance fellow-passenger, as well as that earlier mentioned binoche who starred in bleu, the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of the judge when he watches the news trying to guess if she survived. she did, and still we feel very heavy at heart. mr. kislowski managed to draw a grand, subtle story about the solitude, misunderstanding, secrets and pain. deep, dark personal pain of those who are lost and lonely. brilliant film.

in my analysis of "trois couleurs: blanc" i wrote that its tone is much lighter than the tone of "trois couleurs: bleu". i think it's the same with this film. this time it's not because of a tragic comedy-element, but much more because of the main character valentine. although her boyfriend is living abroad and is ridiculously jealous, she manages her life with lightness and optimism, it seems to me that she might be kieslowski's image for a carefree youth. the opposite seems to be the judge, who is very pessimistic, a grumpy old man, who experiences big loneliness. in my view, valentine and the judge are pretty similar to each other, the judge is just much older and has experienced many more disappointments. they share a different kind of naivety and they both discover that they can learn much from the other one. finally i would like to stress irène jacob's performance, she rounds off the run of amazing female contributions to the "three colours"-trilogy.

well every scene so perfectly presented. never before had i seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every scene.well while i was watching this movie i remembered watching "amilie". amilie is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy touch. these movies are both based on a same plot line. but both of them are perfectly perfect in there own way and being able to create a world of their own.red is able to provoke lots of thoughts in people about destiny and dejavu s. and i am still thinking about it.the story is great and the ending is a bit funny. i was laughing in the end scene. well funny how this three movie red white and blue are connected.all in all a great work of art. a work of a masterman.10/10

i believe i share the same psychological outlook on the world with kieslowski. he is polish, i am dutch, yet we share a synthetic mind: the world is not void of the metaphysical amidst total coincidence. hardly ruled by man or perhaps by a poet-prime minister, so that as a social and cultural 'low pressure area', poland could play the role it did in wwii, being critical yet christian towards the jews but often not less critical toward oneself. there are innocence and guilt in kieslowski's world view, as the symbols in catholicism: the white versus the black madonna. in rouge, the black madonna is she who the judge fell in love with when he was a young man. flashbacks are magically-realistically intertwined with the present, although totally coincidental, such as the camera simply swinging to the other side of the street or the then young judge's red jeep passing by the now young woman's car after she accidentally hit his dog with it. that we leaped through time in those same camera moves, is what we grasp later. his love was unanswered, so that his life wasn't as he had planned it. he lost his ability to love other people and animals. being a judge, he feels he is actually spying on other peoples' lives and when he retires, he simply continues to do so, spying on his neighbors this time. the innocence and sense of righteousness of the younger woman (literally) accidentally getting into his life, reinstalls his better judgment and it is because of her that he spontaneously confesses his spying behavior to his neighbors and the police, accepting and even holding on to the stones consequentially thrown through his windows. in the process, history repeats itself between this man and the woman he loves, although this time he is old and the woman not the same. kieslowski may have wrestled with this bit for the old judge is his alter ego, and it is said he was infatuated by irène jacob. both women play the same essential role in his psychology, of the one (!) who possesses his heart and soul and therefore can make him or break him, even as an old man! it is as if the 'powers in the air' are, or god is, bringing them together. coincidences are *too* coincidental to just be chance or even good luck. there has to be some mystical, supernatural or theological source influencing these unfathomably deep life-decisions. the study book fell and opened at the page of the exam question is another example of this. or the moment the old judge spoke his heart to the young woman, the wind outside the opera house suddenly slams the open doors and breaks the windows. the gigantic picture of the young woman happens to predict the one on tv, after the drowning accident on her canal crossing trip. these moments are effectively accentuated through the human voice of liturgy or what sounds like it (van den budenmayer).

are we allowed to interfere with our fellowmen's everyday's life? is it possible to intrude upon their intimacy, to penetrate the inwardness of their thoughts violating the privacy of their own home without being blamed? the director raises some doubts about these apparently solvable questions, almost sympathetic towards judge jean luis' destabilizing decision of coming to terms with his own inducted self-seclusion by means of fragments of lives embezzled by him."trois couleurs: rouge" is based on the concept of "universal communication conceived as the human desire of an open window on the world". the phone may be considered the main character of the story: after its performance in "dekalog 9" it gives in the beginning the encore to kieslowski's onlookers, followed step by step in its fast run across the world. the director looks deeply into the faculty of communication of human beings, without taking up a definite position about the ethical side of individual behavior. once again he points out to us the unpredictability of future events, venting careful descriptions about strange courses and recourses of life separated from each other by a considerable number of years. inexplicable combinations oddly converging in a series of continuous and upsetting situations. - some books falling to the pavement. - one of them opening casually on a fatal page, predetermining the destiny of a future profession, as in a past similar occurrence. - glimpses of daily life meeting fleetingly, ideally joined by their fondness for the fictitious musician van den budermayer. - human fortunes marked by the most ill-fated coincidence.in this piece of work deserving to be seen with our heart's eyes instead of our mind's ones we can witness a dialectic game between judge jean luis' (jean-louis trintignant) and valentine dussaut (irene jacob, maybe the sweetest actress of our times, together with the beautiful winona ryder), in a generational conflict between the experience of a world-weary old man and the self-conscious immaturity of a nice girl on the point of facing the steepest path of her ascending way. kieslowski talks about "dialogue tests" between a disappointed human life and a youth unaware of her future, between a spiritless misanthropist and a spontaneous girl full of good sense of unselfishness.and the final parade when the damp odor of tragedy still lingers in the air, with all the main characters of the whole trilogy in full evidence, saved by an accidental stroke of luck thank to the providential script cleverly written, gives us the extreme greetings of this movie master fully used up by his great passion for cinema. only a sense of bitter regret and emptiness is left to remind us the existence of a void impossible to fill. good-bye krzysztof. we miss you so much!

master kieslowsky came with an idea in 1993, the idea was to portrait how human relationship are in the world today, passing from blue (a crafted visual masterpiece about a woman's life) from white (a visual comedy movie about marriage) and finally arriving to red (a masterpiece dealing with human interaction).while i'm not going to spoil the move i can easily say red is the best movie from the 90's decade because it has one of the strongest messages in a script i have ever ever seen.the movie begins a little slow but finds it's rhythm early enough to keep you hooked through the whole movie.the performances are perfect, sublime. since the characters are completely realistic and they're not clichéd in any way and one could expect no less from the actors and one doesn't get disappointed... seriously i believe jean louis tringtignat deserved an oscar nod at least.the music from zbiegnew preisner is amazing it's one of the best musical scores ever. piotr sobocinsk cinematography is also outstanding he got an oscar nod for it (and deserved to win).overall the movie is a perfect 10 and will be loved by people that love foreign cinema and people who don't. don't miss it.how did the awful pulp fiction beat ed this masterpiece at cannes is beyond my comprehension

trilogies are very interesting. some go out with a bang (lord of the rings), some get progressively weaker (the matrix), some get lost in obscurity (blade, back to the future), but some maintain the genius, that seemingly ever-growing bright light that floats beyond the surface of its flawless exterior. case and point: "three colors trilogy". this chapter in the trilogy, being the last one, is the most philosophical and thought-provoking. in "blue" we had a more visually stunning, more character-driven plot, in "white" it was more of a light hearted, narrative-driven story where we listen more to what the characters say than anything. "red", however is focused on the "what ifs" and "how comes". it questions our own fate and focuses mainly on the past and the future than the present.this chapter is about a young model who runs over a dog and brings him back to his owner. she soon finds out that the owner of the dog is actually a cynical retired judge who spies on his neighbors' phone calls through advanced spying equipment. all three films in the trilogies have very basic plot lines, but bring a lot more to the story. consider in "blue", the story of a woman dealing with the loss of her loved ones. we are constantly shown ideas about the contemporary french society and how that reflects the character's behavior. "red" is not only about a young woman who finds shelter in an older man's life, but it is also about chance, hope, and fate.irene jacob stars as valentine dussaut, who at first finds the old man (jean-louis trintignant), whom we never find the name of, extremely self-centered and disgusting. though through self reflective analysis, and her voyeuristic intentions, she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her, if only he was 40 years younger. irene lives across from another, younger judge, who highly resembles the old man. this is the "what if" that keeps circling in the movie. what if irene were born 40 years ago? the old man would have been her perfect match. but what if the younger judge is actually her perfect match, since he so closely resembles the older one. valentine doesn't know this, only we do, and krzysztof kieslowski subtly suggests this in almost every frame which irene is in. we are constantly smacked in the face with his presence, as almost a suggestion of irene's fate.i mention that the old man does not have a name for a reason. that reason is because it is very symbolic to the overall theme in the story. we are to compare the old judge to auguste (jean-pierre lorit), the younger judge, in more than one way. we learn that the old man once had someone he loved but she got away. in another scene, we see auguste heartbroken as the love of his life gets away with another man. there are constant reminders of whether or not valentine will ever meet this man. even though they pass each other without noticing every single day. there is also the motif of the telephone, to valentine it is a way of keeping sane and updating her life, to auguste it is what leads to his heartbreak, and to the old man, it is the only thing he has left. these three elements serve to shadow the characters own psychology. it is a sort of statement about what they are and who they are.all three "colors" films stand for a certain principle, most common in france. "blue" stands for liberty (the personal being), "white" stands for equality (being accepted by more than one), and "red" is fraternity (to socialize, to learn). and although this final chapter is an obvious focus on the fraternity principle, kieslowski makes sure he brings in the other two as well, in order to connect all three stories. for example, we see the old man trying to reach out to valentine and enlighten her with his spy equipment, which is a reflection of the equality principle. we also see near the end that valentine is doing some soul searching and that she's more concerned about herself than others (not picking up the phone when michel calls), a clear example of liberty. and with all three principles established, kieslowski nicely connects all of the characters as well, in the final and most heartfelt scene."red" is about where you could have been if you were older or younger. it is about whether or not there is someone completely perfect for everyone, and whether or not one person can change your life. the final chapter in the most awe-inspiring trilogy ever made, this film breaks barriers in both directing and storytelling. it is not only about our modern life, but about where life could and should be in our modern time. and although the movie is more subtle than both "blue" and "white", it boldly exclaims a statement of love and compassion.it's hard to imagine that "red" was kieslowski's last film, and that he died at such a young age. nevertheless, the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that ranks right up with bergman, fellini, and wenders as a truly remarkable director who's never been awarded with an oscar. kieslowski, you have been missed!

in the "goofs" section for this film there's a comment to the effect that there is a mistake in continuity where auguste's car is seen to be parked in a different place from that seen in a previous shot in the same scene. this is incorrect. one of the views is from auguste's flat, the other is from valentiné's flat across the street. the whole purpose of this segment is to show how valentiné and auguste - who may be made for each other - almost cross paths (as happens several other times) but never quite do so, until circumstances throw them together on the ferry at the end of the film. (and here there is the implication that joseph has manipulated things so that auguste is on that ferry, having inspected valentiné's ticket to see which sailing she is booked on.)

its my favourite film because there's so much going on that you don't see at first and so many things that make you wonder "did kieslowski mean that or is it in my head?" for instance - is the judge meant to be god or some supreme being ?also irene jacob as in the double life of veronique is outstanding, there may be a few superficially prettier actresses but none who manage to convey beauty of spirit with physical beauty the way she does.tritingnant also is magnificent without really saying much and the things he does say are excellent such as his answer to valentine . . . "be".

"best in show" is certainly christopher guest's funniest and deepest movie yet. the characters are excellently portrayed and the connection of pet to owner adds a new level of comedy to the movie. i've been a fan of guest since spinal tap but in this movie he has truly achieved what he set out to do in the "mock-umentary," a genre he invented and has now perfected.

in this offering, one only has to view the current westminster kennel club's annual offering to see the parallels. outrageously funny and captures the true essence of the competition. one can only imagine the wit of the producers and the amazing ability of the performers. i too would have nominated this movie for a globe award and feel it is one of the funniest i have ever seen.

in an earlier comment i mentioned how much i enjoyed this film - better second time around. i don't resile from that opinion. strangely, i can't find anyone else who did like it. my mother was going to see it but several friends told her "no way". my sister and her family saw it and half the theatre walked out part-way through. my wife's suggestion is that australians see the characters as just normal, everyday americans and therefore it's not funny. but, hey, most americans think all australians are like crocodile dundee, so it's nice to have the boot on the other foot for a change.

this is one of the funniest movies i've seen in ages. i watched for about 20 minutes, slightly puzzled by what was going on. then i started to laugh and didn't stop 'til long after the movie ended. such deadpan satire is rare indeed. christopher guest has a true eye for the humor inherent in those who have no sense of humor about themselves (about 90% of white heterosexual males, to start with). as in "waiting for guffman" guest nails middle america's idiotic self-importance to the wall. i can hardly wait for his next film.

this flick was even better then 'waiting for guffman'. the great strength in these two films lie in the brilliant character acting by guest and levy's little second-second city troupe. if one finds this movie boring or pointless, god help 'em, they just didn't get it. it is a mockumentary, something at which guest and levy have a genius for. at the end of the movie where guest's southern down home dog lover tells us that to relax after the show, he went to israel to work on a 'caboose', or when he tells us that ventriloquism is an ancient art and we see a hieroglyphicof an ancient egyptian holding a tiny ancient egyptian in it's hand, i realized it is moments like this that make life worth living. thank you mr.guest and mr.levy, and god bless you.

it seems everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon and say "maha go go go"....the word is macha........like "mach".....pronounced maa - ka"...i grew up with this series in the early 70's here in la on the late and very lamented channel 56...before that there was tetsuwan atomu (astro boy), dating from 1963 on ol' khj tv. astro boy was the first tv example of anime we got here in the states...i was into anime as a kid and followed it until the late 80's when, by then it'd become a series of badly animated "talking heads", a phenomenon which has only gotten worse. 'nuff said.as for "speed racer", i really enjoyed the basics there, the pov shots, the cinematic aspects of live action skillfully adopted to animation...that was fairly typical of most japanese anime back then...graphics graphics graphics! take note sometime how obviously the series was inspired by stanley kramer's film "grand prix" (1966), especially the redone american credits....oh yeah, i have the original comics from which the series is based, so i know of which i speak.what were we doing animation-wise besides crap like johnny quest?.....th' same ol' stuff we'd been doin' since the 20's....ho-hum!i guess the real problem i had/have with the way anime was/is shown on american tv is the hatchet job done on the scripts, credits, etc to "sanitize" them for american audiences...i won't go into other programs as we're talking' speed here.look at clowns like peter fernandez as one of the culprits here, as he was 99% responsible for the re-writes of the series...not to mention the voice of speed, racer x and others...between him and the goofs at trans/lux ( think felix the cat and the mighty hercules - oy vey!) they took a slick, very sophisticated show and dropped it down to the level of sesame street. think "cruncher bloch", the "forthebird company", "skull duggery"...if i go on i'll puke.this series dates from 40-odd years ago but i, at the time, was keen enough to feel insulted by the dumbing down of this and other japanese programs...i mean it's obvious when someone's getting' killed but they either remove it or gloss it over........pleeeeeze!good show - originally. sadly all the more recent incarnations of the series have that crappy "made in korea" look, not to mention being nauseatingly "pc" in content. even the japanese outsource their animation now..try watchin' the original japanese opening on youtube sometime...it sends chills up my spine.....if only......oh well. robert

the role of economics in the industrialized north american market must have always been theorized in the homelands of the engines creation. persons and industrialist such as mercedes benz and the bavarian motor works (bmw) surely realized the opportunity of the north ameircan market with the purchase of fuel and number of automobiles purchased per household. this type of economic phenomena sparked the concept of speed racer.after the new constitution of japan the industrialization of the isolated island nation of japan must seek opportunity once again via economic partnerships with its global neighbors. this also helped spark the economic opportunities in the european and north american market if not the global market.speed is a young avid driver who without knowing any better is driven by his demanding father pops racer who has challenged himself his whole life to make a better machine better at winning races. it was in fact pops racer who drove his first son rex racer to the brink of destruction with his strategy of how to best use the technology he developed. as a mature racer, rex, finally realizes his own inherent values and becomes independent but still feels obligated to his younger bother speed.the exact relationship of rex racer to persons such as the inspector are never really clear, but put into dramatization. rex is eventually accused of being a type of agent for a country or organization due to his ability to be in places at times when there is no other explanation to how he would have known speed was in trouble. or the fact that the situations involved some types of illegal activity were his secretive knowledge is leveraged against an evil plot. this brings a level of cloak and dagger romance to speed racer.the mixture of speeds innocence with trixy, sprital, and chim chim brings a level of comic human nature. this concept is a good form of rhetoric to balance the themes and plots as they are played out from episode to episode. so, instead of a dry detective story the thrill of international race car driving, romance of cloak and dagger, and comedy of human nature is put into one story, speed racer.

i found this movie to be educational, entertaining and very moving. i was impressed when i learned of just how much justice arbour had contributed in during her time in kosovo.wendy crewson is highly under rated and it is good to see her again in a canadian production. other easily recognizable stars are leslie hope (24) and john corbett (sex in the city.)while the story line of this movie may not be completely factual it did leave me with the desire to learn more about the word of arbour. a great movie for inspiring young women.i say the movie is a "must see."

hunt for justice is about the setup of slobadon milosevic for his trial in the hague. while it was a little too clinical in presentation the subject matter could have gotten very depressing very quickly. a canadian judge, louise arbour, becomes the chief war crimes prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the un in yugoslavia. she battles everyone to pull out the evidence that sent milosevic to trial. not a bad docu-drama with class a directing and production work. the 'evidence' was disturbing by the shear discussion of the facts, happily they didn't go into too much detail and no real pictures of the tortured.

hunt for justice is a canadian television drama that has made it to dvd and that is reason for gratitude for those who hunger for educational dramas that inform us about facts of current history that somehow get buried in the media. the film is not a hollywood production, it relies heavily on footage from court files, but it also introduces to many of us the act of heroism of louise arbour in bringing about the trial of yugoslavian president slobodan milosevic.louise arbour (veteran canadian actor wendy crewson) is a canadian judge appointed by nato as the chief war crimes prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal in the hague. the film begins in 1996 when arbour travels to the hague to face the political obstacles that are preventing the tribunal to bringing to justice the war criminals in the war yugoslavia has been waging in serbia, croatia, and bosnia, a war that has gross evidence of crimes against humanity in the form of genocide, extermination camps, and other heinous abuses. the progress toward bringing the criminals to justice is hampered by generals (including one played by william hurt) who fear a major world war if precautions against same are infringed upon. arbour, with the keen help of her translator pasko odsak (stipe erceg), her staff including keller (heino ferch) and the unexpected assistance from british capt. john tanner (john corbett), forges ahead, focusing the impossible task of bringing all responsible parties to justice on three specific events. two of the three top suspects are captured but during their trials each meets his end. this leaves only slobodan milosevic himself, and arbour and her colleagues are successful in bringing the war criminal to justice in 1999.there are several touching side plots employed in the telling of this well-documented tale, stories that make the point in history more personal. some may find the film footage of corpses and prisoners and death camps too strong to watch, but they are necessary to bring home the purpose of the film. wendy crewson carries the power to drive the message home - the message that war crimes must never go unpunished. there is much current history to be learned from this film: writers ian adams, riley adams and m.a. lovretta have condensed the information and made it dramatic as well. director charles binamé balances the docudrama with the story progress, never forgetting that he has a tale of intrigue to tell as well. hunt for justice is worth watching! grady harp

if "love me tonight" is "the musical for people who don't like musicals", it has to be said that "the gay desperado" is definitely not a musical for people who don't like opera. in fact -- despite apparently being based on a comic operetta -- it is not really a musical at all but a spoof bandit story with interpolated unrelated arias to show off the voice of one character; and what a voice it is.nino martini, as the young singer chivo who joins the bandit troop to get a spot on the radio (no, the plot doesn't make a lot more sense later on either...), has a glorious golden tenor whose style hasn't dated a day since the era when it was recorded. the trillings and warblings of some of his musical contemporaries belong to a bygone fashion, but it's very easy to picture chivo belting out "nessun dorma" to a world cup crowd and topping the charts in the process. unfortunately, while he has an engaging grin and a decent dramatic range, he is completely incapable of acting and singing at the same time. the result is that the otherwise rapid-paced film grinds to a shuddering halt every time chivo lays his hand on his breast and starts to declaim, and the viewer's tolerance of the result is likely to depend on his appreciation of operatic performance.aside from this drawback, the film is an enjoyable broad-brush satire on hollywood conventions and the mexican bandit stereotype in particular, which achieves the vital goal of all such spoofs in making its characters engaging enough in their own right to hold the viewer's interest when the joke would otherwise have grown stale. the bandit chief and his sidekick have the traditional double-act relationship, there is an enigmatic peon with a carved-teak face, and a spirited heroine (a young ida lupino) who performs the generic "you say you hate me but you love me really" routine with a refreshing twist.overall the film is entertaining and pretty funny, and i feel i did get my money's-worth -- but it can't be denied that the musical interludes, while admirable in their own way, introduce severe pacing problems.

"the gay desperado" is wonderful throughout. the banter between leo carrillo and harold huber is as funny as anything you would hear in a movie today. best line? "that would be my third choice!" "diego" is obviously the archetype for kevin smith's "silent bob". lucien n. andoit's black and white cinematography (particularly with the banditos' shadows) was striking. all i can say about ida lupino is, "thank god for dvd!" you can go right to the scene where she is trying on sombreros and serapes and watch her standing in front of that mirror over and over again.lest i forget, that nino martini guy sings real purty, too.

i don't know where this movie was shot, but because it was shot on location, it has the authenticity that this story deserves. it is the story of a young english woman who is taken prisoner by the japanese in southern asia at the beginning of wwii, with a group of other english women. there is no prison camp for women so they are forced to march for months from place to place, because the japanese don't know what to do with them. the courage and resilience of the english women, and the bravery of the australian soldier who tries to help them, is the core of the movie. this movie is very long, maybe 10 hours, so you can watch it as it was shown on pbs, as a series, which actually adds to the feeling of the endless journey this woman makes from england, across this remote island, and finally australia. story, cinematography, location and actors combine to make this a movie not to miss. my only question is why this hasn't been released on dvd!

i cannot believe it has been 25 yrs since i first watched this story on tv. i remembered to have been very much touched by it and was lucky to get the vhs tape several years ago. i did not watch it again until just recently. i have been watched it over and over ever since. i must have watched it 10 times in the past 2 wks.the acting is superb, the story is compelling, and i am embarrassed to say that i did not appreciate actor bryan brown's talent until now. the playful facial expressions shown in the first half - when he gave jean the stolen medicine in malaya is such a contrast to his very reserved and nervous body languages shown in the second half: in their first drink together in caines and the touring of the homestead. we have to wait until the wedding reception, especially the final dance scene to see his open display of affection for jean. the same dancing eyes that first revealed his admiration in malaya. who wouldn't want to be his mrs. boong ? while joe changed from a cocky, almost bigger than life figure in the malaya jungle to a somewhat self-conscious average joe in his own backyard, jean took the opposite road; her wartime experience seems to have given her new confidence. she wasted no time and went after what she wanted. she took steps to take what she could get - exactly as joe had told her to once upon a time.for me, all these transformations helps to show this is more than just a love story - this is a story about growth, courage and fragility in life. the solicitor -noel is both a sweet and sad figure. he too gave much to jean - he gave his last hope for love. at the end, he did what true love requires -- he put her happiness ahead of his own.i happened to like the fight between joe & jean that was not in the book. i thought it's an appropriate and necessary addition for it helped to surface the inner struggles they both had to deal with in order to make their life together possible.now, i am older, maybe i understand life, love and loss a little better. this story touches me even deeper. i am, however, surprised to see b. brown has blue eyes in the promo photo shown on this site. he most definitely did not in "a town like alice." well, 25 yrs is a long time !

jean paget, joe harman, and noel strachan--all are unlikely heroes and survivors. petite but strong jean whose strength and resolve help save lives, marching hundreds of miles and with calm self-discipline and persuasive powers, joe harman ("oh my word") who took risks for jean and the other prisoners, only to suffer the worst pain imaginable, and noel strahan, who trusted jean regardless of the odds. her good humor and hardiness inspire everyone around her, and those with the courage to go in with her are rewarded. the beautiful scenery and musical score adds to the adventure. despite the length it was never boring to me. these ordinary people did extraordinary things and it is based on a true story. someone borrowed my vhs a few years ago and i never saw it or them again. learned my lesson, mates, and will buy another copy when it can be found. it's a shame the miniseries is not on dvd.

i can't count the times i have watched this, and although it differs from the book in story line the mood is still the same. the bond that two such diverse people give each other that surpasses trials and years is immortal. and that the element of the women prisoners was an actual event, that did happen to real people. the story is about the strength of character of ordinary people, people who just tried to survive a horrible time in their lives. and this also presented australia in a real mode. the country is like all countries, areas that everyone loves, quaint country areas and desolate areas. but it gives shute a stage for jean's transformation from a lowly outback town to a family community.

if you love the book, as i do, stop watching the video after jean and joe meet in australia. up to that point it is a fairly faithful rendition of the book, and the visuals are great. 10 out of 10 to that point and i've enjoyed it many times. after that, the story is seriously rearranged and revised in ways that really destroy the key part of the book, i.e., how jean creates a town like alice (springs). in the early part, the major change is to make strachan a 40-something bachelor instead of a seventy-year old widower. this rather skews this love story, especially when there are also small changes that contribute to making him more selfish and avaricious, such as: in the book, he intimates to joe at the ship that he might find more than a letter waiting for him in australia, but in the video he gives joe no clue about jean's whereabouts or intentions. the last hour of the 5-hour video scrunches and mangles the last third of the book. i see no reason why they threw in a fight between joe and jean -- it is quite out of character and seems to be just an aussie dig at pommies for telling them what to do. then they bring on strachan for the wedding (instead of some three years later) -- and have him read the toast!! -- very strange, especially in the context of the relationship between jean and noel as cast in the video. the whole wedding scene is the invention of the screenwriters. these abominations take up time in the last hour, which was already not long enough to do justice to the fascinating story of how jean recreates willstown as a place where she and joe can both be happy.

this is one of my favourite books and i remember watching this series and loving it immensely. sadly i have never seen it repeated or been able to get on dvd, but it made such an impact i have never forgotten it.the lead characters were perfect for the roles, especially the lovely bryan brown and although the scenes in australia were not entirely in keeping with the book at least they were there, unlike the film version with virginia mckenna which missed that part out altogether.i agree that gordon jackson's character of strachan is entirely different from the book but he is still excellent. for your information "moley75" "strawn" is the gaelic pronunciation of "strachan".

this review contains what might be a spoiler if you never read the book or saw the cover of the video box. so if you want to approach the movie not knowing anything about it, except that i like it a lot, stop here...the production values are not first rate, but the acting between the leads is, and they give the romance between them more life than shute does in his novel (although i generally prefer the novel). my very faint objections to the film as opposed to the book is that the film dumbs-down some of the relationships with secondary characters, and between the lead characters in a scene toward the end of the film, to provide for some not at all realistic dramatic tension and as a general plot device. all this is handled much better in the book, with the result that i find the end of the book quite a bit more touching than the end of the movie.

this movie is a sleeper - i've watched every miniseries that was ever on tv, some many times, and this one is the best. wonderfully cast, superbly acted, and the characters are well-developed. helen morse perfectly fits the part of jean paget - strident, in control, sharp, and a bit belligerent. she bounces well off of joe harmon, the cowboy/taciturn/"it'll be okay" sort of guy. i was sorry that the movie didn't stick to the book, in that there was no romantic interest between noel struan and jean paget. for those who don't know, this is taken from a true story about english women marched around malaya for 3 years by the japanese, who indeed did not know what to do with them. very few of them survived. neville shute talked to one of them, and this is her story. this movie deserves to be in everyone's collection who loves wwii stories.

i have seen this film at least 100 times and i am still excited by it, the acting is perfect and the romance between joe and jean keeps me on the edge of my seat, plus i still think bryan brown is the tops. brilliant film.

i raced to the library to check out this miniseries after having just finished listening to the marvelous "talking books" unabridged version of the book. the first half of this tv version is really very good, but it stumbles quite a bit in the second half. the relationship with the trustee is overplayed and conflicts are inserted between jean and joe that don't exist in shute's story, unwisely in my opinion, as they greatly diminish the power of their love story. i was disappointed to find that the wonderful bryan brown's joe seemed a lot cockier and much less appealing than the man in the book, but helen morse's jean was really quite good. i think they would have had to make this a 10-hour miniseries to develop the outback story properly. but all that said, i did watch whole thing in more or less one go and did appreciate its merits, all the while wishing that someone would do a less soapy remake.

i remember watching this series avidly and being so disappointed when it came to an end. over the years since then, i have tried to find out if i could obtain a copy of it on either video or d.v.d., to no avail. however, i was delighted to find this website with details of it, only to be disappointed again at the point of purchase, that the videos available will not play on english recorders! this production was so wonderful, being absolutely accurate with nevil shute's novel, taking the storyline through after the end of the war, with joe and jean's subsequent life together - absolutely marvellous - and i just wish i were able to see it again, as since it's original screening, there have been no repeats of it on british television.

this is a really sad, and touching movie! it deals with the subject of child abuse. it's really sad, but mostly a true story, because it happens everyday. elijah wood and joseph mazzello play the two children or lorraine bracco, a single mother who just tries to make a home for them. while living with her parents, a man, who likes to be called "the king" comes into their life. he hits the youngest boy, bobby, but the two brothers vow not to tell their mother. but finally she finds out, after the bobby is hurt badly. the end kind of ruined it for me, because it is so totally unbelievable. but, except for that, i love the movie.

well...i like this movie first of all because it's very well thought of... and well..because the um...director and others chose an extremely great actor to play mike....and also my last reason because ( my opinion) elijah wood is so so hot!!!

"radio flyer" is one of my most loved american movies.the really great job of two boys, joe mazzello and elija wood, (in spite of terrible performance of t.hanks at the beginning and ending...) with marvellous script of d.m.evans and powerful and emotional directing of r.donner plus absolutely incredibly peerless music score of h.zimmer allowed the "radio flyer" to win one of the first places in my family's rating of movies.it's so pity that that very good movie was underrating by some movie critics.i just can't help waiting to see it on dvd.

where do i begin? i first saw this film in 1995 and had no idea of what to expect, i was actually at the time searching out films that elijah wood had starred in and this one had come highly recommended. i sat down and watched the film once and didn't know what to think. i watched it a second time a few days later and the floodgates just opened. never before in my life had i ever really cried while watching a film, and i was blubbing, every high and low the film i was riding right alongside, on an emotional roller coaster.it struck such an emotional chord in me on many levels, the intense sadness and elation we see in the film, the wonder and innocence of childhood, the yearning for a time that once was, but is no more. more than anything, this film reminded me of my childhood (except for the abuse) during a time in my life when i'd shrugged off my childhood some years before and not even really noticed, i'd given it up and moved on to a life entirely devoid of it. the radio flyer made me wake up and suddenly realise what i'd given up without really even noticing. from that day forward i immediately set about to change my life and myself, and i did.this is going to sound corny but basically i rediscovered my inner child, i started down a path that has been ongoing over the past 6 years and has changed me so much, so much for the better, embracing and living that part of myself. i've been finding out who i really am. i don't think it was simply a case of the right film coming along at a crucial moment of my life, the radio flyer really did something very special, and i still look upon it as an incredible piece of work in all respects, an incredible film.in closing i cannot fail to mention the music. i am a great fan of hans zimmer and this is among his very finest works. the sheer breadth and depth of emotional expression he has put into the score of this film is a huge part of what makes the film what it is to me. like subtitles to a foreign language film, his soaring music is a crib sheet to the intense emotions this film will take you through. find the soundtrack at all costs, it was sadly deleted long ago, i never expected to find it but amazingly did, after chatting with someone i met on a hans zimmer fansite guest book.watch this film, let yourself live the emotions, don't get bogged in trivial nitpicking of the ending, be that child again

i am a 20 year old bloke from england. i don't cry at films. but this one moved me. i cried like a girl! this is absolutely the most moving film i have ever seen, even though the story was questionable. joseph mazello's little face when he dreams of crying made me sob every time. how could anyone hurt such a sweet looking kid? i'm going to cry now just thinking about it! remarkable.

young elijah wood and joseph mazzello are outstanding in this excellent film about two boys who have promised to "take care of their mother," and how they cope when their new stepfather begins beating the younger boy. the supporting cast around the boys is top-notch as well. the script really gets inside the mind and heart of an imaginative child. it's hard to believe wood could grow up to look anything like tom hanks, but that's nothing new in hollywood. that's honestly my only criticism of the film.

this story is an excellent tale of two boys that do whatever they can to get away from there abusive drunkard father. "lord of the rings" star elijah wood is outstanding in this unforgettable role. this movie is one of the main reasons i haven't touched a single beer and never will as long as i live. that might make me sound like a nerd, but that's what i have to say. it is a wonder why this isn't hearld as a classic american tale.

i first saw this movie as a younger child. my sister had told me about it and i thought it would be more of a kid's movie. however it remains to also be an incredible movie. true that the subject behind the movie is ruff but also true this movie will never stop touching your heart.i was only 6 when i first saw it and just yesterday, 7 years later, i saw it again. for the first time in a long time. even after i knew how it ended, i knew that i had seen it a billion, bizillion times i wept like a teeny weeny little baby. when i saw it a few years back i finally got the idea and the seriousness of the film. so i stoped watching it for a while. but yesterday i didn't change the channel, i watched it. by the end i was astonished at how much it still made me laugh, cry, think, and above all, believe in mericals again. i haven't belived in a long time and this movie got me out of my shell and opened up my heart. this movie wasn't just impacting. i was also so impressed with the actors. especially bobby. so if you are wanting to see this movie for the first time i suggest seeing it alone. with tissues. and being ready to discover your young, sweet, innocent side and the side that still has hope. this movie touched my soul when i was only 6, and even in this time of trying to figure out who i am this movie helped me realize both what i don't and still do want to be in life.

this has to be the best movie of all time (in my opinion). it really taught me when i watched when i was 10 (in 2000) that the freedom of a being a child slips away sooner then we expect it to. also joseph mazzello has to be my favorite actor ever, and i think that him and elijah wood did a great job in the roles of brothers. this movie is quite sad, and some people don't understand the ending. but the story itself is quite incredible, the thought of a poor 7 year boy (bobby)getting abused by drunken step father is horrible, and what the two boys do about this is sad, and important. my favorite part of the movie is when tom hanks (older mike) lists the 7 things of being a kid that are lost to the grownup world. however there are some parts that could have been done better in this movie, such as the casting of the mother (lorraine braco), who i think is a horrible actor. "the king" played his role well, since it is a hard role to play. joseph and elijah definitely were the stars of the movie. i couldn't believe how well they played victims of a abusing stepfather, being the age that they were (7 and 9). but overall, i recommend this movie to anyone, who loves great child actors, and a great movie. :)

my take on the ending. bobby died at the hands of his step father. mike had tried as he may to get bobby out. only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine that could fly. bobby died.... mike as a child survived by creating an alternative ending in his mind...on how bobby left....mike made a plane that flew bobby out. children who are sexually and violent abused often create whole other worlds in their minds to survive.was also great seeing my old housing area. we called it san jose boulevard and i lived right around where these house were filmed. it was so strange to see that they filmed inside the houses...not studios... it was my kitchen, bedroom and living room. and those hills...we use to hike them as kids....looking down on our little valley....seeing glimpses of the bay. was a real nostalgia trip for me.

this movie was a heart-felt piece of cinema that helped show the darker side of childhood, and the little things that shaped who tom hank's was. using a very cryptic story, they were able to give you an idea of what truly happened to tom hank's character as a child. and while scenes like the flying machine may have never happened, it helped to show how even denial can help tell the truth. in all good conscience, i could not rate this lower then a 9 out of 10, great performances from all the actors, and while many may not have understood the cryptic ending in which the brother is murdered by his step father, and tom hanks covers it up using a far-fetched story about a flying machine, pay close attention to the little details, such as the turtle that he still has, even though his brother "flew" off with it. truly, a beautiful piece of cinema, and every actor deserves recognition for it.

i am surprised that so many viewers didn't find all the symbolism in the movie.....it's what made the movie an incredible work of art! the story deals with some of the saddest content a movie could hold, yet it is one of the best movies i've ever seen because of the need for your own imagination and the brilliance in the storyline.if you will pay close attention, the message is there. the younger brother is killed by the stepfather. the older brother made up the story about the wagon flying as a way to deal with the pain of his brother's death. there are those that would argue why would he lie to his own children with the story. to me the answer is because he doesn't want to share such ugliness with his own children, or that he has blocked it out and replaced his memory of the horrific event with the thought of his brother flying away to safety. i've read some of the reviews that believe he was an only child and that he created the younger brother as an escape to deal with the abuse he suffered. although this is an interesting idea - i love the imagination used to come up with that. i don't think he would have lied to his own children about having a little brother. but, i do find it plausible that he would have lied about his little brother's death. however, i like that idea of an ending much better than the notion that the movie had no symbolism at all.there are many different takes you can have on the movie, but if you take the movie at face value.....two brothers creating a wagon that flies to escape an abusive stepfather - you've missed the brilliance. the fact that i was able to see the subtle messages in the script were what made the movie so incredible to me. it requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it work......dig deep when you watch it. you'll be amazed at the genius contained in the film. the only other movie i've seen as close to this in symbolism and subtle messages is pleasantville.....but that's a comment for another movie!

remember - before there was sidney, there was dudley.dudley digges is barely recalled today - because his heyday as a fixture in sound movies was the late 1920s and through the 1930s. except for one major performance: the ship's good natured, if tipsy doctor in the 1935 mutiny on the bounty, most of his films are barely revived. more's the pity because he was a wonderful actor. in 1931 he played casper gutman (the original actor to play that villain) opposite ricardo cortez's sam spade in the first the maltese falcon. similarly, about the same time, he played the recording angel in leslie howard's version of outward bound - the same role that sidney greenstreet tackled in between two worlds a decade later.digges could be likable and lovable (that ship's doctor again), or detestable (in china seas, as the judgmental first mate sneering at poor lewis stone but then proving he's as big a coward in a moment of crisis). he held his own against paul robeson in the emperor jones. he is the chinese freedom fighter working with gary cooper in the general died at dawn. digges could do anything. here, he is mr. thompson, the hypocritical and thieving warden of a reform school that frankie darro and his friends are sent to for committing a robbery and injuring a greek-american store owner (it is the latest incident for most of them). digges is as bad here as in china seas, but it is a close thing to totally dislike him. he's able to somehow transcend his roles...more later about that.darro has a gang of urban delinquents (including a jewish boy and "farina" from "our gang"). as pointed out in another review, it is a prototype of the bowery boys. we see them shake down car owners to pay them to "watch and protect" their autos. when one guy won't do it, they calmly wreck his car. the snatch and grab robbery at the store of the greek-american is also rather graphically shown - his skull getting fractured when pushed. the boys are rounded up and brought before stern but decent judge arthur byron, who realizes that he can't leave the kids with their parents: the parents are unable to watch them, or are incompetent. unfortunately there are three racial stereotypes in this sequence: a jewish father who is more concerned with his business than with his son, farina's stereotype "yassum" father, and the an italian father whose willingness to cooperate gets his son out of going to the reform school.once there the boys find the regime oppressive. occasionally one of the guards or the nurse (madge evans) tries to speak up for them. but digges has no time for coddling. his is a regime determined to break the boys so they behave themselves. unfortunately, digges and his bookkeeper partner are greedy. they have been serving inferior food to the boys and pocketing the profit. one day a new official comes from the state to look at the reform school. it's jimmy cagney, who is a hack ward heeler whose gang got the vote out for edward maxwell. as a reward (he could not get the park commissioner post) cagney was made an assistant school inspector. he is supported by his hanger-on pal and factotum allan jenkins (in his first warner brother film). the irony is that if digges were a bit more careful, cagney would probably have let him continue running things. but cagney arrives to see darro brought to digges for fighting. the warden and darrow have had problems about respect earlier, and digges now intends to punish darro who flees - but get seriously injured by digges' barbed wire fences and his free use of a whip. cagney stops digges and lets evans treat darro's injuries. and she explains the reality of the situation to cagney, and her own idea of real reformatory reform of the boys by building up trust in them with responsibility.the film follows this to the end, showing that cagney and evans are on the right path, turning the reformatory as a "republic" for the boys to run properly. this leads to conflict with digges, whose profiteering is reduced as he is no longer getting supplies. but the scheme is derailed when cagney himself finds he may be in serious trouble with the law. digges sees his opportunity and fully takes it. but then he goes too far...far more than he ever bargained for.the 1930s had many films showing kids taking steps to right wrongs and change things. darro appeared in such as wild boys of the road. cecil b. de mille did this day and age, where the kids teach a lesson to a gangster played by charles bickford that scares the hell out of him. so it went in the 1930s. the mayor of hell reaches a similar intensity of vengeance and juvenile justice seeking. but that's the one problem of the film. digges' character is a knave and hypocrite, so we never really cheer for him, yet if he wasn't a thief we might go along with his view (even if it is counter-productive). the scenes at the start of darro and his gang preying on people actually make the harshness digges would follow seem fairly understandable (even if his thieving ways are not). also he has one moment when he's justifiably angry at cagney - at that point in hiding from his own clash with the law - giving orders over a phone from long distance to a befuddled digges. when digges learns what's actually happened he is justifiably furious at cagney lecturing him about proper behavior. it is the closest thing to making mr. thompson sympathetic in this fine movie.

this one of those social dramas that wb knew how to put together and were guaranteed boxoffice hits in the thirties. this early "dead end kids" are sent to a reform school where they are mistreated. cagney, a gangster as part of a deal is appointed as the commissioner of the school. he doesn't take it seriously at first but he changes and makes the necessary changes to improve the lives of the boys. the idea is to let the boys rule and administer their community. whether this is sound social reform is beyond my belief but it's a movie. it's a lot like boys town with a slight darker tone. a useless happy ending deluges what impact the scene prior hard but is still good. wb would later make this same movies with bogart in the cagney/fatherly role.

james cagney (the yankee doodle dandy boy) was just starting his career and was able to perform as a gangster and also a social worker for a boys reform school which is being run by corrupt politicans. the reform school inmates are underpriviledge minors from the streets of new york, like the "east side kids" who were poor and uncared for during the great depression. in the final scenes, there is a trial held by the reform school boys with flaming torches and a barn which is set on fire and a big leap by the corrupt warden. i noticed that they did let the horses out of the barn first. this film is not shown very often and i really can understand why!

james cagney, racketeer and political ward heeler, get to become a deputy commissioner of corrections and visits a boys reform school. the catch is that cagney is not in it for the graft, he genuinely wants to make a difference in the lives of the kids there because he comes from a background like their's.the villain of the piece is dudley digges who is a grafting chiseler and a sanctimonious hypocrite to boot. one of the subtexts of the plot of the mayor of hell is that these kids are mostly immigrants and those that judge them and are in positions of power are those who are here a few generations. note in the mess hall scene as digges offers a prayer of thanks for the food they are about to receive, digges is eating well, but the kids are getting quality you wouldn't feed to your pet.cagney has his own troubles back in the city with some of his henchmen and he has to take it on the lam. that puts digges back in charge and setting up the film for it's climax.the mayor of hell was a typical product from the working class studio. and because it was pre-code it gets pretty gruesome at times. a later version of this, crime school, with humphrey bogart and the dead end kids, was a more sanitized remake.although cagney is fine in the lead role as is madge evans the school nurse, the acting honors go to dudley digges. hard to believe that the same man could portray the drunken, but kindly, one legged ship's surgeon in mutiny on the bounty. but digges is a fine player and a joy to watch in every film he's in. this film is not shown to often because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes it portrays. a whole lot of minorities would be offended today. still it's a fine film.interestingly enough a few years ago the film sleepers came out and it touched on some of the same issues. i guess films about reform schools don't change in any time.

this is a typically fast-moving entertaining movie of the early 1930s. when you have james cagney in the lead, these "pre-code" films are even better: just fun stuff to watch. usually, when films are "dated," it's a negative but not so with films from 1930-1934. yeah, with the slang and the attitudes, dress, hairstyles, etc., they are dated but that's a big part of the fun. these films have an edge to them that almost always are fun to view.they also have a corniness which is appealing and fascinating. you see people - like the juvenile delinquents pictured in this film and their goofy parents - that you just don't see in any period but this one (early '30s). early on this movie, the kids go before the judge and you sit and just laugh at these crazy characters that appear in court on behalf of their kids, one after the other. yes, we get the stereotypical emotional italian father; the jewish dad; the anglo-saxon mom and a few other moms who all, in dramatic form, plead theirs is "a good boy." even though things are predictable in some cases, you don't mind because everyone in here is so much fun to watch.this also teaches you that kids were punks 75 years ago, too, stealing, robbing, mugging, lying - hey, that's the human condition. this movie debunks the theory that "people were nicer back in the old days." no, people have always been rotten or good. the degree was aided by their environment, parents, financial situation and other things. here, we get a bunch of "dead end" kids who wind up in reform school.the ridiculous and stupidly-liberal storyline has kids acting immediately like angels once they run the show at the reform school; not punished in the slightest for causing a man to fall to his death and setting the institution on fire (the explanation: he was a meanie and deserved it. so much for real justice and reform.); and "patsy" shooting a guy bit never having to even be questioned by police because he's the good guy! notice the subtle anti-religious dig in which the only guy seen praying is the evil "warden." that's no coincidence, no accident. that sort of negative-association things has been going on ever since the hays code was canned in the late '60s and was seen, as you see hear, in the pre-code early '30s.dudley digges, by the way, is outstanding in his "bad guy" role of "mr. thomson." i especially his voice was very effective and could picture him playing one of those similarly-evil roles as an institution boss in a charles dickens film adaptation. cagney played his normal role, the take-no-guff tough guy who gets the pretty girl, "dorothy griffith," played by madge blake. frankie darro also was effective as the leader of the boys, "jimmy smith." just the looks on darro's face alone made his character believable. some thing he was the real star of the film, but i'll still go with cagney. the rest of the reform school kids weren't too believable and they were really ethnic stereotypes, but they were all fun to watch.i thought the most interesting part of the film was the first 20 minutes when we saw how bad these kids were and witnessed the good and bad and stereotypical parents in the court after the kids were arrested. those scenes are pure 1930s dead end kids stuff. they always showed the kids to be bad news at the beginning of the film, but by the time the story was over they all looked acting more like wally and beaver cleaver - hardly rough "delinquents." it's very far-fetched but it works, entertainment-wise.overall, a hokey but very entertaining movie, typical of cagney films and those of the early '30s. almost all of them rate at least eight stars for their entertainment value.

the great james cagney, top-billed in big letters, doesn't show up till the movie's second third, and probably has less screen time than dudley digges, who plays the eee-vill reform-school potentate. but when jimmy arrives, as a deputy commissioner of something-or-other out to reform reform schools, he slashes the air with his hands and jumps on the balls of his feet and spits out punchy warners-first national dialogue with all the customary, and expected, panache. the psychology in this crisp antique, one of warners' many efforts to assert its place as the "socially conscious" studio, doesn't run deep: digges is bad just because the script requires him to be, and there's the quaint notion that juvenile delinquents will turn into swell kids if they're just given a dash of autonomy. but it's made in that spare, fast style that the studio specialized in, and it never bores. frankie darro, who got into all kinds of onscreen trouble during a brief tenure as warners' favorite rotten street kid, is an ideal jd -- a handsome, charismatic toughie with a pug nose and a hate-filled stare that could wither steel. no kid actor today can touch him.

it is the best movie on acting i have ever seen. all the artists are old turkish theater actors, they are magnificent in this movie.it is sometimes said that "they do not act, they live it", you can really see this in this movie. the director is also competent, you cannot see lots of moving cameras around but the positions of the cameras are also good. but after the acting, the most outstanding part is the content of the movie. it gives happiness, enthusiasm, desire to live, importance of real friends to people. we all started to live individually nowadays, in this film you see that there are someone other then us. and most importantly, you see that the most honorable feeling in the world is love, loving your friends, loving your darling. all people should see this movie...

i mention that there may be a spoiler here just to be cautious because of what i discuss, although i don't really think i am giving away anything important. any "suprises" are really unimportant to this film's success or a viewer's ability to enjoy it. while not without some very minor flaws, this is a beautiful and very moving film about friendship, time, uncertainty, and the choices people make about their lives. yet, at the same time, it is also a very humorous film, with small, mostly understated bits of comedy woven in throughout. for much of the film, it progresses at a fairly leisurely pace, but it does not seem slow at all since the film draws one into it and into the lives of the characters, and at first it is mostly rather light-hearted. some have commented that much of the film seems slow, but it is such a wonderful portrayal of the lives of such sympathetic characters that one could watch it almost endlessly. as it progresses, the film becomes more emotional and moving up to the very end and the progression is handled wonderfully. eventually, some of the characters decide to rob a bank and although it is perhaps somewhat hard to believe, that is beside the point. it is a wonderful addition to emphasise the love that these friends have for each other while at the same time it accents the humour and adds a little more irony to the film. and, although hardly original to have a bunch of old guys rob a bank, the context and details are quite original and they do it wonderfully, making it really quite funny as well, such as when ismet (if i remember correctly) exaggerates his aggressiveness to "disguise" the fact he's old.as i said, most of the other comedy is rather low-key but still very humorous so i was constantly chuckling throughout. the actors are probably the real key to this film. they imbue the characters with deep personality and sympathy and portray them with great care and warmth. there are some small transformations or tiny details of the characters' personalities which are pulled off smoothly and beautifully. of course, the film is about the personalities of these very characters and how they care for and interact with one another. it succeeds so well because of them and if lesser actors had the roles the movie could well have failed.gule gule is not without sadness, but that simply provides the full range of emotions and provides a more powerful experience. in fact, the film is so moving and filled with so much love from such rich characters that it is in the end a very heart-warming, satisfying, and even happy film despite its sadness. i could watch it over and over.

peak practice was a british drama series about a gp surgery in cardale  a small fictional town in the derbyshire peak district  and the doctors who worked there. it ran on itv from 1993 to 2002, and was one of their most successful series at the time. it originally starred kevin whately as dr jack kerruish, amanda burton as dr beth glover, and simon shepherd as dr will preston, though the roster of doctors would change many times over the course of the series.the series was axed in 2002 and ended on a literal cliffhanger when two of the series main characters plunged off a cliff. viewers wrote to itv in their thousands and a petition for one last episode was set up by website peak practice online. however, all pleas were unsuccessful and itv said they would not make any more episodes.peak practice was replaced by sweet medicine, another medical series set in derbyshire. it lasted a few episodes before it was dropped from the schedules.cardale was based on the derbyshire village of crich, and the series was filmed there and at other nearby derbyshire towns and villages, most notably matlock and ashover. after the end of this programme, itv attempted to launch a follow-up series called sweet medicine, which extended the stories of different characters from the original show.

if you have not heard of this film, it follows two sudanese refugees from a refugee camp in africa to america, where they convince themselves they will find success and riches. life is harder than expected in the states, and this film beautifully captures the frustration felt when things are not going right. the lives are captured so well many moments seem scripted because they're so perfect. whether it be on the job, at school, or the time in between, the two boys, peter and santino, are very honest with the filmmakers, and make some very thought-provoking comments about life in the states. it's one of the only documentaries i can recall that, when it ended, i wanted it to go on for another two hours. it might be difficult to find this movie cause it didn't get great distribution, but check your local "art house" or independent theater and give this one a go (side note, if you're reading this when it's already on video then definitely it's worth a rent). rating: 28/40

well made documentary focusing on two sudanese refugees who get resettled in the united states. it's your basic fish out of water story with a non-fiction twist. i found it fascinating to see how peter and santino lived prior to coming to america and how they adapted once they arrived here (in houston, texas.) they expected a sort of heaven but found out that it's a lot harder than it looks to cope well in the states. they go from hopeful idealists to somewhat more realistic skeptics. everywhere they go they meet bureaucrats with paper trails that most citizens may take for granted. they fret that they are blacker than the african-americans here and don't feel accepted because of that. one of the "lost boys" manages to leave houston to go to olathe, kansas, where he finds conditions slightly better but still less than ideal. there are people that try to help them as well as try to hurt them in this film. not shown, but talked about, are those who put a gun to their heads and robbed them, leading one lost boy to comment negatively that "all black people in america are no good." i found it interesting, too, that they arrived in houston in august 2001, a month before the world trade center was attacked by terrorists. i had hoped to see their reaction to this tragedy but it's not mentioned at all. still, all in all, a really well done documentary with no narration. none is needed really. the "lost boys" do a fine job expounding on the events going on around them without any help at all, thank you very much.

i've heard about this documentary for so long i knew i needed to take the time to watch it. as a documentary it's very well done, in that it takes a neutral observant view of their experience. there are no voice-overs, or interviewing. it is honest. it is true. it is also humbling. two comments really stayed with me after the film was done. one was how the boys are told to not to become like the american boys who wear the baggy pants, and how in africa there is time but no money, but in america there is money but no time. the biggest impact was how the boys hungered for education, and how one of the boys totally relocated himself so he could go to school. i watched this film with a high school sophomore who said it upset him to see how the boys were brought to their new life without any real orientation to america. he also said he knew so many american teens who simply cannot appreciate howblessed their lives are in america. i would agree with him on both accounts. a strong film that will leave a person thinking about many things.

in sudan, the arabs rule and are constantly at war with the christians and animists who inhabit the southern portion of this east african country. this film follows a group of of dinka boys, a tribe of cattle herders, whom were left orphaned after their village was destroyed and their families killed in a brutal attack carried out by the arab forces. most of these boys are now teenagers and have been dubbed "the lost boys".the filmmaker follows a group of the "lost boys" on their journey, as they have been accepted as refugees in the us, where they will land in houston. those who've been accepted as refugees gain celebrity status, as they feel (from what they've heard) that america is amazing. making a trip from sudan to america is like "making a trip to heaven" says the one young man. a huge party is thrown for their departure, and they are told to do sudan well, and once they have been educated, to return to sudan so that they can contribute to dinka society. they are also warned not to be like "those with the baggy pants" whom are responsible for the negative stereotype of black men, and also, no matter what happens, not to forget the dinka culture.you watch as the boys come from a third world country into america and how they attempt to integrate into american society, as they have gone from a place with practically nothing to this plentiful world where everything is massively overproduced and overconsumed. they are taught about cleanliness and how to use all the utilities that we take for granted on a daily basis. it is humorous at times, humbling at others.listening to the comments they make about black americans and american society/culture are quite interesting. as the film progresses you see how american culture begins to corrupt their previously humble ways of thinking.one of the boys, peter, is not content with working and making just enough to survive, so he up and moves from houston to kansas city so that he can pursue an education. when the other boys visit him, they talk about how they cannot get into any schools. the main reason they came to america was to get an education and the media is saying that the boys have been brought from sudan for an education. this is occurring because the boys were given arbitrary ages, making them older than they actually are, preventing them from being able to enroll in high school.the film juxtaposes images from houston to kansas. we watch as peter enrolls in school, where he befriends a group of christian conservative kids, and as santiago attempts driving school(even though he drives without his license anyways), and works at walmart. we see peter struggle with high school life as he strives to make his schools basketball team, and as santiago has trouble keeping up with work, the rent, appeasing tensions back home in sudan, and most of all, coping with loneliness.it comes to the point where the boys want to return to sudan, and tell them that everything they are taught about america there is lies. "you must make it alone here, do everything alone" one of the boys says. a damning message to a liberal capitalist lifestyle, showing how it causes people to become radical individualists (a trend which led to the creation of both the neo-conservative and radical islamist movements). their biggest beef with america though, is that there is no time; time is money and we don't waste a second! despite all this, the boys never lose their sense of dinka culture. they celebrate southern sudan liberation day, which marks the day which the spla began to fight in sudan, a fight which continues today. they also meet with other "lost boys" on the anniversary of their arrival in america, where they discuss their experience in america as compared to back in sudan. when asked, one boy says that if he were able to make a living he would much prefer to live in sudan. it is much too lonely in america he adds. they never lose their sense of community, which has been conditioned into them as part of their culture!this film makes us question the way we live, makes us question the artificial happiness that materialism and the nature of our societies has created within us. it will also change the way i look at refugees, i will never again take for granted how hard they must work and what immigrants mean for a country such as my own, canada. this is a wonderful film. i laughed, i cried..a very emotional journey, and a very well made documentary. 10 out of 10.

this documentary is not only one of the best documentaries i've seen, but also one of the most moving and quietly beautiful movies i've seen period. it follows the lives of two sudanese young men, peter and santino, as they try to make their way into the american culture. peter and santino are friends at first, but they gradually drift more and more apart, as peter goes to kansas city, and santino stays in houston ("a land called houston"). santino's beauty is in his eyes. he takes people onto his back, he supports an apartment full of other sudanese, paying the rent, doing everything for other people. he is a quiet sufferer. peter looks out for himself, getting a high school education while playing basketball and making christian friends. it seems that director megan mylan did not know what she was getting herself into with the beauty of this tale. peter and santino are amazing characters that move you. but the real strength in this movie lies in its commentary on american society. it is not judging. it shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world, and how difficult it can be to outside people. i suggest you find this film, and look at america through the lives of these two fascinating and beautiful people.my grade: 10/10

what a crazy film!it lasts 12(!) hours and you don't understand who these people are and what are they doing!the main plot is about a bunch of clueless actors trying to bring on scene "prometheus",but there are lots of sub-plots,like the disappearing of thomas and a crazy guy looking for monsieur warok....what's the meaning of all this???

i loved this movie! so worth the long running time. i need help with the ending though....*spoiler*the final shot of marie at the end - is this to suggest that she is still searching for renaud? or possibly that she was the one who wanted to reinvigorate the 13? (she seemed to be the one who delivered the initial letter to colin in the first place) i don't quite understand it, but i know i really liked it. so if anyone has seen this and remembers it or has just seen it, please elaborate on the ending.thanks

one has to be careful whom one tells about watching 12-hour long films. it could become easy for people to assume that this is some kind of regular occurrence - in fact, even in the world of 'arthouse' cinema, such mammoth running times are extremely rare, for obvious reasons. this is one thing that hollywood and art cinema share in common: the generally accepted running time of 90-120 minutes, with a minority of movies that dare to approach, but rarely exceed, the three-hour mark.for this reason, a film like out 1 (runtime: 729 minutes) is a challenge for even the most hardened cinephile, and it goes some way in explaining why it has only ever been screened on a handful of occasions and remains extremely hard to find.originally devised as a tv series by maverick nouvelle vague director jacques rivette, it raised little interest from the french networks, and wound up being given a brief theatrical run instead (peter watkins was forced to do much the same with his brilliant nuclear war pseudo- documentary the war game, although that had more to do with state censorship than issues with running time). shown a couple of times in 1971, out 1 has re-emerged at a handful of rivette retrospectives over the last two decades, and many who have seen it, including esteemed us critic jonathan rosenbaum, have acclaimed it as one of the greatest films of all time.is it? well, yes, if you like rivette. that alone is a big 'if', as jacques rivette has never been a commercially successful director. only two of his films were hits (celine and julie go boating (1974) and la belle noiseuse (1991), both superb), and many remain difficult to find on dvd today (out 1 only recently became available over the internet after a rare videotape was uploaded). nevertheless, he is greatly respected within the film community, and with good reason - his playfully surreal narratives, sense of pacing and use of improvisation set him apart as one of cinema's most unique and satisfying film-makers.out 1 deals with a theme that re-occurs throughout rivette's work: the nature of acting, particularly in the context of theatre and improvisation. his fascination with acting make rivette's films a far more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries, as the improvisational aspects allow actors to have a far more active role in determining how the film comes together. out 1 is roughly divided into four major narratives, gradually intertwining and blurring as the film develops: two consisting of acting troupes, each trying to devise post-modern theatrical adaptations of aeschylus plays; the other two individual petty thieves (played by nouvelle vague icons jean-pierre léaud and juliet berto) pursuing eccentric methods of making money; and an overarching plot involving a mysterious balzac-inspired conspiracy centred around an organisation known as 'the thirteen'.as with any rivette film featuring a 'conspiracy' narrative, the mysteries and secret organisations are little more than a red herring. as the characters are slowly explored and revealed and their plans and interpersonal connections break down, the film becomes increasingly symbolic of post-1968 ennui and the decline of the ideals of that era. for a film made in 1971, these were remarkably prescient themes; another french director in jean eustache would tackle this topic equally satisfyingly in his 1973 masterpiece the mother and the whore. but this is not the limit of out 1's scope. comprised of eight episodes of roughly 90 minutes each (the beginning of each episode has a brief, abstract black-and-white still montage of the events of the previous chapter), out 1 is no less watchable than any quality tv series, and may even be better experienced on a one-episode- at-a-time basis. this is not to say that it doesn't remain challenging even when viewed in segments. like most rivette films, it uses the first few hours to simply establish the characters before embarking on the plot, of sorts, and some of those early scenes (particularly the sequences depicting the actors' heavily abstracted 'exercises') seem interminably long. these scenes are important, however, not just as an exploration of the improvisational acting methods that play both a literal and a metaphorical role in the film, but as a method of adjusting the viewer to the somewhat languorous pace of the film. paradoxically, long takes make long films far more tolerable for an audience, and this understanding of pacing has led rivette, along with more modern directors like michael haneke and béla tarr, to create films with less commercial running-times that nevertheless retain the capacity to leave viewers enthralled.in a film that is in many ways about acting, the acting is fantastic. many famous nouvelle vague faces appear, including the aforementioned léaud and berto, the outstanding michel lonsdale and rivette regular bulle ogier. even another legendary director in eric rohmer has a great cameo as a balzac professor who appears in a pivotal scene. the people and architecture of paris c. 1971, though, seem to have an equally significant role - the city landscapes, crowd scenes and interested onlookers freeze out 1 in time, a document of a place at a point in history.after a little more than 720 minutes, the film ends on an impossibly brief, enigmatic note; yet, the exhausting journey that the viewer has taken is so full of possibilities, intricacy and spontaneity, that one would be forgiven for wanting to start all over again from the beginning, or see the next twelve hours in the lives of these characters. for those who have watched many kinds of cinema and think they have seen everything the art form has to offer, out 1 is a reminder that cinema has the potential to be so many more things and diverge in so many more directions than current conventions allow. for film-makers, film critics and artists of all disciplines, this is something to be cherished.

this is the very la nouvelle vague.one of the best films of the new wave and i dare say one of the first ten ever made! why? the atmosphere, the story,the actors (actress) are all brilliant. this is the theater, a fairy tale, the life, the film.paris. thank you mr.rivette.

i think that pierre léaud, or his character, to be precise, is really outlandish but with grace: i also remember the chess player, and of the girl who seems to be appearing by chance in his home, something really curious...the woman acting as the lawyer, is to me one of the most beautiful actresses ever seen on the screen...but i must admit that the plot is too inconsistent to be taken seriously....the character who plays as the lead theater actor is really nice, especially when he's annoyed by the new actor, the one in purple t-shirt...also, the scene where the bearded actor - who belongs to another company - directs the stage is really fascinating and relaxing, as it often happens with this movie - for example, when they drink tea, they just make you want to have a cup...

the museum of the moving image here in new york recently put on a comprehensive retrospective of jacques rivette's films. having fallen in love with his "paris nous appartient", i decided this was not to be missed.largely through extended shots and flexibly structured scenes, the movie depicts two avant-garde theater companies preparing their renditions of aeschylus' "seven against thebes" and "prometheus". additionally, we are shown the directionless day-to-day lives of two individuals distantly connected to the companies: a working class woman named frederique who finds creative ways of hustling men out of their money, and a young man named colin who visits local cafés posing as a deaf-mute, and plays shrill harmonica at the patrons until they pay him to go away. the first four hours or so are devoted to establishing the characters and their patterns, before a somewhat loose, whimsical plot finally emerges involving a conspiracy and the decoding of clandestine secret letters.the film is largely about life on the fringe of society. the theater companies are a despairing affair, using their elaborate, emotionally draining exercises (which are really something to watch) to distract themselves from the fact that their acts are unlikely ever to be staged or even seen. colin and frederique both have very few friends, who only briefly find any excitement or purpose after the conspiracy touches them, as they are spurred to find out more about it. the film meditates on the consequences of rejecting normal society in several memorable sequences, including a long shot of colin as he wanders the streets of france shouting poetry to himself. as such, the film has been referred to as an analysis of 1960's counterculture.there is not a frame of the film that is not bursting with energy and vitality. the fact that much of the dialogue and movement is improvised makes the characters much more spontaneous, much more immediate. the camera also becomes an important character in this regard; throughout the movie boom shadows are visible here and there, or other similar errors, yet they seem natural and fit with the flow of the action because the camera is so important a player therein.more than anything for me, the film seems a great example of another way of making movies, a venue for film outside the usual pattern. for me it was a mind-opening experience, even more than "paris nous appartient", though the latter bears many similarities of theme and structure. a must-see for anybody pondering the nature of art.

ok, if you would judge the movie to now a days it wouldn't fit in to well.if you watched fi now the stage and everything was pretty cheese ( i agree)but weren't all the movies in the 80's like that(gilligan,wonderwoman,aso).but too the people born in the early to mid 70's or earlier it has a cult status. evertime the plane was on approach tattoo would run up the tower ring the bell and with his accent would yell "da plane boss da plane" and you would wonder what everybody's wish would be.people who are born in the mid 80's or later wouldn't understand the hippe because if you watched it now.it don't have a harry potter,jurassic park computer animation fx.it was just a stage where you probably could even almost see the wire attached to a guy who's wish was too be able to fly.but to us during that time it was a fantasy island.

after reading some of the earlier nasty remarks, i had to put in my two cents. this show was not, despite what that goon in essex thinks, the worst thing that ever aired on tv. i think most of today's tv is much worse (when is this stupid "reality" fad ever going to end??) and there isn't a current show i can stand to watch. gimme the stuff i grew up with. i'm a 1965 baby and not ashamed to admit it.this show has been my all-time favorite for almost 30 years. i was in high school when it originally aired and i think it helped me to hang on throughout those miserable days. i was such a misfit back then, and "fantasy island" appealed to my imagination. as i was a budding writer in those days, it provided incredible opportunities for me to practice the craft. what a wonderful premise! i won't say it didn't have its faults. sometimes the scripts were pretty bad, and some of the problems seemed trivial; but it could be good too, and it was a blast to watch and still is. as for the cheesiness factor, well, i think it's unfair to label every single 70s product as cheesy. there was a lot of great stuff back then and this was among the ranks. (btw, most of the seasons aired in the 80s!!) my favorite episodes came from seasons 2, 3 and 4 mostly.to those who disparage hervé villechaize for his heavy french accent and his short stature: grow up and learn something! it's so easy to make fun when you're "normal" and "perfect". that man made the best of what he was dealt in life, and if you don't like it, that's just tough. have a little compassion. he's been dead 15 years, and how easy it is to cut down someone who can't defend himself. there's just no shame anymore.i love this show. so it looks dated. hate to tell you this, but we didn't have splashy special effects and blu-ray discs. we were lucky to have vcrs. live with it. accept it for what it is, and that's just plain fun. "escapist tv" describes it perfectly, and that's what it was for me -- an escape from my rotten real life. and it's still a lot of fun to watch.

i must warn you, there are some spoilers in it. but to start it off, i got "spanish judges" on february i think. it was mention it was the last copy, but as i see, it wasn't back-ordered. but either way, i have it. i thought it was good. i wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor, matthew lillard (i'm surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar) although it is kind of low budget, getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending. man, what a good actor.the story it about a con artist known as jack (matthew lillard) who "claims" to have merchandises called the spanish judges. if you don't know what spanish judges are or haven't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read, i won't even say what they are. i figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was. he needs protection, so he hires a couple who are also crooks, max and jamie (vincent d'onofrio and valeria golino) as well as a crook that goes by the name of piece (mark boone junior). he has a girlfriend who won't even tell anyone her name because she's from mars, as she said. so they (mainly jack) call her "mars girl". everything starts out fine, but then it turns to one big game. a game that involves some lust, lies and betrayal.there was some over acting in it (matt and valeria, as well as tamara, were not one of them). there were some scenes they could've done better and the score could've been a little better as well. some of the score was actually good. the theme they used for the beginning and the end (before the credits) was a good song choice, that's my opinion. the fight scene in the end could've been a little longer and a little more violent, but what can you do? one more comment on matt: damn, he plays a smooth, slick con man.i know this is a review, but i need to make a correction towards necro, one of the reviewers: valeria golino is not a newcomer. according to this site, she has been acting since 1983. to me, and hopefully to others, she is well known as charlie sheen's italian love interest in both the "hot shots!" movies. but good review.although i think it's one of the rare films i've seen and it's really good (which is why i gave it 10 stars above), i will give the grade of what i thought when i first saw it.8/10

im a huge m lillard fan that's why i ended up watching this movie. honestly i doubt that if he wasn't in the movie i would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it but once i did watch it realize the story was pretty decent. a bad ending i must say but i did see it coming. it's a low budget movie and some of the actors weren't really good but all in all i rated this movie 7/10.the suspense of wondering what lillard was actually up to was what really keeped me interested in this movie.its a good rental!7/10

wow, i can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie.although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is matt lillard, granted most people probably either think he's too caffeine happy or just plain sucks but we're both the same age and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that he's one of my favorites now. this is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in slc punk, another great lillard film.baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything, which start to amount to craziness. also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincent d'onofrio, a very under appreciated person in the film industry. the woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isn't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)it's a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one. they all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. matt shows his true prowess as the scheming jack who initially starts the whole scheme. vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business. vince's character is a bit deranged and skitz's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film.the surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like. this movie kept me very interested besides the fact matt was in it, it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies. critic's probably won't like this movie, but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway.

this review is based on the producer's cut: 'halloween 5' was a major disappointment at the box office way back in '89. personally, i've always loved it and am proud to have it in my collection. but because of it's failure and also because of rights issues, it would be 6 years before we would see another installment. the film had the makings of being one of the best, if not the best in the series. a hardcore fan writing the script, the return of not only donald pleasence as dr. loomis and george wilbur as michael myers, but also the return of the character of tommy doyle from the first film, a major studio backing the project, and a fall release all made the film sound like a hit in the making. so what went wrong? i'll give you two good reasons: re-shoots and poor editing. due to a bad test screening and also the unfortunate passing of donald pleasence, the film was changed, and not for the better. the film, like parts iii and 5, tanked at the box office and earned negative reviews from both critics and most series fans. but then, thanks to the magic of bootlegging, the original cut leaked out and many fans, including my self, were very happy. i will end this portion of my review by saying this: this film is, so far at least, my favorite 'halloween' film and i'm not afraid to admit that.pros: the score is simply spellbinding. has some of the best writing and dialogue of the series. 'halloween 4' emulated the original in that it was more about suspense and mood instead of blood and guts, and 6 is the same way. great performances, especially from the late and very missed donald pleasence. moves at a breathtaking pace. an interesting explanation for michael's evil and why he won't die. some brutal kills. some pretty chilling moments, my favorite being the one involving kim darby's character. a lot of really cool nods to the previous films. some good surprises. like the previous two sequels, this one has an awesome cliffhanger ending.cons: though the explanation for michael's evil is fascinating, it does make him a little less scary. since when can michael move around from place to place so fast? final thoughts: this was the first 'halloween' that i saw in the theatre. i was so excited because i really had thought 5 would be the last and then i heard this was happening. i enjoyed it at the time, but over time i saw it for what it really was: a great movie trapped in an ok one with a terrible ending. why did the filmmakers have to listen to the people at the test screenings? if they had released this superior version it may have done much better and the series might not be stuck in the mess it's in right now.my rating: 5/5

i personally love this film amidst the halloween series. i've found, after watching it with many friends, that you enjoy it completely, or find it absolutely unbearable. personally, i've watched it dozens of times, and it never gets old. there is a great back story within the movie itself, and a lot of different things are finally explained. it's a rather short movie, at just shy of 90-minutes, but it's definitely a thrill ride.the shape seems to be pretty brutal in this film, but the acting is still there with the way he walks, stalks and kills. there are a lot of neat little screen shots with micheal appearing in the background, which adds more of a spooky element to the movie.

halloween:the curse of michael myers is probably the best sequel out of all of the halloween flicks. jamie, serial killer michael myers' niece, bears a baby who is then taken by the man in black from the conclusion of halloween 5. a kind nurse helps jamie escapes but myers quickly tracks her down and kills her. jamie's baby is found and rescued by tommy doyle, one of the kids jamie lee babysat in the original film, and myers arrives in haddonfield and begins to kill off the strode clan living in his old house. the film concludes with scenes revealing clues to michael's evil, the identity of the man in black, and a close to the whole dr. loomis/michael myers storyline. i highly recommend this brilliant horror masterpiece.halloween:the curse of michael myers is rated r for strong graphic violence, extreme gore, brief sexuality, language, and brief nudity.

although i brought this film by accident (i thought it was the original halloween(stupid eh!)) i was surprised by how good it was, many sequels just continue the events of the previous films, this however tried and succeeded in explaining the events of the prequels, why does michael myers kill people and how come he seems to have supernatural abilities. i thought this was a top horror film full of action, suspense and surprises, i'm very glad i brought it. i've given it 9 out of 10.

...dislike this movie and everyone would understand why. the plot is poor, so is the acting. but in my opinion it is better than halloween 5, although even this does not give many surprising moments. a few scenes are really well directed. but these few moments do not deliver the reason to rent it. i do not despise violence in movies, but h6 features extraordinary strong and bloody scenes which do not fit to the tradition of the halloween-movies. the most sucking aspect about h6 is the lack of tension. no comparison to the first masterpiece.halloween 6 only gets 4 out of 10 stars from me. if you want, rent it. but don't expect a great horror-experience....

"opera" is a great film with some wonderful,imaginative imagery.an opera singer(cristina marsillach)is being stalked by a killer who forces her to watch him murder everyone she knows by tying her up and taping needles under her eyes.this idea of the needles comes from the fact that argento doesn't like it when people cover their eyes while watching his movies."for years i've been annoyed by people covering their eyes during the gorier moments in my films.i film these images because i want people to see them and not avoid the positive confrontation of their fears by looking away.so i thought to myself 'how would it be possible to achieve this and force someone to watch most gruesome murder and make sure they can't avert their eyes?'the answer i came up with is the core of what "opera" is about."-says argento.plenty of suspense,wonderful cinematography and brutal,gory murders.one guy is stabbed in the throat with a knife causing a gushing wound,daria nicolodi gets shot in the eye while looking through the peephole,etc.for anyone who hasn't caught this one yet,give it a try.highly recommended.

opera (the u.s. title is terror at the opera) is somewhat of a letdown after some of dario's other movies like phenomena, tenebre, and suspiria. (i still can't find inferno anywhere.) it's one of those movies that has a great first half but midway through it's like someone started slowly letting the air out of the screenplay and logic.the basic plot involves a beautiful opera singer who is being stalked by a deranged obsessed fan. this killer begins killing people close to her in a most unique fashion. he binds and gags her and tape tiny sharp pins under her eyelids so if she tries to close her eyes she'll gouge out her eyes. this forces her to watch while the killer murders her acquaintances in typically brutal and gory argento fashion.unfortunately, about midway through the film becomes sluggish and illogical. (this is especially directed towards the killer's motivations. i still haven't completely figured out why he's such a nut.) the ending especially come out of left field in the worst possible sense.but, for about the first hour or so this is some of dario's best filmmaking and the camera work is breathtaking. too bad it couldn't maintain it through to the end.rating:7

a young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first major part in a staged play as lady macbeth thanks to the mishap of the production's diva falling in front of a moving car. a success winning her accolades, betty(christina marsillach)finds instead horror as the one responsible for getting her to this point terrorizes her in cruel ways.first her stage manager boyfriend, stefano(william mcnamara)is viciously stabbed with a knife while she has to watch, rope-tied to a pillar in his uncle's vast mansion, keeping her eyes from closing thanks to needles scotch-taped under her eyes, with pricking a result if she blinks. allowing her to escape, betty again finds herself in this unfortunate position, when a specific gold chain is found on her lady macbeth wardrobe that had been torn to shreds by the madman after killing a series of crows which escaped from their cage in the equipment room, by the clothing designer who is first knocked to the floor by an iron and subsequently stabbed heinously by a pair of scissors(..to cap off this nasty scene, the chain falls into her throat with the killer having to cut open her throat to find it; while not specifically elaborating this act, dario uses the ripping sound of the scissors for optimum effect with the camera often retreating back to the victim's dead face). having nowhere to turn, inspector alan santini(urbano barberini, playing him cold and bland at dario's request)promises to catch the psycho as betty relies on her few remaining friends for comfort, the theater director marco(ian charleson, of ghandi & chariots of fire who would later die of aids;a sad footnote, dario revealed in an interview that charleson informed him at the end of the shoot that he was hiv positive)attempting the stage after a successful horror movie career despite being rejected by critics, and pal mira(daria nicolodi, dario's former squeeze), her agent and confident. but, the serial killer is quite driven and a showdown between them will, of course, occur in the theater as marco has added an interesting change to the production using the crows at his disposal.i think this is dario at his most savage & nihilistic. although he has certainly made later gruesome films(..such as his masters of horror entries and sleepless would suggest), this film really ups the ante in pure violence towards the victims of the psychopath. his method of forcing betty to watch was admittedly a gag by dario regarding the type of audience who like to look away from the more horrific parts of horror movies. i found myself rubbing my eyes every time she just has to blink(..brilliantly, dario shoots the pricking from point-of-view achieving a tormenting effect from our perspective as if we were the ones with the scotch taped needles holding our eyes open). i like how dario will show the widened eyes of betty, horrified at what she's being forced into watching, as little blood tears down the needles when she has no choice but blink. the photographic work of ronnie taylor is impeccable, such as the crow's point-of-view shot in the theater at the end as it searches for the killer. or, when the camera "travels" through rooms in the theater following the killer who wishes to see his muse from a box seat. or, the dream sequence where we are taken into betty's memory of an event regarding her mother's death by a certain killer, donning the same mask and gloves as the one causing her trauma at present. the highlight, in my opinion, is the peephole bullet-fire sequence, masterly staged by all involved as the camera follows a bullet which shoots through the eye of a victim, exploding from the back of her head, going through a telephone betty planned to use to call for help. we even get a crow pecking the eyeball from the killer(..to add to this vicious scene, the crow is shown with the eyeball rolling around in it's beak). only aspect i didn't care for, often pointed out by naysayers of the film, is the "final" ending which i personally felt was a bit unnecessary, but i guess dario wanted to point out that betty was indeed not like her mother, a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies which, in a twist, relate to why the killer torments our heroine. the rock music used during the violent scenes didn't bother me, because i felt that those moments of wicked graphic attacks needed a jarring thud which heavy metal can often provide.

i finally managed to get myself a copy of dario argento's opera, and i tell you ... that was about time !! it was the last argento movie i had yet to see and i'm a fan of most of his work. i reckon that most of his work is extremely important for the genre of horror but some of his movies tend to disappoint ( like phenomena ). but the plot idea of opera always appealed to me and it turns out i was right !! i enjoyed every shot in opera and i was fascinated by this movie for the first minute till the last. out of all the argento movies, opera went straight to the number one spot and i hope i can encourage as many people as possible to see this one as well.the script and plot-idea of opera is rather simple. especially compared to argento's previous movie phenomena that had too many ideas in it, and ended up being a mess. the plot of opera is creepy and chilling but at the same time it's an excellent satiric comment - almost a spoof - towards the opponents of explicit violence. ***spoilers*** a young opera singer ( the gorgeous cristina marsillach ) is being stalked by a horribly sadistic murderer. during every massacre he commits, he forces betty to watch his actions with her eyes wide open. there are needles attached to her eyelids and when she closes them, they're getting torn apart. ***end spoilers***. to this simple - yet effective - idea, argento adds a lot of horrific elements like ravens, the classic piece ( and curse ) of macbeth and the whole atmospheric location of the opera building and the music. especially the presence of the creepy ravens are and extra value. ancient masters like edgar allen poe already knew these black birds have a lot of mystery hanging around them, and dario argento knows it as well. the violence and gore is very well presented in opera and that's what makes this a true argento picture. his best in my opinion with profondo rosso as a close second. i surely hope to recommend this movie to a lot of people among you. especially for fans of the ( italian ) horror business, this is an absolute must ! favorite "rewind"-scene : argento shows his visual talent the best in the scene where betty's friend is getting shot in the eye while she's trying to see who's in front of the door.

if you're ok with the outlandish work of italy's premier horror directorable to accept his outrageous story lines and flamboyant stylethen you should have a great time with opera. if you don't, then you won't.cristina marsillach plays betty, a beautiful young opera understudy who is given a shot at fame (in an avant-garde production of macbeth) when the star of the show is hit by a car. as any thesp who has 'trod the boards' will know, macbeth is a production that carries a curseand betty soon discovers that the show in which she is now the star is no exception: a killer is systematically offing the staff at the theatreand poor betty is forced to watch by the sadistic murderer (who tapes needles under her eyes to prevent her from closing them!).with the help of a little girl who crawls through her air-conditioning ducts, her director and agent, and a few ravens who have seen the murderer's face (!!!), betty discovers the killer's identity, and the truth about her mysterious past.let's face it... opera is one crazy film, with its preposterous plot-turns, convoluted death scenes, and an ending that beggars belief. and whilst director dario argento has never been one for, shall we say, conventional story lines, this particular giallo is so daft, and features so many of his trademark stylish touches (all ramped up to the max), that it's almost as if, with each successive film, he is seeing what he can get away with (at times almost parodying his earlier work).this is exactly why i find the film such fun!!!argento's camera movements are absolutely incredible: gliding, creeping and, in one amazing scene, even swooping around the opera house above the audience; the power of verdi's music is combined perfectly with the synth majesty of claudio simonetti's score, providing a suitably grandiose accompaniment to the sumptuous visuals; and several outstanding set-pieces (featuring sergio stivaletti's nauseating gore fx) go to prove that no-one does death better than argento (check out one character's stunning demise, in which a bullet passes through a spy-hole in a door in slow motion, and straight into their eye!).7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for imdb.
