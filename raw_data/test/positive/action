i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film. while i am not at all a fan of british drama, i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made. i was in tears by the end of the film. every scene was mesmerizing. the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive.i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character.*******spolier alert******** i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance! ****end spoiler*****keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen, but it was sienna miller's performance that was truly oscar worthy.i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards.

despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war, this film isn't too sticky and pink, because love is as a rose: with thorns, that is. the four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the down-to-earth. the music and lyrics of the cabaret/chanson-esquire songs (sung b keira knightley herself) drag the viewer deeper and deeper in the film, from one place to another, between the brutal war and amongst the peaceful love. some people may find it too much a biopic, but it ís mostly a romantic story, even though it consequently follows the life of dylan thomas and the triangular relationship which is steeped by joy and jealousy. london gets visualized from another angle for once, the bohemian life of dylan during the bombings of the germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms, pubs and bars. the independent women, the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger. maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film, but all in all this is a great romantic story.

in this tv special jon is the one who needs a life. the highlight of his day is counting the tiles on the ceiling and rearranging his sock drawer. not content with this forever, jon takes garfield to a self help group in order to meet people. how many people will be interested in a loner 20-something who's best friend is a cat?after several failed attempts at getting a girl, including one cringeworthy dance scene that rivals david brents' fusion of flashdance and mc hammer in the office (disco's dead?, says jon), he is more than shocked to find a cute girl who is as much as a jerk as himself. naturally, they get on but garfield is worried that john will forget about him and prefer having kids to a cat. fortunately jon's new girlfriend is allergic to cats. with slicker animation than past tv specials, this feels like a longer episode of garfield and friends.

[contains spoilers!!!] garfield and his owner jon arbuckle were in a rut. they basically had no life at all. all they did was lay around and count the ceiling tiles. jon even organized his sock drawer according to color and fabric. he needed a life. so he consults a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. a singles' bar was a great place to start. unfortunately, when the music started and jon hit the dance floor, we see what made disco die: jon killed it. jon next tried to pick up girls at the video store. he ended up feeling down in the mouth. literally. the laundromat was no prize either when jon and his would-be date get a glimpse of each other's underwear. jon tried to act all buff at the beach, but soon he angered a real buff guy, which left jon feeling, once again, down in the mouth. literally. jon then tried to pick up girls walking and jogging by. no avail. jon pulled out a guitar and sings the blues. unfortunately when he mentioned his cat being fat, a fat man walked up and stomped jon's guitar. it was hopeless. fortunately for jon, an ad flashed on the tv: an ad for lorenzo's school for the personality impaired. it guaranteed a lifeless person to get a life in a few easy steps. jon and garfield attend the class. the building didn't exactly look the same way it did on tv, nor did lorenzo act as peppy as he did on tv. jon sat next to a pretty girl named mona. so while lorenzo taught his lessons of introducing yourself, checking your pulse, and pretending to speak a foreign language, jon and mona get to know one another. they leave together, forgetting all about garfield. at home, jon and mona just sat on the porch and talked. garfield was jealous of mona for fear that she would take jon away from him. garfield envisioned the future: jon and mona get married, she moves in, and soon she gives birth to a little arbuckle who is overjoyed at pulling garfield's tale. back to the present, garfield would not stand for it. he tried to get jon to get rid of mona, until she started scratching behind his ears. but then jon learned that mona was allergic to cats. so that was basically the end of their relationship. but they still saw each other every now and then, and garfield was sure to be with them. another hilarious garfield tv special! this one was made during the run of tv's garfield and friends. garfield was slimmed down somewhat. somewhat. since hie early 1980's cartoons. the scenes of jon trying to pick up chicks is funny, so is the one where the fat guy stomps on jon's guitar. good ol' lorenzo music is back as garfield. thom huge is jon. frank welker (the third man of 1,000 voices) is lorenzo. and june foray (the woman of 1,000 voices) is mona. if you like garfield, then i recommend you see garfield gets a life today! it, along with here comes garfield, and garfield on the town, were just released on dvd! so check them all out today! you are guaranteed a good time. hey, has garfield ever let you down before?-

i am a huge fan of harald zwart, and i just knew that i had to see this movie, even though i can't say i'm a soccer fan. but watching this just filled my heart with joy, and i had a great time in the movies watching it.bjørn fast nagell does a tremendous job directing this movie, and even though you notice the main characters are new at acting, they grow with the movie and makes it what it is. even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie, there is surprisingly little soccer in it. the whole idea is to show the six guys making up the word n o r w a y on their trip to the world cup in soccer playing in germany this year. if you're only gonna see one norwegian movie this year, this is the one..

this was one of the few norwegian movies i actually looked forward too see. it started of as a few commercials with a motley bunch at football matches. then they made a movie out of it. the leads are not pros (and you can see that) but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me away.norway is known for making crappy movies (no offense)but i had a good feeling about this one. even thou i'm not interested in football i wanted 2 see it. the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep piling up. there are loads of cameos from norwegian celebrities and players. the characters are well portrayed and you feel for them. if you're ever gonna see a norwegian movie. let it be this one!!!!

i hate football!! i hate football fans! i hate cars! but this film was the funniest thing i have seen in quite some time. i was given the great opportunity to see this film at the weekend, and all i have to say is i laughed till i cried, and when is it going to be available in the uk and denmark. girls, this is one football film you will need to see, its hilarious!the fact that this film started out as some crazy commercial for a telephone company is just amazing, the guys may not be well known actors, but this is good down to earth real humour, with real people, and i for one applaud them for taking this to the screen.well done!

let me just say - i love the horror genre to the extent that i see every single one that i can get my hands on regardless (except really low quality b-movie horrors which i could do without) and recently have become a big fan of eastern horrors. little did i know that a korean horror would be the one that tops my list beating off heavyweights such as the japanese ringu (or the american ring), or even quality us movies such as the sixth sense and the others, and the widely acclaimed hong kong horror 'the eye'.previously 'the ring' had stood as my favourite horror but it seems to me that i prefer the beauty of 'the tale of two sisters' any day - the story is extraordinary and rather open to interpretation thus allowing repeat viewings although chances are you'll want to watch this again and again just because the movie is so masterfully shot... the story is likely one of the best in the genre to date. the acting is top notch too from the entire cast and the scares when they come have the potential to rattle you like anything within the ring - i did find myself glued to the screen at those points unable to take my eyes off. still i am glad it didn't come back to haunt me later that sadako/samara did from the ring - after all such feelings are unpleasant and the tale of two sisters leaves you with an uneasy feeling, but one that hopefully won't leave you without sleep but leave you satisfied that you have seen something quite special. but do remember.. if you don't understand the plot after the first viewing, a repeat viewing is more than advised.. i personally didn't have time for this since it was late so i flicked through scenes on the dvd, some numerous times until i had a good synopsis in my head and after looking on the net, seemed ihad pretty much nailed it on the widely agreed interpretation. and the satisfaction from solving a puzzle like that is wonderful.all in all - a masterfully crafted horror that is unlikely to produce the same 'level' remake (its been purchased by dreamworks) simply because of the korean content and everyone is advised to catch this in the theaters or on dvds while they can... its one of the best you will get. unfortunately due to the type of movie this is, there is no way to even talk about the story without spoilers so its best to do what i did - watch it without knowing a single thing except its 'a tale of two sisters'! and be prepared for something that is unlikely to be matched for some time.

this movie certainly deserves to be placed within the genre of horror, but not for obvious reasons. the horror of "a tale of two sisters" lies not with sudden shocks or large helpings of cgi guts and gore; it is a psychological horror movie which piques the viewer's curiosity from the start and builds a suspenseful aura of mystery and questions throughout. best of all, the ending does not provide a clear answer, pushing the viewer to analyse what they have seen and make up their own mind about what really took place.do not be put off by the seemingly slow pace at which the movie begins, and don't expect to be jumping out of your seat immediately. this is not the conventional hack-and-slash movie with orchestral stings designed to make you scared of nothing in particular. "a tale of two sisters" slowly builds an atmosphere of terror, a terror of the unknown and a fear of things which evade explanation until the very end. even when the final conclusion is revealed, it is not so heavy-handed and obvious as to make the entire film fall neatly into place. the movie requires its viewer to reflect back on what they have seen and to try and square this with the frightening revelation of the final scene. some things will still be open to interpretation, and this is one of the joys of watching a film such as this.the true fear of "a tale of two sisters" lies not in shocks or conspicuous scares; it is a psychological, gut-wrenching horror that defies convention and expands a genre to proportions hitherto unexplored by the traditional horror film. it is no exaggeration to say that this film stands apart even from the so-called 'asian horror' genre. indeed, it would be a mistake to align "a tale of two sisters" with films like "ringu" and "the grudge". this movie can be understood from a variety of standpoints, some requiring no suspension of credulity, others embracing the supernatural wholeheartedly.whichever way you choose to interpret this film, it is one that demands an open-minded approach, rewarding viewers regardless of their preconceived notions on asian cinema or horror in general.

every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie. this movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be.the plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about what's going on and you really want to view it for the second time. but after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be.a word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie. this is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie, in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b**bs and lots of blood.if you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports dolby digital or dts 5.1ch, without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation. and don't forget to switch the light off.my points on different aspects:-direction = 9/10 acting = 8/10 atmosphere = 10/10 sound effect = 9/10total = 9/10

hehehe. this was one of the best funny road movies ever! i laughed so i fell out of the chair. with many norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves. harald zwart is the producer, known for films like agent cody banks and of course one night at mccool's.it is about norwegian crazy fans, going to the world cup in soccer in germany 2006. and all sort of crazy fun that comes with it. it was hilarious. i couldn't stop laughing. i haven't had so much fun in ages. rumors say it will come a number two, but i do not know. it will be hard beating this one. recommended to everyone! it is a must see film. i was suppose to see it at the cinema, but i had work at the times it where shown. and been trying to rent it for a month, but all the time rented out. got it today on dvd. well worth it.

many horror fans complain that horror has scarcely progressed in the last twenty years. i was inclined to agree with this until the influx of asian horror films, a trend which has admittedly grown dull. however, it has produced some true classics, and a tale of two sisters, for me at least, stands out as an exceptional piece of cinema, and perhaps the best horror film in a very long time.based vaguely on a korean folktale, it tells the sad story of two mentally-troubled sisters residing with their father and stepmother. after experiencing a few problems on their first night back at home, they determine to stick together and deny their stepmother access to their close relationship. the tension rises and there is the inevitable snap. but what happens after this requires more than a pair of eyes, as the story takes several twists, and the scares become more emotional and quite real. by the end, you may need a few moments to absorb it all and piece it together in your own mind, but it is exactly this pairing of horror and mystery that pushes it beyond the definitions of these genres and makes it an instant classic. one to watch again and again, if only to work it all out.

this isn't so much a review of a tale of two sisters as it is a discussion of some of the smaller plot details, so i advise you not to read this review if you haven't seen the film, because doing so will absolutely ruin a few surprises for you.in a way a tale of two sisters is far from original, at least from a purely superficial aspect - some of its iconography is taken straight from ring or dark water, while the storyline itself (especially what brendt sponseller calls the "rubber reality" aspect of the narrative) is reminiscent of films like fight club (lead character interacts with someone created in their mind), mulholland drive (character creates alternate reality in a psychogenic fugue), as well as other minor aspects of lost highway, jacob's ladder, and basically every film under the sun dealing with mental illness, plus amenabar's films (the others, abre los ojos), memento (particularly with regards to the torturous nature of memory), et al. thankfully all these similarities do not detract from the film's overall emotional impact, and i personally found a tale of two sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experience.many people have commented on the "confusing" nature of the narrative, but i personally found the storyline to be fairly self-explanatory, even if it is in part portrayed in a non-sequential manner. the narrative only becomes confusing for some because, midway through the final third, the story switches from a purely subjective setting (ie. soo-mi's warped perception of reality) to an objective one, with a flashback at the end explaining the origins of soo-mi's nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness. the shift in emphasis is bound to throw some people off guard, but structurally i found it somewhat reminiscent of aforementioned mulholland drive (even though we're not dealing with a character's perception of reality via a dream but instead their own schizophrenic tendencies - something which, in turn, reminded me of another lynch movie, lost highway). to be honest, i don't really regard a tale of two sisters as a horror movie as such, but rather a tragic story of a family's breakdown as well as an honest look at a character's mental illness (and i hasten to add that fans of psychoanalytical cinema are going to love this film).that aside, the cinematography in a tale of two sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films i've seen this side of wong kar wai's 2046. the performances are also fantastic without exception, and i expect to see more of the four lead actors in the future; not to mention the music, but then east asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be few and far between these days.it's very likely that some people will look past the finer artistic points of a tale of two sisters and simply dismiss it as "yet another asian horror film", oblivious to its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytical approach. but then each to their own. if you can ignore some of the film's platitudinous aspects and simply take it for what it is at heart, ie. an extremely tragic, heart-breaking story, then i see no reason not to recommend it.

i've been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early 80's. i say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft-core fluff, a genre i'm not particularly interested in. the dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical (making sense, no doubt, only to it's franco-italian producers)and the plot completely extraneous. what it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood. the scenery (the beautiful philippines), soft-focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today. it is truly one of my great "guilty pleasures". i was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than i think is healthy. a worthwhile moodpiece.

despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by franco micalizzi, this film doesn't quite reach the level of joe d'amato's similar efforts while staying just about as trashy. the author of the original book "emmanuelle: the joys of a woman", emmanuelle arsan, directed and had a smallish role in this film, which mostly pornographically showcases a very young annie belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations. her boyfriend, played by zombie's al cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married! orso maria guerrini drops by as a professor who is oh so usually married simultaneously to two women, one of whom is played by arsan herself. despite beginning promisingly and having a few hilarious lines of dialog like "can you see me with the naked eye?" ... "i can see you better naked!", the film shambles along plotlessly up until the less-than-spectacular finale. much like d'amato's emanuelle and the last cannibals, the main characters are all in search of some lost tribe, but don't get your hopes up, there's no violence at all in this film, and not much sex either for that matter. just a lot of nudity and silly dialog. i couldn't help but find some appreciation for this little film, if only for the completely cornball logic the film goes by.

gorgeous annie belle in her prime stars in this adventure/sex movie. she wears her hair in a buzz cut that is bleached platinum. she and her boyfriend are visiting some tropical asian paradise. they have decided to keep an "open" sexual relationship, which is played out on their journey to find a secret society/tribe where the people live one year and then are reborn in some kind of ceremony. the scenery is gorgeous, deep vast green gorges and jungles are explored. the imagery is very similar to that of the movie "black emanuelle". it is rich and colorful. recommended!

i finally saw laure and i have to say that i equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it. what's great about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. the story is non-existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter. the pace in languid and the settings are exotic. the film has a lot going for it. unfortunately, it also has a few things going against it. the first thing is that the gorgeous annie belle and the handsome al cliver have no chemistry whatsoever. because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability. according to imdb, al and annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie. they sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen.the other problem with laure is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous. there's one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest i've ever seen in any soft porn flick: our young blonde couple are picked-up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross-dresser! the pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend (!) and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter, in mid-air. and al cliver is filming all of this with his 16mm camera! i kid you not. ridiculous. we later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola. while the footage rolls, al and annie start making out. this scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much. watching the footage of the cross-dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud. is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way? the last thing i want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag, certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman, while piloting a helicopter, no less. al and annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene. i just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn't so silly.speaking of drag, another dull plot point in laure which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great orso maria guerrini and his two wives. a married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting. the two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex. in fact, orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film, even when he's with annie belle. this is another minor complaint about laure: there's nudity but it's not as much as other films of the same era. it just needed more skin to punch it up.except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments, laure is actually very watchable. i love these kind of softcore films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere, not the crude stuff we see today.p.s.: make sure to watch emanuelle in egypt, which stars annie & al but also another famous screen couple, laura gemser and gabriele tinti. the music in that movie is also great.

distributor: goodtimes home video plot: a pretty high school student is marked for unrelenting terror in this suspense filled made for tv movie. gail osborne is new in town. she makes friends, has a boyfriend and everything seems to be going her way. that is until she gets an ominous and frightening phone call while babysitting. after more and more phone calls, she is raped. throughout most of the movie, she tries to find proof that the person did rape her.audio/video: this 1987 vhs edition from goodtimes stinks. there are constant lines at the bottom and top of the screen.extras: no extras from goodtimes home video.final thoughts: this suspense filled made for tv movie was made in 1978, so don't expect many deaths (there are none). if you can find this movie with the worldvision home video logo on the front, then buy it. but the goodtimes version is pretty crappy. this can be a little boring, but if you are patient, the ending is pretty good.

there is a lot to like in this film, despite its humble trappings of a preachy pc tale about rape and the perp always faring better than the victim. the movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes. (i, for one, was sure it was the teacher. in fact, that would have been more probable plot-wise because the idea of the best-friend's boy-friend kind of came out of nowhere. i guess the point of that is that "rape is omnipresent. you never know who it is going to be".) ms. beller is luminous as always (yet see kb discussion board for my qualification of this statement). like all preachy films the plot lasts 15 minutes past the climax so you might want to quit watching at that point. unless you are really curious to find out what happens to phillip. blythe danner, as the mom, is in the role she was born to play: the fretting, over-protective mom. some good 70s scenes for 70s fans. (the dark bar that the father goes to in order to drink away his pain is all dark-stained beams, barrels, oak and cork). a must for beller fans and highly recommended for fans of 70s high school melodrama or 70s kitsch in general.

"are you in the house alone?" belongs to the pre-cable tv days when the networks were eager to offer an alternative to popular tv shows. it is well-made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations. kathleen beller plays a high school student who gets a series of threatening letters. everyone seems to think that it is nothing more than a prank but beller is really scared. tony bill and blythe danner play beller's parents, ellen travolta (john's sister) is the high school principal and dennis quaid has one of his earliest roles as a cocky rich kid. it's a competent chiller with a still relevant social message. beller is lovely - if you are 30 or older, you will remember that she was very popular among youngsters. blythe danner, who i usually don't like, gives a truly moving performance. nice little film.

when one watches the animated superman shorts of the 1940s, the similarity of the plots can become a bit boring - the adversary is most often a mad scientist in a hidden headquarter, threatening metropolis with some evil invention - death rays, mechanical monsters, electric earthquake, magnetic telescope, what have you.this one is refreshingly different. the bad ones drive around in a car, shooting and bombing, but the center of action is the gold train (on which lois lane travels, as the only press reporter, it seems). train movies have their own typical ingredients, from the 1903 great train robbery on, and quite some are featured here: decoupling cars in motion, running on the roofs, taking the steam locomotive from the tender in the back, fighting with the engineer, a switch turned to deroute the train on a side track, the fall (of people or the whole train) from a high bridge... it's all in the few minutes of this lovely piece.but it wouldn't be a superman film if he didn't do some incredible feats (involving balancing and high-precision placement) to ultimately win the day. if you're a fan of train movies, don't miss this. it's in the public domain and can be legally downloaded from archive.org.

while all of the fleischer/famous studios "superman" cartoons are excellent, "billion dollar limited," the third in the series, is probably the best of the lot in terms of overall animation, plot, and pacing. why it wasn't even nominated for an oscar as best animated short for 1942 (incredibly enough, only the first one was) in inexplicable.here, lois lane is assigned to cover the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the u.s. mint. masked gangsters in their super-powered (for 1942) car take off after the train, determined to get that gold. without giving too much away, what ensues is a thrill ride for both the characters and the audience, with truth, justice, and superman triumphant at the end.as they did in all the fleischer/famous superman cartoons, clayton "bud" collyer and joan alexander, who played clark kent/superman and lois lane on radio, have the voice work honors here, and fleischer perennial jack mercer gets a little to do as one of the bad guys, as well.

i was swept into this series just as surely as the sea would sweep me into its grip. although it started out slowly, i found that the realism in depicting the ship, the variety of characters and lively dialogue keep me watching. the protagonist was destined to be challenged, grow and change on this voyage and i wanted to be there for it. i was not disappointed. the series took you from humor to tragedy and everything in-between, often in the same scene, the same breath. there was a wealth of emotional overlaying, interaction and expression--relentless and compelling to observe. the movement of the ship added an almost fanciful component to the many scenes, making the characters ill one moment and adding humor the next.edmund talbot is a complex character, the likes of which we don't see often. we may know where the captain stands or mr. prettiman, but they are older men, set in their ways. talbot was young and arrogant, still learning, testing himself and being tested. he struggled getting along with others and made mistakes like a real person would but had a heart that could be touched, that grew with each hard-taught experience. i appreciate the excellent characterization; it's too rare in movies and television.

meticulously constructed and perfectly played, to the ends of the earth is a simply astonishing voyage out of our reality and into another age.based on william golding's trilogy, these three 90-minute films chronicle the journey towards both australia and experience of youthful aristocrat edmund talbot (benedict cumberbatch) aboard an aging man o' war in the early 19th century as he heads for a government position down under.among the crew and hopeful emigrants sharing his passage are a tempestuous, bullying captain (jared harris), a politically radical philosopher (sam neill), a canny 1st lieutenant who's worked his way up from the bottom (jamie sives) and, fleetingly, the first brush of love in the form of a beautiful young woman (joanne page) whose ship literally passes in the night.quite aside from the astonishing degree of physical historic accuracy, director david attwood and screenwriters tony basgallop and leigh jackson have a canny eye and ear for the manners and stiff etiquette of an earlier time, crafting a totally convincing microcosm of the napoleonic era.shipboard life is one brutal, monotonous round of seasickness, squalor and danger after another and as edmund becomes entangled in the loves, hopes and miseries of his fellow passengers he experiences a delirious whirl of life's hardships, man's inhumanities and his noblest sentiments.those who enjoyed master and commander: the far side of the world or patrick o'brian's series of novels on which it was based will love this  for everyone else, it's a whole new world to discover.

i saw the second part of this beautiful period piece set on a ship sometime in the 19th century. golding's book must be responsible for some of the superb dialogue but everything else was good too! i especially liked the way they created the period and feeling of being on the ship so well. for me this had a feeling of completeness about it which i know i won't be able to convey in words... perhaps it was the way they mixed in technical and historical details about sailing in the eighteen hundreds to the story without messing it up. benedict cumberbatch was excellent, as was the rest of the cast. it's not often a mini-series sends me to the "zone", but this one did.

the three-part series ended last night on pbs, which i believe was its first wide exposure to an american audience. the richness of its text and the unique quality of its filming are high points. it seems very novel to view and hear an action play employing the vernacular of georgian england, jane austen's filmed drawing rooms being the primary example of that form of speech. yet it is the scope of drama overwhelming the senses that makes quaint language fit perfectly into each and every scene. such bold exposure to an old reality is evocative of literary giants like tolstoy or shakespeare while at the same time entertaining in the manner of a c. s. forester or patrick o'brian sea saga. the universality of basic human condition lies at its center.narrator talbot as played by an actor with the almost perfectly appropriate name of benedict cumberbatch (surely not even dickens could beat that one!) alternates between stodgy jingoism and extreme vulnerability, an acting tour de force. indeed, i cannot recall among this very fine cast any misstep of interpretation. that is a tribute not only to the actors themselves, but to the director as well.the most impressive element, however, is how perfectly life aboard a man-of-war en route to australia in the early 1800's is presented. that is especially true of how the motion of the ship becomes almost a character itself, something sea stories rarely take into account except as backdrop. anyone who has ever experienced mal de mer in person will recognize it instantly, and appreciate all the more how difficult it must have been to recreate within the context of filming.this is no fanciful pirates of the caribbean. some effort must be expended in attaining an understanding of its nuances.

this is the best 3-d experience disney has at their themeparks. this is certainly better than their original 1960's acid-trip film that was in it's place, is leagues better than "honey i shrunk the audience" (and far more fun), barely squeaks by the muppetvision 3-d movie at disney-mgm and can even beat the original 3-d "movie experience" captain eo. this film relives some of disney's greatest musical hits from aladdin, the little mermaid, and others, and brought a smile to my face throughout the entire show. this is a totally kid-friendly movie too, unlike "honey..." and has more effects than the spectacular "muppetvision"

it's not a movie, but an experience!not the usual eye candy i thought it would be. too many things are happening at once, your senses almost couldn't handle it. a product of cutting-edge technology (we were torn between just sitting back to enjoy the show and putting our 3d glasses on and off to decipher the magic), the music is great (it's a concert!), the disney characters are in it (and you get to be part of their world), it's funny, it's magical, it's exciting--i know this is beginning to sound like an advertisement--but it really is that awesome! beats christmas in bringing out the kid in you!this attraction alone already makes going to disney all worth it. ;)

i'm not a disney fan at all, but i happen to be in orlando for a friend's wedding. so my traveling partner and i went to disney for a few days. i haven't seen a good 3-d effect in, well..ever. so i usually try to stay away from these presentations. the 3-d effect in this was so good. i'm a grown man of 38, and even i wanted to try and reach out and touch. it's that good! word of advice. at the end, look to the back of the theater on the wall. put it like this...the first time i saw it, the effect wasn't working. so i told my friend..."it would have been nice if...." my friend said, "that's exactly what happens. it's not working for some reason." it's an awesome show. you will not be disappointed!!!

i recently visited the magic kingdom as an adult with my mom, her best friend and my adult sister. disney world is often mistakenly perceived as a place for just children, but when you see quality shows like mickey's philharmagic, you realize that the magic of disney is for everyone! it was such a great show that we left the theater and turned around and got in line again. and then a third time. it was absolutely breathtaking. i would encourage anyone who goes to disney world to check out this show, which is not just a show but a world wind, fun filled ride with donald as he once again lets his temper get him in trouble!

okay, i love this movie!!!!! i watched it over and over again. it is so hard to tell who the attacker is. you keep thinking it's one person, then another, then back to the first person, then another person. it is so suspense full you want to fast forward your tv to the end to see who it is.summary: gail osborne is raped and left at her home. she is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped. it goes from her meeting her steady boyfriend, to her teacher who takes a liking to her, to her ex-boyfriend, all different stories, all suspects. but who did it?i love the acting, they have a lot of great talent in here. the suspense is wonderful and the settings are superb. if it comes on tv watch it. *** 1/2 stars 10/10

this program was on for a brief period when i was a kid, i remember watching it whilst eating fish and chips.riding on the back of the tron hype this series was much in the style of streethawk, manimal and the like, except more computery. there was a geeky kid who's computer somehow created this guy - automan. he'd go around solving crimes and the lot.all i really remember was his fancy car and the little flashy cursor thing that used to draw the car and help him out generally.when i mention it to anyone they can remember very little too. was it real or maybe a dream?

this movie is an evolutionary piece - from terminator to robocop .stan winston did the spfx !in this film, a scientist working in a sinister robotics company with a really creepy boss(they always are) gets is killed by them in a horrible lab explosion and has his brain placed inside an indestructible robot body .the rest of this movie goes on with a romance angle as this cyborg/man regains consciousness and wreaks havoc while trying to communicate with his wife, played by the gorgeous(back then in 1986) terri austin . (he tries to reconnect with his old life, like in that scene in robocop)the rest of this movie is about breaking things, while trying to defeat the evil his evil boss from recapturing him for some ill-defined 'turn humans into cyborgs' project .this film pays homage to previous movies like the day the earth stood still - - as the cyborg breaks free like the giant robot gort does .except for the 'frankenstein suite' designed by stan winston, this movie's production values are typically canadian: sleazy ! ! pam grier stars in this film as an hired killer-commando, a cheap role of the likes she was doing so much of during the 80's .as for a sci-fi horror b movie, out of 4 stars, this film ranks about a <3

the combination of amazing special effects and oscar worthy acting makes the vindicator one of the most important sci-fi films of recent years. for some reason still unknown to me this gem was found in a bargain bin, why some worthless human thought it right to dirty a modern classic by relagating to a bargain bin is beyond me. i have never been so terrified by a man in tin foil and random bursts of fire. forget terminator, robocop, aliens, and other films that blaintly ripped off this masterpiece, the vindicator is an unstoppable force.

ascending to power in 1933, hitler and his "national socialist german workers party", which of course we all know as the nazis, tightened their grip on the country more and more as the time went by. early in their rough-shod trampling of the german people, they called any and all artists, newspaper men and film makers into their nazi hq in order that the may be informed of just what the newly declared "third reich" (aka 'empire') expected of them.when the master director from the german cinema's silent impressionist and expressionist era, mr. fritz lang, was called in to meet with herr goebels; he listened attentively and said nothing. immediately after leaving the minister of propaganda's office, herr lang went directly to the train station and took a passenger directly to paris. not even going back to his residence, fritz lang did not return to germany (at least not until many years later. he remained in france; eventually immigrating to the united states of america.* mr. lang went right to work in america; creating a variety of most enjoyable, solid and substantially literate upper echelon movies for many a year. included in this smörgåsbord of titles is today's lucky subject, western union (20th century-fox, 1941).typically a film about the old west and pioneer days needed both quality as well as quantity of cast. western union qualified on both requisites. we are treated to a fine array of starring talent as well as a supporting cast which makes just about every minute and each scene a delight to our senses.heading up the playbill are robert young, randolph scott, dean jagger and virginia gilmore. others prominently displayed are folks like john carradine (playing not a vampire or other scary guy, but a physician), george "slim" summerville (veteran character actor, silent film veteran and graduate of mack sennett's keystone comedies), chill wills (always dependable supporting player and former singer in "the avalon boys") and burly bad guy barton maclane. added to this mix, we have names like russell hicks, victor killian, minor watson, george chandler, addison richards, irving bacon, james flavin, francis ford, frank mcgrath and kermit maynard (ken maynard's bro).prominent in those american indians featured are: chief big tree, chief thundercloud and mr. jay silverheels. also featured is that one great representative of the aboriginal peoples of north america is that great, singularly impressive and memorable example of the red man, the louisiana native, iron eyes cody (born espera decorti of sicilian immigrant parents).the filming of the fine outdoor scenes was done on location in arizona and utah and rendered in the highest grade of technigolour available. (there is no monument valley; but then, that's the province of mr. john ford.) in some respects this film is a far more amazing accomplishment than we might think; for it took a sort of pulp magazine story, adapted it to the tastes and idioms of the pre-war america of the late thirties and early forties. all of this being done by a german born director who was only had been in hollywood and america for the shortest length of time.in its final analysis, western union, while it may not be the most historically accurate example of the western genre; we just don't care. it scores in all of the necessary categories needed for a great night at the movies! so, who really cares about little details such as "accuracy"? we give mr. lang and 20th century-fox a rating of ****!note: * we just saw a special on pbs station wttw, here in chicago that was all about all of the film actors, directors and other artisans whom the nazi rise to power caused to take refuge in america and hollywood. (it seems that movie folks and scientists were the biggest export for germany at this particular time; being that the scientists who built the atomic bomb, as well as the future nasa people, came from europe at this time.) poodle schnitz!!

doe-eyed high school student kathleen beller is found beaten andraped in the opening scenes of this made for tv movie. the filmthen flashbacks to the few days before the rape, as beller isharassed by a stranger.beller and scott colomby and her best friend robin mattson anddennis quaid are double dating early on. beller's anxious parents,laid back tony bill and shrill blythe danner, wait at home wringinghands and so on. right away, the 1970's makes its datedentrance, as the young couples discuss the romance and love in"three days of the condor."beller, an amateur photographer, begins getting threatening notesstuffed in her locker at school. the film makers wisely give us awhole slew of suspects: beller's new boyfriend, mattson'sboyfriend, beller's dad, beller's ex-boyfriend, and what about thatoverly friendly photography class teacher who wants beller to be alittle more sexy in her self-portraits? i knew who the rapist wasbecause the worldvision video company video box has a picture ofthe attack on the back cover, destroying any suspense in thatregard.without giving away who the attacker is, beller begins gettingharassing phone calls, and is eventually raped. the movie thenheads south as she makes like nancy drew and secretly sets upa time lapse camera to catch the guy stalking another student.finally, the film makers tack on a hokey ending narration frombeller about the lack of understanding for the victims of rape in thatday and age.the suspense here is very real, without going over the top intoscary movie stuff. beller is very good, and watch for her andmattson's scene in an abandoned theater- both do great jobs. thefilm is full of familiar faces, including ellen travolta in a small role,and everyone is professional.this was made in 1978, and it shows. i am sure no one had anyidea that this would be reviewed in 2001 by an overcritical horrormovie lover who needs to get to bed and be up early in themorning, but some of the attitudes here are embarassing. theteacher who tells beller to be sexy is never made to explain whatexactly he had in mind. nowadays, if any high school teacher saidthat, then that would have been a made for tv movie on its own.after beller is raped, the rapist is still a part of her life, as warrantsare issued, blah, blah, blah. there may not be a case becausebeller is not a virgin, and cannot prove she was raped by whomshe said. many of these problems have been addressed withmodern technology and policing efforts, but this film obviouslyknew it would have a chance to add to the reform debate. rape isan act of violence that has not gone away, but efforts today to catchthe attackers are miles ahead of twenty four years ago. theproblem is the anti-rape angle feels tacked on, like anafterthought. before that, we have a tight little suspenser that hasreal honest to god characterization. after the rape, everythingchanges, filmwise, and not for the better.i remember beller from the '70's and '80's (and who could forgether revealing role in "the betsy"), but she has not done anything inalmost ten years. this is a shame, since she was very good wayback then.i will recommend "are you in the house alone?!" based on theacting alone, with a reluctant nod to at least the first two-thirds ofthe film. if you want to relive 1970's made for tv high school life,this is your cup of tab.this is unrated but contains physical violence, some sexualviolence, and some adult situations.

this western was set in 1861 and had to do with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines that were laid by western union. while nice guy dean jagger (sporting lots of hair) did his best to get this done, there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons. so, it's up to either randolph scott or robert young to save the day.this is certainly one of the better 1940s westerns i have seen and it nearly garnered an 8--it was that good. however, for the life of me, i have no idea why fritz lang was assigned to direct this film--after all, he knew nothing about westerns. his forte was drama--and i guess this movie is a drama of sorts--just set in the old west. strange, yes, but it seemed to work out okay, though i wonder how this great german director felt about being given this job.as for the rest of the film, it's exceptional--with vivid color, great location shooting and very good acting. as usual, randolph scott put in another relaxed and realistic performance. i was surprised, though, with robert young being also cast in the film, but it was a good casting decision--he was supposed to be a harvard-educated easterner. when i saw barton maclane was also in the film, i pretty much assumed he'd be the "baddie" and my thoughts were well founded, since he made a career out of playing jerks! as for the script, it seemed pretty ordinary for the most part, but the final showdown between scott and barton maclane was a lot better than i'd hoped--making this movie ending on a very high note.

western union tells in melodramatic fashion the stringing of telegraph lines between two points out west. siblings dean jagger and virginia gilmore work for western union, and randolph scott and robert young work for the creightons. indians and some bad white guys get in the way, but nothing can stop america's progress. this sense of manifest destiny is greatly enhanced by a first-rate musical score and vibrant color photography. scott is a bank robber looking to mend his ways, and both he and engineer young vie for the attention of the perky gilmore. lots of great character actors help keep the large production moving forward.

this is a sort of hidden gem. it has little to no promotion, no fanfare, no classic status, and it deserves all of the above! one of the great directors of cinema, fritz lang, has created a real gem in this excellent western. a fine cast led by randolph scott (in probably one of his greatest performances), the always sturdy dean jagger, robert young as a surprisingly accomplished dude plus many veteran character actors: chill wills, slim summerville, john carradine, barton maclane and others in an exciting zane grey story of the laying of the western union cable across country. it has tense drama, sprinklings of humor and great effects. it's reminiscent of demille in ways and yet fritz lang leaves his own stamp on it. at very least this is a damned good western!

here's another of the 1940's westerns that i watch whenever it comes on tcm or fmc, because although it may be flawed historically, it is extremely entertaining and well acted, plus it's got randolph scott, my favorite actor second only to gary cooper-well, ok, fourth behind coop, charlton heston, and gregory peck. but the film itself, to me anyway, is reasonably historically accurate and as i said before, well acted and "flows" very well-i bet i've seen it 50 or 60 times, and enjoy each viewing more than the one before. i have it on tape from tcm but would buy it in a minute if it ever came out on dvd. see it if you haven't- i guarantee you'll like it!

lang does hawks as well as hawks does in the first part of this extraordinary western, before settling down into typical deterministic, dark and guilt-haunted lang for the finale.this is one of those films that shows its greatness almost instantly but at the same time very subtly. vance shaw (randolph scott) is on horseback and being pursued, we know not why -- he stumbles on wounded edward creighton (dean jagger) and decides to take his gun and horse, but discovering that creighton is in a bad way, decides to fix him up first. this is conveyed mostly through facial expressions and very brief, clipped dialog - in 2 minutes we know that shaw is an outlaw, but basically a good guy. shaw ends up helping creighton on his way to civilization, then disappears.cut to a few weeks or months later, with creighton on the mend and in charge of an expedition to lay telegraph wire going west from omaha. he hires shaw as a scout, who tries to leave when he finds out that creighton is in charge; but creighton wants him anyway, repaying a debt and sensing something quality. also hired is a tenderfoot, son of a benefactor of the project, but atypically the easterner richard blake (robert young) is quite competent as he shows right away in an amusing but exciting bronco-busting sequence. both of the hires vie for creighton's sister sue (virginia gilmore) who - again not typically - seems quite as able to take care of herself as any man. the camaraderie between the three men, the comedic elements involving an unwilling cook and various rough and tumble types, and the wonderfully played light romantic elements dominate the first third of the film and reminded me more of howard hawks' "red river" or "only angels have wings" than most lang - but they are so well played and the action progresses so naturally that it doesn't matter, and doesn't alter our pleasure - if it does perhaps change our expectations - as the more usual langian themes of the haunted past, dark secrets and the immense pull of the easier, destructive and evil ways come to dominate the later part of the film. shaw's old pals come back to haunt him as the the wagon train and its wires move westward; attacks mount on the crew, and shaw has to wrestle with what, if anything, he is to tell creighton about his tortured relationship with jack slade (barton maclane), leader of the outlaws.beautifully shot in early technicolor and moving fairly seamlessly from sound stages to western locations, this is for my money easily lang's best western and one of his very best films, conveying as potently as any of his films the tragic inability of men to escape their pasts and build a new future. scott is as good as i've seen him, showing more with a flick of an eye than a lot of actors can do in a paragraph of dialog, and the rest of the cast is uniformly fine. the inevitable showdown between shaw's past criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary, and a surprise even for a longtime lang devotee such as myself; and even in 1941 it seems there was no place more fraught with meaning on the margins of civilization than the barbershop and the dusty street outside. you can get a shave, you can feel like a new man, but you can't really ever be one as long as the old ties are still holding you back.genius.

an enjoyable movie, without a doubt, and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boy's 'rites of passage'. but i have to say that having read the very positive comments here, i was a bit disappointed. the period was captured, but the plot was desperately thin. the whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays. the idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns, but a philanderer, is risible. and without that, nada. the sub-plots bore no relation that i could see to the main plot - all of them could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story - which surely suggests a fundamental flaw. when all your sub-plots look like padding, you know a central idea is being stretched beyond its limits. nevertheless, it's a benign movie with its heart in the right place, there are some fine performances, and you just get the feeling that everyone involved felt deflated at the final 'cut!' that good feeling permeates the film. and that has to count for something. a flawed really quite good movie. 7 out of 10.

i was at school in the late sixties and early seventies and this film is very much how my school was. the school play where the leading actors kiss, that happened at my school. a crazy gang of lads, my school again only when we went on a cross country run we would have a smoke! 'getting the whack', some one at my school broke in through a sky light and broke the canes! after that they were kept in a safe!!! and as for certain nocternal activities! what can i say.... the film actually came out in 1982, i remember that as it was when i bought my house and the film was showing at the same time. if you like british films and films about school, growing up and period pieces, then this is for you. another film very much like it, 'swalk', came out a few years before and i for one would like to see that again, also 'kes' is in the genre. highly recommended. (but trust me, 1982 is when it came out)

although i don't like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago, i still think it is one of the best coming-of-age movies ..i remember the day i returned home from my school and sat down to have my lunch, i saw the opening titles of that movie and then....i was so immersed in it that i felt i was there, it really affected me personally. i still remember how i felt when i first saw it ,i felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine, going through the same adolescent experience we were having in those days. what i really liked about that movie is the main theme of a "shy" boy fantasizing about "kissing" his dream girl, no offense but if that was an american movie, you would certainly see-at a certain point, mainly climax- the "shy" boy "making love" to his girl, and i really can't grasp this contradicting concepts till now...i have a simple request ,if anyone knows how to get this movie on a dvd by mail ,please let me know cause i need a shot of memories..thanks

why didn't critics like this movie?? i don't get it. this is easily my favorite clive barker effort. "hellraiser" is a bit too rough around the edges (the film just never leaves that stupid house) and, lets face it, "lord of illusions" doesn't move at all!!! i have loved barker's writing for years, especially his "books of blood". terrifically entertaining. he has a vicious side to him that is totally unlike a stephen king. he freely mixes in his own homosexuality and odd religious and occultic elements. i love love love love it. i also realize , however, that barker is as much a dark fantasy writer as he is a horror writer. and fantasy just isn't my bag. puts me right to sleep. always has. i also think barker works best with short stories. his novels tend to wander a bit. that was my experience when trying to read "the damnation game". it started out well. then 100 pages in i thought "where is this going?" because it wasn't going anywhere.i read "cabal" (the book nightbreed was based on) and thought it was good. i especially like the elaboration on decker's character. the way the mask talked to him and controlled him. i like the way barker simply presents it. black and white. there it is. he gives it a simplicity that's attractive and believable. when asked why decker kills he says (simply) "because i like it". probably something jeffrey dahmer said at some point.but i actually liked the film nightbreed better than cabal. i adore the visual attention to detail that barker gives to his films. adore it. i think it is just beautiful. lord of illusions had some of this as well. some of the drawings in the beginning, during the nightbreed credit sequence. it's like an entire vocabulary barker dreamed up just for the nightbreed world. i'd be curious to know how much was purely his design. i know he is an amazing artist who his own style and language as an artist.nightbreed is also (i think) barker's most entertaining film. it moves very quickly. well edited. it doesn't drag like lord of illusions does a little bit. very quick. everything in it is just perfect. it also works as a fantastic and scary little slasher movie. the stuff with the killer in the beginning killing the family and later tormenting the old man in the shop is really scary stuff. that mask is frightening. i'd be curious to know if barker designed that as well. it's not just a hokey jason or "scream"-type mask. something about it is really disturbing.anyway, this is a great flick. definitely check it out if you haven't seen it. highly recommended. one of my favorite horror films of all time. in my opinion clive barker's best. it is scary and violent though, be warned

if you're looking for an original horror flick, this might be the one for you. it's strange and at times lingers on stupidity, but it's just such a good looking, nice sounding and original movie, it never fails, except maybe during the over long climax. "nightbreed" is a must see for horror fans, or for fans of monster movie make-up.boone (craig sheffer) has been having dreams of a town called midian full of mutant creatures. in therapy, his psychiatrist dr. decker (horror director david cronenberg) has come to the conclusion that boone is a murderer, and gives him hallucinogenic pills, and tells him to turn himself in. after almost getting killed, boone ends up at the hospital, where he runs into a mental patient who also knows about midian, and tells boone where to go. midian, located in a graveyard, is inhabited by vile mutant creatures that don't let boone in. after escaping with only a nasty bite, boone is shot dead by the police, who were lead to his location by dr. decker. but boone isn't dead. the bite causes him to live, and he goes off to midian. meanwhile, boone's girlfriend lori (anne bobby) tries to find boone and get to the bottom of this. when dr. decker also finds out about this place, chaos ensues.the plot seems long and complicated, but it really isn't hard to understand. the plot, among other things, makes this movie really interesting. the make-up effects are astounding. the creatures look unique and amazing, and make this a very appealing film. to add to more senses appeal, we have a musical score by danny elfman, that is both lush and bouncy, and fits the film like a glove. the shots in the movie are also set up beautifully. the cinematography is lovely, and the movie sets up an atmosphere that is never broken. even the acting is good, with the biggest surprise being director david cronenberg giving a great, menacing performance as the man, who for one reason or another, wants to see boone dead. it's odd for a horror film to be this well done.the problems with the movie...well there are a few, but the positives outweigh the negatives. the script features the occasional lame jokes to try and add some humor, but almost every one falls flat. the mutant creatures look great and for the most part are well acted, but sometimes it feels like they are just posing their awesome makeup for the camera. the worst part of the film would have to be the climax. it takes so long, and is just constant chaos. it's the portion of the film that moves from individual characters and nice tight knit shots, to fiery explosions from each direction and violence happening to characters we don't know or care about.overall, this movie is amazing to look at. it's a well done horror film, but even with that said, it has the occasional failure in character's lines, and a messy climax. nonetheless, this is one to check out.my rating: *** out of ****. 101 mins. r for strong violence and language.

adapting his own novel "cabal" for the screen, author / screenwriter / director clive barker fashioned this marvelous story of outré horror and fantasy. craig sheffer plays boone, a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer. the cops gun him down in front of midian, on the surface a cemetery but which is actually a haven for monsters that have been shunned by society. when they lay claim to boone and make him one of their own, this causes repercussions for everybody, including boone's sweet girlfriend (the very cute anne bobby) and dubious psychiatrist (a most enjoyable david cronenberg)."nightbreed" displays the kind of wild and twisted imagination that i don't see in movies all that often. for one thing, ralph mcquarrie, an old hand at conceptual art having worked on such films as the initial three "star wars" entries, helps barker to create excellent visuals for "nightbreed", starting right away with the opening credit sequence. the visual and makeup effects are elaborate, and production design and cinematography quite impressive. barker and crew do a wonderful job at creating this whole other world with compelling characters. it's colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take in. and of course there's the strong sense of social commentary regarding intolerance and bigotry, not to mention the heavy consequences that can result from a person's actions.great supporting performances add to the fun. cronenberg oozes lots of malevolent intent and is a real gas as the bad doctor, while charles haid is a fine love-to-hate-him type of antagonist, a rather nasty police captain. doug "pinhead" bradley once again gets buried under heavy makeup as the weary lylesberg, and is solid as a rock. hugh ross is great fun as narcisse, as is catherine chevalier as rachel (as an added bonus, she bares her breasts in one sequence). simon bamford, who played the "butterball cenobite" in the first two "hellraiser" pictures, turns up here as well. there's even a cool cameo by 50's and 60's sci-fi star john agar.danny elfman supplies another of his fantastic scores, and barker leads us steadily through the intriguing story towards a terrific apocalyptic showdown."nightbreed" is an excellent genre film worth checking out for anybody who hasn't seen it. i give it a hearty recommendation.9/10

nightbreed is definitely my most favorite movie, i've worn more than one tape as it is. the make-up is awesome, the story is lovely. it takes a few different twists and isn't quite as deep as the story it's based on (cabal, by clive barker) but for a movie adaption it stays very true to source material. the only problem with this movie were the producer's vain attempts to turn it into a teen slasher movie, hence the changed ending to allow for sequels *eye rolls*. apparently someday we're going to be getting a director's cut that will (i hope) clear up this bit of nonsense. until then, i'd suggest it to anyone who like dark fantasy type horror as opposed to freddy/jason/micheal type slashers. i really don't know what would be comparable...

don't ask me why i love this movie so much...maybe it came at a time in my life i desperately wanted to fit in, maybe it is the amazing monster effects, maybe because i enjoyed the novel "cabal", but it's probably because i love clive barker. i think it's fair to warn you the movie and the novel have no true resolve and like me you'll probably have a wtf moment at the end. at least two sequels were planned but never came about due to the fact the movie flopped for a few reasons. the studio made drastic cuts to the film cutting a good 30 or so minutes out of it and they did a horrible job promoting it. the adverts made it look like just another cheap slasher showing mainly the "button face/mask" decker character. this is a movie about the monsters! about fantasy! about a place called midian! it's a story where the monsters are the good guys. there is truly nothing else out there like it! it's not a movie for everybody i suppose but it stands as one of clive's many great works. sit back and be prepared to be taken to midian - where the monsters are.

nightbreed is not only great, it is also unique, even taking into account other barker's movies, which never lack originality. an amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book. for the horror genre, it has quite a few of subtle symbolics and references. certainly a lot of fun to have, a a bit to think about, if one cares to. and, not to forget, a nice music score. well, the special effects, as usual, get old faster than anything, but that is probably the only drawback. i've just seen it again after ten years, and i still find it something to recommend.

postwar england, the dawn of the "atomic age". yet, the worries of a young schoolboy yearning to experience his first "kiss" cannot be derailed by something as inconsequential as the bomb. this was a delightful if not educational look at young love from the vantage point of an adolescent male and his world of the1940's. free of political correctness and preachy messages, this film exposes the viewer to the world that only the mind (andhormones) of a young teenager can create. wonderful subplotsmaintain character interest ala "gregory's girl", and plentyof well blocked shots help keep up the imagery of this era. this is a very good story for anyone, young or old, who hasever been in love, or ever wanted to be. does he ever get his wish? watch it and see.

there is a great danger when you watch a film that had had such a profound affect on you the first time around , that 20 years later , it wont hold the same magic as it did before. i must admit i wasnt expecting it to be as good as i remembered but a was pleasently suprised. p'tang yang kipperbang is still as fantastic as i remember it when i was a 12 year old .this film has a certain type of brilliance that not many films possess. it is engrossing , it is briliantly acted and best of all it makes me feel like a kid again and there isnt many things that can do that. john albasiny and abigail cruttenden's rolls in this film are 1st class and i had forgotten how good they were until now. i urge any parent of teenagers to sit them down and watch this and see if it has the same affect on them as it did on me. p'tang yang kipperbang eehhh! 10 out of 10.

just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent bbc mini-series, published in 1981, it was not available on dvd until the last few years. since then, it has become available, but initially only in the british format (for which i bought an 'international' dvd player, which you have to hack--illegally, i suspect, to see it), but the series is now available through amazon.com--3 discs-- for between $19-21, to be viewed on dvd in the us format, no hacking. there were 41 reviews, average 5 stars. this mini-series is one of the very best on oppenheimer, or the manhattan project, or virtually anything produced by the bbc.

like an earlier commentor, i saw it in 1980 and have never been able to shake the memory of the gripping story, splendid acting, and dramatic musical score. it certainly contains some of sam waterston's finest work. he and the writers depict oppenheimer not simply as an unjustly victimized hero -- which he was -- but also as naive, fond of alcohol, and snobbish, a rounded portrait instead of a stereotype.

>>> great news there is a bbc dvd release scheduled for 31st july 2006,uk - there is also a scheduled release in states - don't know the date - can't wait ! ! <<<<>>>> below is my original comment <<<<<i agree with all the other reviewers - it is simply staggering that one of the greatest tv dramas ever has never been released on dvdthe story line is gripping - the acting is outstanding and the character development is enthralling !over here in the uk we have quite a history of getting tv drama series and films out onto dvd through popular campaigns it's very hard to see why the rights owners do not go into a dvd production ? i'm going to e:mail one of the leading players in this grass roots movement and see what happens. who did the production ? was it bbc ? rw

insanely well crafted mini-series.i recall seeing most of it twice when shown on american playhouse on pbs. was heavily promoted at the time. i believe it might have been one of the very early mini-series showing on pbs outside of the masterpiece theater series.the full length production was shown i believe only once during its first broadcast. was 6-8 hours total. this length was edited down somewhat to 6 hours. cut some interesting, but slow scenes.i am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and restore a complete, not edited version to dvd. not worth creating a vhs version at this point.would fit in very well in the mini-series or dramatic history genre.

...means "take up and read", which is precisely what i felt like doing after having seen this marvelous film.von ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of tobias wolff's 1995 new yorker article of the same name. the incredible performance by tom noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired. the nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle, clever, and make the film cinematically more dynamic. it's lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it again.watch out for this young director...he's going places.

oppenheimer was a great series (it was the first thing i saw waterston in) and it is too bad copies aren't available. a similar situation exists for "glory enough for all", a british series from around the same time, about the discovery of insulin. i would pay a good price for both of these on dvd. is it really so difficult to get oppenheimer on a dvd that is able to be played in the us? another very enjoyable series, again from about the same time, was "danger uxb". a series about defusing unexploded bombs, hence the name. that one you can get from your local library.pete

'oppenheimer' with sam waterston in the title role and with david suchet as evard teller is an example of the docudrama at its very finest. well written, well acted by actors who bear a believable resemblance to their historical characters, highly informative, and very entertaining. the set designs and costumes capture the feel of the us during world war 2, and the plotting and dialog make the viewer feel as if he were really present at los alamos and caught up in the excitement of the manhattan project. the only downside is that this is a british production, and some of the actors lack skill in affecting a convincing american accent. (the skill of current day australian & irish actors taking on non-native dialects is amazing.) the storyline is fully consistent with richard rhodes' definitive history of the development of the atomic bomb. sadly, the mini-series was shown only a couple of times on pbs at the beginning of the 1980s and then apparently vanished into oblivion.'oppenheimer' compares favorably to the more recent 'fat man & little boy' feature film with paul newman as leslie groves (the chronically overweight and rather homely general would be thoroughly flattered) and dwight schultz (alumnus of tv's 'a-team') as oppenheimer. as a mini-series, 'oppenheimer' is around 4x as long as the newman feature, but uses the all of the additional time completely to its advantage.

the true story of phoolan devi who became a national hero in india because she fought for her rights as a woman but in a violent manner. i was surprised to see a powerful film with strong images come out of india instead of the bollywood art trash classics they churn out.

i saw this movie over 5 years ago and the subject still infuriates me, as it should. her anger and initiative were inspiring. not that i would takeover an army and kill people, but the scene at the well and at the rebel strong hold will never leave my mind. this is a great film but be prepared for the strong subject matter.

not wishing to repeat what everyone else has noted, i will only say this: nearly everybody says they loved curly best... but i will put brideless groom up against any of other the stooges shorts. i think it's the most hilarious from start to finish, as well as being the most re-watchable.the off-key singing student... christine mcintire's "cousin basil" routine, and of course emil sitka's j.p. are highlights, but only around the stooges' impeccable timing and the great writing too!nuff said.

a three stooges short, this one featuring shemp. of all those involving shemp i've seen, this is my favorite performance by him in a stooges short. the basic plot is that shemp must get married by 6 o'clock that very evening if he's to inherit the half a million dollars a rich uncle left him in his will. so shemp sets out to get himself a bride but finds it a tougher road than expected, that is until they learn of his inheritance money. best bits here involve shemp shaving, shemp and moe in a telephone booth and larry on piano as accompaniment to shemp's voice-training session. also the sequence where shemp is mistaken as cousin basil and its outcome proves hilarious.

for the record, i am a curly fan through and through. but i do have to say that in reality, shemp wasn't really that bad. yeah, he might have lacked the same kind of slapstick that curly had, but in his own way he was hilarious. at least he wasn't as bad as joe besser.in brideless groom, shemp plays a music professor (stooge? a professor? yeah right), who recently inherited a half million dollars from a dead uncle, and moe & larry have to prepare him to marry a woman by six o'clock that night, or no money.this was one of the stooges' first skit with shemp, before they started recycling their material. perhaps it isn't surprising that shemp was part of the stooges before curly came into the picture, so he seemed natural at this. the slapstick gags are hilarious, especially this one scene with moe and shemp in a phone booth. essential stooge short to be honest.

almost certainly the best three stooges short with shemp, 'brideless groom' is as good as any of the trio's best shorts featuring curly. memorable stooge moments abound. the opening with 'professor' shemp giving voice lessons to homely, untalented and lascivious miss dinkelmeyer (dee green), wincing at her horrendous singing notes and fighting off her advances, is an excellent example of shemp howard at his best. many considered him the most naturally funny of the stooges.later, when moe and larry try to help him get spiffed up to find a wife (and claim $500,000), shemp thinks he has cut off his head when his mirror gets flipped backward. fixing the mirror, he cries with relief, "there i amand pretty as a picture!" "yea," moe quickly replies, trying to hem his slacks, "of an ape!"the best scene (and maybe shemp's best with the trio) comes when he pays a call on attractive young miss hopkins (christine mcintyre). mistaking him for long-lost "cousin basil," she smothers him with hugs and kisses (also leading to a hilarious bit between moe and larry in the hall), not giving him a chance to explain his true identity. suddenly the real cousin basil calls and she goes berserk, slapping him repeatedly and accusing him of taking advantage of "a poor . helplessdefenseless  woman!" that final line is delivered as she socks him in the jaw (with a real punch, according to shemp and crew members), knocking him through the door and into the hall in a perfectly executed gag. "what happened, kid?" moe asks. "can i help it if i ain't cousin basil?" shemp asks before passing out.other classic bits include moe and shemp getting tangled in a phone booth, trying to find a lost coin, larry getting slapped because of shemp's bad looks (his face pressed against the phone booth glass), and the great girl fight in the justice of the peace's apartment. the great emil sitka delivers his classic line (inscribed on his tombstone), "hold hands, you love birds" over and over as his apartment is trashed.i prescribe 'brideless groom' as medicine for anyone who thinks the stooges' glory years ended when curly left. true, shemp didn't have as many great shorts with the group as curly, but that was due to an increasing lack of support from columbia and his (and the others') advancing ages. when shemp was healthy and the trio was given decent material to work with, they were still on the top of their game.

this is the very first three stooges short with shemp that i saw, and it is one of my favorites! that is what i really liked about shemp when he returned after curly's stroke, he did not try to be like curly, he was his own character, and that is what i admire! shemp is my favorite third stooge, i like him more than curly, but i like curly as much as i do shemp. shemp is great, he's funny, he's silly, he's shemp! i really loved the scene where he dropped the nickel and moe got into the booth with him to find it and they ended up getting tangled in the wires and really badly hurt! but what i really thought was scary was when shemp had his face smashed against the glass of the phonebooth, he looked like a deformed professor snape!poor shemp, he had a lot of bad things happen to him in this short, but that is just typical three stooges, they always have a lot of bad things happening to them! this short is another must see for three stooges fans! 10/10

the stooges are back and funnier than ever. "brideless groom" in my opinion was probably the best shemp flick.shemp has the opportunity to inherit $500,000(which was probably more than a million dollars compared to today) from his dead uncle. but! there is a catch. he has to marry someone that day by 6 o'clock. shemp is a bachelor with not too many admirers, except for one high pitched aggressive annoying singing student of his. but he doesn't want her, he wants someone a little more on the victoria's secret model type of women. but obviously he has no choice since he's no collin ferrel himself. but when it is printed in the papers that he is to inherit all that money if married, his ex girlfriends are on the "i want my man back" attack! what a great stooge flick! this is up there with thewinners of all stooge flicks! 9/10

"gargle with old razor blades. can i help it if i'm not cousin basil? i think the piano's out of tune. ginger grey. this is your little snookums." laughs throughout the entire 20 minute short as the boys spoof gold diggers and opera singers. they even manage to show us how to properly demonstrate to some attractive ladies how to handle both a rifle and a bear trap. wonder how many times they rehearsed the scene with the phone booth. adding christine mcintyre and emil sitka, 2 frequent collaborators, to the mix makes it even better. only vernon dent is missing. the stooges did some great individual scenes, but this was their best overall.

clyde bruckman borrows the premise of this short from buster keaton's "seven chances," recently tepidly remade as "the bachelor." in the original, buster has 24-hours to get married in order to inherit a large sum of money. in this version, musical teacher prof. shemp has only 7 hours (after all, it is a short!). this is one of the better stooges shorts due to the storyline and wonderful routines (including the telephone booth scene with moe & shemp, reminiscent of laurel & hardy's "berth marks" and the marx brothers famous stateroom scene in "night at the opera - here the boys hold their own in their variation of this routine). i'm not a huge stooges fan, but this one should be noted by any student of comedy as one of their very best since the early 30s shorts.

ok, the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem, i.e. the story started out in life as material for buster keaton's silent classic "7 chances". comedy, or acting in any genre for that much, is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before, if it's not a totally original creation. here we have the stooges essentially doing material that was written and performed by someone else and yet for a low budget, short time span of a film, they're handling things just fine. regardless of what the credits say on their films, real "stooge-philes" know that they had a lot of input on lines and direction. they took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation. words spoken by emil sitka himself during a documentary about the boys. here, what appears to be their usual anarchy over something so simple as getting married, is actually organized chaos. every line is perfectly timed with a related physical action. how many comedians are around today that can claim such mastery? most obviously the seinfeld crew but none others that i've seen in the last 35 years of watching tv. the critics will always "pooh pooh" the stooges or laurel & hardy and others but then again...who ever remembers the critic's names or what they said? simply watch, laugh and enjoy!

the entire civilized world by now knows that this is where emil sitka says his immortal "hold hands, you lovebirds." but shemp howard, professor of music, steals the show. watch him tutoring dee green as she fractures the "voices of spring." watch shemp as he shaves by a mirror suspended from the ceiling by a string. watch him as he gets walloped by christine mcintyre. watch him, and you will laugh and learn. moe is no slouch either. watch him as he attempts to induce a woman to sit on a bear trap. larry, as usual, is the zen master of reaction. all in all, one of the very best stooge shorts. you won't find one weak moment.

after the funeral was absolutely superb, and by far the best episode of the season. i was disappointed with cards on the table, that started off so well but let down considerably by the last half hour, and i didn't know what to think of taken after the flood, though i do remember being confused at the end. after the funeral as i've said is one of my all time favourite poirot episodes, up there with five little pigs, sad cypress and the abc murders. i was afraid that they would ruin the story, but instead it is very faithful to the book. now i will say i don't mind changes to books, and try not to compare movies and tv adaptations to their sources, except when the book is a masterpiece and the adaptation doesn't do it justice. that's why i disliked some of the marples like nemesis and sleeping murder, and so far out of the poirots the murder of roger ackroyd, taken at the flood and cards on the table are the only ones that really did disappoint. everything else ranges from good to outstanding, even the recent appointment with death, despite the many deviations from the book, which i admit isn't a favourite, was surprisingly good, thanks to the marvellous production values, stellar ensemble performances and outstanding music score. back to after the funeral, the production values are fantastic. it has a really cinematic feel to it, and the stunning photography and splendid scenery and costumes made it a visual feast for the eyes. the music was very stirring and even haunting, and the entire cast give wonderful performances. david suchet is impeccable as always as poirot, and geraldine james and anna calder marshall are just as terrific. but for me, the standout was monica dolan as mrs gilchrist, she is up there with donald sumpter and polly walker as the best supporting actor/actress in a poirot episode, that's how good her performance was. all in all, a must see, one of the best poirot episodes by far, and one of the more faithful ones too. 10/10 bethany cox

for those of you still in the dark, i will not spoil this christie, as it is definitely one of her finest works, and i stress that you should see it whenever you next have free time! if any of the adaptations are to be watched before (or in lieu of) reading the book, i would suggest "after the funeral" for the following reasons.i wanted to praise the performance by monica dolan (miss gilchrist), whose employer-companion cora is brutally murdered at the outset of the film. her portrayal of a shocked, nervous, insignificant woman is actually moving, especially when she has a moment of personal connection with poirot, another person who travels alone in "the journey of life." and when the murderer is being revealed in typical poirot denouement fashion, dolan's reactions to the revelation are acting at its finest: you feel as angry at the murderer as you do sympathetic to miss gilchrist... something uncommon in christie lore.although there are a couple of discrepancies between novel and film adaptation, as per usual (the business of the will perhaps making less sense in the film), the unbelievably lavish recreation of post-war england, thoroughly high calibre of acting and directing, and preservation (if not heightening) of christie's mystery and intrigue render these discrepancies insignificant.bravo suchet, dolan and the whole team for crafting this masterpiece of murder mystery theatre, and the producers who gave it the green light! encore!

aunt cora had always been tactless, and her well-bred family ignored the remark she made after her brother richard's funeral: "he was murdered, wasn't he?". they remembered it the next day, when cora was found brutally murdered with a hatchet...for some reason, the poirot movies this year have been far from faithful to the original book. i was disappointed about the changes made in cards on the table-- my favourite poirot book. after the funeral is my 2nd favourite poirot book, and i was scared the story would be destroyed. it wasn't! the movie was nearly page-for-page faithful throughout, right down to the killer's motive! all the actors were wonderful, but my favourite has got to be monica dolan, who gives a great performance as miss gilchrist, the companion to the late aunt cora. without a doubt the best poirot movie ever!

david suchet is agatha christie's mustached detective hercule poirot in "after the funeral," produced in 2005. anyone who has heard david suchet speak with his own british accent knows what a shock it is, because his accent as poirot is so perfect and organic to the character. suchet is the poirot of agatha christie's books, and although i confess a love for peter ustinov in the role, his portrayal doesn't have that much to do with what christie wrote.in this episode, poirot is asked by a solicitor friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients. enroute on the train, the solicitor recounts the events after the death - a strange will disinheriting the expected heir and the pronouncement of the man's sister that he was murdered. when poirot meets the family, he discovers adultery, lots of secrets, another will and murder.the story is excellent with rich production values and a wonderful, detailed depiction of the time period. all of the acting is superb, particularly from monica dolan, who plays miss gilchrist. poirot here is without hastings, his beautiful office, or miss lemon but he's effective nonetheless.i had the privilege of seeing david suchet on broadway in "amadeus." breathtaking. what an actor - when he's playing poirot, all i see is poirot.

i was surprised that i liked this movie. but it reminded me of a 2004 version of the first friday the 13th. there were a number of cheesy elements, yet at the same time there were many cool ones. the story line was good--predictable if you have seen more than one or two horror movies, but full of one-liners to make it worthwhile. there are some memorable scenes worth watching. a few issues i had with the plot had to do with the continuity of the characters. for instance in the opening scene the scarecrows (which were humans on stakes, whose blood was drained to grow the crops), looked very real, but later in the film they looked more like fake scarecrows wearing blue colored masks. there were more than several gaps in the plot, and the acting was mediocre, but at least it sounded like how real people talk, unlike hollywood movies where the dialogue is really fake sounding when you think about it. the culmination of the last scene, when the main character says "i'm not a baker, i'm a connell!" and lops the head off of the scarecrow is satisfying, as his friends have for the most part been killed off by these creatures at that point.

this movie was to me a fairly enjoyable watch, i mean it wasn't great but it was one of the better horror movies of late. it seems to have been low, almost state benefit budget size but it has it's charms like the lovely ladies in it. the atmosphere was good also (which is what is missing froma hell of a lot of horror movies these days). the acting was your typical 80's low budget affair, that being in case you don't know is that it is "dud" acting. but that is what lucio fulci's movies were full of, they like this movie had atmosphere what they were lacking in storyline and money etc. they more than made up for in the horror & gore & atmosphere for the movie it's self.it is just a typical low budget horror movie that is watchable, i watched it all the way and i love horror movies. i've seen movies where i just turn off within 10 to 20 minutes or sit and fast forward it if it's on video, or skip scene's on the dvd. this movie didn't make me want to do that, i sat and watched it all the way to the end, without wanting to skip parts.i would have liked it however if the zombie type folk in this were a little more scarier as they were about as scary as having freddy kreuger as your babysitter, not. but seriously though if they were a little better it would have been low budget perfection, maybe.the music in this movie was top notch stuff, ideal horror music so it was. i've seen horror movies where the music is good or average but it could have been better, thank goodness though this movie didn't have nay of the metal music in it.i've been a die-hard metal fan since 1990 but in horror movies metal music spoils it, the movie looses atmosphere a lot when any type of music other than a score is playing. so i'm glad there was no music in this movie other than just your typical score which was rather creepy, well done.it could have use "profane grace - epitaph of shattered dreams" on it though. as it is keyboard music no guitars no nothing except "really" creepy keyboard tracks. like track one "forever sleep" you hear the wind blowing all the way through it and some goose bump inducing keyboard music that follows it. ever track on that cd is the same, ideal horror music at it's best, it would have suited this movie perfectly.the only unattractive chick in the movie to me was the one who got chibbed/killed (or so we are led to believe) and hung up as a scarecrow, only to get free and try to escape later. every other woman in the movie was lovely indeed, a big 9 out of 10 for them all except the one i mentioned above.i wish that hollywood (mainstream side of things) would give money to romero and the guy who made this movie. as giving it to them for movies is way better a decision made than giving it to a goon muppet called paul anderson of the "resident evil" mince.well done guys, it is not bad, not bad at all, i loved the part at the end credits when they kept showing you clips of them making the movie (behind the scene's) not many movies do this kind of thing, which i thought added a little to the movie, as it also showed you some outtakes of sorts and that's always a good thing if you ask me.rating for this movie 8/10, rating for the lovely ladies in the movie 9/10, rating for the atmosphere in the movie 9/10, rating for the score for the film 9.5/10.

do not expect a classic military comedy, which claims to make fun of the military while only enhancing a militaristic outlook. instead it deconstructs the elements that make the military such a murderous machine. kind of east german version of "buffalo soldiers"."nva" works on a meta-level that it sympathizes with its heroes' attempts to escape from army drill any which way they can. it's not about loud laughs but about long lasting smiles. utopian, of course (in one scene you will be shown the harsh reality), but very thoughtful.just to fill the required 10 lines: do not go into that movie if you have been an army officer and liked your job.

don't quite know why some people complain about this film not being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic. if it had been realistic, there certainly wouldn't have been much comedy. i also don't think that a comedy needs to make you laugh aloud twenty times. there was much subtle humor, sweet feelings, and kim frank just portrayed a dreamy character. in real life, there are many people whose facial expression doesn't change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right. the ending was quite unrealistic, i'd say, but happy. it's a light-hearted movie with a feel-good ending. i liked it. loved it, actually. a serious part was krueger going to schwedt, and i'm glad they didn't show what happened to him there. showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly.

looks like the bet movie i've ever seen. not too much for intelligent perception but so rich for perception sensitive. antonioni is comparably wise to his movie. malkovich's so organic, roles are so true, situations are so real. i've change my world outlook after this cinema. i'm a beginner literati in russia -- country of tolstoy and dostoevskiy -- and i'm quite sure watching antonioni is good and fun for russkies, because i and we do understand his point of view. so i don't understand his lesser raiting on imdb. i'm sure, speaking from russia and our people, we like antonioni because of his romantic soul and positive sensation of surrounding reality

first, the positives: an excellent job at depicting urban landscapes to suit the mood of the film. some of the shots could be paintings by de chirico. sophie marceau, beautiful.the negatives: the stories are hard to believe. unreal, uni-dimensional characters preen and posture 100% of the time, as if they were in some kind of catwalk. this is neither the antonioni of his earlier, much better movies nor the wenders we've all come to know and appreciate. malkovich is excess baggage in this movie.

amazing movie. some of the script writing could have been better (some cliched language). joyce's "the dead" is alluded to throughout the movie. beautiful scenery and great acting. very poetic. highly recommend.

if you speak french or can put up with sub-titles, you will really enjoy this movie. if on the other hand you just want to see god's most beautiful creatures, this is a must see. not an ounce of silicon in sight. zalman king eat your heart out. sophie marceau's body is the epitome of perfection and everything i had ever fantasized about. her part is even in english. even the fact that she was nude with john malkovich did not detract for her beauty. sophie is a ten if ever there was one. chiara caselli and inés sastre are 9.5s. oh yeah, it is a pretty good story. several little vignettes are woven together in a sort of six degrees of separation style.

her excellency madam shabana azmi has worked in countless movies over life time. i think best is yet to come.fire is ok.but still good days are yet to come.hopefully, in water i will be able see her better.thanks and regards.ps: india doesn't have a director to make best use of her.

this movie embodies the soul of modern "elite" foodculture, even though the movie is 17 years old. the standing principle in the movie is: food is more than just nourishing matter. it is also a powerful symbol and a medium for culture itself. the main characters literally get drunk on the finest wine and food, become inspired by idealistic thoughts and culture, as they let go of their puritanism and passion-denying table manners. karen blixens shortstory makes use of the difference between north europe and south europe, to point out their inherently different approaches to food. as the strict and and rather dull scandinavians get infused with "eros" from south, the party gets going. so what are you waiting for? go watch it.....again!

i saw this movie awhile back and can't seem to track it down. does anyone know where i can get a hold of it? i feel it is worth seeing again.i'm sorry to say i had never heard of chloe nicholle until this film. yes she can act. when i first began to track this movie down i mistook it for another one of her movies, sex spa. the plot seems similar to me but the roles are reversed.this is the first film i've seen dru berrymore. i looked up some of her other films and i feel she looks better as a blonde. i agree this is a good introductory movie. not too soft. not too hard. you got to start somewhere.

there's not much anyone can say about this flick....the plot is quite simple: two police officers (who also happen to be lovers) are using a brothel as a stakeout in order to catch a criminal, with the help of the "lady of the house", played by hardcore pornstar chloe. as anyone can guess, there's a few plot twists and some blurred alliances, but the writing was just horrible, even for a softcore movie.i've read some previous posts about nicole hilbig's accent (she plays the female cop). yes, it's hard to understand what she's saying at times, but i think i've placed it. i did some sniffing around....i think she's from germany, hence her odd-sounding accent. she makes an impression even without speaking, however...she's got a great looking body.there were a couple of "from behind" sex scenes in this movie that were quite graphic for a softcore film....excellent work there. the three-way scene toward the end wasn't bad either.*spoiler alert*i kinda knew the female cop was gonna turn into a part-time call girl at the end. she enjoyed her three-way way too much.*end spoiler*i'm not gonna nitpick about the story too much, seeing as this is a low-budget, direct-to-video softcore flick. however, it just seems like i've seen way too many movies in this genre with a similar type of storyline.women: b (chloe and hilbig were okay as the eye-candy) sex: b+ (scenes were kinda short, but good) story: c (a recycled plot, but whatever works, eh?) overall: b-

for a moment, let's put aside the cultural aspects of this movie, even if it is a very important side of it, and let's look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story. two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation, caused by two selfish husbands. they have to live through their sad days without any ray of hope. if each one of these two women had been alone, imagine what kind of life each one would have had to accept. they found each other and they fell in love. that this love was against all the social, religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant. they loved each other, found relief in each other, that was sufficient. the reaction of the individuals around them is but a small fact that they have to accept, suffer even, and then they can go on with their lives, their life. very nice.

thank you the filmzone for showing this sleazy soft core sex flick at 1 a.m. i truly enjoyed it. to be honest, i expected a lot more from a sexy cast with mckayla, dru berrymore, and of course, the talented chloe nicholle (as rebecca carter).the production values are truly bad mainly because of the low budget but a little more effort wouldn't harm. for example, the cinematography makes it look like a hard core porno movie. there's absolutely no effort in lightning. but let's ignore that fact because let's be honest, we watched "pleasures of sin" because of the high amounts of sex.the sex factor is pretty good and offers steamy, explicit scenes. chole nicholle delivers the best performance of the female cast.so my advice is , watch this movie if you are in the mood for good explicit sex or just watch it if you are a fan of mrs. nicholle.recommended only for the sex scenes; don't expect anything else.

i've taken another look at this film and still consider it pretty good. chloe is one of the few hardcore stars who really can act. she appears occasionally in soft core such as "body of love" and "lady chatterly's stories" on showtime. i thought nicole hilbig did ok too with her nice body and charming accent. too bad she's not in more films.

progeny is about a husband and wife who experience time loss while making love. completely unaware of what this bizarre experience means they try to go on with their lives. the hubby begins questioning the bizarre event and gets help through a very annoying psychiatrist. he comes to believe that aliens are responsible for this lapse in time and that the unborn baby he once thought was his and his wife's actually belongs to the aliens.if ya ask me, this is a great scifi/horror story. taking a highly questionable real-life scenario involving alien abduction and hybrid breeding is definite thumbs up from this guy. i love all things related to aliens and this story definitely delivered some good ideas. so if you also share an interest in things extraterrestrial, you should be pretty happy with progeny. at least story-wise anyways.unfortunately the movie overall is pretty average. with average acting by all actors. yep, even by the consistently awesome mr. dourif, who still does deliver the best performance. though the black head doctor, delivers his lines really well. there are a few points in the flick where some of the delivery is cringe or laugh worthy, which is fine in my book. i like them cheesy and this had a little bit of some nice stinky cheese, and i mean that in a good way.anyways, with a less than stellar script you can't really blame all the actors. i especially didn't care for the mother hysteria the film went for. she wanted a baby so badly that she'd neglect and dismiss everything her loving husband (who's a doctor!!) said to her. it almost reached a point where you actually didn't care what happened to her.the progeny is another flick by brian yuzna from the icky-sticky film, society. again he delivers some slimy effects, and again he delivers a pretty unique tale of horror. if you're into scifi/horror or are a fan of dourif and or yuzna films, there's no real reason not to check out this flick if you get the chance. a generous 7 outta 10.

first, let me review the movie. this movie creeps me out, and i don't even believe in aliens! however, the movie has its flaws.there are three acts to this movie. act one is perfect. it sets up the movie, and really builds up the creep factor. i must say the score is great! everything is set up and it's set up perfectly.act two begins when jillian, playing sherry burton, goes to the shrink. they hypnotize her, and she recalls the abduction. act two ruins the film when the aliens show up. "screaming mad george" did the effects for the aliens. i must say they did a good job, except with their depiction of the "gray" aliens. no offense, but the grays looked like inflatable door prizes.on a side note, i liked how they treated hypnosis in acts one and two. if you paid attention, you would notice that the husband and wife had two different memories. in the husband's version of events, the blue light zaps them and his wife says, "somebody's here," or something like it. it makes sense. the husband is concerned for his wife. "someone" may hurt her. that's his issue. however in her version of events, she says, "help me!" she does not say "somebody's here." this also makes sense. the aliens are after her. wanting her husband to help and save her is her issue. now back to the film.act three turns the film into a gore fest. it begins with a "strange" ultrasound procedure. it's a typical gore fest, but it does have a surprise ending. i won't ruin it because it's actually an interesting development. the dvd and commentaries takes itself too seriously, but if you think wilford brimley saying "horsesh**" is funny, you might want to check it out in the cast interviews section. now on to my praise of jillian mcwhirter.i could only hope jillian will read this. i had never seen her before, but wow, what a performance! let me tell the rest of you this. first of all, this is supposed to be a serious film. the details i will now describe may sound campy and fun, like "humanoids from the deep" (1980), but it really isn't. got that? okay.jillian is hot, naturally good-looking. she is naked for a lot of the film, a good thing. unfortunately, she is usually being assaulted, terrorized, and raped, a very bad thing. however, she must act in a lot of this film naked. she gets points for overcoming that. she has to act happy, sad, horny, afraid, and physically hurt all in the span of a few moments. the turnaround of emotion is astounding! she has to cheer for joy when she learns she's pregnant. she has to scream in terror when the aliens take out her guts. she has to act very angry when her husband suggests that the baby isn't his. she has to act like she's in denial, saying nothing is wrong with her baby, when her husband says otherwise. a denial, i should note, that is really forced upon her by the aliens controlling her. i am talking oscar-caliber performance here!then there is the rape scene. it's disturbing, but since it's just some rubber alien, it's not too bad. in this scene, the alien is not a "gray" alien, so i will describe it. the alien has tentacles, and it's kind of like a table. jillian is on the table-like part, restrained by the tentacles. by her head is the alien's head. the alien's head is long, and it flips down so that its head is now above jillian's legs. then, the alien's hey-nanu-nanu comes out of his forehead. it's forehead! sounds pretty campy, right? well, jillian plays it straight, and she pulls it off! she has to act like an alien with its hey-nanu-nanu coming from its forehead is raping her, and she pulls it off! it's a very intense scene, but that's not what makes it. you see, this scene is done in a flashback. what makes the scene is jillian's performance recalling these events. she is just lying in a hospital bed under hypnosis recalling the alien abduction, but her acting here is more intense than the actual rape scene! how many actors can pull off a performance in a scene that describes a rape that is more intense than the scene with the rape? not many! however, jillian does it.i could go on and on. jillian, if you ever read this, i want you to know that i, (name withheld) alias of megamanx-1, believe you are the best actress ever. you are the best actress ever! i could only hope you read this and take it with you always.as for everyone else, "progeny" (1999) is an okay to good film. i would recommend it.

<-----minor spoilers!----->a woman gets pregnant, but not by her husband. she develops 'something' inside her, or at least thats what her husband thinks. they go through a lot of hard times, while she is on the brink of a nervous breakdown. the husband contacts an ufo professor, and with his help they try to find out what is wrong with her.<-----minor spoilers!---->the story could have been a bit better, or at least be made less predictable, but the movie is catchy and it got me and my sister hooked through the entire movie without a problem. the acting is very good, and the filming is much better than normal, if you compare this to your normal b-alien movie. the effects are good, and something is happening every second of the movie. the characters are really likable, and apart from a stupid nurse in oné scene, they are all very convincing in their roles.i thought it was a good movie, and can recommend it, if you like alien/monster-abduction movies!7/10 - the story could have been a bit less predictable.

an odd beam of light penetrates the bedroom of dr. craig burton(arnold vosloo)and his wife sherry(jillian mcwhirter)as they are making love. about two hours are unaccounted for as they embrace seemingly unharmed. under hypnosis during a session with psychiatrist dr. susan lamarche(lindsay crouse), craig discovers that his wife was impregnated by aliens. sherry resists this notion as absurd and is quite happy to relay news to her husband that she is indeed pregnant. ecstatic after their trying for ages to get pregnant, sherry is frightened at craig's persistence of the fetus not being his..this stems from a check on his low sperm count with odds especially high that he could in no way have impregnated his wife. awkward, troubling experiences with the fetus inside her leads sherry to some scary discoveries..her doctor, david wetherly(wilford brimley)finds that the ultra-sound gives some unusual results of the developing infant's appearance, but it's craig who notices that it resembles an alien! sparks ignite cutting out the electrical equipment, even shutting off wetherly's pacemaker! through hypnosis, sherry reveals the experience of her abduction, but lamarche believes her problem is psychological not physiological. with no one believing his wife's alien impregnation theory, craig turns to sociologist dr. bert clavell(brad dourif), whose work is in the studies of alien life and abduction. but, bert is reluctant to help craig who will go to the ends of the earth to save his wife's life from possible harm. tragic results occur as lamarche and others try to keep craig from his goals of "cutting the thing out" believing he is mad. craig will still pursue his task trying to drag bert down this path with him.grim, absorbing horror tale about one man's struggle to save his wife from the harm of beings no one else believes exist. thankfully, dourif's character isn't some quack nutjob but an intelligent doctor who wishes to learn more, but his pursuit of the truth of aliens isn't hostile..he does hope to learn from sherry, but isn't incredibly demanding in this goal. the story is told realistically..it's easy to understand why others might deem craig off-his-rocker. vosloo doesn't take the character too far, but expresses the distress of his current situation. how can he save his wife from this hostiles and prove to others that he's not nuts? mcwhirter deserves credit for the demands of the difficult abduction scenes where her unfortunate character is naked on this table being probed and molested by these things. crouse is fine in her limited, but important role as the voice of reason in a situation where her clients seem out of control psychologically. the monster effects are icky and effective. i think the film works quite well and director yuzna deserves credit for restraining himself for this film at least. the final twenty minutes as craig tries to perform his "removal surgery" with a scared bert watching the crazy situation escalate is nail-biting.you know, fans of "fire in the sky" might dig this flick.

this movie will undoubtably not go over well with some, because most of the horror is mental. but it does have a little something for almost everyone, including a couple of really cool abduction scenes with aliens. the film makes extensive use of alien abduction mythology, while also showing a bit more intelligence about some facets of abduction myths than you would expect out of a movie. jillian mcwhirter is excellent in what had to have been a grueling performance.

i put in the dvd expecting camp perversion from the creators of society and re-animator, and was quite surprised to become involved in an authentically suspenseful tale. acting was top-notch (nice to see vosloo in a protagonist role after a long string of villains), the storyline involving, and the few twists fairly surprising. i figured i would fast forward through much of it to get to the abduction scenes, but instead watched it through, only being let down at the very end.maybe i'm being too lenient, but as i stated before, i wasn't expecting much more than alien sex. of course, if you are looking for some hot alien sex, you will be let down. it was mostly quick-cut exam table nonsense with a blink-and-you'll-miss-it glimpse of an interesting 'impregnator' alien.

it would be so easy to dismiss an alien abduction movie before even seeing it - as i did - but this is well worth a look. if you think about it, its not an easy subject matter to handle but this film manages to suspend disbelief which in itself is a feat for such a way out subject. casting the main character as a doctor was a sensible move which lends credence to his willingness to believe in the possibility of alien abduction. vosloo plays it very sensitively involving us in his pain and confusion at the weird events that befall himself and his wife. special effects are used sparingly but to shocking effect and at times the movie is totally gripping but sadly there are a couple of points where the plot wanders and leaves some confusion. also, after building to a tense climax the ending is something of a let down. the supporting characters were unnecessarily weak (the alien hunter) or menacing (the psychiatrist) which also served to detract.but all in all it raised some interesting issues amongst which was a telling line "how do think animals feel when we experiment on them".the concept of "lost time" was also thought provoking.

i just got this movie for christmas and have already added it to my favorites list. a cute and simple story which makes a beautiful movie. who could not love uncle felix or not have their mouth water at the sound of all that food. definite points go to sydney greenstreet for his performance of alexander yardley and also to reginald gardiner who played john sloane, the impossibly boring fiancee. truly a gem to be watched every christmas.

i came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non-holiday films. as you can tell from the other reviews this movie has a very good story line and great actors signed on for it. stanwyck is great as bride to be that is having second thoughts. dennis morgan's acting is strong also. he goes unnoticed in most films but was a very capable actor, check out kitty foyle. in this film he plays the visiting sailor that woos stanwyck away from her husband to be. this is a christmas classic. the settings and the story make for a great christmas romance

though it's a christmas movie, "christmas in connecticut" could have been done any time of year, as it's the story of a soldier who spends what is to be an idyllic time with a martha stewart type. that's what he thinks. in reality, the lady in question, portrayed by barbara stanwyck, has a popular magazine column about life on a farm with her husband and baby. she has no farm, no husband, and no baby, nor are the many recipes she publishes hers. they belong to the restaurant owner nearby. when her no-nonsense editor, sydney greenstreet, insists that she entertain soldier dennis morgan, she enlists the aid of her boyfriend to use his farm, and she transports herself and the restaurateur there. there's even a baby...well, actually, there's more than one. chaos ensues, and the charade becomes increasingly difficult to play out, especially when stanwyck falls in love with morgan.this is such a wonderful movie, and even if you're gravely depressed, "christmas in connecticut" can lift you right out of it. barbara stanwyck is wonderful as the career woman turned homemaker. despite not being as flashy as crawford or davis, she was nevertheless able to do what any role called for - she could be cheap, elegant, warm, nasty, cold, and/or sexy and she makes it look easy. on top of that, she is always attractive and alluring. dennis morgan is a handsome and charming solider; as an added bonus, he gets to use his irish tenor. fiancé reginald gardner is all business, and you can tell he's not quite right for stanwyck. s.z. sakall as the fake uncle/real chef is hilarious, especially as he prays stanwyck can flip a pancake before an audience.i can imagine the impact this delightful film had at the tail end of world war ii. it must have been a real beacon for the better times to come.

this is a wonderful old fashioned christmas favorite, which i try to catch on tv every year if i can. it revolves around a martha stewart like journalist named elizabeth lane, charmingly portrayed by barbara stanwyck. however, in contrast to martha, this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever. the other cast members effectively complete the story, and include dennis morgan (jefferson jones), reginald gardiner (john sloan), and sydney greenstreet (alexander yardley).elizabeth lane is a journalist who writes food articles, portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children. in reality, she is a single woman living in a new york city apartment and cannot boil an egg. her recipes are borrowed from her hungarian chef friend, felix. elizabeth gets away with her deception until the publisher of her magazine, alexander yardley, decides he wants a nice old fashioned country christmas, and invites himself to visit her, bringing with him a returning war hero, jefferson jones, a sailor who had been shipwrecked. yardley demands total honesty of his employees. to get out of her predicament and save her deception based career, elizabeth borrows the connecticut country home of her longtime architect suitor, john sloan, a dull, fussy chap who has long sought marriage. she also borrows a neighbour's baby (actually, several) to pass off as her own and her 'husband' sloan's.of course this scenario makes for much merriment. it's a screwball comedy and a charming romance, with the added attraction of a christmas atmosphere. whenever i think of this movie, i picture the snowflakes falling, the tree beautifully decorated, the fire roaring in the hearth, the turkey roasting, and christmas cookies baking.why did hollywood feel compelled to do a remake? i understand there is a 1992 version, directed by arnold schwarzenegger and starring dyan cannon, kris kristofferson, and tony curtis. i have not seen this modern adaptation nor do i wish to. this old favorite is perfect just the way it is and a holiday 'must see' along with it's a wonderful life, white christmas, miracle on 34th street, and of course all the versions of a christmas carol.

i have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites...it has all the charm, 1940's quaintness, and good old fashioned romance and it's hilarious, to boot! barbara stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking\home life articles for a famous magazine...under the premise that she is a married homemaker. even the president of the magazine is under this delusion. enter a handsome gi, (played by the talented dennis morgan)just rescued off of a raft along with his buddy. his simple wish is to stay at the homey inn the she writes so eloquently about and relax with her famous home-cooked meals. she now has to frantically find a way to save her job and reputation...add to this that her fiancé is in a hurry to tie the knot doesn't help. the humor is superb and the chemistry between the leading characters a lot of fun. throw in the character-actor nicknamed "cuddles" (who fits this name completely) it becomes even more adorable. this has become my must-see movie that i snuggle in with a cup of cocoa each christmas season. a wonderful, enjoyable movie to enjoy at christmastime or anytime!

this movie kicks ass, bar none. bam and his crue have out done themselves with this film. since i got the dvd (4 days ago) i have watched it three times and it gets better every time i watch it. i can't wait for grind to come out in theaters. if its anything like haggard it will be worth the wait.thanks, jtcellphone

barbara stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy, about a sailor invited to spend christmas with a popular magazine writer's family, at her farm in connecticut. the problem is she has no husband, baby, or farm, as she writes about in her column, and she can't even cook; her wonderful recipes being provided for her by her good friend " uncle" felix, owner of a hungarian restaurant in new york city.things get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites himself along for christmas. a scheme is hastily planned, with her stuffy fiancé providing an actual connecticut farm, neighbors providing a borrowed baby, and a quick wedding planned when the publisher isn't looking. but when the handsome young sailor arrives on christmas eve, romantic complications ensue, as the supposedly married author falls like a ton of bricks for the nice guy navy man and vice versa.this is a charming, warm film that deftly balances humor with sentiment and is a wonderful showcase for barbara stanwyck to display her considerable comedic talent, aided by such marvelous character actors as sydney greenstreet, una o'connor, s.z.sakall, and many others. a christmas night dance at the town hall is a toe tapping delight to see, and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of stanwyck is a wonderful surprise, for viewers who have seen her mainly as tough, bitchy women in femme fatale roles. truly a wonderful film that has stood the test of time.

if your expecting jackass look somewhere else this an actual movie and for the budget well done the acting isnt top noth neither is the writing but the directing was there and so was the story definetly worth the rent and possibly the buy if you really enjoy it like i did. but for the person who just likes jackass rent it first.

personally, i don't like a lot of b/w movies, but there's something magical about this movie. the movie starts with elizabeth lane (barbara stanwyck). "liz" writes a magazine column about how she's the 'martha stewart' of connecticut. of course, she's lying. this becomes a problem when her publisher, mr yardley, asks her to play host to a navy sailor over christmas. in addition, mr yardley, who's going to be alone for christmas, invites himself up to the farm for the christmas party. from there, things just go crazy.since the movie is set on a new england farm, the movie has a warm holiday feeling. plus, the characters are hilarious. mr. yardley is always shouting orders, and liz's friend felix is always yelling 'catastroph!' when things go wrong. finally, the movie ends the way a christmas movie should end; a jolly fat man laughs and shouts "what a christmas!" in short, no matter what age you are, you will love this movie.

this film is one of my favorite christmas classics. sure, it's fluff, it's not "relevant", but when did movies being simply entertaining and fun become a bad thing? no, this movie is definitely "a good thing" as martha stewart(appropriately)would say! barbara stanwyck is so appealing in this film and dennis morgan perfectly compliments her. both of them have charm and warmth to spare. they are assisted by a crew of those incredible character actors who seem to have disappeared since the 40's and 50's--sydney greenstreet, s.z.(cuddles)sakall, reginald gardiner and una o'connor among them. where are characters like this today? not one role could have been better cast. bette davis thankfully refused this role as beneath her and she was right to refuse it. she would have attempted to steam roll over everyone and everything around her and completely destroyed the film. stanwyck was a strong actress, but had the wisdom to play this lightly. she has seldom been more appealing and is pitch perfect. morgan is the essence of the nice guy. because his part is the least splashy there is a tendency to overlook his skill. just the fact that he could hold his own surrounded by such distinct character actors is an accomplishment in itself, but he too is absolutely perfect as jefferson jones. skip the ill advised(and pointless)1992 remake and watch this bright, sparkling holiday gift!

given the acting roles he played in the 1940s (casper gutman, signior ferrari, mr. peters, jerome k. arbutny, ex-superintendent grodman, count fosco, titus semple) it surprises many of his fans to learn that originally sidney greenstreet made a name for himself in comedies in the west end and broadway. he was usually such a total villain, or serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored. in fact he actually did make four comedy appearances (one a spoof of his villainous portrayals with his villainy partner peter lorre in a cameo appearance). his best total film appearance in a comedy was probably that of magazine publisher alexander yardley in "christmas in connecticut" (although his autocratic, half-mad soap tycoon in "the hucksters" is a close second). despite some problems with the screenplay, it is a good film, and usually revived in the christmas season.elizabeth lane (barbara stanwyck) writes a column in "american housekeeping" magazine for yardley, where she gives household tips and cooking recipes. she is the 1945 version of martha steward, except that ms steward is a cook and house-owner, and can vouch for trying out and testing what she advocates. stanwyck can't. her cooking recipes are those of her friend felix (s.z. sakall), a gourmet chef and restaurateur. the house she describes as her home (a model farmhouse in connecticut) belongs to her unofficial boyfriend, architect john sloan (reginald gardiner). gardiner really would not mind marrying stanwyck, but she is not fully ready to consider a final commitment to him.as the film begins, an american is shipwrecked by the nazis. this is jefferson jones (dennis morgan), a sailor. he spends two weeks in a raft before being rescued. sensing publicity value, greenstreet decides to grant morgan's wish to have a genuine old fashioned christmas in connecticut. he basically tells stanwyck that she will entertain morgan and himself at her farm for the holidays. stanwyck is unable to explain that the columns image of herself (complete with her ability to flip flap-jacks, and raise a baby she supposedly had with her husband) is a lie - if she does she will be fired, as will her immediate boss dudley beecham (robert shayne). in a moment of depression she accepts gardiner's proposal of marriage, and then gardiner finds his connecticut home is dragooned into becoming the "actual" home of stanwyck and himself and "their baby".of course, aside from putting off greenstreet's meddling curiosity, stanwyck and morgan find that they are falling in love (much to the annoyance of gardiner - he does actually expect that stanwyck will still marry him). complication following complication occurs, as lies piles on lies, and as neighbor's babies succeeds neighbor's babies, before greenstreet begins to wonder if he is missing something. but it is a comedy, so everything works out well. even greenstreet, at the conclusion, is amused by the entire madness - his celebrated hearty chortle mirroring that of santa clause for a change. this is not a classic comedy, certainly not a great one, but amusing enough for the season to be worth watching in december.

it's fun and fast paced, as one falsehood leads to another and another toward an inevitable, surprising conclusion. the suspense separates this holiday flick from all others. one wonders how the pieces are going to fit, both during the movie and in the future.the character actors laid the foundation and entertained us in the process. sinkewicz (frank jenks) shows us what manipulation can get...and ultimately what manipulation can cost! uncle felix (s.z. sakall) sizes up each person for us while trying to protect "lishka" (barbara stanwyck), and this helps us decide who we are going to root for in the end.if we could ever achieve a perfect world, imperfect people would likely have to undergo a series of events such as these.a glaring weakness is that fake baby cry after it allegedly swallowed uncle felix's watch. i've heard more authentic crying from a doll in a toy store.watch it, and you'll really feel like you've been somewhere!

some users are confused about the identity of the armed men walking down the steps in the "odessa staircase" sequence. these men are not cossacks but regular army troops.the cossacks arrive at the scene a little later and they are the men on horses slashing at the crowd with their sabers.to experts on russian history: correct me on this if i'm wrong.but there are a couple of lines in the movie that apparently no one has commented on. after the takeover of the potemkin, someone in the crowd on shore says, "kill the jews!" this is on screen for only a couple of seconds but it is there.how cruelly typical of history, not just in russia but in so many other countries, to immediately, unthinkingly and instinctively blame jews for any domestic trouble!perhaps other parts of the movie are not historically factual but the outcry against the jews is all too real. comments, anyone?also, why can't speakers of english learn to pronounce the name as "potyomkin" instead of as "potemkin"? there's a need in russian to distinguish the two possible pronunciations of "e": as either "ye" or as "yo." sometimes two dots are used to distinguish these two pronunciations but usually the difference simply has to be memorized.

make sure you make this delightful comedy part of your holiday season! if you admire dennis morgan or barbara stanwyck, this film is a fun one to watch. they really work well together as you would see in this movie. the whole cast was very entertaining. since i'm a dennis morgan fan, this film was a real treat! but...everyone can enjoy it! recommended!

i just finished watching this film. for me, the most outstanding work in this film was the music score. while many silent film scores work very well with their scenes, i feel that this is the best score i've come across. the mutiny scenes in particular worked extremely well.

this is one of the best films i've seen from the silent era (sad to say, i've yet to see too many with the exception of chaplin/keaton stuff). very visually brilliant, with insanely influential style in editing and composition. really unique (especially for its time) camera angles and extremely hectic editing. definitely a must see for the film nerd.the downside is that it is a bit too in your face about its politics (i have no problem with politics in film, as long as they are subtle or at least somewhat ignorable as a backseat to the story). also, it's not an "entertainment" film, which is fine, but it's not something i'm going to watch a billion times. this is art, plain and simple, like it or not.worth an a+ for influence alone, but based on personal enjoyment, i give it an a-.

i had before a feeling of mislike for all russian films. but, after seeing this film i haven´t. this is a unique masterpiece made by the best director ever lived in the ussr. he knows the art of film making, and can use it very well. if you find this movie: buy or copy it!

it finally hit me watching my vhs of christmas in connecticut what other film this one reminded me of. if it weren't for the fact that the other was done 20 years later, i'd say it was a remake.just as rock hudson was a phony fishing expert for abercrombie&fitch who had to get some on the job training at a fishing tournament, barbara stanwyck plays an forties version of martha stewart.stanwyck's a cooking columnist who's built up this whole image of living on a small connecticut farm with husband and baby cooking all these marvelous delicacies. trouble is she's unmarried, childless, writes her column from her apartment in new york and doesn't know how to boil water. but her writing is a hit with the public.trouble comes when she's hijacked into cooking a home christmas dinner for a war hero sailor played by dennis morgan who gets to sing a couple of songs as well. got to keep up the image at any cost. and her publisher sidney greenstreet likes the idea so well that he invites himself to the dinner.so with borrowed farm, baby, and reginald gardiner who'd like to make it real with stanwyck she tries to brazen it through. christmas in connecticut's now a yuletide classic and deservedly so. the leads are warm and human and they get great support from the assembled players. s.z. sakall as the hungarian restaurant owner/friend of stanwyck from whom she gets her cooking information and una o'connor as the housekeeper have a nice chemistry between them. reginald gardiner and stanwyck have no chemistry at all, obvious to all but reggie and he's funny in his stuffed shirt way.most people remember this film as one of sidney greenstreet's few ventures into comedy. if he's not an outright villain, a cynical observer of life or a tyrannical tycoon, greenstreet is few other things on screen. christmas in connecticut gave him a rare opportunity to burlesque his own image and he made the most of it.in a biography of barbara stanwyck, she mentions she enjoyed making christmas in connecticut as a welcome change from some villainous parts like double indemnity she'd been doing recently. one of the things that made doing the film so enjoyable was that between takes, director peter godfrey and greenstreet would do some impromptu entertaining of cast and crew with english music hall numbers. made for a relaxed and warm set and the cast responded accordingly.now if only someone had been filming those numbers.

forget jimmy stewart reliving his life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead. i suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this flick and stanwyck's other great christmas story, "meet john doe" aren't revered with the same level of love as...well, you know it's name.stanwyck plays a food writer for a mccall's-type rag who has been lying for years to her pompous publisher about the folksy setting for her recipes. she's an ace b.s. artist until the day morgan's sailor is pulled from the ocean after 18 days afloat & 6 weeks recuperation in a navy hospital. released the last year of wwii, the film is dusted with subtle patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia but never sinks to sentimentality. stanwyck is sexy and sassy as always and meets her match in the hunky morgan with whom it's love at first sight. unfortunately, she has to play married to gardiner's prissy architect who actually has been seeking her hand for years at his farm in ct, just to fool her boss.s.z. sakall adds a great deal of hungarian malaprop & double-entendre humor in support as babs' true source of culinary talent & una o'connor is hilarious as gardiner's obnoxious irish housekeeper.

at the time that this movie was made most housewives knew exactly who barbara stanwick was parodying.today only some women over 50 probably remember gladys taber,whose column "butternut wisdom" ran in family circle magazine from before world war ii until the 1970's.she lived on stillmeadow farm in conecticut,and her columns were collected into a number of books,stillmeadow seasons, stillmeadow daybook, etc. the lines that barbara stanwick recites as she types them for her column are quite typical of the ones that began a typical gladys taber column.besides cooking and country living,she got rather nostalgic and philosophical at times.she talked a lot about her favorite dogs, mostly cocker spaniels.you might say that martha stewart is the gladys tabor of today.christmas is connecticut may not be any cinematic masterpiece,but it is pleasant,lighthearted entertainment,soothing to the stressed out mind,and that is good enough

from the perspective of the hectic, contemporary world in which we live, the so called `good old days' always seem so much more serene and innocent; an idyllic era gone by of which we have only memories and shadows that linger on the silver screen, as with `christmas in connecticut,' a warm and endearing film directed by peter godfrey. barbara stanwyck stars as elizabeth lane, a popular `martha stewart' type magazine columnist who writes about life on her beloved farm in connecticut, always with the latest recipe at the center of the story. one of her biggest fans is alexander yardley, played by sidney greenstreet, the publisher of the magazine for which she writes. yardley has never visited her farm, and in response to an idea expressed to him in a letter from a nurse, mary (joyce compton), he decides to spend an old fashioned christmas with elizabeth, her husband and child and, as a special guest, a certain mr. jefferson jones (dennis morgan), a sailor just recovered from spending fifteen days at sea on a raft after his ship was torpedoed. elizabeth of course cannot refuse her boss, but there are problems; not the least of which is the fact that she has no farm and writes her column from the comfort of a high-rise in the city. it makes for a precarious situation for her as well as her editor, dudley beecham (robert shayne), as the one thing mr. yardley demands from his employees is total honesty. what follows is a charming and delightfully romantic comedy that transports the audience back to a seemingly more simple time and place, to share a christmas past where a warm hearth, good food and kindness prevail.barbara stanwyck absolutely sparkles as elizabeth, with a smile and presence warmer than anything the grandest hearth could provide, and totally convincing as a city girl entirely out of her element on the farm. morgan also fares well as the somewhat naive sailor, whose trust in his fellow man is admirable. even with the deceptions being played out around him, he's the kind of guy you know will somehow land on his feet, and in the end it's elizabeth you really feel for. one of the true delights of this film, however, is sidney greenstreet. his yardley has a gruff exterior, but beneath you know without a doubt that this is a man with a heart as big as texas. it's a straightforward, honest portrayal, and it's a joy to watch him work; the most memorable scenes in the movie belong to him.the supporting cast includes reginald gardiner (john sloan), the terrific una o'connor (norah), frank jenks (sinkewicz) and dick elliott (judge crothers). a feel-good movie that plays especially well during the christmas season (though it would work any time of the year), `christmas in connecticut' is a memorable film that never takes itself too seriously, is thoroughly uplifting and will leave you with a warm spot in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world seem like a good place to be. it's a true classic, and one you do not want to miss. i rate this one 10/10.

i first saw this film about 15 years ago, and i have been enchanted by it ever since. it is such a feel-good experience, that i could happily watch it at any time of the year. however, to me, it is the ultimate christmas movie.the fact that it is in b&w is irrelevant - although i often wonder what it would be like in colour. you can just get that warm, glowing feeling watching the christmas events unfold. stanwyck and morgan are perfect together, and greenstreet is the antithesis of his usual character, sakall is a blustering joy to watch.it is light relief and certainly does not tax the brain, but leaves you feeling glad that you saw it.i can't wait for it to become available on dvd in the uk. i shall certainly be at the front of the queue to buy it.

this christmas gift arrived courtesy of tcm. we had never seen the film, even though we have seen most of the films of barbara stanwyck. this comedy made us laugh so much, that at times, we had to restrain ourselves, in order to hear the dialog.this is a movie that should be seen by people suffering from stressful situations, especially around christmas. it would certainly lift one's spirits by just letting go. the movie would make a perfect gift in the form of a dvd, or a vhs tape. "christmas in connecticut" was directed with great panache by peter godfrey, based on a story by aileen hamilton. the best thing in the movie is the felicitous pairing of two of the most popular stars of that era: barbara stanwyck and dennis morgan. barbara stanwyck always played strong willed women, obviously, this was a change of pace for her. in this film, as well as "lady eve", ms. stanwyck displays a knack for comedy. she and mr. morgan, who played in a lot of musical comedies, make a winning combination.there are no weak performances in the film. sydney greenstreet, an actor notorious for playing 'heavies', is a delight to watch as the rich, and fat, alexander yardley, the man who owned a media empire and who knew a good thing when he saw it. reginald gardiner, an accomplished english actor, adds luster to the stellar cast behind the two principals.s. z. sakall, is another source of continuous mirth; he plays the hungarian chef felix,who has a hard time with his own version of the english language. also, una o'connor makes a perfect norah, the housekeeper in the sloan perfect connecticut farm.in reading other comments in this forum, it's sad to learn that the glorious black and white cinematography is not appreciated by some people. after all, color was not widely used in the 40s, and most of the classic movies have to be seen in its original format because, what would be accomplished in 'coloring' them?this film should be a requirement for anyone looking to spend almost two hours of uninterrupted fun at christmas time because total merriment is assured. watch it with an open mind and heart an maybe you'd like to see "christmas in connecticut" every year.

first, i loved the documentary. it represents a new school history/theory where a subject can reflect a wide range of social and historical issues.i'll get the camera and dogs out of the way first. i hate the blair witch quality of the camera, but also understand the advantage of such a casual approach. in fact, i agree with the other reviewer that it gives us unprecedented access.dogs: warning, i have a doctoral degree in literature which i do not use as a profession, so some of my training may seep in: the dogs are a beautiful metaphor for the complex relationship of human's great endeavors and our need to find the labor to achieve them. the dogs might reflect their owners, as one reviewer suggested. but they also serve as a stand-in for the workers we see in the film. while this might hint at the marxist problem raised by one reviewer, i think it also shows how difficult it is to globalize labor issues. no mondovi's in italy may not translate as well elsewhere. (yikes! i am a marxist at heart and hate to hear my cynical resignation hold sway!) it is a remarkable bait and switch. the dogs are family, the workers are family. but, in the end, the dogs are the workers (the last scene with the poor farmer). while you may disagree with the politics, the artistry of the analogy, coupled with the more overt politics of the film, are wonderful.had only faulkner (i am from alabama) had the power of film beyond the hollywood market, what interesting tales would have been told.

our reviewer from toronto told you what you need to know about this film (except note that it needs editing-the hand held technique gets really old, really fast). i saw this film last night in menerbes, france-we are in the luberon valley, which is covered with vineyards and of course wine makers. they were all there in the salle de polyvalente for the showing-crammed in. polite, patient, genial. although my french is testy, i got the gist of the film but noted that the audience loved the "old" terror growers interviewed-esp. the one from a communist village in languedoc. he got a lot of laughs. this is unusual in france-laughing aloud. there is no question which side of the terror-globalization war they are on! sm

mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary. in the world of wine there is a huge different between the big winery and the small one. it's not just about size of of your vineyard but also the amount of money and power you have. if you have enough money to place ads in the wine spectator and hire a so called "wine except" then it doesn't matter the size of your estate. also in business world of today wine often has to mass marketed and suited to people's taste. what is means many times wine filtered of it's origin. mondovino shows the commercial side of wine in that of mega producer robert mondavi, and michael rolland the wine expert who shapes wine to the taste of today's critics like robert parker who is also in the film. now these men are not evil or wrong for they have done a great deal of good for wine. but they have power on a grand scale. as we all know power corrupts. mondovino also shows small wine makers such as aime guilbert of the languedoc and hubert de montille of volnay in burgundy. these wine makers are not starving wine makers but they know like all great wine makers that it's about where the grapes are from. the best example of this is explained not by a wine maker but by a haitian man working for neal rosenthal the wine importer. the area the grapes are grown the terroir that matters, that a guiding hand that knows this makes important real wine.

it's not really about wine. no, nossiter's real targets are those who would streamline and assimilate the peculiarities of local (wine) production for business purposes. to this end he has made an excellent, objective film. spirited, bumptious, emotional and flawed independent wine producers are juxtaposed with media-finessed, anodynesprech amercians and auld-europeans: the art of wine-making against market-driven, laboratorised product manufacture. it's an open show that doesn't lead conclusion.nossiter's film is occasionally infuriating to watch - cameras are neither concealed, nor steadicam, by any means. there are also plenty of captions as well as subtitles to wade through, often too short a time on screen.however it does outdo michael moore at the game moore can't play anyway. the characters speak for - and therefore condemn - themselves. well worth a viewing 7/10

just saw this movie 2 days ago. a very interesting look at people and our world through the world of wine. i have no special interest in wine, and yet i found this very enlightening. the director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people as they are. while he exposes a lot of things that are below the surface he manages not to take a stand and leave that for the viewer. he shows a lot of compassion to people (and dogs) and sympathy and let people tell their story and in the same time exposes what they don't want to tell.the movie shows us where our world is going to, what are the benefits and what is the heavy price we pay. it is a movie about the love of wine and the love of making it big, personal and global, character and formula.the real stars of the people for me are the older wine makers with their disillusioned look at the world and themselves.it takes some time to get use to the hectic camera moves and editing, but it's worth it.highly recommended.

i can't imagine why it hasn't been theatrically released yet. it's got a great ensemble cast, with sutherland, lane, and especially chris evans doing spectacular work. wake up, studio execs!the story is based upon the experiences of the author/screenwriter, growing up as the "poor kid" in an extremely affluent community, where class is everything, and makes a difference in every aspect of life, from clothing to justice.during the film's q&a, the author was asked about his experiences, and particularly what we don't know about the ultra-rich. he said they aren't stupid, they're very smart (as opposed to how they may portray themselves), they've got plans, and they are a threat!in many ways, this film is extremely timely.

i was lucky enough to see this at this years tribeca film festival. i was stunned by how well made and how entertaining this wonderful little film was. director griffin dunne has done a great job assembling this film that has several characters and several story lines that blend so smoothly and seamlessly. the main story involves the family and it is very thought-provoking and entertaining story that involved the viewer in every scene. the film as a whole has credibility and integrity, yet still has that commercial edge - an "indie" movie for the masses if you like. the performances by the cast are all excellent but it is diane lane who shines the brightest. diane lane is simply sensational in this wonderful film and should be oscar nominated. early days i know, but lane acts her socks off here.

i thought this was a very good movie. someone said it was 'sick' so they couldn't watch it. i think if you realize its rated r then you will be prepared for the nudity and drug use. it is a good story and the acting is amazing. just can't be a prude to appreciate it! its basically about a mom who does drugs and wants to get clean so she calls a very wealthy old friend and he moves them to his estate and crazy things happen. i guess it is a drama. i am just so sick of people who don't like movies because of cursing or nudity. that is the world we live in. you obviously aren't comfortable with yourself if you can't see things like this movie. and it's rated r. so, that should tell you from the beginning that its not all peachy happy rainbows. i liked it. i think you will too!

with boundless, raw energy and an uncompromising vision, talk radio brilliantly explores the public's fondness for reducing strangers' private problems into entertainment via the radio.eric bogosian is sensational as barry champlaine, a rude, in-your-face talk radio host. he's a natural for this kind of role, and fine tunes one of the most impressive, interesting radio personalities i've ever seen on screen. the timing and delivery of his insults to his various callers are strokes of genius.alec baldwin also shines as barry's boss. he demonstrates the same explosive cynicism that he would later display 1992's glengarry glen ross. but the supporting role that truly stands out is the stoned, seemingly brain-dead teen played by michael wincott. you have to see it to believe it.oliver stone and robert richardson do a great job with the photography, which is almost entirely confined to a single broadcasting room. the claustrophobic feel of the movie perfectly mirrors its tone. after all, one of the major points of the film is exploiting people's private moments to draw an audience. stone demonstrates that these moments are often too private for the whole world to experience.talk radio is a film with strong emotional and cerebral impact - the likes of which are seldom seen today.

eric bogosian gives as great a performance as you'll ever see in an oliver stone film. his barry character is an assault rifle disguised as a man and he blows away anyone, on or off the air, that offends him. adapted from bogosian's stage play, "talk radio" is a vicious and frightening ride that doesn't let you off until it's too late. by then, you've become familiar with the fringe of racists, rapists, paranoids, wannabe assassins and mere prank callers who listen, speak and lurk in the dark of dallas nights. stone behaves himself, if that's even possible, letting bogosian dominate every scene, from barry's humble beginnings to the make or break point when his radio show can reach national syndication. the rest of the cast are uniformly excellent as the lovers and/or co-workers that all have being used and tossed aside by barry in common. the only thing i'd change is the recurring theme music, "bad to the bone". i'd have used bachman-turner overdrive's "not fragile". a better song, one i haven't heard in a film so far and a driving, relentless tune whose ominous riff is like the true soundtrack to barry's life.listen if you dare!

talk radio sees a man somewhat accidentally stumble through life, indeed the american dream, from whatever bog-standard and everyday job he has in a store; to presenter of a local radio show before going right the way through to the same job only later syndicated nationwide. it's a role he adopts out of his own aggression and natural mannerisms, a frothing mad approach to freedom of speech as he attacks just about everyone and everything, even those that often call up to agree with him or compliment him. his role as a man that rants on all things good, evil, right, wrong, political, religious, moral and immoral is something that people seem to take to in one form; that of 'it's entertaining and worth tuning in for', but additionally on a plane of rejection and antagonism  two things born out of the very things seemingly encouraged in professional working life in the western world. this, towards a man as he gets to the very top of his game by way of the american dream and dealing in freedom of speech as people take to a man but do anything but take to what it is he says.talk radio begins with a montage of tall, towering buildings in a business based area of dallas, texas. the skyscrapers are shot from a ,ow angle and tower over the viewer plus everything else in the general vicinity as this voice of one man tears through the images, belting out statements and information on items as these monolithic buildings dominate out screen. they are the very physical representation of capitalism, while the voice of what we learn to be a radio dj is the oral representation of the free west; personal speech and opinions on anything and everything. stone will finish his film in the exact same manner in which he started it, although the film is anything but a circular journey of any sort as the characters undergo monumental changes in both what they witness and their general livelihood. rather, the shots of the buildings act as an anchor around which the study is observed. the ideologies and ideas of a way of life exist; people subscribe to them, but it does them more harm than good; before the re-establishment that this proud way of life still exists and will continue to exist in churning out the sorts of people on display in the film until someone or something drastically changes things.the dj is barry champlain, a man with a radio show on a local texan station dealing with just about anything. champlain's somewhat carefree attitude to some pretty explosive content is established when he flies from one call with a bigoted man whom recently visited a holocaust museum to a young drug addict whose girlfriend has supposedly overdosed and onto both the berating and mocking of a pizza shop. to us, the content comes across as quite shocking; to these people, everything seems to be business as usual which plants some serious seeds of both doubt and horror within the minds of us, the newcomers to all of this.what barry's show is about, nobody ever seems to really establish: everything and nothing. indeed, time is taken in the form of either jingles or dialogue that the shows immediately pre and post champlain's show are on specific subjects; gardening, for instance, and are hosted by calm speaking and methodical people whom, i'm sure, do not flit from one random or extreme to another all the time raising the stakes. one wonders what barry's jingle is, the kind that plays around about lunch time during someone else's' show: "coming up later, the barry champlain show! featuring the village idiot and psychotic drug abusers!" indeed, his show's introductory piece carries a matter-of-fact tone, a shouting at the audience, as a loud rock track accompanies it.barry's success arrives in the national syndication proposal. it's born out of confrontation and a relationship built on the contempt he has for his listeners and that they have for him. the furthering of the material and the upping of the stakes ought to call into question just how far they think they can take this, and whether this progressing down a track for sake of entertainment is really worth it. it is when the show reaches this level of broadcast that barry seems to come unstuck for the first time in his broadcasting life, when a supposed serial rapist calls in and leaves mostly everyone slightly stunned. it's at this point the camera pauses on barry, and by way of depth of focus, encompasses those same looming, towering buildings the film began with which stand outside of the window, directly behind barry. they remain tall and proud. specifically, of the ideologies they've been built on and this furtherance of freedom of speech in broadening barry's show nationwide as one man climbs his profession's ladder suddenly clashes with the sort of content that's being offered. everything reaches a point too far, and that with freedom, ought to at least come a sense of clarity rather than a mere revelling.oliver stone made talk radio right in the middle of both a fascinating and explosive period of film-making he had in the late 1980s. in this time, he produced a series of really well received films in a pretty short space of time; beginning with one of my favourite war films in platoon before continuing with the quite brilliant wall street and eventually finishing with 1991's jfk. one might even say that this run continued on into the mid-nineties with natural born killers. talk radio is like its lead character in the sense it's loud, booming, stark and confrontational. it isn't anti-capitalism, as much as it is focused on drawing a line between what is perceived as entertainment and what is just going too far for sake of popularity and riches. talk radio is certainly a film that sticks in the memory.

excellent and highly under-rated from beginning to end. one of oliver's best. well scripted, directed, shot, acted and stuarts copeland's soundtrack (trivia: the music during the end credits vaguely sounds like a late 90's pop hit by "spacehog" band eric and cast are brilliant, let alone the callers. what a whirlwind of emotions. it make's your hair stand on end. (..."necks will be broke and whips will crack"--in a old female southern accent.. yike! creepy. scary than any horror movie.10 out of 10em

oliver stone, always ready to make politically-themed movies, makes another one here. "talk radio" is loosely based on the career of alan berg, a radio talk show host in denver who was murdered by white supremacists. in this case, the character is barry champlain (eric bogosian), an outspoken talk show host in dallas who loves nothing more than to irk the people who call in. as it is, most of the people who call in are a bunch of pigheaded racists. and things may be heating up more than anyone realizes.bogosian's performance brings a light comical tone to an otherwise serious movie. i really liked the scene where he jabs at a redneck who calls in. granted, i wouldn't call this oliver stone's greatest movie ever, but it's a good reference in an era when media gets more and more concentrated. good performances by ellen greene and alec baldwin also help.

never having seen an oliver stone film before, nor any films starring eric bogosian, i didn't know what to expect from this film. having toyed with the idea of buying it for a while, i finally got it for free as a supplement with a sunday newspaper and i was hugely impressed.it tells the story of barry champlain, a talk radio host who can be incredibly rude towards his callers, often putting them in their place before they realise what's going on. though this is what has made him a popular radio show host, it has also earned him numerous enemies.the acting in this film was hugely impressive with not one dud actor in it. eric bogosian is brilliant as barry champlain, the troubled talk radio host with alec baldwin turning in a strong performance as barry's boss, dan. it also features the voice of, and cameo appearance by, michael wincott (my reason for wanting to see this).the story was really well written as, despite his arrogance, you feel for barry as more about his troubled life is revealed and you see how vulnerable he really is.i'd recommend this film to anyone as it is captivating and, more importantly real on numerous levels, two of which being that is was inspired by the life of an actual talk radio host and the fact that you do actually get radio show hosts, and callers, like the ones featured in the film in reality.high recommendation and 10/10.aye yours, cat squire

oliver stone is not one to shy away from a movie or theme for that matter. he is eager to confront people with their fears or show them their ugly faces in the mirror. look on his cv for proof! this movie is not an exception, quite on the contrary, it is another gem, that unfortunately not many have seen.as controversial movies go, this is one that you should be thankful for. a movie that should encourage you to think about you, the people next to you. the prejudices that do exist and that everyone of us has in one form or another. either we like to admit it or not, but it is easier to categorize people and be like "ah he's 'xyz', yeah he must be like ...". now i might be reading too much into it, but i don't believe that. i believe that oliver stone is a very intelligent filmmaker and that he was aiming for those things. and if that's something you want to explore (as a movie or within yourself), than watch this film and be excited!

i have never been a great fan of oliver stone, often because i have found his films to be forced, preachy and generally flawed. the two stone films i truly like are jfk and talk radio, yet talk radio takes the cake for being stone's finest achievement. stone is a director whereby you are either a fan or you are not, it is safe to say that before watching talk radio i was not fond of the guy and considered one of the most overrated directors in the film industry, though after watching talk radio some of my perceptions have changed. talk radio is an unsettling and amusing attack on what is now known as "reality tv".talk radio follows a self-indulgent, dysfunctional, determined, hysterical, outrageous and perplexing radio host, named barry champlain who hosts a controversial late-night radio show in dallas. quickly becoming well known for his bold and quirky air-presence he becomes a late night sensation, whereby depraved junkies, delinquents, racists, sociopaths, sickos, perverts and morons call in to be ridiculed on air. the film shows the rise and fall of the man's career, carefully making an accurate portrayal on freedom of speech. originally adapted from a stage-play, the film attaches itself to the theatre theme that it was originally built around, wonderfully conveying the film's fierce nature.with the ferocious energy and non-stereotypical air, talk radio brings all the hilarity behind "crass media". it remains even more poignant today than it was in the late '80s. the film goes into depth studying the likes of arrogance, self-obsession, offensive behaviour, controversy, hypocrisy and ignorance. the film shows through a controlled manner how it is good to have a personal opinion and freedom of speech, yet it is something that should be used wisely rather than shamefully blunt. stone tries to show how freedom of speech is a crucial importance in life, but is something that we should be wary and cautious about. the film asks the question of "is our main protagonist just the same as the sad people who call up the show?" stone fabulously creates the film's key set-piece (the radio station) with an ambition and cold atmosphere. he then succeeds in capturing the isolation, fear, ambiguity and the dangerous emotions that are built up at the radio station. eric bogosian is perfectly cast as the isolated, self-absorbed and complex genius, barry champlain. he fits the role perfectly letting off his lines with such enthusiasm, urgency, perplexity, brusqueness and ultimately the bold hilarity of his offensive nature. the performance brims with spark, which was evidently robbed of an oscar nomination. his voice suits the character, being that a primary element of a radio host and his power of acting along with tragedy and comedy works brilliantly.there is a strong use of editing in stone's films and talk radio boasts some of his cleanest, most rhythmic editing. he uses beautifully controlled camera techniques, which differ from being calm to suddenly becoming turbulent. there is a vibrant energy behind the film, with its raw and wonderfully delightful script working as a centre-piece for the greatness of the film. the striking and virtuous cinematography stands out in the moments inside and outside the studio, most impressively capturing the city at night. not forgetting the hauntingly heartbreaking and yet darkly funny climatic "spiral to decline" is ultimately remarkable cinema.talk radio is an essential modern masterpiece, i am certain you will be surprised by just how great it really is. i highly recommend talk radio for anyone interested in media or film. talk radio is a fine example of top-notch, intellectual and insightful entertainment, which still packs a well-earned wakeup call. finally, if it was not for eric bogosian the film would not be the fun, delightful and enduring masterpiece it is today.

i tend to be inclined towards movies about people who choose to cross the barriers of censorship, and express what they really want to express. eric bogosian's character of barry is like howard stern, but much more intelligent. the character itself is very fascinating. as an oliver stone film, i guess i was expecting more. the film sags a bit during the third act. plus, it's pretty obvious that "talk radio" is based on a play, with its long dialogue scenes. but overall, the film works. bogosian is great in the lead, and the fact that he also wrote the play from which the movie was based on probably helped him. if you want to check out one of stone's greater films, i better suggest you check out "jfk" or "salvador." this is not his best work, but a good movie nonetheless.

"talk radio" is my favorite oliver stone movie, though he has made many great ones including "salvador", "jfk", "natural born killers" and "platoon". but i like the intimacy of "talk radio", a cinematic expansion of eric bogosian's searing stage play that was based on a real life account of a dallas talk show host. working with ace cinematographer robert richardson, stone turns what could have been a very set-bound exercise into a visually arresting ideological battle that presents a radio station as an arena of war. bogosian is devastating as tortured on-air spouter of abuse barry champlain and conveys the conflicted, destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self-loathing. alec baldwin, as his alpha male boss, strikes the perfect note as a man driven nuts by a guy whose monstrousness he helped nurture. ellen greene is fantastic as barry's sweet ex-wife who ends up becoming another target of his vicious personal vitriol. stone and bogosian fill every frame with interest and every line of dialog with sweet poison and cutting ambiguity. john c. mcginley, as barry's long-suffering screener/technical producer stu, turns in a hilarious, sharp performance, as does the great michael wincott. the film is a flawless, underrated masterpiece of superb writing, awesome acting and brutal, uncompromising direction. the stewart copeland score is brilliant, too.

i have seen it a few times and get completely glued to it every time. it is very suspenseful and intense. to describe it sounds boring but it is amazing. it is the kind of movie where you need can't miss a thing, but if you soak it in it sticks with you long after it ends. now thinking about it i don't even know what stone was trying to make us see. just the story of alan green? i don't think so. it was a look at ignorance, stupidity, self-absorption, and a guy just loosing his grip. maybe he had more grip than the listeners though. i didn't like barry but still seemed worried about him for some reason. i was perplexed at why i couldn't get him out of my mind when the movie ended. i wish i could see inside olive stone's mind for this one.

***spoilers*** for some strange reason oliver stone's "talk radio" based on the stephen singular book "talked to death" and the films star eric bogosian's play, about the 1984 murder of denver talk show host alan berg, has never gotten the recognition that it so rightfully deserved. the 1988 movie was prophetic enough to recognize the underground movement that was developing in the farm and hinterland of america. a movement that spawned, some seven years later, the likes of an angry and disgruntled gulf war veteran timothy mcveigh who's hatred for the us governments actions in wacco texas lead to his and friend,terry nichols, detonation of the us federal building in oklahoma city on april 19, 1995 that took the lives of 168 people, the worst act of terrorism on us soil up to that time. the movie is, as far as i know, the first time that any major branch of the entertainment media mentioned and elaborated on the rural militia novel "the turner diaries" by the late william l. pierce, that has since become a chilling underground classic. "the turner diaries" forecast a domestic and utterly disastrous terrorist attack, like the oklahoma city bombing, on a us government federal facility which was the fbi building in washington d.c. dallas radio station kgab talk show host barry champlain, eric bogosian, is the top rated show in the dallas listening area and is now about to go national. barry get's his high rating by his razor sharp wit and abusive behavior when he's on the air. taking on all comers and ducking no issues, no matter how unpopular or taboo they are, has gotten barry to be the most listened to as well as hated man on radio. barry being a showman at heart and not thinking that his talk can lead to violence keeps up his abrasiveness to his call-in listeners as his rating go up to the celling. but there are those in the listening audience, mostly ultra right wing types, that don't take too kindly to his in your face attitude. one of them decides to take matters into his on hand at barry's expense. powerhouse performance by eric bogosian as the tragic barry champlain who crossed the line from entertainment to hard reality in his actions on the radio. thinking that he's not that important to be sought out and murdered for his on the air opinions which is enemies dislike he found out only too late that there are those out there who are crazy enough to do to him on the outside. also in the movie "talk radio" is a very young alic baldwin as barry's boss dan who tries to have him soften his tone but in the end goes along with his talk show style since he's killing the competition not realizing that in the end it's him that he'll end up getting killed. both ellen green and leslie hope are the two women in barry's life his ex-wife ellen and now lover and talk show producer laura whom barry uses to his advantage and almost ends up losing both of them at the same time. the 1988 film "talk radio" is so far ahead of it's time that even if you watch it now in 2005 you still think that it's too disturbing to be shown to an over sensitive and delicate american public.

set in the 1794, the second year of the french republic formed after the execution of louis xvi, this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders danton (gerard depardieu, at his finest) and robespierre (a commanding performance by the polish actor wojciech pszoniak). the moderate revolutionary danton has returned to paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the committee of public safety in the previous year by robespierre. he is opposed to "the reign of terror" which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens, mainly by guillotine, who are thought to be opposed to the revolution. danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade robespierre to curb the bloodletting. but robespierre and the committee are afraid that the popularity of danton will lead to them being overthrown, and put danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors. this was the first french language film made by andrzej wajda after he had arrived in france from poland. his polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the solidarity trade union, which had opposed the polish government in the late seventies and early eighties. his previous film "man of iron" (1981) had dealt with the solidarity union and its leader lech walesa, and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of walesa and the polish leader general jaruselski, and that between danton and robespierre. danton/walesa are the voice of reason opposed to robespierre/jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent. the film is based on the polish play "the danton affair" written by stanislawa przybyszewska in the 1930s, and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical. but what the film does is to concentrate on the behind-the-scenes meetings of the committees and the scenes in the national assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of paris.

i watched this again after having not seen it since it first came out (in '97), and it still made me laugh out loud. it's skillfully written, kevin kline and joan cusack are both perfect in their roles, and if you can look at bob newhart in this movie and not chuckle, you're more of a man than i.for that matter, i think the scenes where tom selleck kisses kevin kline, where kevin kline listens to the "how to be a man" cassette, and the post-(almost-)wedding scenes w/ joan cusack are three of the funniest scenes in any movie.sure, the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending, but...few movies are perfect.

i saw this because my cousin is an extra in one of the wedding scenes. i read somewhere that oz and rudnick wanted to poke fun at liberal message movies, but the climax ends up being right out of one of those movies. also, some of the humor is a bit on the cloying side, joan cusack was too over-the-top for me, and someone has a strange timeline re the oscars. still, there were more than enough funny moments, like the kiss scene, the wedding that isn't, and the scene with the principal, to enjoy this. kline as always is good, but for me, the real surprise was selleck, whom i'm not a big fan of, but pokes fun at himself nicely here.

in & out was a funny comedy with good performances by joan cusack, tom selleck, matt dillon, and kevin kline. the thought of kevin kline being gay was very funny. if i was him, i would hate to say i'm gay at his own wedding with his family, friends, and his going to be wife there. very seldom would that ever happen. i also loved when he was dancing around when the voice on the radio was talking to him. i'd say that in & out was a silly comedy with a lot of laughs and giggles. this is a recommended comedy and kevin kline had a great performance as a gay guy. trust me you'll like this movie.7/10

in & out is a comedy with a simple premise. it admirably succeeds in the mission of being funny and entertaining.the comedy in this film ranges from the ridiculous to the sublime, physical comedy exists alongside dry humor, with a nice veteran turn by bob newhart. kevin kline is predictably in excellent form in this film, alongside tom selleck not playing to his expected "square jawed" leading man type. mr. selleck plays his humor well and displays a nice sense of comedic timing. the cast makes this film successful.not all films with homosexual themes are made to advance some sort of sinister, hidden hollywood liberal agenda, in point of fact this film was simply made to entertain, and if any part of this films makes the viewer think, then it was a byproduct of the well-acted work by a terrific cast of professionals. frequently tongue-in-cheek, i found myself laughing at the right moments. a solid "b."

howard brackett (kevin kline) is a teacher who is about to get married. then, one of his former students wins an oscar for a film in which he plays a gay soldier and thanks howard in his acceptance speech, outing him as being gay too! this film follows the aftermath as reporters descend on howard's village and he tries to convince everyone that he is straight.i love this movie! kevin kline is wonderful, it has some really hilarious moments and it always leaves me feeling great with an enormous grin on my face. consequently, it's one film that i enjoy watching as often as possible. if you haven't seen it, you're missing out!

some movies want to make us think, some want to excite us, some want to exhilarate us. but sometimes, a movie wants only to make us laugh, and "in & out" certainly succeeds in this department.indiana high-school teacher howard brackett (kevin kline) is going to be married to fellow teacher emily montgomery (joan cusack) in three days, but the whole town is more excited about the oscar nomination of former resident cameron drake (matt dillon). but when cameron wins an oscar for playing a gay soldier, he thanks his gay teacher, howard, for inspiration. what follows is howard denying it in an hilarious set of mishaps in a truly screwball fashion.kevin kline is great, exuding gay stereotypes. joan cusack really has a knack for screwball antics. debbie reynolds is utterly hilarious as howard's mother. and bob newhart is also a hoot as the homophobic principal.gay screenwriter paul rudnick really achieves a delicate balance here. he knows the stereotypes and exploits them in a way that's mostly tolerable to conservative midwesterners and yet mostly inoffensive to the gay audience. it's not exactly progressive, but it's funny and inoffensive, and definitely a step up from the previous year's "the birdcage."

i guess if they are not brother this film will became very common. how long were they can keep this ? if we were part,what should they do?so natural feelings,so plain and barren words.but i almost cried last night blood relationship brotherhood love knot film.in another word,the elder brother is very cute.if they are not brothers,they won't have so many forbidden factors，from the family、society、friends、even hearts of their own at the very beginning.the elder brother is doubtful of whether he is coming out or not at the beginning .maybe the little brother being so long time with his brother and even can't got any praise from his father，this made him very upset and even sad,maybe this is a key blasting fuse let him feel there were no one in the world loving him except his beloved brother. and i want to say ,this is a so human-natural feeling ,there is nothing to be shamed,you may fell in love your mother、brother、sister.just a frail heart looking for backbone to rely on

first and foremost i would like to say, that before i watched this film i considered myself an accepting individual. someone that cared about others, appreciated others, found no/barely any judgment against other people, and this film has (i think) changed my life or viewpoint dramatically. when i watched it, i didn't know particularly what it was about, i knew it was about some type of forbidden relationship, but other then that i was clueless, and as i began to see what was taking place between these two wonderfully depicted characters, i was in shock, disbelief, confusion and surprise. the first time i watched it, i was blind. blind to their love, to their intimacy, to their connection, to their pureness as human beings, to their relationship. i watched it a second time, because i finally figured out how hypocritical i was being, saying to myself and others, "oh i accept all types of people, and try not to judge them" while still judging this wonderful and amazingly insightful story, because of my fear i suppose. the second time i watched this film, i opened those eyes of mine that had stayed closed the first time, and really looked, not at the type of taboo relationship part that i'd heard about all my life, but simply at two human beings in love. and i loved it, i loved the storyline, i loved the slightly broken yet strong individual people in the film, i loved the sharing of feelings, and i loved the strong bonds created. it is a really eye opening, beautifully done film that made me cry at times, and i hope that people who read this and are going to watch the film eventually, remember that everyone deserves love, no matter what shape or form it is presented in....

i've just seen this movie, and it made me cry. it's a beautiful drama about two brothers falling in love, and i think it's a good idea, especially for the closed-minded, to watch this one. i have come to love the short-film genre after just having seen a couple, because they have to make an impression on you so fast, and i have to say that this one definitely sat it's mark. it described some things, that i haven't ever really thought about that way, incest for one.i have to admit that i did not care too much for the ending. just once i would like to watch a gay-themed movie without wanting to kill myself after wards. they seem to pretty much always end in tragedy. it was 'cute' though, how that they had to be together, even if it was in death.i gave it eight stars, and i recommend it too everyone, cause i think it gives an 'inside-look' in the world, that this movie make you enter.thanks for listening, enjoy.

i've watched many short films in my day. often i find them either too compressed (throwing too much information at the viewer in the short amount of time they have to run), too "artsy", or lacking a clear-cut vision. i can say none of these things about starcrossed. in this review, i'll do my best to avoid any dramatic spoilers, but i'll also assume that the reader understands that the theme of this film is brotherly incest.as with any short film, the story is fairly simple, straightforward and easy to digest. it's clear that the film attempts to shine a light one one of modern society's most deeply held taboos. this film succeeds in every respect. in the fifteen minutes of running time, i found myself feeling a gamut of emotions. with only a little dialog, the viewer is rapidly pulled into the most personal moments and thoughts of these star-crossed brothers.from the opening scene set in their early childhood, one can see the very close relationship the brothers have. when the film progresses to the present day in the next scene, the excellent acting and honest, heartfelt performances remind the viewer that love can come in the most unexpected and harsh way. as the relationship progresses, any disgust the viewer may initially feel is quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional distress as the viewer suddenly realizes that there can be only one possible resolution. and the aftermath of that resolution is heart-rending.anyone with an open mind would do well to watch this film and absorb its message. if nothing else, it boldly and honestly challenges the viewer to reexamine some of our deepest beliefs on the shame-filled and secretive taboo of incest. though the film is only fifteen minutes long, it resonates in the viewer long after the credits roll. this is perhaps my favorite short film i've ever seen. i can't recommend it highly enough.

i just watched this short at the planetout movies. starcrossed was a very sweet, sad, little movie about two brothers that are in love. there is some great, subtle acting from both the male leads. often times movies with this subject matter seem to get too caught up in the controversy and shock value of the plot that they forget that there is an actual story. luckily writer director james burkhammer does not do this, and instead lets the story play out with honesty. the sequences of the two boys first falling in love are very sweet.

i had the pleasure of seeing this short film at the miami film festival this past saturday and let me just say i was astounded. it was the only film out of the whole program that i loved. it is beautifully shot, composed, edited, acted and written. after the screening i saw the director at a party and asked him what he was doing next. he said that he was working on finding financing for the feature version of the short. he described some scenes to me. it sounded like the kind of first film that launches the greats into the industry. if you ever get a chance to see this short i highly recommend taking it. hats off to star crossed.

i just saw "eagle´s wing". i do not really know why this movie was made. what is the message of this story? nevertheless i liked it. there are some exciting scenes in it. i appreciate a strong performance by martin sheen. harvey keitel is less convincing.

the mere presence of sam waterston as an indian, is enough to put this movie in the must-see category. he is both beautiful and very subtle, with no lines whatsoever. he is tender with his kidnappee, and yet we can see he is among the proudest of all young indian men. martin sheen is just a dumb cluck who decides to challenge waterston (white bull) for a gorgeous white horse. other sub-plots are really unnecessary. i don't understand the part played by caroline langrishe, as the poor girl who white bull kidnaps...i don't know how she keeps her hands off this beautiful indian man! it's a lot of fun, though; especially if you're a waterston fan. man, he looks good in this one!!! harvey keitel's role isn't even worth mentioning, to tell the truth! but, rent it and enjoy! actually, i do believe that if the music score was better, it would've been a more dramatic film...the music is so bad, it's distracting. still - there's mr. waterston!

i have just read what i believe to be an analysis of this film by a lyrical irishman. lovely to read.however, a concise analysis of this film is that it is a interweaving of the seven deadly sins with the four types of justice.envy, greed, pride, sloth, anger, etc. and justice in the forms of retributive, distributive, blind, and divine.i could demonstrate three examples of each, one for each of the three protagonists; however, it is much more fun to note them for oneself.this is an excellent film.don't miss it.

"eagle's wing" is a pleasant surprise of a movie, & keeps the viewer interested. i didn't know anything about it being made by the british until i read the other viewer comments. i can understand why it won an award for cinematography, for it was brilliantly presented & must have looked magnificent on a vast theatre screen.it seemed to be a lot more realistic than most westerns, in portraying how the west was more truly won. as well as the complexities of the characters it presents. the indian-sam waterson character is particularly intriguing. he seems to be brutal in the savage environment he is conditioned to, but displays remarkable respect for the frailties he witnesses in the white men & women he encounters. he is not friendly or sensitive to these intruders in his lands, but he has a limit to his sense of vengeance, even a compassion when he is in a position of power & observing the wilting white man bent on revenge, as well as the girl he kidnaps after capturing a stagecoach. as such, his character seems complex but congruous to the harsh lands he lived in & which were threatened by these intruders he is not heartless in his dealings with.the magnificent horse he rides is a critical link & it is interesting to note how this indian handles it, compared with the martin sheen-character who has it in his possession & power for a time. "eagle's wing" is an unusual western, a genre i am not drawn to, but i really appreciated this excellent offering, which i would rate second only to "a man called horse".

8 points for take on probably what really kinda maybe more what it was like back then. american indians probably stole more than killed. who really knows? nice slower odd pursuit means it has a pace and... interesting and unique. thankfully not another mindless shoot em up. i thought this would suck at first, i wound up getting wrapped up... nice treasure... good job! i have hopes nobody dissects this film. when the entire movie unfolds you have many unique twists, impossible to determine what will be next. the characters are human and have either honor or not... passion or not... forgiveness or not. wound up loving the white horse, the indian, sheen even the damned desert. all good.

on first viewing this movie seems to be some kind of fairy tale about a beautiful and significantly white horse once seen never forgotten. however viewed strictly within the context of the story the implication is that to survive in the immediate post-civil war america, one had to have a horse, and not any old horse but a truly great one. and eagle's wing is such a horse. but for a man to be worthy of such a horse is another matter. who should own it? the native american or the awol soldier? the story throughout pits primitivism against civilisation. as has been said by other commentators it is ironic that it took an english director to perceive this fact, and then develop this simple theme into a western like no other you're ever likely to see again. the film is basically about this beast and the savage harshness of the environment and the people who scrape a living from it. the photography and the soundtrack are exquisite. martin sheen's performance is a revelation. this film, released in the same year as sheen's other great performance as willard in 'apocalypse now', hints at his abilities which somehow were never given such a free rein again. more's the pity. a comparison of the two stories throws up the surprising similarities between them - not least that both films chart a man's journey into his soul in order to find redemption. whereas willard is redeemed i will leave it to the viewer to decide if pike is eventually. the ending is fabulous in the true sense of the word, and very moving; be warned. altogether this is an extraordinary film.

an unusual, revisionist western, well worth watching. despite a slow start, the film builds  with scarcely any dialogue and no subtitles  an increasingly involving and intense, almost existential portrait of life in the harsh environment of the western desert. the growth of the lead characters is worth waiting for, and the strong central cast bring a real sense of desperation to the struggle for ownership of the all-important horse. how interesting that this was made by a british director. i hope he's smiling now: i get the impression the film was largely ignored by contemporaries; but time works its usual alchemy, and hidden gold shines out as it inevitably must. one note jarred for me: the revisionism is only carried so far. sam waterston as an indian? - granted he plays his part with real emotion and intensity, but really, couldn't one american indian actor be found to do the job? but his scenes with caroline langrishe have an intimacy which contrasts nicely with the immense landscape around them.forget big, bankrupt hollywood versions of the past, men with big chins and swirling music; this one is all about a primeval struggle between protagonists who, stripped of all the trappings of 'ordinary' life, come to understand what is worth fighting for. impressive.

there must have been some interesting conversations on the set of eagle's wing, with martin sheen straight off apocalypse now co-starred with the actor he replaced on coppola's film, harvey keitel. a real unloved child of a movie, dating back to the last major batch of westerns in 1979-80, it was much reviled at the time for being made by a british studio and director (conveniently ignoring the fact that many of the classic american westerns were directed by european émigrés), which seems a bit of an over-reaction.the plot is simplicity itself, as martin sheen's inexperienced trapper finds himself fighting with sam waterston's nonosyllabic kiowa warrior over the possession of a beautiful white horse, the eagle's wing, across a harsh and primitive landscape in a time "before the legends began." aside from caroline langrishe's captive irish governess, the supporting cast have little to do (stephane audran never even gets to open her mouth) and it is a little slow, but anthony harvey's film does boast terrific scope photography from billy williams and a good score from marc wilkinson.

this splicing of the searchers is one of the weirdest films i've ever seen, filmed by a briton in a strange, unfamiliar mexico. it's often said that the best films about america are made by foreigners, who can approach the familiar with an outsider's eye. but this crackpot film is something else. though set ostensibly in post-civil war america, this isn't an america recognisable from myth, cinema, tv etc. the film has an air of timeless fable about it, while dealing specifically with western mythology.director harvey uses the title horse as a focus for interconnecting stories, all dealing with the traditional western clash of the primitive and civilisation. the former seems to have the upper hand. the vast scrub and desert of the film's landscape is unbroken, ripe for allegories of the mind. the only brief sites of civilisation are a stagecoach of missionaries and landowners, and their hacienda, from both of which derive behaviour that is anything but civilised.the basic story intercuts three stories. in one, an aimless deserter, pike, having lost his trading partner, steals a miraculous horse, eagle's wing, so-called because of its grace and speed. in the second, an indian, white bull, owner of this horse, waylays a stagecoach, and kidnaps one of its female occupants. in the third, the spanish men sent to find her ignore this quest in favour of a murderous, plundering spree.although a revisionist western, the treatment of the indian is problematic. unlike pike, his character is never explained, forever inscrutable, denied a voice, except for an excruciating snatch of song. when he's not a strange other, he's a symbol, whose role isn't entirely worked out - at one point a savage brute, at another he epitomises nature and freedom.but pike notes at the beginning that the film will attend to the period of primitivism before civilisation. in many ways the film resembles 2001 - a space odyssey, especially its opening sequence. part of the film's power lies in the connections made between the three disparate characters, forcing us to view the mythic struggles and quests in a different light. indian culture and catholicism is linked by superstition, ritual, greed and murder. both pike and white bull are musical and alcoholic. white bull is demonised by both pike and the abductee as a 'bastard', unwittingly revealing the tactic of illegitimacy used by colonising whites who infantilised the natives, becoming themselves 'necessary' fathers.unlike a traditional western, concerned with making history, civilisation, and progress, this film is a double detective story, interrogating the past, tracks, remains.what gives this film its remarkable uniqueness, i think, is, despite maltin's racism, its britishness. the climactic stand-off is more like an arthurian joust. the film itself bravely eschews dialogue for the most part, creating the kind of visual and aural tapestry malick missed in the thin red line, and something few hollywood directors would have dared. the existential doubling and quest motifs are more european myth than american (resembling another british harvey keitel movie, the duellists).most astonishing is the use of nature. most westerns use landscape as an awe-inspiring backdrop: there is little sense of actually living in the west. in many ways, eagle's wing is like a powell and pressberger film, with nature a powerful, pantheistic character in its own right - alive, dangerous, hostile, beautiful. there is a sublime scene reminiscent of a canterbury tale, when jewellery left as a trap by white bull in the trees is suddenly blown in the wind: there is a haunting, tingling, magical, thrilling effect more reminiscent of the arabian nights than a horse opera. heartstopping.

i enjoyed this movie okay, it just could have been so much better. i was expecting more action than what i got...which was more of a comedy than anything else. granted, it was serious in parts and it had a good fight scene here and there for the most part it was more romance and comedy with some action and no horror at all. which is hard to do with a vampire movie. a vampire hunter loses his partner and must train another, his sister is going through a difficult break up, but she is being pursued by a vampire of all things. granted, this vampire is rather nice and not into sucking blood. so that is all there is really to it except for a plot of another vampire after certain royal vampires so he can gain ultimate power. some of the problems with this movie is that its plot went here and there and the movie had a very uneven flow to it, that and it seemed to shift genres a bit much too. one minute action, the next pure comedy. however, the girls were cute, there is good action, the comedy was worthy of a chuckle or two and jackie chan makes a rather energetic appearance or two. this movie probably just needed more development in some areas such as the villain who is basically not really explored at all. so for a movie with a few good fights and a chuckle or two this is rather good...though why was it rated r? i have seen stuff we have made that is pg-13 that is a lot worse than this.

i watch a lot of vampire movies. i know vampire movies. hammer films have always been my favorites. christopher lee will always be the best dracula. vampire effect is a fun movie from the beginning to the end. the dubbing is not great, but i also like godzilla movies, so i am used to badly dubbed movies. anyway, i liked this movie very much. the sfx are great. even though jackie chans part in the movie has nothing to do with the plot and seems to be added to sell the movie, he is enjoyable in it. the fang work is excellent. the acting is not great, but this could have something to do with the bad dubbing. maybe the actual language would sound better with the movie if i could understand it. i am sure the movie gone with the wind sounds worse in another language.i own this on dvd and would not part with. i have it sitting on my bookshelf next to my hammer films dvds.

the twins effect is a vampire martial arts movie available in cantonese with english subtitles. it is a jackie chan production and he does make a special guest appearance, although it is not for those that liked shanghai noon/knights and the other recent hollywood flicks he has become known for, this film is a lot more special than that.it was originally called the vampire effect but as a very popular chinese female pop duo called the twins (charlene choi and gillian chung) took the two leading roles the title was changed to cash in on their fame.the film will appeal to three types of audience: those who love martial arts films, those who love vampire films and those who loath the rubbish films hollywood generally churns out.the premise for the film is that vampires are about and a secret society seeks to hunt them down before we all become snacks for the undead. this bloody work is carried out by some martial artists who drink a little vampire blood to give them the edge they need, well it must be thirsty work! things are going pretty much for the course until a particularly nasty european vamp finds out that he if he obtains a set of keys held by all the vampire princes then he can walk around in sunlight etc and generally eat when ever he wants to. to say anymore on the plot would spoil the enjoyment of watching the film.the twins consist of one assigned vampire slayer (chung) and the sister (choi) of another. it is the twins that really make the film; with some of the freshest and funniest acting going. the fight scenes they carry out are fast and furious and well choreographed with a mix of genuine athleticism and wire work. to add the cherry on the cake the twins are both quite lovely to watch too.the direction is crisp and the script is sharp. there are only 3 things that let this film down: the make-up for the vampires is quite poor, jackie chan seems to be in the film just for the hell of it and adds nothing to its content, and some of the slapstick comedy attempted by the male vampire hunter is quite lame. thankfully the twins save the day bringing an originality to the film normally only found in european films. the best scene for me was one of them (choi) communicating only by screaming, her ability to convey her thoughts through this medium was a comic delight.their are many other touches of originality in this film - i particularly liked the coffin complete with surround sound stereo and tv screen! and it is the films' many original touches and acting that stops this from being a tired old flop and turns it into a must see movie.

one of the best movies i ever saw - a classic "matrix" movie. for many years, i have been trying to get it on vhs or dvd - to no avail. the german movie/tv industry still prefers to let valuable cultural contributions (and this is fassbinder, after all!) rot away and collect dust in some archive rather than distribute it commercially (and make a lot of money with it if that is what stimulates them instead of the promotion of creative thinking). though, the wdr once told me if i paid dm 200.00 to check the copyright (non-reimbursable), and then dm 8 per minute of copying, plus the cost for the materials, then they will consider preparing a (single!) copy for me. some way to sell something! the same problem we have with many other tv movies or series like "so weit die füße tragen", "sonntagseltern", "kellerkinder", and others. excellent tv series - never to be heard of again. germany, wake up!update from march 2007: last year, i finally could get a dvd copy from the "mittschnittservice" of the wdr for about 50+ euro. great!

i really liked this picture, because it realistically dealt with two people in love, and one of them having a disorder. though the ending saddened me, i know that that was the best way for it to finish off. i would recommed this to everyone.

because it's late and i'm running short on vocabulary, i will describe this film as "beautiful and heartbreaking," begging the forgiveness of those who cringe at such cliches. robin tunney does an amazing job portraying a young woman in the clutches of tourette's syndrome - her character was absolutely sincere and convincing, and i will follow her career wherever it goes because of this film.

niagra niagra was certainly not the best movie i have seen. however., i cannot describe the way the movie made me feel while watching it and how i felt as it ended and also how i feel about it now. very few movies have such an effect on me. i like them or i do not. i look at niagra niagra as a work of art. we all see something in it and it may remind us of something or it may instill fear or fun etc... this movie had me in not the best mood. in fact it left me feeling empty somehow. i guess because the lives these two persons led were so empty in so many ways. they had no direction. their only direction was to have no direction. they had many problems to deal with and i guess needed to get away from what could not have been a happy life. but on the way things really only got worse. a steady decline from where it started. it was sad as it was so well acted and i guess we have all most likely seen someone in some situation that may in some way resemble the situation these folks were in. they might have had a good life if they had any idea how. but it wes clear they did not know what to do. so they kind of rambled to someplace they had heard about. no real goal. they had no idea how to have a goal. they had no idea how to overcome the life that was set before them. i felt bad but could not stop watching the movie. only good actors can make me feel so much about a movie that i would not like if just anyone played the parts. these two did a great job to the point you just did not see the acting. i am very impressed and want to buy the movie when it is available on dvd. you know. it left me feeling a little like leaving los vegas did. but again it is in a class of its own. not a great movie but well worth an hour or two on the right day. if you are a person who has problems i would not suggest you watch it. it could depress you. it depressed me and i have not the conditions these folks had. jimmyjoejetter

i tuned in to this movie because there was nothing else to watch. i was immediately sucked in by the characters.robin tunney is nothing less than spectacular in this film. her portrayal of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100% believable. really, this sort of thing is not easy to do. she pulls it off fantastically.we know early on this film is going to end tragically, but you cannot take your eyes off of it. the characters do stupid things, but unlike most hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot demands it, these people do stupid things because the are not right in the head - and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters.this is just a great example of film making imho. great writing, great acting, great directing. a film for people who think film can be more than mindless entertainment.

i have watched this movie time and time and time again - each time it makes me laugh, it makes me think, and it makes me cry. robin tuney does an incredible job of portraying marcy (and i'm kind of glad that kate winslet and that other lady turned down her part) its just one of those rolls that you know that no one else could have even compared.its a beautiful love story of these 2 very different people in crappy situations that team up together. they stand beside each other no matter what, even if it is in an odd situation and crazy ways.i'll tell you now its not for everyone - out of everyone i've shown it to i'd say the results are 50/50 - but if you like it, you'll love it and want to share it with others! 10 stars all the way!

i like movies about quirky people. "one flew over the cuckoo's nest" is maybe my all time favorite, so one can imagine i had a blast with this one. it's definitely not one to watch if you want to walk off smiling. this movie is unpredictable and intense. some scenes are downright frightening, even after multiple viewings (because this kind of stuff really can happen). it will most definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride. and after you see the ending, if you're not deeply disturbed, you really should check yourself for a pulse.the acting was phenomenal. marcy, with her rather extreme case of tourette's, shifts from quirky-cute to utterly terrifying, sometimes appearing so out-of-control that she looks like the undead. seth was great, too. the focus of the movie definitely does not fall nearly as much on him as it does on marcy, though he happens to be the one that gains the most momentum as a blossoming character.it's a classic love story with some unconventional twists, and it's also my favorite love story next to "true romance." there are two bad reviews for it up here, but one of the people who gave such a review didn't have his facts straight and admitted to not seeing the whole film, while the other was just looking for some hollywood thrills without the deep characters (and perhaps was a little thrown off by the apparent shallowness of the plot, seeing as the end goal revolves around stealing a black bobbi head from a toy store). the point is that this movie is not for those who want to see something "normal" or "lighthearted". this one is messed up and indie as can be, and won't let you go until the heavy climax.

this movie is truly worth seeing - robin tunney excels and henry thomas proves that he's one of those rarities, the child 'actor' who grows up to become a real actor. the characters are perfectly drawn, and in the wrong hands because of their depth, they could have been unconvincing - but all the actors are simply astounding. the cast of this movie has to rank up there with that of "girl, interrupted" (both movies coincidentally star the brilliant clea duvall). the score and music selections fit perfectly, and there is plenty of action to prevent the movie becoming just a character study. if you want the story, you won't find it in this review, but i will say that the climax will haunt you for a long time.

not only is this a very interesting exploration of tourette's and how we react to people in our lives, it has some of the most well-filmed views of a bleak northern winter landscape. there's nothing pretty about this film, but it stays with the viewer.

wow! i caught this on ifc recently after i watched but im a cheerleader. id never heard of this movie but the description sounded remotely interesting. i went in with low expectations and now i must say this is one of the best love stories ever in film. robin tunney does an excellent job portraying a person with tourettes. the relationship between the two and just the slightest details in the film are so acurate and believable. i usually hate "romance" and love films but this movie truly touched me. i so recommend this movie to anyone with the ability of vision.

niagara, niagara is a stunning and heartbreaking story about the two outsiders seth and marcy. robin tunney gives a fantastic performance as marcy suffering from tourette's sydrome, getting sicker and sicker as the movie progresses. this movie is not very optimistic and it's very hard emotional, but at the same time very romantic. it's hard to explain, but see it and find out for yourself. it's definitely worth it.

henry thomas, and robin tunny, are a couple of the most underrated performers in the business. it's beyond me as to why they haven't received more recognition than they have. this movie is a perfect example of how boundless their abilities are.acting out the lives of folks who could be referred to as a bit odd seems to be their speciality, and if these characters ain't odd, i'm at a loss to find anyone who is.the story is funny, romantic, dramatic, complicated, and tragic. i hated the ending, but if i hadn't, i wouldn't have loved the story as a whole. so there ya go.

there are many things to admire about this film, but the thing that got me above all others was the part of an eccentric recluse, the sort of role that hollywood loves & romanticizes but which here is absolutely convincing & unlike any character i've encounterd in film or in life. also a very convincing & disturbing depiction of tourete's syndrome

i watched this movie in 75 and this movie was a kind of open mind to me about how important is to care the natur and the wild life. when i got a dog in 83, i called him truska ( in movie..avakun's dog ) to never forget this movie. by the way, i have a copy this movie, but is in portuguese language and the quality is not so good like a dvd or a new vhs ( i recorded almost 20 years ago and in slp speedy.. so the quality is not so good..)if somebody wish a copy.. i'll try convert to dvd and i can send for you ok?ot's a great movie and i agree that is a movie to be always watched.waldemar braz - sao paulo/brazil

another "must have" film. henry brandon is a favorite! i was so surprised when i learned years ago that he was from germany because he sounds & looks so typically american! and wasn't he great in "the searchers" as chief scar??!! another of my favorites, i have it & watch it over & again. now if i could add this one to my collection, it would make my day! this is a great wildlife story & film for all ages. the scenery is so absolutely beautiful & the plight of the endangered snow leopards is told with such great emotion it will spark the interest in endangered species in anyone, especially children. if i could i would give a copy to all of my grands & great grands!

this is one of my favourite films, dating back to my childhood. set in the remote wilderness of siberia at the turn of the century, a small community is stirred when an extremely cold winter forces two tigers to come down from the mountains in search of food, preying on outlying farms. in this atmosphere we are introduced to avakum, a hermit fur trapper, who lives out in the wilds, as he comes to the village to sell his annual catch to boris, his close, and rather only, friend in the village, who runs a store. at boris' request, avakum accompanies his friend's arrogant son, ivan, on the hunt for the menacing tigers. personalities crash and tempers flare as the older, more experienced avakum criticises ivan's amateur methods, an encounter noticed also by the other members of the hunt. on the second day, the hunters sight their prey and give chase. in a thick wood, ivan wounds one of the tigers, which then attacks the hapless man. avakum, seeing ivan tangling with the enraged beast, fires, but accidently hits ivan. he kills the tiger as it flees. the other hunters arrive on the scene, suspicious.back in the village, the doctor works to save the wounded ivan. avakum attempts to leave the village, but is confronted by ivan's friends. the trapper brushes them off however, and speeds off with his dog-drawn sled. the young villagers swear after him that they'll come for him if ivan dies, which he later does, but before dying explains to his father that it was an accident. old boris, upon learning of his close friend being run out of the village, straightens out the gathering "lynch mob" and goes out after avakum, to find him and set things right. and so the main story begins.a simple film, it raises the conflict of man and civilisation versus nature, mainly avakum's struggle to survive alone out in the wilderness. the winter landscape is very well filmed. perhaps the strongest element in the film is the soundtrack by jimmie haskell. very sentimental and evocative, the main theme reminiscent of albinoni's adagio. other movements reflect russian styles, as well as a couple of folk music type tunes.unfortunately, this film is not available to buy, to my knowledge, which is rather a shame. the copy i own, recorded off tv nearly twenty years ago is slowly deteriorating. this film is a must see for those who can appreciate it, if they can find it. 8/10

i managed to obtain an original bbc broadcast of this film on video and loved it so much i had to try and locate the original video in its original box; thanks go to ebay.deleted on any format since 1990, this exceptional wildlife film is finely constructed and well acted. directed by stewart raffil (mac & me), the scenes of leaping tigers running through the alaskan wilderness is nothing short of stunning and its timeless tale of a trapper trying to survive on his own in the frozen wastes with two young tiger cubs is moving on each viewing.why no major company has picked up this movie to distribute on dvd is a big wonder; but makes it that extra special to know its also hard to locate.if you find this film by chance or eventually track it down to add to your collection, make sure never to let it vanish out of your grasp. films of this calibre, as shown, don't come often.a true masterpiece in every sense of the word, and highly worthy of its praised comments, "when the north wind blows" will sink deep into your heart as soon as you see it.

i collect films on super-8, and managed to snag a full length print of this one last week on e-bay. it looks like at least for the moment, this is the only way to see this film in a country having ntsc video. i have seen it available on region 2 dvd many times, but never region 1. i just finished watching it a few minutes ago and i am amazed by it. it's a powerful testament to freedom and finding your own place in the world. the photography and music were wonderful, and i really felt empathy for some of the characters.i kind of like the idea that i was probably the only one in the usa watching "when the north wind blows" tonight! long live avakum!!

i remember this film,it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 74/75 my dad took me my brother & sister to newbury cinema in newbury berkshire england. i recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adams actor dan haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies. if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me know.the cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away, would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it.

this film is one of the best memories i have from childhood. having always loved tigers my mum took me to see it. it is absolutely amazing. its is one of those films that leaves a lasting impression on you. the image of tigers running through the snow with it all spraying around is still in my head some 25 yrs on, not many films have managed that, as other comments have said photography is stunning. a must see. i have also been looking for the film for some time with no luck at all. :-(. checking amazon every now and then reveals nothing, not even listed. if anyone does know of a source, please contact me or post here. tim

a fantastic movie, and very overlooked. gary has never been more handsome, and ingrid is more beautiful than in any other film. if you don't believe, just watch the movie. every cast member is wonderful; the love scenes between gary and ingrid will make your pulse race! the story is great, the script is oscar caliber. don't miss this film!!

ingrid bergman (cleo dulaine) has never been so beautiful. gary cooper as "cleent" so perfectly cast as a laconic texan who knows this gal is up to no good. when the two lock eyes at the french market, we know this match will be full of sparks. when they stroll in her garden in her restored french quarter house and the love theme plays it is a dream for all us romantics.the costumes are lovely; the set decoration makes you wish the "quarter" was just that way. and that saratoga still had that hotel with the wide veranda with all the old biddies gossiping.from edna ferbers novel, the story is of revenge for old wrongs and the fights over who would run the railroads in the early days of that industry.in the saratoga scenes, florence bates as a grand dame steals every scene.but it is the scene of cleo taking on the little lawyer her new orleans relatives have sent to buy her off that is a magic movie moment. after cleo has bested him in the negotiations, he looks at her with longing and says "may i say - you are very-beautiful". and cleo with a happy, wicked smile says "yes, isn't it lucky." you want to shout "yes"!!!one of my all time favorite romantic films.

this film is pretty good, it actually is like a good wine, it gets better the more you watch it. the pace is pretty slow for such a high octane topic, but the cinematography is beautiful and surreal. there is a cool blue tint that "rides" the whole film. there is also one great performance in gabriel casseus' performance of the character "midget". he is terrific. why doesn't this guy work more. if the film got better support, he probably would have.

i thought nick gomez's look at the gritty streets of new jersey, where car-jackings are at an all-time high, was both thought-provoking and entertaining. this is just as good as movies like boyz n the hood or menace ii society or above the rim. i thought the actors and the scenarios were suitable, it had a gritty realistic feel to it and was very atmospheric, whether on purpose or by raw coincidence. i liked this movie a lot, an underrated gem i found on tv and glad i caught it. go watch this movie if you get a shot. if they don't have a dvd, they should release one. well done nick gomez. imdb rating: 5.9. my rating: 9/10

wow i love this movie. this is definitely added to my list of ghetto movies.juice - starring tupac 'i don't giva f***' menace ii society - o-dawg 'i'll smoke anybody, i just don't giva f****' new jersey drive - hey they steal cars in broad daylight they obviously don't giva f***new jersey drive is the best hood movie ever. it is at the top of the list, menace ii society is second, and juice is third, clockers is really stupid.the soundtrack for new jersey drive is pwnage too mac mall & young lay - all about my fetti is heard through out the movie.lords of the underground - burn rubber, another good song, and so is ill & al scratch - don't shut down on a playerif your a fan of gta-sa you'll freaking love this movie, and the amazing soundtrack. the soundtrack is basically rap about stealing cars ^_^ sweetttt movie!

i lived in that area (hoboken and jersey city)for about ten years. this film certainly captures the feel of that time and place. the dialogue is very good, the music is right and scenarios realistic. as another poster said, it looks almost like a documentary.i like the way it humanizes these kids, who probably would have rather have been born in westchester, but fall into what kids fall into. it just so happens that area is pretty rough.they over-demonize the cops quite a bit, but that's to be expected. i'd say the acting is good all-around, too.it gives the viewer some sense of how this idiocy is caused and gets blown out-of-proportion. hopefully, the new mayor of newark is making progress.

this movie brings to mind "boys 'n the hood," "menace to society," "south central" and others of its ilk and even shares actors with some of them. the film's "us vs. the law" mentality is underscored by the all-black neighborhood vs. the nearly all-white police force. here the cops are so bad they seem like caricatures and in one scene they even ambush the boys as they drive by in a car they've just "liberated" from its owner. it's like a bushwhacking from an old western, but the contemporary setting makes it look all too real.the story centers on young jason petty and his buddies, to whom school is just an inconvenience that takes time away from their "real occupation" of boosting cars. this happens to be newark, n.j., a rust-belt city low on jobs but notoriously high on crime. in fact the problem is so severe that the cops all have "car theft" written on their backs, to show that an entire unit must be devoted to this particular crime.the boys use a "slim jim" to gleefully break into cars and go joy-riding, as if it's no big deal. they only run into real trouble when the police ambush them. the vicious, nazi-like lt. has a vendetta against the boys, seeing them not as human beings who might be worthy of redemption, but as human targets. in fact, he's a little reminiscent of that sadistic nazi officer of the warsaw ghetto, who shot down jews for pleasure in the film "schindler's list." when the boys steal a police car in retribution for the ambush, things predictably go downhill fast. they are severely beaten by the cops and jason finally ends up in prison. clearly these are "bad boys," who'd steal your car in a minute, but the film wants us to see them as anti-heroes, showing jason protecting his sister and his friend taking care of his own grandmother. the film left us wondering whose side to take and who to feel sadder for: the boys whose lives are going down the drain, the honest citizens whose cars are being stolen left and right and who could be caught in the crossfire of a shootout at any moment or the city of newark itself, the spirit of whose law is being betrayed by brutal, soul-dead cops.in spite of the over-the-top portrayal of the latter, the film offers a realistic-looking rendering of the ghetto, of the protagonists and their families and of the culture of car theft in a city where there appears to be only 2 career paths - law enforcement and crime. strangely, the entire subject of drugs is never mentioned.the filmmakers (including producer spike lee) are obviously biased against the newark police, who, we hope, are not as bad they are portrayed here. nevertheless, they've given us yet another a strong, affecting story about the inner city and black youth gone awry and sharron corley is fine as jason.

this is a very realistic movie. it's the most realistic i've seen on urban youth. the actors were great. i will look out for more films by gomez. i had never heard of the film until someone mentioned it recently. i bought it on dvd. i was impressed. i haven't seen anything come close to life as i know it in philadelphia. this comes real close - in fact, one scene where there is an accident (i won't spoil and give details), reminded me of a nearly identical situation in philadelphia. at first i thought gomez took the scene from that real-life event, but then i realized that he made the film a few years before that situation. i also agree with the point that this film didn't try to broaden its appeal by putting in hollywood crap. gomez also directed "laws of gravity" - i am eager to see it.

being from eastern pa, right on the border of northern new jersey, i still get a feeling like this was a documentary more so than a movie. i have friends from new york and new jersey and this film represents the kind of lifestyle that "still" exists today in lower income area's outside of the "big city" lifestyle. if you have not seen this movie and ever wondered what really goes on in the urban jungle, check this movie out. no really big name actors, its as if they just pulled these guys off the street and said act, which adds to the realism of the movie, the performances are fantastic none the less! see this film!

i just wanted to inform anyone who may be interested that the the movie "new jersey drive" was my personal favorite off alltime. i admire the work nick gomez and spike lee put into this masterpiece of a movie. this movie made quite an impression on me because of its realness and its appreciation of detail of life in urban new jersey. it struck a chord with me, personally, because i grew up with friends like those depicted in the movie. it further made an impression with me because i used to spend time in teaneck several years ago, so some of the characters were kept "real". at times, this movie seemed like a documentary because you didn't know whether or not these were real events taking place. although movies like "boys in the hood" and "menace ii society" grab more attention, i personally feel these movies were somewhat "enhanced" to appeal to a broader audience. "new jersey drive" was an uncompromising piece of "in your face" reality. lee and gomez covered every detail in this urban drama from the music, clothing, slang, and location.unlike some of the movies i mentioned earlier, the actors performed as if they weren't "actors". nothing was compromised in order to make good "theater". the only misfortune to come from this movie was the fact that many people "slept" on it. i look forward to more works of art from nick and spike in the hopefully near future.

i am not one to like those anime cartoons (eg.pokemon,dragonball z,naruto), but zatch bell is different in my opinion.zatch bell is more exciting, has better characters, and doesn't focus so much on a sort of weapon or mamodo as much as the episodes i've seen,such as it the episodes "big brother kanchome", "zatch vs. kiyo".zatch bell really focuses on the life of the strange zatch,the smart kiyo,the clueless suzy,and the weird ponygon.zatch bell is probably my fav cartoon for now,but i encourage others to watch 1 episode of it, you'll most likely will like it!-robbie h. (aka vectorman)

this anime recounts the tale of the battle for mamodo king. every 1,000 years, 100 mamado children are sent to earth to fight to determine who will be their next king (in the original japanese, the creatures are mamono, which literally means magic/evil object). each mamado is paired with a human partner, and given a magic spellbook. the human can use this book to unleash incredible powers in the mamodo, and when a mamodo is defeated, their spellbook is engulfed in flames (alternately, a mamdodo's book can be captured and burned directly). after that the mamodo returns to the mamodo world.the titular character is zatch (gash in japan), a 6-year old mamodo with electric powers. he is paired with kiyomaru takamini, and 14-year old genius. zatch is initially reluctant to fight, but learning that some mamodo are evil and deciding the battle for king is wrong, he decided to fight to become a 'kind king'.zatch bell has drawn comparison to pokemon, but a better comparison is to digimon. like digimon, the mamodo and human have a one to one, symbiotic relationship. also unlike pokemon, both shows have an actual plot.zatch bell features character growth and evolving relationships, and some fairly adult story lines (like love vs racism; slavery; mind control; etc.). it even has some decent plot twists and mysteries.

take a young liberal idealist christopher boyce (timothy hutton) put in a top secret classification in a government front company because of his father's position team him up with a no'count drug dealer daulton lee (sean penn) who is wanted by the police and needs a new source of income and you have a recipe for espionage. sean penn played the part of the punk drug dealer with a certain sang froid probably out of particular verisimilitude with such raunchy types. the gall penn carries with him in every situation is unique; he even suggests the soviets run drugs for him.i've seen the movie over and over again and each time i see something new. it seems to me that a major problem with us spy organizations is its inbreeding which leads to the hiring of an obviously unsuitable candidate by reason of temperament and inclination for a government front company.i do recall when the falconeer escaped from prison and led the authorities on a wild goose chase. i see that despite the escape he is now released. a pity the soviets are no longer around to accept the wretch! a cheery cherio!

the falcon and the snowman is based on a true story. christopher boyce, and andrew daulton lee, (the titular traitors,) played by timothy hutton and sean penn, received their code- names from the kgb. why? boyce was an avid falconer and lee was a coke head. the movie is based on a true story. it's based on the book of the same name. another reviewer asked what was their motivation? disillusionment it ain't. ideology it ain't. (pardon my bad grammar,) but i'm making a point here. what was it if it wasn't disillusionment or ideology? in a word, greed. by the time of the boyce-lee case, money became the great motivator and not ideology. don't believe me? then look at the walker family spy ring which was broken in the late '80s. three spies did the worst damage to our national security in the '70s and '80s. john walker, who began his career as a spy in the '60s, christopher boyce, and andrew daulton lee. all three sold out this country for thirty pieces of silver. if you aren't familiar with that phrase, i suggest you read the bible.

... sings david bovie in this movie. but it is!!! it's all about america, so don't be ashamed to watch it. just think, if you can, to prevent more damage... you know, you're just the same regular guy next door, so, be careful! one of the best critics of "common" mind and friendship. still don't care? go for it for the music - it's worth a try, just close your eyes and pat metheny and david bowie will touch you so deep you'll start to scream! and while watching, if you'll dare to open your eyes, please don't do the popcorn&stuff, you're gonna miss quite a lot. you may think that it's not worth, but, think twice - and don't look at your neighbours lawn - you never know what to find there... is it worth? try it! just don't die or gloat over it...

it has taken me about a year now after seeing this film to write about it. lord knows i have wanted to, after witnessing it i knew i saw something i hadn't seen before but wasn't sure why. now after reflecting for quite some time i know, it's these characters that even now i still can't stop thinking about.distant briefly and slowly tells the story of a relative (yusuf) who comes from the rurals to live briefly with a well off to do photographer (mahmut) in the city in hopes to find employment. however it becomes clear that after yusuf hypothesizes the idea of being a sailor and his employment prospects dim, that he's really searching for something else, some sort of purpose in his life.through all this soul searching we are taken through seasonal surroundings that are filmed exquisitely. the context in which they happen makes the scenes more powerful in 2 particular ones when a girl yusuf has been following suddenly meets up with her significant other, and the look of yusuf's face as he looks into a basket of fish and the shot and light that reflects off his tortured face. that scene in itself has to be one of the most gorgeously filmed pieces i have witness in i don't know how long.in the end mahmut has his own demons too, but ends up confronting his relative that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave, in a scene that is very simple but has the feeling of true heartbreak.what the viewer is left with is lots of reflecting and pondering for these 2 people who everyone can see a piece of themselves in. you should not be put off by the pace of this film it is truly worth every single breathtaking second.rating 10 out of 10.

people must learn to watch what is up there on the screen. this is a great film that is based on a slow, careful gathering of details which serve to establish the personalities of these two men. the passivity of yusuf (emin toprak), the country cousin, is well described by his fear of talking to women. he has at least three chances to start a conversation with a young woman and loses all of them. he has many decades of bachelorhood ahead of him, and maybe unemployment as well.mahmut is a different case. he got out of the small town by working very hard (we imagine), and his resentment of slackers like yusuf is palpable (he leaves crumbs on the expensive carpet--the slob!). we are shown a group of friends talking about tarkovsky among other things, and we note that mahmut feels regret--but only slight regret--that his work has become commercial over the years. the gulf between the cousins just gets wider and wider. the mouse trap theme is wonderfully vivid, it brings out the compassion and confusion of yusuf, and the cold-blooded problem solving of mahmut.i was reminded of two classic films of men driving each other nuts: les cousins by chabrol (the rich boy with hitlerian pretensions played by brialy is always in my mind) and kiss of the spider woman (william hurt can't figure out why everybody's so mean). nuri bilge ceylan takes his place among the dozen important directors now active. i just hope that in future he will come to rely on collaborators, instead of directing, writing and shooting his films himself.

uzak (2002), a turkish film shown in the u.s. as "distant,"was directed, produced, written, and filmed by nuri bilgeceylan.this movie is a gritty and somber version of the clash between a "city mouse," mahmut, played by muzaffer özdemir, and a "country mouse," yusuf, played by emin toprak. both men are superb actors, and the plot allows them to demonstrate their acting skill. (tragically, emin toprak died in an automobile accident shortly after the movie was completed.)in most country cousin/city cousin tales, the contrast between rural and urban life styles is portrayed in a humorous fashion. in this film, there's little humor or even warmth. both menhave lost touch with human society. mahmut 's work as acommercial photographer for a tile company gives him no satisfaction. he has divorced a woman he clearlystill loves, and has no satisfying human relationships.mahmut has lost his job because of a factory closing in his small town, and doesn't have the skills or the energy to find work in the city. his human interactions are primarily confined to silent observations of the other people who cross his path. he's clearly a warm and caring person, but can't express these qualities in an urban environment.the cousins don't relate well to the world, and they don't relate well to each other. neither makes an effort to act in a way that would provide an opportunity for bonding or closeness. in a sense, this film portrays an opportunity wasted. conceivably, each cousin could have provided at least part of what was lacking in the other's life. instead, they steer parallel unhappy courses. the two men are distant throughout, which is a situation suggested by the film's title.one of my friends mentioned the masterful way in which ceylan builds detail upon detail. these details ultimately tell us more about the characters than we might have learned by simple exposition.uzak was shown as part of the rochester labor film series. it's not a "labor film" in the traditional sense of that genre. it is a labor film because it demonstrates the harmful effects of unsatisfying work (mahmut) and unemployment (yusuf).this is a quiet, absorbing, dark film. although it doesn't make for happy viewing, i walked out of thetheater realizing that i had seen a truly creative andimportant movie. this film is worth finding and seeing!

while sleeping, mr. eko is assigned by his brother yemi (adetokumboh mccormack) in a dream to go with john locke to disclose the meaning of the "?" symbol. with the pretext of chasing henry, mr. eko brings john with him and they find a second hatch called "pearl" underground the question mark symbol marked on the field, where a video explains that the other hatch is a psychological experiment and people behavior pressing the buttons of the computer every 108 minutes are actually subjects. meanwhile, jack unsuccessfully tries to save libby.in this episode, john locke loses his faith in the island when he finds that they have been monitored in the hatch. the disgusting michael sees the anguishing libby wishing that she was dead, while hurley, jack, kate and sawyer are suffering her pain, in a deep emotional contrast. my vote is eight.title (brazil): not available

in this episode, locke and eko go searching for the "?" symbol that we saw during the lock-down on a previous episode. michael, having shot ana lucia and libby, struggles with his actions as libby inches closer to death.the most interesting thing about this episode (i think). is during the commercial break. locke and eko find a hatch under the plane that killed boone in season one, and a new training video ends with "copyright, the hanso foundation, 1989" in a following commercial break, a rather bizarre and nondescript commercial advertises "the hanso foundation" (a planted commercial), and the website advertised (www.sublymonal.com) leads the visitor through a world of information about life on the outside of lost's storyline. a must see for all fans!

the second "mr. eko" episode has somewhat less interesting flashbacks than the first ("the 23rd psalm"), but in just about every other department it is one of the best episodes of season 2, advancing the series' mythology/background as well as the characters. a new dharma initiative station - the pearl - is discovered by locke and eko, and the orientation film that they find and watch inside completes locke's transformation from a believer ("orientation" - after the end of the film: "we're gonna have to watch this again") to a doubter ("s.o.s" - "did you push that button, henry? i need to know") to a non-believer ("?" - after the end of the film: "do you want to watch this again? - "no, i've seen enough"). terry o'quinn's performance is powerful as usual ("every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button"). meanwhile, eko takes his place as the man who becomes sure that he was brought on the island as part of his true destiny, which is to continue pushing the button. other high points of "?" are a startling, unique dream sequence where person a has the dream as being person b (this is the kind of bold idea that the current season of lost could use much more of), and the haunting scene of libby's last word before her death, and the way jack and hurley cannot possibly know its true meaning. ***1/2 out of 4.

an eko-centric episode the "?" explores the aftermath of the tragic events that rocked the castaways in the previous one. as the main characters john, locke, sawyer, kate and hurley come to terms with the incident in the hatch, locke and eko set out to find out where henry took off to. as it turns out eko is on a mission of his own trying to figure out the symbol ? which locke had drawn on his sketch. we see flashes of eko's life in sydney as a priest who comes in contact with his brother through a stranger. we also witness the tragedy that struck the hatch boil down to a room temperature as michael continues to remain a mystery.an excellent lost episode with many interesting turns.

northfork is above all a masterpiece of widescreen cinematography. for this alone the film is well worth one's time. the stark, wide open plains and badlands of eastern montana are captured in the spare, muted earth tones of autumn or early spring. the gigantic grey cement fort peck dam is the film's protagonist. the film comments both subtly and not so subtly on about a dozen issues of western landscape. the dialogue can be trying at times, yet the images and concepts are powerful enough to lift the film. the 1950's period works so well here and is executed so well. i think that the passing years will be kind to this film.

i loved the movie "northfork". i knew nothing about the movie before watching it. therefore, i had no outside influence or information to guide me in what i was seeing unfold on the screen. in retrospect i would advise anyone interested in the movie to watch it if for no other reason than the quality actors who appear in it. do not read anything about the plot, story line, or evaluation of the movie. in fact stop reading anything further in my comments although i believe they are general and would not spoil the movie for you, i don't want to diminish the value of the movie to you. find your own path of meaning in this film or it is diminished in its potential.in general, i found the 3 benign strangers in northfolk puzzling. as the movie unfolds, they could qualify as three entertaining escapees from a mental hospital or, the dreams and hallucinations of a sick and feverish young boy, or three angels "sent" to find the "lost angel".the sick and perhaps dying boy works to convince the three "strangers" to abandon the search for the lost angel, become his guardians (mother & father), and take him safely far away from northfork (no less than 1000 miles). he even declares that he is the lost angel to try to manipulate them all to be his guardian. only one of the three responds to the boy on a positive basis. the other two have no real enthusiasm or passion for this involvement.the priest who is nursing the sick boy demonstrates a depth of caring for people and a deep conviction toward his faith. he transcends the desolation and emptiness of northfork and its people; he is the light of goodness and hope to both northfork and to the movie viewer.near the climax of the movie, the boy and new guardian journey over land to a field where a plane waits. they board to find the other two strangers also on the plane; in fact one is the pilot. the engines start and the plane takes off.who are the 3 strangers? if only one stranger was interested in helping the boy why were all three on the plane? where is the plane going? did the other two find the "lost angel"? is there a lost angel and if so who is it? who are the six men dressed like undertakers? if all of this is just the sick boy's feverish dreams, how did one of the 3 strangers end up reaching out to help one of the men dressed like an undertaker when he jumped and hit his head(neither the boy or strangers had contact with these men)?one or two sentences written under the title telling people what this movie is about is a tragic mistake (this is not a spoiler, it's statement about advertising only). so if you haven't seen the movie, northfork, the questions above show only a few of the interesting and fun forks in the road of thought when you view the film northfork. if you read the advertising summary of the plot of the movie before you watched it previously, maybe you ought to look at some of the questions above and watch it again... i know i will.terry

the stark, cold landscape of big sky country, with its majestic snow-capped mountains juxtaposed to barren plains, is put to poetic use here in this lynchian fable/slide picture show about death and melancholy from the young and talented polish brothers (who previously treated indie movie fans to the bizarre and fascinating "twin falls idaho"--a film about a young woman falling in love with two brothers who happen to be siamese twins). a little orphan boy is dying, and a town is about to flooded in the name of progress (in the form a damn and hydroelectric power plant). with its eerily pleasing music score, minimalist dialogue and character development, and uncanny fantasy sequences involving some very unique angels, the polish brothers put their focus on what every good film artist knows a film should be about, the moving pictures...the images, the scenes...paintings of deep beauty captured on celluloid. this is best to be viewed late at night so that the haunting imagery can linger in your mind and wash over you as you drift off into sleep. the fact that all of this was done on a shoe-string budget of less than two million dollars puts hollywood with their bloated film costs and hollow movies to shame and indicates something grand to come from the polish brothers in the future.

michael polish's hypnotic "northfork" is a film that will stay in one's memory for quite a long time. this exquisitely crafted movie that michael and mark polish wrote, is visually one of the best things that came out last year from the world of independent films. the movie is splendidly photographed by m. david mullen, with a haunting score by stuart matthewman.if you haven't seen the film, perhaps you should stop reading here.the idea to set the film in montana was a great coup for the polish brothers. never has the majestic views of the country and mountains been so vividly captured as in "northfork". we don't need any color! the beauty is in the dark tones of the film that enhances the story of the desolation in this remote outpost.at the center of the story is irwin, the sick child under the care of the mysterious father harlan. this boy is seen in his bed where the kind priest is administering the medicine for his body. but is he really there at all? we watch him interacting with the odd group that we first encounter around the cemetery. there are two freshly open graves. will one of them be for irwin? at the same time, another plot line plays parallel to this first theme. we see the six men in black that have come to the area in order to remove from the area as many people as they can. this will be the bed for the man made lake that will be created. their reward is one acre and a half of lake front property if they move a certain amount of people.the third story line centers on the mystical group composed by flower hercules, cup of tea, cod and happy. they are following a possibility of a link to an angel that has been injured in this area. when irwin meets them at the cemetery, he offers to help, only if they take him away at least a thousand miles from here. we watch as the quartet examine the feathers the boy has placed among the pages of his bible. could irwin be that angel? the closing sequence show us all parties leaving northfork in different directions. the men in black riding their automobiles, perhaps going home to enjoy the newly acquired properties given to them as a reward. the mystical group is seen boarding a plane and taking off for a higher place. we also realize that the child in father harlan, in spite of the medicines and the care he received from the saintly figure, has died.michael polish got one of the best ensemble acting from all the principals. nick nolte, as father harlan turns a low key performance in his portrayal of this kind man. james woods, as walter, one of the men working for the developer, does a fine job. the biggest surprise is duel farmer, who makes an excellent impression as irwin. this child actor, with the right guidance, shows great promise.the mystical group is brilliantly acted by daryl hannah, robin sachs, ben foster and anthony edwards, the man with the funny spectacles. peter coyote, mark polish, ben foster, and the rest of the cast are flawless under mr. polish direction.the beauty of the film relies in its simplicity. mr. polish's vision will haunt one's memory. the images of montana, as perhaps an unreal landscape is one of the best things in american films in quite a while.

the third film from the polish brothers is their best, most beautiful, imaginative film yet. though many audiences will have a problem with northfork's lack of traditional dramatic structure, "stick with it, jack!". the plot is difficult to summarize, so just know that the story includes: agents trying to evacuate a city, god in a cowboy hat, the selling of angel wings, and a sick orphan (but it all works). m. david mullen's extraordinary photography makes almost every frame exciting and wonderful to look at. the performances of the actors, working with the polish brothers' inspiringly offbeat script, are pitch-perfect and give the film its emotional punch. the strong-willed audience member will be moved by the mythology and folk tale of the story, the comic and moving actors, and finally the incredible courage and command that michael polish shows behind the camera. again all of these incredible and seemingly disjointed elements come together magnificently in one of the most incredible things you should run out and experience. a great, great, great movie!!!

it's a shame this movie is rated pg 13--it is really quite suitable for anyone--though young kids might not follow it too well.it belongs to that wonderful genre of serio-comic ghost/angel stories that would have to include everything from capra's "it's a wonderful life" to wenders's "wings of desire." the photography is stunning, the acting first rate, and--wonder of wonders--the tone is uplifting.my only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film. the two interwoven stories seem intriguingly mysterious at first; but they resolve themselves a little too nicely for my taste. as the director points out in his commentary on the dvd, all the ingredients of irwin's story are on his bedside table. the symbolism is just a trifle too pat for me.but what a lark! my favorite scene has to be when the relocation team tries to get breakfast at a diner. this is practically theatrical in its magic--a tour de force of witty acting--subtle, playful, and positively rhythmic--coupled with striking cinematography and an acute eye for the grotesque."northfork" is funny, touching, gorgeous to look at, magical (with the above reservations) and has not one single car-chase.an easy nine stars.

"it all depends on how you look at it we are either halfway to heaven or halfway to hell," says the priest rev. harlan in "northfork." the polish brothers' film is an ambitious one that will make any intelligent viewer to sit up, provided he or she has patience and basic knowledge of christianity. the layers of entertainment the film provide takes a viewer beyond the surreal and absurd imagery that is obvious to a less obvious socio-political and theological commentary that ought to provoke a laid-back american to reflect on current social values. the film's adoption of the surreal (coffins that emerge from the depths of man-made lakes to float and disturb the living, homesteaders who nearly "crucify" their feet to wooden floor of their homes, angels who need multiple glasses to read, etc.) and absurd images (of half animals, half toys that are alive, of door bells that make most delicate of musical outputs of a harp, a blind angel who keeps writing unreadable tracts, etc.) could make a viewer unfamiliar with the surreal and absurdist traditions in literature and the arts to wonder what the movie is un-spooling as entertainment. though european cinema has better credentials in this field, hollywood has indeed made such films in the past in "cat ballou", lee marvin and his horse leaned against the wall to take a nap, several decades ago. "northfork," in one scene of the citizens leaving the town in cars, seemed to pay homage to the row of cars in "citizen kane" taking kane and his wife out of xanadu for a picnic.the film is difficult for the uninitiated or the impatient film-goerthe most interesting epilogue (one of the finest i can recall) can be heard as a voice over towards the end of the credits. the directors seem to leave the finest moments to those who can stay with film to the end. if you have the patience you will savor the layers of the filmif you gulp or swallow what the polish bothers dish out, you will miss out on its many flavors.what is the film all about? at the most obvious layer, a town is being vacated to make way for a dam and hydroelectric-project. even cemeteries are being dug up so that the mortal remains of the dead can be moved to higher burial grounds. real estate promoters are hawking the lakeside properties to 6 people who can evict the townsfolk. of the 6, only one seems to have a conscience and therefore is able to order chicken broth soup, while others cannot get anything served to them.at the next layer, you have christianity and its interaction on the townsfolk. most are devout christians, but in many lurk the instinct to survive at the expense of true christian principles, exemplified in the priest. many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions.at the next layer, you have the world of angels interacting with near angelic humans and with each other. you realize that the world of the unknown angel who keeps a comic book on hercules and dreams of a mother, finds one in an androgynous angel called "flower hercules." while the filmmaker does give clues that flower is an extension of the young angel's delirious imagination, subsequent actions of flower belie this option. you are indeed in the world of angels--not gods but the pure in spiritand therefore not in the world of the living. the softer focus of the camera is in evidence in these shots.at another layer the toy plane of irwin becomes a real plane carrying him and his angels to heaven 1000 miles away from norfolk.the final layer is the social commentary"the country is divided into two types of people. fords people and chevy people." is there a difference? they think they are different but both are consumerist.to the religious, the film says "pray and you shall receive" (words of fr harlan, quoted by angel flower hercules). to the consumerist, the film says "its what we do with our wings that separate us" (each of the 6 evictors also have wings-one duck/goose feather tucked into their hat bands but their actions are different often far from angelic as suggested by the different reactions to a scratch on a car).the film is certainly not the finest american film but it is definitely a notable path-breaking work--superb visuals, striking performances (especially nick nolte), and a loaded script offering several levels of entertainment for mature audiences.

a dreamy, stunningly atmospheric film takes place in a small town of northfork, montana in 1955. the government officials arrive to evacuate the town about to be inundated by a new hydroelctrical dam. there are the other visitors in the town, the angels from another time but they only seen by a dying boy irvin. a local priest (nick nolte in a quiet heartbreaking performance) takes care of the boy. irvin pleads with the angels to leave the place with them...there is some unearthly quality in the film, some dignified mourning and sublime sadness when you suddenly realize the inevitable finality of everything - humans and their relationships, cities, countries, civilizations, the whole world as we know it. death and birth have something in common - we go through them in the ultimate loneliness. i cannot recall the film that affected me in the same way and as deeply as "northfork" did, the film so beautiful and so tender, so quiet and so powerful, so heartbreaking and so moving. even now, after several weeks since i saw it, tears come to my eyes when i only think of it.after i saw it, i had to talk to somebody about it. i sent a pm to one of my friends and i asked, "please tell me what i just saw?" and my friend replied with the words, "you just saw one of the greatest films of modern times. one of these days others will see the light."

when northfork debuted at the cannes film festival, many people didn't like it because they felt it was boring and too slow. while i agree that it was slow (one of the slowest movies of the year), in no way was it boring. as roger ebert said, `there has never been a movie like northfork.' i usually don't agree with ebert, but for once he speaks the truth. although john sayles' sunshine state may have some of the same immediate themes, nothing that i have ever seen or known of can even compare to the striking originality of the polish brothers' northfork.northfork is a perfect example of how many times it's better to trek an extra few minutes to go to an art-house film instead of the latest jack black movie. the plot isn't some hackneyed, cookie-cutter plot; it's just so strikingly original. a small town in montana named northfork has a dam nearby that is about to be taken down. therefore, the entire town must be evacuated. some people, however, just don't want to leave. in a side plot, a young orphan (duel farnes) is very sick and bedridden; he's being taken care of by father harlan (nick nolte). the boy imagines himself as a fallen angel, so to speak, who help him out through his time of sickness.although much of the movie is straightforward, some of it could give david lynch a run for his money. there's odd weather patterns, a weird, wooden, huge dog thing, and symbolism that would make fellini proud. it's not as overall confusing as a lynch film, but it's still quite odd. that's what makes northfork so great: it's so out of the ordinary and yet so simple and plausible.northfork has a magical feel to it: it's almost like you're watching something you're not quite sure what it is but you feel entranced by it. as i said earlier, i agreed with ebert on how this movie is unlike any other. however, i disagree when he says that it is `not entertaining'. he goes on to say it's just `enthralling.' perhaps he just thought he should give it good reviews because everyone else is, but in lieu of how slow it was, i still thought it was very entertaining, something many dramas now can't do.northfork may not be the quickest movie or the most popular movie, but if you can get to and through it, you'll be extremely surprised, as i was.my rating: 8/10rated pg-13 for brief sexuality.

the polish brothers are unique film artists, and they've really pushed the envelope here. a fantasy that has points in common with "wings of desire," "northfork" tells the story of a '50s era small town in the middle of nowhere that is two days shy of being inundated and submerged thanks to the u.s. government's desire to make a reservoir on the place where the town stands. it's a wry parable about loss and remembrance, featuring angels, dreams, premonitions, and the most hilarious government reclamation functionaries since "repo man." the performances are all outstanding, especially nolte and woods. i've noticed in reading down some of the comments that there are people who were offended simply by the fact that the polish twins use elliptical storytelling tactics, and i want to say, that's one of the things that makes this film so great: its willingness to embrace the mysterious as an aspect of everyday life. david mullen's cinematography is stunning. highly recommended; if you've suffered a meaningful personal loss, such as the death of a parent, i would even call this film necessary viewing. - ray

it's pretty evident that many of your nights were spent alone. if you watched 5 minutes of the actual show instead of watching the commercial you would have seen one of the greatest television shows in canadian history being made. too bad you would have been watching it alone. probably the reason you hate it... no game. keys to the vip is hilarious, light and funny. guys are going to eat this show up. my game is tight and i can hardly wait to get on this show. the chicks were hooooot and the clubs kicked ass. i'll be watching every week. it makes me wonder why more great shows like this one aren't being made. now it's clear that the talent in canada has the ability to produce american quality television.

don't mind what this socially retarded person above says, this show is hilarious. it shows how a lot of single men are in a bar atmosphere, and also shows that women are not as gullible as men think they are. the contest aspect of the how is really cool and original. its not the standard reality show that we are all used to now a days.give it a chance everyone, we are only one episode in, we finally have some canadian programming that isn't absolute crap. as canadians what do we normally get, bon cop, bad cop, or corner gas. come on people show that we are all not as prudish as the previous reviewer.way to go comedy network, giving a new show a chance. the panel is funny and the contestants so far are pretty good.

keys to the vip, an original series by the canadian comedy network (comedynetwork.ca) scored big with this entertaining, yet inspirational gameshow. this show is hosted by four funny, good-looking guys who judge others on their 'game' (ability to pick up women). each episode features two guys who go head-to-head in various pick-up games. there are three different sections and the winner scores a night as a vip in an exclusive toronto night-club.being a guy, i naturally find this show hilarious. we all know that it's hard to confront women and watching these guys do it naturally sparks the curiosity of men. the guys who compete on this show might even give you a few pointers -- if you pay attention.

i don't know what the last reviewer is talking about but this show is pure entertainment. basically 2 dudes are put in competitions at a club to pick up girls in 3 different scenarios. they mix up the scenarios for each show so it is not the same every time. the panel of 4 judges is not afraid to call people out or admit it when they recognize game. they will break down what the guy did wrong, and what they guy did right. some contestants are weak, some are strong but what happens is always entertaining. if you are a guy that goes out, you can relate. i've seen weak game, i've seen strong game, and this show is for real. no doubt.

for all losers who gave it negative review,its because you probably have sex once in 2 years,or you are in ltr with one girl for years. and guess what ? she is going to cheat on you when player like those on that show approach her somewhere.off course any male who is not as good as these guys are going to hate them and hate the show. and that one chick who thinks this show is meant to mock these guys.. its more actually how to show clueless man how to pick up woman.what these guys are doing it way better then what most man are doing-not approaching at all.for anybody who has open mind i recommend to read the book "the game" by neil strauss.it deals with similar theme as this show

i think it is a brilliant show with cool talking heads and very cool action. 2 guys who pretend to be masters in women seduction demonstrate their skills at different night clubs and 4 experts (pickup artists themselves) comment on them, choosing the winner. their jokes are amusing, and some participators are really fun to watch. more so, this show really teaches men how to get in touch with women, lots of expert's comments are useful while you may see how it works in the field. actually i think this is one of the best tv shows and i totally recommend this to all men, who like women.ps/ pardon for my broken engrish.

this has to be one of the most beautifully morbid films i have ever seen. merhige has created a living painting that unfolds with horrific violence, sex, and a minimalist retelling of the life of jesus christ. the high contrast and thick layer of grain make you question yourself as to what you are really seeing at times, but the use of texture, combined with the extreme contrast, create an incredible viewing experience. this film is not for everyone. i think you have to keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this film for its content, which if extremely rough, but does make a fairly important statement about creation, god and humanity. whether this film is a work of art, or shock value trash is open to discussion.

if you are dating a girl that is into wicca!many parts of this movie were killer and the feeling you get from this movie while watching it and immediately after is enough alone to sit through it all but some things really bothered me about this film that i cant really put my finger on...i definitely think that this movie is one that any art student or photography student should see b/c of the camera style and graininess that ive never seen but that is just it...it looks like an art student made it and the plot if there is any is so jumpy that you really need to be on a lot of drugs to get just what is going on

thank god for the internet movie database!!! when i first got this movie i watched it every night just before before bed and was getting something different out of it every time. but no matter how i sliced it, it came up disturbing. the black and white and all the twitching really freaked me. you stare at the screen unsure of what you are looking at, and just when you think you got it, it becomes clear and it's something completely different. the imagery is very disturbing, twitching and straight razors do not sit well with me in any movie. still everytime i watched it, i was interpreting it somewhat differently (there is no dialogue, ya know), so i decided to check the imdb for the plot summary. boy that throws me for a loop, i had no idea that was supposed to be god. now i'm going to watch it with this in mind and see what happens....

begotten is black and white distorted images. it looks like it could have come from the nineteenth century. however, the sound is crystal clear, minus the sync and the addition of calm nature sounds.this movie was very critical of the struggles of life. it shows a single mother and child in a violent world that thrives on the innocent. the mother is very oblivious to her surroundings. this leads to lots of torture, pain, and death. you may watch it many times and see different symbolisms, plot devices, and basically "what does it mean?".if you appreciate art in movies then you will love it. otherwise, don't bother.

begotten is one of the most unique films i've ever seen. it is more, to me, a study of sound, light and dark, and movement than a real story. the type of thing you see as a video instillation at the museum of modern art than a film enjoyed at the local theater. i'm not going to try to interpret the images of the mother nature, the beasts in cloaks, the twisted and tortured body of her "child". some things just defy interpretation.

i loved it, it was really gruesome and disgusting. i thought that the tearing of the human flesh was thoroughly provacative. the way that it was depicting the human crucifix about jesus christ was really interesting. the tearing about limbs and jaws was awesome brutally gruesome. don't watch this if you have a weak heart, you wouldn't be able to stand it.

anyone who correctly identifies the opening images as god killing himself without reading the end credits certainly deserves a free ticket to a rest home in transylvania. i would imagine this as being a favorite movie at "twin peaks" dark lodge on movie night if time existed there. i would think that a better title might have been, "how much fun can you have with someone who's almost dead in the forest with only neolithic technology?" the answer, it would seem, is quite a bit. so, despite the silly "god killing himself," the uber-pretentiousness (an apt phrase taken from a previous letter), the more clearly "alistair crowley - hi, i'm the beast, deal with it!" than christian cosmology (i can't believe another viewer had the thick-headedness to see the judeo-christian bible in this)... despite all of that... this is a daring, important work that most people should not see. i am both impressed and creeped out that it was made at all.

first of all, this is an art film and a good one at that. i loved the presentation and way it was shot. very cool. certain scenes were some of the more graphic horror sequences i've ever seen. this film did scare me, not because of suspense or shock, but because i was deathly afraid that i'd soon see something really appalling. that did happen in a few places, but mostly at the beginning. this film also dragged and the 74 minutes seemed long. however, if you're into film you have to see this. to date, i've seen nothing like it. 8/10

not really sure what to make of this movie. very weird, very artsy. not the kind of movie you watch because it has a compelling plot or characters. more like the kind of movie that you can't stop watching because of the horrifically fascinating things happening on screen. although, the first time my wife watched this she couldn't make it all the way through... too disturbing for her. runs a bit long, but nonetheless a worthwhile viewing for those interested in very dark movies.

i absolutely like this film a lot. it is not very entertaining, but it's a feast of bizarre and stunning images! there's no dialog ,only some background sounds and noises. if you are into something completely different and original, and enjoy the obscure and bizarre...then you might like this work of art. ik looks like a film made with the very first camera ever made ,in a time where strange human-like beings live and perform their bizarre habits. god has killed himself with a razor and gave birth to mother earth. mother earth impregnated herself with god's semen after an act of fellatio, and gives birth to a son "flesh on bone". what follows are inhuman acts of ritualistic torture, rape and murder for purposes we do not know....or do we?

this kind of angst can only be inside a young person who seeks very seriously his religion and his place in this world. as the text in the beginning of the movie says, these pictures are dead: they are the past already, and have been right from the moment when the product was ready. but that is only for the maker of these "products": maybe to somebody, who is in the same frame of mind (i think very many people, at least of those who are seriously interested in religion, go through the same terrible angsts and doubts in their personal development). and that, of course, is the reason that art is made in the first place: identification and consolation amongst fellow human beings.this film uses very well the "classic" technics of the experimental cinema. and this is where those technics are to my opinion in the best possible use: as an instrument in telling stories and creating atmosphere to them, not just as a pure abstractions or as an end in themselfes. those "tricks" have already been made many enough times. some other movies that i imagine have influenced/inspired this director, are "eraserhead" and "nosferatu". it's interesting how these technics make this movie totally timeless: there is nothing contemporary in this movie. or nothing from any other specific time either. it could have been made a thousand years ago.it is interesting in this story how these people treat this new born holy child: they use it selfishly in their own purposes, and don't even try to listen to him. they beat him, rip off his intestines and castrate him. they drag his (living) body forcibly from place to place. and they do the same kind of violence to his mother. the story also reminds me of the borges' short story "el informe de brodie". also the critique towards the practices of the christian institutions reminds me of the great "el topo".unpleasant watch at times, but beautiful. very simple, thought and concentrated. very strong movie, almost too strong. the whole human energy has been concentrated to this. also this movie shows that when you have the passion and ideas, you can make a movie with a round zero budget.but i have to admit, it was a bit hard to watch for a "contemporary" viewer like myself, because of the experimentality. it was so slow and demanding. but after all, worth the suffering. i have to give ten points just for the effort that somebody makes this kind of movie.

what this movie is not: cool, entertainingwhat this movie is: visually interesting, difficult to get through, intentionali feel that this movie puts the viewer (if he or she is willing) through a clip of time where they experience a world without language. much like how animals must experience the world. you don't really watch this movie as much as you witness an awful series of events in what "feels" like real time.consistently, it goes on much longer than is comfortable. this movie could be edited down to a 20 minute short and it would be a totally different movie. it would be cool and entertaining, but the experience would be lost. i have seen a lot of cool movies, but i have never experienced one like this. if you can get your head in the right place for this one, you should be able to really appreciate (but likely not "enjoy") what they accomplished here. 10 out of 10.

sui generis. folks, i'm not going to lie to you; merhige is a one or two hit wonder, but what a film (it almost excuses suspect zero). i'm also not going to pretend to understand it completely; half of what makes it what it is is trying to second guess what the hell they are doing on the screen because of the chiaroscuro.richard corliss says, "it is as if a druidical cult had re-enacted, for real, three bible stories -- creation, the nativity and jesus' torture and death on golgotha." that's not a bad description, but there seems to be more to it than the seemingly one-to-one religious correspondences.there's an environmental theme right up near the surface -- note that toward the end (after the barrenness of the landscape) there are large pipes not unlike those on a construction site. oh no, he's going to say look at how people are raping mother nature. one rarely sees a dead metaphor in action, and with this much hyperbole, but to see it acted out is way grislier than language implies.and yeah, if you just want something to sync with a death metal soundtrack, it does have the requisite atrocities. but as for myself and others like me, it's an important art film that should merit a criterion collection release. ranks right up there with murnau's faust.~ ray

god cuts himself with a straight razor, afterwards, he gives birth to mother earth, which then gives birth through gods semen, son of earth. this is a one and a half-an-hour movie that sort of depicts a dark version of how god created the world. its surreal, dark and poetic. the most important aspect of the film to me is the visuals. its shot in a very grainy black and white film, using both slow-motion and normal shooting. sometimes even fast film and stop-motion. the scenes are long and dragged out, that sets a very weird mood. no sounds were recorded when filming (i think), sound effects were added afterwards, such as criccets, water and other ambient sounds, repeated over and over. as you might understand this movie is certainly not for the impatient person...i often felt it was similar to david lynch's eraserhead, only this one is even harder to understand, and even more dragged out, but that's okay for me, i like that kind of stuff. its certainly not entertainment (at least not the hollywood kind) so if your going to check it out, i recommend you set yourself up for it. be open minded, and except something like the end of 2001: a space odyssey.

this is not a story. it's a bunch of psychic needles reaching for your subconscious. if you wait for a story you'll be bored. but if you give yourself over to it you'll be inside it's dreamworld within 10 minutes. the vague but disturbing images of pain and torture in a desolate landscape leave room for your own fantasies. the strange soundtrack that gives you the feeling of isolation, the visual echoes of the crucifixion of christ, the pulsating light and deep dark shadows, they all reach to your subconscious to fill in this mind-space. i found myself trembling and unable to escape in front of my television. it was like dreaming with eyes wide open. a strange nightmare, a bad trip, a religious experience... it touched me deep inside and marked me for live. it freed my mind and gave me one of that rare experiences of loss of personality, and merging with the world of archetypes. a little freedom for the soul. a violent freedom however.... not a nice movie, but a very strong and unforgettable one. literally my text has no spoilers. for me the great surprise of this film was the unbelievable intensity of it, and describing this can be understood as a spoiler. the less you know about this film as you watch it, the better.

there have been many (well, more than a few in any case) attempts over the past 30 years to create film that has an "otherworldly" appearance. supposing that this is a film director's wish to distance himself from other movies, or simply to gloss over the low-budget and shabby look, "begotten" is on the top echelon of this pile.apart from the peerless "eraserhead", anyway.merhige's painstaking process of artificially degrading his film changes it's structure completely (imagine what this film would have looked like in glorious, standard technicolour) - it can almost be envisaged as an artifact from another, unknown culture. some images are so far removed from what we expect to see on the screen, they disturb mainly as they are dislocated. this is not "last house on the left" disturbance, more like leaving-your-cave-for-the-first-time-and-seeing-the-sun disturbance.watch this fever-dream if you get the chance, and relish. remember, they make other, more standard films every day. they can wait.

a warning to potential viewers of this experimental film: the nature of the imagery and the effects are such that this is one of those types of films that should really be seen on film, projected. the pixellation created by digital transfers sucks a lot of depth and adds a lot of noise to already abstract and grainy film. however, since this movie is pretty much unavailable in any format, i suppose you'll have to make do with what you can.anyway, this most excellent artistic endeavor comes courtesy of the guy who would eventually give us shadow of the vampire. it's a dark and dirty film of the genesis of the elements (as far as i can glean from the character names) through a process horrifying and surreal. begotten is a very good example of what is known as abject art, a stylistic approach that seeks meaning through the visceral more than the thematic.and visceral describes it. not very much stuff happens in the movie technically, but the levels of emotion it'll put you through are innumerable. the very repetitiveness of some of the imagery creates a mesmerizing catch over the senses. the sound editing and score in particular are immaculate, and serve the imagery incredibly well.fans of this film would do well to check out the collections of short films released through other cinema dvd, experiments in terror i, ii, and iii. movies such as these make me more and more certain that the realm of true horror resides in the abstract, abject, and non-narrative, rather than in spooky tales of ghosts and axe-murderers.--polarisdib

begotten.the magic.the terror.the slight boredom.that "begotten" is for acquired tastes goes without saying,you don't just happen to watch it unless your friends are real art-house movie buffs.you must dig the weird,the macabre,the bizarre.you must dig cool flicks.and you must dig to find diamonds."begotten" is one of the most visually dazzling and mystifying films ever known to man.the visual part is something to behold,something no one can prepare you for.but since the film is devoid of any type of dialogue,the visual part is pretty much the only part...."begotten" is a visual film.the soundscapes created for the film are magical and groundbreaking but still....the sight of it....god commits suicide in a particularly gory scene then from his corpse rises mother earth who impregnates herself with god's semen and gives birth to flesh on bone,a retarded child.she then abandons him,and he gets tortured by heathen-like creatures.mother comes back (to save him?) but she and her son get murdered by the horrible creatures.the film is about the meaninglessness of life,and about the fact that we come to this planet to suffer and to die,and that when something dies something else is born etc.nihilism.the film's no.1 quality is of course the visuals,the setting,those haunting images,this other-worldly quality....after you're done watching,you feel like an alien.it's that mesmerizing.when people say it should last 30' instead of 70' they're right.no they're not,it could last 40'.it's just that everything happens to such a slow pace.in fact,the plot summary i provided is all that happens in the film,like no kidding.still,it's....i don't know....glorious... ...like a flame burning away the darkness...

begotten is certainly an experience, and a out of the ordinary experience at that. the use of colour is fascinating and at times, frustrating. a lot of what happens on screen is incredibly difficult to make out. your view is either obscured by a sudden bizarre change in colour and tone, characters in the way and random cuts to the sky. the sound is very haunting and a welcome addition. it really aids the nihilistic and hopeless tone that smothers this film. as for what begotten is about, the "rape of the environment and rebirth" theory feels pretty accurate to me. but i wouldn't spend a lot of time focusing on the meaning, it's virtually unimportant. it's clear the director didn't want to explain anything. he simply presents it as it is, and if you want to search for a meaning that's up to you. watching begotten is definitely not a walk in the park, but i was captivated from the opening. it really is like watching a person's worst nightmare. what we see is at times distressing and very unpleasant, but there is a surreal dreamlike beauty in there. if you're an art-house/experimental fan and you haven't yet seen begotten, make it a priority. i doubt you will ever forget it. i sure know that i won't.

e. elias merhige's begotten is a one of a kind, surreal depiction of the mankind's treatment of religion. there are a couple of different ways you can interpret things, but the plot itself is simple: a god disembowels himself, and out of his corpse springs mother earth. mother earth then felates the god's corpse post-mortem, and then impregnates herself with what remains of his seed. following this, she gives birth to a messiah figure who quivers, presumably in infancy, but possibly with terror at being brought to life on earth. this all takes place in the first 15-30 minutes, and after that, the rest of the film consists of robed figures dragging the messiah (who is incessantly quivering, or seizing) across a desert landscape. the robed figures pause only to brutalize the messiah, then continue to drag him around.there are a couple of ways to interpret this, depending on your level of optimism and your world view. it can easily be interpreted as a bleak nihilistic atheist allegory about the total lack of apparent power that christian "deities" can be perceived as having in a modern society that only invokes their names to advance its own selfish goals. or you can interpret it as a postmodern pro-christian allegory, in which you view the film as being about how mankind has twisted christ's message around so much that it's original purity and innocence can no longer have relevance in a world where that message and image are inappropriately used to endorse everything from interpersonal violence, to war, to totalitarianism.the visuals of this film are phenomenal, and you will not see anything like it, period. if you can, watch the original vhs release, i recommend it. i'm not sure if the visuals are changed on the dvd, but i have seen clips of this streaming on you tube and the effects are seriously diminished. on the vhs version, merhige achieved total binary contrast. meaning, there basically aren't any mid-tones except for some grain in some of the shots. other than that, this film offers the rare opportunity to see pure white and pure black, and the result is stunning, hallucinatory, and quite unsettling. this film makes film noir look positively washed out and mediocre. the shots fade into each other in a surreal manner that recalls un chien andalou without completely aping it, for an effect that has been called a filmic rorschach test.that being said, the film can certainly try a viewer's patience and commitment. there isn't any dialogue for starters. the only sound throughout the film is a fairly constant loop of crickets chirping, peppered occasionally with the gurgling and death rattles of the dying deities, and an amelodic droning synthesizer texture. personally, i find that the film is best enjoyed listening to experimental industrial music like the instrumental nin remixes from the downward spiral era, more abstract noise/experimental music like f*ck buttons and odd nosdam. it also works quite well with apocalyptic black metal. basically any music with extreme textures and/or hypnotic rhythms. that's one of the most amazing and versatile aspects of this film, it is prime for postmodern re-contextualization, like projecting it during a performance of avant-garde music, or composing avant-garde music to accompany it.once the messiah figure is born, there really isn't much change for the rest of the film, meaning that you are basically sitting through at least 45 minutes or more of the messiah figure being drug around the desert and beaten. it looks bleakly beautiful, but there isn't really anything new unfolding. it helps to cement the filmmakers intentions of communicating that for thousands of years now people have been using christ's name and image for personal benefits, but can be tiresome to a casual viewer or someone with a short attention span. basically, if you are looking for a modern horror film with suspense, look elsewhere. if you are looking for a unique film experience, and you aren't particularly fond of mainstream hollywood cinema, this could be your quivering messiah.

i want to preface this review by saying that i have no idea what "begotten" is truly about. all i really know is that in the beginning god kills himself, in turn birthing mother earth, who proceeds to impregnate herself with god's semen. she then births a son. the rest is pretty subjective, and you have to interpret it in your own way.how i chose to interpret the film was this; god killing himself signified the start of the scientific revolution, when people started questioning the doctrines imposed by the church, like the geocentric view of the universe and etc. mother earth symbolized people starting to think for themselves and reject the church's "it happens like this because god says so" views. the tribal people were the church lashing back at them, trying to force christianity down their throats. i'm not exactly sure how son of earth fits into all of this. mother earth and the tribal people seemed to be fighting over him, so maybe he represents the freedom of people or something to that effect.i have no idea what the final parts of this movie are supposed to mean. bludgeoning, raping, then dismembering mother earth and son of earth and grinding them into the ground like a mortar and pestle could mean anything, but that is where the fun of this film lies; you can interpret it any way you want. there doesn't have to be a definitive meaning to it, you can let your mind wander. sometimes you don't even know what you are supposed to be looking at because it is shot in a weird angle or it is too fuzzy.the only thing that disappointed me was that i was expecting a truly terrifying film. i was going into it thinking i was going to get a phone call immediately afterward with a foreboding "seven days" warning. what i got was pleasantly different. it was not scary at all, but it stirred my imagination. trying to decipher the movie's cryptic message was a creative challenge. there were many scenes that were in fact beautiful. mother earth just after she was born and the final shot of the forest path come to mind.so overall i would have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed this film. it is certainly the most abstract movie i've ever seen, but that's not a bad thing.

e. elias merhige's existentialist experiment in the enduring is definitely one hell of a boring watch. this is like something alexander de large was forced to watch in "a clockwork orange." but, despite just how unwatchable this film really is, it is a success.if you are reading this and have not already seen the film, then it is too late. for me, at least, the payoff (after 3 separate viewings with lots of break in between mind you) was seeing the list of characters *after* the story was told. that's when the simple message hit home. but i wonder if merhige could have told a 5 minutes story in about 30, instead of 78.however, seeing as how the cast of credits is displayed prominently on the front page for this movie, the cat is already out of the bag and you surely will only appreciate this film if you appreciate existentialist film making from the early 20th century. even then, you might puke.4/10 (but i commend merhige for crafted a piece of art, even if it is unwatchable)

even though it doesn't really matter to the film, this is a creation myth. god (a convulsing, bloody figure in a chair) cuts his organs out with a straight razor and dies in his own filth. mother earth rises from his corpse and impregnates herself with his seed, giving birth to man. it is, however highly unlikely for you to figure any of this out without reading a synopsis first, and it's not especially important to the film that you do, as it's more a surrealistic art-house imagery thing, all in inky, processed black and white. a sick, bleak atmosphere is created with the stark photography and minimal sounds (mostly water dripping, groans, scrapes, etc.) but each scene goes on a bit too long and so does the film as a whole. this could've been great as a short film, and the god killing himself scene was excellent and extremely creepy, especially being the first thing you see, but it's hard to be patient when it goes on for so long and you don't even know what you're seeing for much of the time.still, a good film for the original style, images, atmosphere and content.

daniel percival's "dirty war", a bbc production made for television was shown recently on cable. the film has a documentary style in the way it goes after the people that caused the near holocaust in one of the big metropolis of the world, london. in fact, this film, produced in 2004 is almost a cautionary tale of the events of the following year, in which terrorists set explosive devices in the public transport that killed innocent people that were in the wrong place, at the wrong time.the film impresses for the pace the director and the production team gave to the project. there are no dull moments in the movie as we watch the preparation by the terrorists and the people that are following their dirty work. although the inevitable happens, it's amazing just to think what would be the consequences if a real 'dirty bomb' was planted in such a densely populated area.the last images of the film have a chilling effect. the mob scenes and the way the whole area is contaminated send shivers of fear, thinking how it could possible happen anywhere.

well this movie certainly was in keeping with the current times. no happy endings, super-heroes, or miracles here. just down-to-earth fiction to stimulate our minds along the lines of terrorism, and what-ifs. kudos to percival and mickery for an excellent screenplay and superb direction by percival. films like this are needed to keep us aware of what is out there. if every peace-loving man and woman on earth reported obviously suspicious activities i believe terrorism could not thrive. this movie showed just how hard it really is to subvert these terrorists, even with good intelligence. even though the film is a bit propagandist against islam (the use of a muslim police officer as a main character) i believe it was entirely realistic. there was meant to be shock-value in the bombing incident. as a very clever tool to relay the humility and indignity of people caught up in an attack such as this, they showed full nudity of women being decontaminated post-attack. it didn't take me long to realize that this was meant to even further instill into the viewer that thought, i.e., we are not in control of everything in a situation like this. although this took place in london, with the usual high-level british acting, it makes a statement for any part of the world. great movies don't have to be blockbuster epic productions, and this movie is very very worthy of viewing.

the bbc and hbo teamed up to create "dirty war", a 90 minute tv movie about a terrorist "dirty bomb" attack in london. the film gets down to business quickly as it packs both the terrorist and the government anti-terrorist efforts into the film leaving little room for human interest subplots. on the terrorist side we follow the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive materials to assembly to deployment to detonation. on the government side we see pr and training exercises, intelligence gathering and analysis, interdiction, post-detonation response, and follow up. the film also imparts a sense of how al-qa'ida type terrorist cells are organized, the radical islamic terrorist mentality, and terrorist strategies. a sort of anatomy of a "dirty bomb" incident, "dirty war" will answer many questions lurking in the minds of a public becoming ever more aware of this insidious threat.

i just wanted to say that when i was young my favorite t.v show back in the day was night heat. i loved the characters and the plot of the show. i thought that it was an excellent show and still do to this day. i enjoy watching the reruns and i am a big fan.i love the way the characters played off one another.i would always stay up late to watch my favorite show with my mother who also was a big fan. now i can enjoy watching my show again and listening to the theme song.which i thought was a cool song for the show.my favorite characters were scott hylands and jeff wincott.i enjoyed watching these handsome guys take down the bad boys.

this lasted several years despite the late hour it was on.like a lot of 80's crime dramas, it looked cold. both physically and figuratively. this isn't a bad thing though. and the (obviously) low budget actually worked in it's favor. gritty during a time when 'slick' was in.allan royal's wraparound segments as the news writer gave it a slight edge.the only actors i remembered were scott nylands (earthquake) and tony rosato (sctv). the cast of barely knowns was a good thing because one could see the group as a whole and not as a bunch of people supporting a 'star.' and yes, that's a young clark johnson (homicide) in a recurring spot.i hope a dvd release is in the future. someone out there wanna get on that?

i feel the niiiiiight heat! i feel your heeaaaaaaaaaart-beat! something ain't right!" theme song written by b.j. cook from skylark- david foster's old band and wife. she also wrote the memorable theme from cbc's "airwaves." oh night heat! what a program! well-written, well-acted and totally classic. crime solvers and a good team and a dash of humour at the end. i'd like to think this is really what detectives do/did. giambone was a real favourite! on a canadian tip, i learned every canadian actor's name and style from guest spots done on night heat. everyone passed through the night heat set and like law & order, it was story-driven so you could just watch and enjoy without a lot of character melodrama.

"the missing star", who competed for the golden lion at 2006 venice film festival, is a film that, when you think about, the first adjective that comes to your mind is: intense. intense looks, intense sequences, this movie's intensity captures the viewer since the very first scenes at the steelworks, in italy (i couldn't recognize the city, maybe genoa or even naples), although the pace is quite slow.vincenzo buonavolontà, the male lead, and with him, all the audience, sees a completely different china than a normal westerner imagines: horrible high-rise building with about 8 hundred flat owners inside, skyscrapers, desolation, fog, scrapers and cranes everywhere, but also the beauty of the yangtze kiang river, that will soon become a big lake because of the controversial dike that will wipe a lot of towns out. china is a country under construction, but, under all these colossal public works, there are still poverty, backwardness and unfair laws.we can relate more easily to this story because gianni amelio, the expert director, chose two phenomenal leads: sergio castellitto, a well-known actor in italy, and the chinese surprise tai ling, a total unknown girl that gives an as intense interpretation as castellitto's.the film is not perfect, there are some flaws here and there, but that doesn't mean it's a mediocre film. try to see it.

as a modern marco polo, from venice to china, here we come amelio, again, taking on the task to render us the grey area in the middle of two worlds in solid colors. eroded by globalization's collateral damages, the pessimistic vision of europe is mutual with chinas. the view of that charming but puzzling country is dealt from below, devoid of any claim to learn or impose opinions. reality, nonetheless, is harsh. abandoned and exploited children, beehive-homes, backward areas is the other china we ignore. vincenzo (castellitto), a technician of a steel factory, is one of us. his voyage to china is a pretext to understand, to learn from the inside a country where progress and third-world problems live together in an infamous balance. it's not exactly clear if vincenzo knew by the first time that the mechanical component was already been fixed, i think so; anyway is a minor aspect. liu, the chinese girl, is the key of the whole film. she carries on her back a lot of difficulties, she's got the strength to overcome, but how could she fight with little money and little help ? the realistic and unbiased view of the facts by the girl, refusing vincenzo's money, touched me a lot. a pack of bank-notes can't get back her husband, her baby (forced to treat like a stranger for the law), protect her by scorns. liu knew his intentions were benign and kind, far from a cold charity act. their friendship is beautifully narrated, the way it grows step by step, dignified and formative, unique. a priceless legacy to keep.some scenes are stunning, either for the acting (vincenzo crying on the ferry) or by the dialogues (at the restaurant, on the railroads). besides a careless editing and a pretty lazy start, "la stella che non c'è" is brilliant and sharp just because chronicles the untold verities.in competition at 63rd venice film festival, plenty bet on tai ling for the mastroianni prize, dedicated to emerging stars. she definitely deserved that award.[8/10]

when i went to the cinema, i expected not much. i knew nothing about this movie but it was the only movie i could see, 'cause i was in a small town then. so i saw this movie and i was fascinated! "la stelle che non c'è" is a trip through the new industrial china and it shows it honestly! you see most of the time the ugly places of china, and you see what really happens with this new industrializing. the main characters are sad but hopefully people. he's the naive italian guy who can't believe what he see's. she's a translator from china who's missing her son. sometimes sad, sometimes funny but every time poetic! a wonderful movie with wonderful actors! so only one star is missing!

this is a wonderful new movie currently still showing in cinemas in my country. its director, the calabrian gianni amelio, is in my humble view perhaps the only contemporary italian director, along with nanni moretti, to deserve being called great (that is, apart from the old masters who're still around and occasionally still churning out movies). it's one of my greatest regrets that contemporary italian cinema has been ailing since the mid-70s, mostly due to a dire lack of funding and nurturing of new talent, something which can be transferred to most fields and which makes italy one of the most static industrialised countries of our time production-wise (both in an industrial and cultural sense)... unlike, say, china. and this, among other things, is precisely the subject of amelio's latest movie. few directors can speak to me about the true, present state of my country and the world as amelio can, yet his pictures also have a precious timelessness and universality. and for those already worrying that they may be slow, ponderous and worthy - rest assured: of the ones i've seen they most certainly aren't, at least not if you're used to quality european cinema.the basic plot outline: vincenzo buonavolontà is a technician at an obsolete steel plant factory somewhere in italy, probably the north. he is played by sergio castellitto, one of contemporary italy's most versatile and talented actors. when a major chinese steel company purchases some of the italian steel plant's industrial machinery, vincenzo, who struggles to make himself understood with the non-italian speaking chinese director, tries to tell him that the machine is defective and its converter needs substituting, an element he's working on custom-building himself. he warns them that not doing this might have very dangerous consequences. meanwhile a young chinese woman called liu hua acts as interpreter between the two men, but seems to struggle to find adequate translations for some of vincenzo's technical jargon. the italian eventually loses his patience with her, virtually pushing her aside and asking her to hand him the chinese-italian dictionary so that he can do the translating himself.despite vincenzo's warnings, the following morning he finds that the chinese factory director and his employees have returned to their own country while not heeding his advice about the adequate use of the industrial machine at all. thus vincenzo, equipped with his great integrity, sets off for china. and here begins an endlessly fascinating road movie through china, a very topical 21st century odyssey through the asian giant. a latter-day marco polo's quest for the secrets of the mysterious nation? not quite. as in all of amelio's movies, the journey itself becomes far more important than whether its ultimate "mission" is carried out or not. in fact, the way in which the point is literally brought home, not without a touch of humour, is a lovely, poignant paradox and irony, which made my eyes well up while i was simultaneously smiling. the spectator is let in on the secret that vincenzo's trip was ultimately completely useless, but he himself doesn't know it, and goes home a satisfied man, a deluded innocent. at least, you figure, he's happy. sort of.the journeys that amelio's characters embark on totally uproots and strips them down to their bare, human essentials. they are momentarily without name, status or someone to put in a word for them. these theo angelopoulos-like themes are also explored in lamerica, actually my favourite amelio movie, closely followed by la stella che non c'è in order of personal preference. in the 1994 movie lamerica, two italian racketeers travel to albania to "do business". just like vincenzo, they intend to go there, do what they have to do and then go back home. instead, one of these two italians accidentally ends up on an almost homeric journey through this devastated land just after the fall of communism.but let us go back to la stella che non c'è: once vincenzo is in china, he predictably discovers that the seemingly "simple" task of handing the converter to its new owner is anything but straight-forward. the piece of machinery's new location is seemingly almost impossible to determine, unless he embarks on an arduous journey through china. when he comes across liu hua, the young interpreter he'd mistreated now working as a librarian, he tries to speak to her but she reacts in a hostile manner, informing him that because of him, she'd lost her job as interpreter back in italy. played by the relative newcomer ling tai, liu hua soon becomes a virgil to vincenzo's dante when she grudgingly figures that she could do worse than to act as guide and interpreter for the italian on his trip (obviously for a consistent sum of cash). this young chinese actress may not have the beauty of ziyi zhang, nor the movie star glamour of gong li, but her charming, expressive and pretty face oozes a combination of defiant strength, intelligence, dignity and wry humour that'll make her features difficult to forget once you've seen the movie. furthermore, she and castellitto have wonderful emotional chemistry as co-stars.amelio weaves dramas that are serious, poetic, mythical, post-neo-realist and humorous all at once, while maintaining a heart-warming ability to explore the fleeting essence of humanity in everyday, commonplace circumstances. a documentary-like naturalness conceals what is actually a meticulously conceived tapestry of faces and places, a vista which also manages to incorporate a cinematography of breath-taking beauty. the photography here is functional yet gorgeous, as befits a movie on the displaced in an industrial and emotional wasteland.amelio's observant eye is a grown-up, disillusioned one, yet also never a cynical or misanthropic one. the masterful camera angles also often gives a sense of vincenzo's alienness in the eyes of the chinese, bringing home a sense of objectivity and cultural impartiality that's very rare in movies about a "familiar" westerner exploring an "unfamiliar" non-western country. i cannot recommend this movie enough.

this is an enjoyable movie. its very realistic to the "wonderful world of music" i've been there and done that. it shows a human element in each character and the realism that nobody is perfect. these amateur musicians weren't all that bad players. cleavon little's character, marshall tucker, was played very well. marshall was no saint himself. here he was getting paid to do a job and he's giving these guys a hard time about everything in the van on the way up there. you don't bite the hands that feed you. i do find it hard to believe that a player with the jazz experience he has, claims he does not know any of the dixieland tunes. he has a tremendous sense of predicting chord changes to tunes he does not know. not common, but not unheard of either. he delivers a true and harsh message at the end of the movie when he tells the clarinet player, "its not a religion, devotion is not enough." on that level, he is correct, although i think the clarinet player could have handled the job. he was practicing his butt off and vocal accompaniment music is not that hard to read. very enjoyable movie.

this movie is almost never seen today - the only reason i can enjoy it again and again is from a slightly worn out vhs copy i made when the film was shown on tv in 1991 here in england.an ensemble cast are obviously enjoying themselves and this is reflected to the viewer. a razor sharp script helps things along, and once you've seen this you will want to watch it over and over again.wayne rogers is the 'star' but everyone contributes to a great film, with a great jazz soundtrack to boot. there are emotional moments during the film, but never to the point of sickly sweet sentimentalism - these are guys on the trip of a lifetime, and they convey that excitement wonderfully.highly recommended if you can actually get to see it.

"the gig" is a tight, funny and poignant little movie about a group of friends that have gathered together on a regular basis to play dixieland for fun. the group unexpectedly lands a real paying job, in musician's parlance; a "gig".they travel to upstate ny for a two week gig at a summer resort minus one member, who bows out due to contracting cancer. at the last minute, they hire a professional to take his place. things get sticky as an over-the-hill frankie valli type attempts a comeback at the resort and tries to utilize the group as his band.the attitude the professional bass player gave the guys rang true. by signing up to play the two-week gig, they were taking bread out of the mouths of someone who needed the job to feed his or her family. while pop, rock, rap, country and western, and r&b stars make money off of albums. jazz musicians have to travel abroad to make a living. almost nobody gets rich. the guys living their dream also cost others a needed income.i believe that almost everyone who can play a musical instrument with some proficiency dreams about playing a paying "gig" one time or another, woody allen and kevin bacon are two popular examples of this amateur-to-professional crossover. i especially recommend this movie to anyone who has ever played music professionally. my mom, who was a musician, loved it.

i absolutely love this movie! evil dead has nothing on this film! night of the demons 2 and 3 are a total bore fest, but this one is a classic. it's super cheesy and the acting is alright at best, but what more could you want from an 80's horror movie? stooge has some of the best one-liners to ever hit the screen in this one. (he's my favorite character) a lot of people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie, but my personal favorite is the ending, sadly enough has nothing to do with the main characters, when the old man eats his left over halloween apples in a pie, and his throat is mangled from the inside out. the sound track is awesome. the scene with angela dancing is totally creepy, especially after the strobe light comes on, and you can see her jump from one part of the floor to the next with every sound of a camera shutter click on the song that's playing. the make-up effects in this movie are pretty sweet; angela gave me nightmares as a kid. if you're the type of person who demands perfection out of your filming experience, you might want to give this one a pass. but, if you're like me, and you really dig the whole halloween, haunted house with the demons cliché, than this one is definitely a must own.

it is 1969. phoebe(camilla belle) is an 11 year old girl growing up with an idealized vision of her 19 year old sister faith(cameron diaz). faith is the doer, the truth-seeker, the fixer of all the wrongs in the world. then one day, phoebe and her mother gail(blythe danner) receive word that faith is dead. faith has killed herself. both phoebe and gail are overwhelmed by this news and, although saddened, gail mourns. phoebe can't let it go. phoebe decides to go to europe and find out what happened.it is now 1977. phoebe(jordana brewster) is 18 and decides to go to europe over the objections of her mother to discover the truth. when alive, faith was inseparable from a man she called "wolf"(christopher eccleston). though wolf claimed not to know anything about faith's last days, phoebe convinces him to tell her everything. within days, wolf realizes that he hadn't let go of the past either and he joins phoebe on her pilgrimage to portugal.in the end, wolf is able to tell of faith's decent into drug abuse and his own guilt at not preventing the suicide. although angry, phoebe realizes in the end how human and fragile faith really was.i liked this movie. i'm old enough to remember the bank robberies of the red army and i was 10 in 1969. this story was familiar ground for me. i can still remember young men trying to decide if they should go to canada or not to avoid the draft.the story is simple, but probably occurred several times in real life during that period. camilla belle was enjoyable and fun to watch as she portrayed the young adoring sister excited by what was happening around her. jordana brewster slid easily into the role of the older phoebe. blythe danner was the ever supportive mother, a role she is all too familiar with on american tv, unfortunately. i would have liked to see her with stronger material to work with. cameron diaz played the immature anarchist perfectly. though at times, her performance of a 1960s activist seemed to come off a news reel. of all the characters, it was christopher eccleston's wolf, that made the most growth. when we are introduced to the character at the beginning of the movie, we can see he is a worldly man. he is a patient and kind man filled with anger at the world's injustices. in the end, he realizes the direction he and faith are headed is wrong and begins to "grow up" deciding he should fight against injustice in his own way. faith refuses to join him in this and it eventually leads to her death. eccleston's wolf is the most real of all the characters.i recommend this movie. it was enjoyable and thought provoking. "the invisible circus" is rated tv-ma, but there is very little cursing, sex or violence in it. the subject of the movie is the reason for the rating.

i caught this on late, late mexican cable and i have to rant about it. the title was translated as "secretos" (secrets). well there's a secret that has an important part in the movie but come on, ! we are not stupid. we know there's a novel behind this.anyways, the movie is pretty interesting and it's carried by it's solid ramatic performances. the always beautiful and stunning jordana brewster and christopher eccleston deliver great performances and have such great chemistry between them. cameron dìaz is also good although she has minimal on-screen time. blythe danner is perfect and his last appearance in the movie is touching, sad. great performances. jordana's character and her sister's ex-boyfriend travel to europe in order for her to deal with his demons and understand why her sister died. through flashbacks, we learn the sad truth and we can't help but feel sorry for the whole family. the ending is truly moving. so there's nudity but it's minimal. in fact, the sex scenes are artsy and do not intend to be steamy or sexy.to be honest, i kept watching it for joranda brewster's on screen charming and beauty. and i ended up liking the story and the dramatic presentations. give this movie a try if you like solid dramatic features. great movie. the last, last scene was very sad.. the two little sisters through flashbacks.

i've seen this film three times and each time i appreciate it more. i think jordana brewster should have received an emmy nomination for her real and natural performance. many of us who were phoebe's age at this time the story takes place will understand how real it is. life for most of us is neither softly glowing romantic or harshly cynical pessimism. it is a blurred balance, and this film captures this balance. it is well constructed, too, with so many fine details in its composition. like the film or not, judging from the extraordinarily high ratings it gets from the demographic of females under 18, we can know that this movie reveals some important truth about how young women see themselves in the world.

the plot of this film is not complicated. a very attractive young girl goes to europe in search of the reasons for her older sister's suicide ten years earlier. there she meets up with her sister's former boyfriend and together they travel to all the places her sister went, and gradually the reasons become clear.but what makes this film so special, and soar above the limited plot, are the beautiful portrayals of the characters. although the older sister's boyfriend is a drop-out hippie, he has noble ideals, moral standards and incredible strengths. and although the older sister, who we see in flashbacks, shares these ideals, she doesn't have a sense of limitation or balance, of how much is too much. and although the younger girl is fiercely loyal to her sister's memory, she gradually finds the strength to face the fact that her sister was only a normal girl, after all.the most special moment in the film is when the young girl and the sister's boyfriend finally stop fighting their attraction to each other. i can't recall ever seeing more beautiful, touching, romantic tenderness in lovemaking in a film!in all these ways this is a truly beautiful film, a film to be treasured, and to be seen again and again. 9 out of 10.

so it isn't an epic, but for people experiencing anything similar(sibling suicide) it might be an interesting way of therapy. animaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time wellspent. for some reason, it hasn't really caught on in the audience,something i do believe is a result of the main theme. why did shecommit suicide? clearly, this is hardly something that usmoviegoers will flock to, had it been an european production itprobably would have reached its audience in a much greaterextent. it is however, a movie that although the realism tainted by ashimmering romanticized glow, gives the viewer a whole heartedimpression.

i cannot for the life of me understand why the rating here for this movie is so low. this was one of the most beautiful films i have seen this year. it really struck a chord with me. i had been anticipating this film for several months and i thought to myself, there's no way it can possibly live up to the expectations i had for it...seeing as how i built it up in my head as much as i did. well needless to say, not only did it meet my expectations but it far surpassed them. jordana brewster and cameron diaz were excellent in every way. their acting superb by far. they were both in their element and completely natural for the roles. the locales were absolutely gorgeous. every shot filmed was perfectly captured and fit the mood and atmosphere beautifully. i found this film very touching and took it very close to heart. i would even contemplate saying this could be one of my all time favorites. at the very least, certainly i could see it again and again.i swear i couldn't find one fault in this film. it's hard to say that about any film. i would highly recommend this one. it's touching, it's meaningful, and it says a lot about human nature and family.10 out of 10. well done by all.

"tesis", "open your eyes" and "the others" were proof of amenabar's talent and skill as a filmmaker, but (in my humble opinion) were also flawed films in their attempt to outsmart the audience, always offering one turn of the screw too many, favoring cheap thrills, twists and turns over depth and resonance. lucky for everyone amenabar chose a subject for his new film that would not allow a surprise ending, focusing on characters and the emotional ties that bind them. the result is a little miracle of a film, beautifully written, photographed, scored, acted and directed. everyone involved in this film delivers a carrer-high performance,behind and in front of the cameras, from the wonderful cast (bardem shines, but mabel rivera, celso bugallo, clara segura and lola dueñas give the film an amazing authenticity) to aguirresarobe's exquisite lensing. the film taps on many relevant issues and emotions effectively , it addresses heart and mind with equal power and delivers a final punch that stays with you long after the credits roll. this is a brilliantly executed film that not only will stand as a landmark in spanish cinema, but will surely become a pleasant surprise when it opens in the abroad (sony classics has paid a record 6 million dollars to distribute it) don't be surprised it it manages to get in the oscar race... there's no stopping amenabar...buen trabajo, alejandro!

this is probably the best movie filmed in at least the last five years. i've always believed that making people cry is far more difficult than making them laugh. if you want to see 400 adults crying out loud in the same room, go see this movie. it's breathtaking. javier bardem performs the role of his life. you will cry, you will laugh, you will smile... the most deserving fact is that in spain everybody knows about ramon sampedro. personally i knew the full story and even the end of it. so, the excellence of the movie is in the way that the story is told. and in this field, amenabar is a the master.this movie is a must.

when i first saw "before night falls", javier bardem had just been nominated for an academy award. i thought "he's got it!". he didn't. i watched "mar adentro" last night. please give it to him this time... this is an actor. convincing, touching, emotional, brilliant. see also "los lunes al sol" and you will understand what i am talking about. he is an absolute chameleon and i swear it's not only the result of make-up work. this movie is so beautiful, so well done, the characters are so real. congratulations to alejandro amenábar (how about a best director nomination?). i also have to mention the make-up artists. i can't think of another word but magnificent. i really hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves. as far as i am concerned, it already has...

" i have wrestled with death. it is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. it takes place in an impalpable grayness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around, without spectators, without clamor, without glory, without the great desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly atmosphere of tepid skepticism, without much belief in your own right, and still less in that of your adversary. if such is the form of ultimate wisdom, then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it to be." marlow in joseph conrad's "heart of darkness"it's difficult to make lyrical the subject of death in any work of art. yet movies have recently made bold attempts to humanize it to the extent that it is embraced as a part of the cycle of all living things, and it can be chosen rather than legislated. "chosen" is the operative word for alejandro amenabar's sea inside, based loosely on the true story of the galician sailor ramon sampedro. it is a drama about euthanasia without prejudice clothed in love, poetry, and friendship. if it sounds like barbarian invasions (2003), in which a cancerous professor says farewell to lifelong friends and loves before he takes his life, then you are right. in fact, sea is better because it spends more intimate time with the protagonist before he goes, a remarkable feat with not one of those moments in the least dull or uninteresting.javier bardem as ramon has expressive eyes and commanding voice for the romantic quadriplegic, a combination of tough realist and poetic sufferer. belen rueda plays the disabled lawyer julia, who becomes an imaginary lover for ramon, increasing in radiance as her life degenerates with disease. added to the already almost soap opera circumstance is lola duenas as rosa, a blue collar visitor who initially tries to dissuade ramon from seeking death but quickly falls in love with him. talk about romanticizing disabilitythis guy has unbelievable luck attracting substantial women, and he can't move a finger. but talk he can, proving the ultimate argument about what women want: love that speaks, not just makes.i will refrain from mentioning the major motion picture now up for an oscar that features euthanasia as its climax in order not to spoil the experience for first timers. sufficient it is just to say both films are successful in opening up both sides of a contentious subject without forcing a specific point of view. the religious right has a right to complain that the former film and barbarian invasions celebrate suicide; it has no right to accuse the beautifully balanced sea inside of the same."a life in this condition has no dignity," ramon says. the irony is he conducts himself with supreme dignity that makes anyone question his determination to end his life. "the sea inside" is a formidable entry in 2004's oscar nominations for best foreign language film.

once again almenábar has provided us with a top quality film. this director is amazing, and he's proven that he's equally talented and effective when crossing genres. the excellent character development of the movie, through dialogue and personality quirks, but with more subtle details as well (ramon's father's gaze), allows the audience to identify with the protagonists very closely, making the importance and emotional impact of the events which take place all the more profound. the visuals are at times, simple, at times stunning (the dream to the beach), and i think almenábar's films really benefit from the fact that he also composes the music - it matched the film's varying moods flawlessly.more than just a film about euthanasia, which in itself is an important issue, this film tackles the duality of a man who at times genuinely seems to enjoy life (albeit in a quite limited way), and yet one who is unswerving in his desire to die. the overwhelming sadness of the film is punctuated by well-timed quips of humor, which seem all the funnier because they provide a welcome respite from the melancholy you will certainly feel.although clearly in favor of euthanasia, this film does an excellent job representing the myriad points of view of ramon's friends and family. most poignant was ramon's father, when he said, despondent, "there's only one thing worse than losing a child. that the child wants to die."excellent writing, acting, directing, cinematography, music - 10/10.

since many other users have already explained and commented the storyline, i won't do it.however, i'd like to restate that bardem's interpretation is terrific, as also are those of the other actors and actresses in this film. reading the previous comments i've noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film doesn't show points of view opposed to euthanasia and that those little present are ridiculed. in my honest opinion this is far from true.there are many characters that move in a gray zone between loving ramón sampedro and wanting him to stay, and understanding his desire to die. most obvious of those are the family. for instance, ramón's sister-in-law never talks for or against euthanasia. another such character is gené (the social rights activist) who, in the last moment, tells ramón to re-think it all. the scene clearly shows that she doesn't want him to die.then there are characters who are clearly against euthanasia. ramón's brother is clearly against it, as is his father ("there's only one thing worse than the death of son, and it's having a son that wants to die.") other users have commented that the discussion between ramón and the priest is ridiculed and filmed to make us think that ramón is good and the priest is bad. well, no doubt the scene is comic, but that doesn't mean the priest is caricatured or ridiculed. from my point of view, the comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest is trying to convince ramón to keep on living using arguments totally alien to ramón's thinking. the priest's speech goes on the line of "god gives and god takes", "we aren't the owners of our own lives, they belong to god"... and so on. the comedy arises from the fact that ramón is atheist and all the priest is saying to him is therefore nonsense.this film is the antithesis of manicheism, it leaves the spectator the chance to think on the subject and make up his/her own opinion. and above anything else is a chant of freedom.

i just saw mar ardentro and felt that i had to comment on this film. euthanasia is a difficult topic in any field and unfortunately is can sometimes distort the true value of a movie. many people have raved about the excellent cast and it's beautiful imagery/camera-work. certainly javier bardem is an actor that brings something extra to each film he makes. to say that he encompasses the real sampredo is a little silly since i don't think that any of the reviewers have known sampredo personally. to lie still and use a certain charm is a acting skill that although well performed doesn't constitute a 'perfect' performance. bardem just does what he does well...and that's it. the camera-work is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the movie itself lacks to deliver. sampredo here is shown as a man that is bend on dying so much that he leaves his loving family behind and marries a woman that he only seeks out when the other will not help him in his quest for a dignified death. now i'm not here to say anything about the right for or against euthanasia. the problem is that when commenting movies like this you can hardly escape it. the movie's subject is so strong that you're almost compelled to discuss the movie in that strong subject matter. i find it a weakness for the movie -unintentionally- portrays sampredo as a unsymphatetic character. someone who is much smarter then his family as portrayed in the simple cousin that doesn't "get" the double layered poem directed towards him. someone who will leave a loving and caring family because he thinks his life is undignified. a scene that is juxtaposed to the female lawyer who according to the movie makes the "wrong" choice ending up in a far state of dementia thus indicating that sampredo's choice was the right one. the woman that constantly seeks him out is almost disregarded for the beautiful lawyer but suddenly is married by sampredo when she agrees to help him die. these choices make sampredo into a calculated figure no matter how charming bardem portrays him. argumentive i would say it doesn't convince fully and i kinda think that amenabar didn't intend on adding this unbalanced element in his film. for a young director it's still an impressive film and it certainly has it's strong moments (the discussion between the priest and sampredo for instance). the camera-work is impressive and the film is well acted. but 10 out of 10...no the movie doesn't reach that excellence.

if you think about it, it's nearly unbelievable that a film could be made about the death penalty (one of the world's most controversial topics) that offends neither those for nor against. it's a testament to tim robbins' extraordinary intelligence and sensitivity, traits that can be seen in his acting roles as well (shawshank redemption, jacob's ladder).this film in fact hints at a subtle compromise between the "for" and "against" camps... so subtle that it can't be put into words, subtle to the point of vanishing, yet one gets the sense after watching the picture that a compromise is possible, that somehow it can be worked out if only we look deeply enough...

this was the most thought-provoking capital-punishment movie ever! it refused to seem one-sided and the emotions felt throughout the story are as real as it can get. this movie had one of the most 'human' (and i use this term in a good way) compassionate religious character ever! this movie actually caused me to go out to find and read the book (which is rare for me). sister helen exerted more of a spiritual tone than a religious(which is also rare). and it presented both sides to the issue so that people on both sides who watched the movie wouldn't feel that a point was left out. and we have the director to thank for that. this is not a film for entertainment. but it is film that delivers a message that can reach to the core of your heart. i can't think of another film like it.

one of the best 'guy' movies i've ever seen has to be the wind and the lion. gad, the scenes...raisouli's bandits swarm over the wall... a staid british gentleman calmly gets up from tea with candice bergen and drops three of them with a webley revolver in his coat. a whisper from the ghost of empire... lest we forget! lest we forget!u.s. marines coming ashore from the long, long gone _brooklyn_. they were carrying krags, it should have been lees, but, oh wow. and the winchester 97 blowing large holes in obstreperous natives and even more obstreperous and faithless europeans... raisouli --sean connery, o, wow!--wondering 'what kind of gun does roosevelt use?"teddy roosevelt--brian keith, o, wow!--wondering "what kind of gun does raisouli use?' and writing yet another angry letter to winchester about the stock on his winchester 95.raisouli, armed with but a sword... a prussian cavalry officer, holstering his pistol and drawing his sword... honor. that's something long dead, from a world long gone, but raisouli would never have flown a plane full of children into a building...milious at milious's magnificent best, and now out on dvd.

tim robbins did a masterful job directing this film. i say this because he avoided convention and cliché. he also oversaw superb performances from susan sarandon (who won an oscar for her role) and sean penn. even more amazing, robbins doesn't patronize. he just tells the story and lets the events play on the viewer's mind. this is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinions on the death penalty, one of the most controversial subjects of our time, without being unfairly manipulated in either direction. i can't recommend this film enough, 9/10.

i'm astonished how a filmmaker notorious for his political left-wing fervor could make such a subtle, non-sanctimonious picture. if you're for capital punishment, you'll still be for it after seeing this. if you're against capital punishment, you'll still be against it. but whatever your stance is, this movie will, at the very least, make you reflect on why you feel the way you do. there's not one false note in the film.

sean connery is very good as the great raisuli, lord of the rif and defender of the faithful. this is an adventure movie with arabs, germans and the usmc all coming to grips at one point or another. there is also a lot of humor in the interplay among the main and supporting characters. the story is based on the true incident in which a wealthy greek-american businessman was kidnapped by the raisuli in the early 1900s. milius has substituted candace bergen and her two children as the victims of the kidnapping, and this opens the story to a lot of literary license.on the other hand, the movie gives milius the opportunity to remind the viewer of two of the most famous (though mostly forgotten) political quotations of the tr era. brian keith (very good as tr) says, "pedecaris alive or the raisuli dead!"; and john huston (also good as sec of state john hay)asks the japanese ambassador at a white house dinner, "you likee knifee, you likee forkee?"

first off, let it be known that i came into this movie not for the music; actually i find it repugnant. really, i was interested in the psychology of the punk subculture. on this point, the documentary did fairly well. one disagreeable aspect was the numerous scenes in which songs are played and the hyped-up band and belligerent crowd are shown running amok. if you've seen the first such scene, you've seen them all. this superfluity is party made up for by printing lyrics for some of the songs. with these, the audience is able to somewhat connect mentally with the band. the lyrics are of far more interest than the jumble of sounds projecting from the speakers. i don't know why all the lyrics were not printed. scenes without lyrics slow (ironic eh?, given the many references to the speed of the music) the flow of the movie. also insightful were the interviews with fans and bands, though there is a letdown when the latter band's interviews prove to be not nearly as enthralling or humorous as the first two. overall, a good movie that i'm glad i saw. i'll check out the follow-ups if i ever get a chance.favorite quote: he tried to hide the fact that he couldn't play by rubbing peanut butter over himself and breaking glass. broad punk generalization: though their disgracefulness, lack of vocabulary and hygiene, and drug-induced obliviousness is often hilarious, in the end it is understood that punks are just pathetic juveniles who rebel just for the sake of rebellion as seen through sophomoric lyrics and naive attempts to philosophize and politicize (disregarding black flag, who are slightly less misguided than their peers).

the one and the only!the only really good description of the punk movement in the la in the early 80's. also, the definitive documentary about legendary bands like the black flag and the x. mainstream americans' repugnant views about this film are absolutely hilarious! how can music be so diversive in a country of supposed liberty...even 20 years after...find out!

this is one of the best films made about the 80 punk scene. i saw this a few years back on a "bootleg" copy and was amazed. very few of todays kids know the true roots of punk and this movie shows some of the 80s punk legends such as the germs and shows how it was back then. nowadays so much punk has gone mainstream with mtv and radio and its nice to see the true underground rebellious movement of the original scene. darby crash (of the germs) is one of my heros and this film shows why. a must see for all "punks" and anyone curious about the 80s punk scene

we usually think of the british as the experts at rendering great adventure from the imperial age, with the likes of the four feathers (1939) and zulu, simply because the imperial age was, for the most part, british. here, in the wind and the lion, we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age.america's projection of power under teddy roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who, despite her gentility, is smitten by the rough, manly nobility of her captor, who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn. (politically correct prigs eager to see some slight of "native" peoples or cultures can rest assured, that the way arabs and muslims are depicted here is far more flattering than the way their modern counterparts depict themselves on the current world stage.) what makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy - and vivid history.though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be sean connery's noble brigand, candace bergen's feisty heroine, john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, roosevelt's "big stick". there is a transcendent scene at the end, when the little boy is symbolically swept away by the dashing moor on his white steed. this is high adventure at its best.

a movie i've seen and enjoyed possibly more than any other movie. i first saw it as a kid and loved the drama and the great climactic battle. as i got older, i enjoyed it as much or more than before, but now due to all of the components that work together to make a true classic. the acting is great (especially keith as t. roosevelt), the cinematography spectacular, the script is full of gems, and the directing pulls it all together wonderfully. it's loosely based on an actual event, and it shows rush of europe and a newly emergent america to carve up the 'sick old man' (the ottoman empire) as it collapses in a fashion unlike any other 'historical' movie i've seen. humor, drama, action, love...it's got it all and deserves far more acclaim (much like 'the great waldo pepper').

anyone who gives this movie less than 8 needs to step outside & puff a couple. great story.reality is for people who can't handle drugs.

not your ordinary movie, but a good one. billy bob is very funny in this movie, the way he talks, what he says etc. i was kind of surprised when i saw it, cause i just thought it was a normal comedy, but it was more than that. it had a very good story, great characters and a good balance.favorite part: probably when billy bob is running around in his robe shooting at the rippers

a fun romp...a lot of good twists and turns! (and we were not even baked!)didn't know this movie even existed until watching the extra trailers on a monty python dvd...(oddly it was there along with the city of lost children, and the adventures of baron munchauhsen)the plot keeps you wondering throughout.the acting was awesome...hank azaria shows his talent again, bill bob is billy bob...(wecis?)definitely worth watching.

what a great little film, lots of good roles from some random stars. basically there are these pot growers that get caught up in a comical adventure. at points the film makes you believe everyone is going to end up dead! which adds to the comedy. when the character of john lithgow (3rd rock) re-appears - its impossible not to imagine the trip, this may have caused, like a total paradox. the film is full of twists and turns that keep you guessing all the way to the end. billy bob thornton astronaut farmer) is brilliant, in fact looking back, the character is fairly similar in the fact he holds the family of pot growers together. everyone involved in this film should get a big thumbs up.as i say' the final scene is a dream; however a nightmare at the same time. i love it when hank azaria (carter) says at the end do you think we should do this every year? i felt my self wishing they would. i'm not going to say this film is good for everyone, but as a lover of stoner movies i give it 10/10. - my advice have a joint ready; kick back and enjoy!

this is an awesome movie, and if you haven't seen it, you should go to the video store right now and rent it. first off, the cast is superb. not only does it have current stars, like ryan philippe and billy bob thornton, but it also has your stars of yesteryear like judge reinhold. it also has numerous cameos by actors like jon bon jovi, ted danson, and jamie lee curtis. second off, the story was quite good also. it was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie, and almost made it dramatic. it takes the drug situation in the united states, and instead of giving it a comedic face like in "half baked" it has a true, life lesson image like "traffic". so watch this movie, if you're a stoner it will give you insight into something you love, if you don't do drugs it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see.

the first half hour of "homegrown" was rather boring and not absorbing, but as the film progressed, so did my interest in the characters and the plot. several scenes are really scary and you fear for the main characters who you actually grow attached to. the story is about three hired hands on a hidden illegal marijuana farm in southern california. they witness the murder of the farm's owner, malcolm (john lithgow), and they take over the weed for their own. the three rather simple-minded farm hands soon get swept up into a scary world of mafia and local interest, while all of the time trying to convince everyone that malcolm is still alive. while the movie had several faults and a slow beginning, it turned out to be worthwhile. 7/10 stars.

another brilliant portrayal by kiefer sutherland who plays mickey hayden, a cop dealing with psychic visions of murdered victims. i absolutely love movies dealing with the psychic realm, and i wasn't disappointed with "eye of the killer" (aka after alice). i only wish the movie had been released theatrical first.

alice is the kind of movie they made in the 30's and 40's. never attempts to be an "event". just wants to entertain. and it does. i was surprised by kiefer sutherland. in a role that could be a cliche, he made it real. the plot does make allusions to alice in wonderland. a guy dressed in white does go through a hole and kiefer does fall down one. like alice the plot does twist and turn, but with a freshness you don't see in small movies. i loved the direction, sutherland, just a very fast paced and interesting movie.

the cure is one of the few movies i rated 10 out of 10. i mean, everything is flawless for me in this motion picture. i saw it almost a year ago, and yet i remember many of the scenes, especially the final touching scene that comes with the credits.the two boy actors clearly gave everything they could and this greatly contributes the excellent storyline, making the film perfect.the message is clear - friendship, and it's displayed throughout the whole thing.i have nothing more to say here. simplicity is one of the things i love so much about this film. and of course, it's fun and moving at the same time, suiting people of any age.10/10, nicely done!

"the cure" is a very touching and poignant drama. the film focuses on two neighborhood boys who become good friends. one of the boys has aids. the boys become good friends despite erik's apprehensiveness at first. the film shows the boys journey to discover "the cure", which is in ohio according to "the national examiner", and how it affects their relationship. the acting is wonderful (i have never seen annabella sciorra do better), and the movie is just plain touching. i couldn't stop crying with the shoe scene. this is a good tearjerker. keep the kleenex nearby. 8/10

this was truly a heart warming movie. it is filled with so many messages. loyalty, friendship, sickness, death, and the paranoia society has concerning anything they don't understand. i have shed a few tears during certain movies, but this movie kept the tears flowing.

there was nothing else on tv yesterday afternoon, so i thought "okay, let's watch this." i didn't know the plot and i had no expectation whatsoever, i was thinking in a few minutes or so i will channel surf again. but then story started to unfold, and the characters played beautifully by the two boys. the story did have unrealistic parts and scenes, but overall it was a real good movie. very well worth watching.

junior high and high school teachers will find "the cure" an excellent teaching tool, both as a companion to "huckleberry finn" or as a stand-alone lesson. although aids is supposed to be the main theme, the strong sup-text of friendship and love, as they evolve between eric and dexter, is a powerful message for teenagers. writing prompts centered around the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective. i also suggest directed class discussion about how eric evolves from manipulative user to loving friend.

*** contains spoilers ***a lovely film this, starring brad renfro and the ever wonderful joseph mazzello. i like joseph mazzello, out of all his films i've seen to date i've loved every single one of them for many different reasons and the cure is no different. brad renfro does very well in this movie as well. the cure is a drama/coming of age movie from the viewpoint of an ill child and his friend.the basic idea is: dexter (joseph mazzello) has aids. he ends up befriending the kid next door (brad renfro) but erik's mum is very narrow-minded, ill-informed and somewhat "thick" when it comes to dexter's illness. she thinks aids is contagious like the common cold so doesn't want her son going anywhere near dexter.after many attempts at making their own cure with no success, the boys go on their way to new orleans to find the cure after reading a pamphlet about it. after getting their kicks from playboy magazine, dexter's health goes south shortly afterwards and as his health detoriates, there's still enough life in the boy alongside erik for two pranks of pretending to stop breathing. unfortunately, poor dexter does indeed die from his illness, leaving poor erik behind to wonder why he couldn't find the cure. throughout the movie he ends up bonding more with dexter's mother than his own.it is a very heartwarming movie to watch and is not absolutely perfect (movies rarely are) but you won't care less about that as you get involved in the film more. a must for joseph mazzello fans, one of his best performances ever. very well recommended must-see movie - if you can find a copy :)

for all the viewers who have seen 'the cure' would agree with me on this comment that it is a superb movie and is very heartwarming. joseph mazzello and brad renfro prove their star quality in this movie, along with dexter's (mazzello) mother annabella sciorra.when i first watched the cure on tv, i didn't know what to expect, but as i watched this masterpiece it soon became clear what it was about. dexter an 11 year old boy who is plagued with aids, sits around his backyard playing with his toys when one day he meets his next door neighbour eric, which at first is a little awkward for the 2 boys, but they soon became good friends.during the film, i kept wondering what would happen to the two boys, as they kept me wondering. i wondered how the heck they would get to new orleans sitting a door with a sea biscuit under it pulling an inflatable crocodile behind it. there were other great scenes throughout the movie.but the part that reached out to me was the part when dexter's health started to deteriorate. you just couldn't help but wonder if he was going to make it but towards the end you find out. i thought at the first prank they played, that dexter was really dead he obviously wasn't, silly me. but when they play the third, something is very wrong. dexter doesn't get up to laugh nor does he show any kind of laughter. at that point the victim of their prank soon announces that poor dexter had died. at that part i lost it. i balled my eyes out, and from that scene onwards i was crying. you just have to. as the end nears you start to understand eric's loss and then the movie ends on a nice note with dexters shoe floating ever so slowly down the river.overall this movie was excellent. it has laughter, adventure, emotion and sadness etc. when you put that in a blender you get an excellent, must watch film. peter horton has done a great job directing this film and i believe its certainly one of his best. but for now, i will try to search for this movie on dvd, if it exists that is. once again a superb movie that will take you on an emotional rollercaoster.

this was such a beautiful film. such an amazing performance from joseph and brad. very innocently written and performed. a must see !! i cried my eyes out almost through the entire movie. this is a movie that every family should sit down with their children to watch, it does teach us all a very important lesson in life and how we should be approaching the harsh subject of aids, how we should be teaching our children to cope with it and people around them. not only with aids, but with any terminal illness. i hadn't even heard of this movie until i scrolled through t.v. one day and happen to run across it. i recommend everyone to watch this, just don't forget your box of tissues. more movies should be made like this one. extremely heartwarming.

i really liked the movie, thought it was very entertaining as well as dramatic. but i just had a question about the music is the movie. i haven't been able to find any kind of soundtrack(if there even is one). and specifically ,i was wondering if anyone could tell me the name of the song that is playing while the boys are going down the river on their way to new orleans? i thought it was something along the lines of "my great escape", but i've searched on the internet, books, pretty much everything i could think of to try to, and i just can't find it anywhere. if someone could help out it would be greatly appreciated. thanks.

the cure is a fantastic film about a boy with aids. i've cried about 4 times watching this film and it's just so sad. i can't promise everyone will cry watching this but it will make you want to. very emotional and very sad, the cure is a must-see movie. it shows you the meaning of friendship and love and is an extremely great movie.at first i didn't think it would be as great and wondered why my mum always cried watching it. but now i know it's a stunning film that is so original and is so close to real life situations, unlike most of the other films that doesn't make sense. words cannot describe the greatness of the cure, you just have to see it.

when the movie "the cure" starts, we find out about a young man named erik (brad renfro). erik is a teenage boy living with his paranoid mother, and living next door to him is a young boy named dexter (joseph mazello). one day, erik and dexter connect and head up to the supermarket, where dexter gets his first taste of butterfinger. when erik learns out that dexter has aids, he tries leaves-and-water tea to make it better. but when the front cover of the national enquirer says a new orleans doctor has found the cure for aids, the two boys will stop at nothing to get to new orleans for the cure.in my opinion, "the cure" is easily one of the best friendship movies ever made. it shows unconditional love between a boy, his (new) best friend, and his best friend's mom. everything is so well done, nothing needs to be changed. not only do i give this a 10/10 for being a fantastic friendship movie, but it also is a sad, but humorous, and fun aids movie. and the tragic finale with dexter's contraction of aids is enough to make me shed a tear. very well done.

i remember when this film came out, and watched it a few times on vhs. i was so glad when it was finally released on dvd. i was hoping for widescreen, but at the point would take what was available. i love how they used color in the film, the outdoor scenes are so alive with color. the trees are the greenest i've ever seen. most of the film was shot in stillwater, minnesota, a beautiful town located on the st. croix river. they must have really scouted locations for filming, because they did a great job. the story is well written, and directed. i would rate this as one of peter horton's best. i'm also surprised that andrew dintenfass (the director of photography) hasn't done more. he did an incredible job. the acting also rates up there. it's amazing to see two actors of such a young age pull off this type of film. annabella sciorra did a great job as dexter's mother. who wouldn't want her as a mother.

even though this film is 11 years old, i just rented it yesterday, and i found it to be a really touching film. the story of true friendship in the face of a very real monster is an inspiration and quite touching.while i did not care much for the amount of language used by some of the young actors--especially from renfro--i understand that art is imitating life. renfro once again does a magnificent job of the rough-and-tough, very (and i mean very) disturbed wannabe bully (his role in the client comes to mind), and mazzello does a wonderful job of the witty, somewhat quirky, dexter--a child who realizes that his life must end too soon.while there are so many touching and funny moments in the movie, i have to say that my favorite was when the boys were cornered by pony in the abandoned church, and dexter (mazzello) cut himself, saying his blood was poison. while very resourceful, and somewhat amusing seeing a grown man running away from two little kids, it's one of the hardest scenes in the film.definitely check this one out, but prepared with your kleenex--you'll need it!

the best movie about friendship! especially between an aids infected person and a " normal " person. this is a great movie for everyone to see even though there is strong language used. i have seen it 25 times.

the subject of children being terminally ill is difficult and saddening but 'the cure' successfully portrays the idea that it doesn't have to be all doom and gloom and, if anything, children need to have hope and delight in their lives if they are to find peace before the end. it is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhood.the film sees erik, a dysfunctional adolescent boy with a distant mother, moving into a new area where their next-door neighbour is eleven-year-old dexter, who contracted aids through a blood transfusion. after his initial fears and ignorance over aids are allayed, erik befriends dexter and their almost fraternal friendship sees them embark on a journey down the mississippi to where they have heard about a new orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the disease.the talent from the two young leads of brad renfro and joseph mazzello, who play erik and dexter respectively, is exceptional. brad was able to portray erik's harder edge without comprising the subtle childish innocence inherent to the character while joseph depicts the sense of vulnerability to dexter's character but injects the right amount of boyish enthusiasm and zeal to highlight that his illness doesn't mean he still isn't a child who wants to run and play like any other eleven-year-old boy. the pair's interactions create a feel in the audience that these are two boys who are genuinely close and they carry the film well. annabella sciorra also delivers a touching performance as dexter's mother linda, who adores her son and delights in seeing him thrive with this new friendship to erik and eventually becomes a surrogate mother-figure to the other boy.set against an excellent soundtrack, 'the cure' is a very bittersweet film that manages to flawlessly weave the story of boyhood friendship that survives unflinchingly in the midst of prejudice and terminal illness without resorting to sappiness or unnecessary saccharine sweet scenes. a very interesting reflection in the film is that is it the adults who have the problem with dexter's aids status whereas the children, even the 'bullies', come to accept him as they would any other. what is also very touching is how, despite erik's streetwise nature, he is the more naive one in his determination to cure dexter while the younger boy has this haunting sense that he knows his fate but is swept away by his best friend's enthusiasm for a cure.i highly recommend 'the cure' for it is rare to find a film that is simultaneously sad and uplifting.

way back in 1996, one of the airliner pilots where i used to work gave me a copy of this film. he told me that it'll make me cry. i never believed him and we even made bets. after seeing the film....i cried a bucket! even after the seeing the film, i found myself in the bathroom crying. it was actually the most touching film i have ever seen. i like the part where dexter's mom confronted eric's mother the line went something like... "your sons' best friend just died today..and it's not gonna be easy...if you ever lay your hands on him again...i will kill you!" the last part where dexter took eric's shoe was a scene that never left my mind until today. honestly, just thinking about it makes my eyes teary. a story of what true friendship is all about. my girlfriend loved it too... she hated me for letting her see the film. i cried a bucket, she cried a river.

very nice movie! i was browsing the channels on my tv and i usually ignore the channels that air drama movies but then i saw this channel that airs old school movies and it is where i saw this movie. at first, when i saw the title "the cure" i thought it's gonna be boring but then i got hooked when i saw brad renfro was in this movie (because of one of my favorite movie of all time is "the client" where brad also stars). then the scenes was getting better and better. the story is so beautiful and very touching! i cried hard in this movie which i don't usually do. great casting! and there are so many beautiful lines/quotes in this movie which is very striking and made me cry hard! now, i bought my own copy on dvd and i always recommend it to everyone!

i had seen the cure when i was a kid and i loved it then. now, years later, i got a hold of a copy almost by accident, and watched it again. being a kid, you don't really have the ability to procure things for yourself that you want, that is usually a prerogative of your parents - but when i watched it again now i felt sorry that i did not do more to get a copy of this movie back then, and consequently almost forgot about it until today.this really is a beautiful movie. it tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a hard-edged, misfit kid - who takes his cues from his horrible, abusive mother - and his neighbor, a slightly younger boy who has aids.right, you say. another one of "those". a tear jerker. a bucket movie. a morality tail. yeah, i know, i hate those too. only this one isn't. it is one of the very few movies among those many i have seen that pulls off a very rare trick: it conveys a truly sad story (and yes, a morality tale) but without a single moment where it feels cheesy, forced or in any other way "hollywoody". it shows a real relationship between two real boys, who interact as real kids do. and through that interaction the good-natured, loving character of the older boy, eric, starts to shine through his "tough-guy" persona, as he takes on a kind of big-brotherly care for dexter, his hiv-positive younger neighbor. together, they embark on an adventure to find a cure - which to erik seems to be just around the corner - so that all this silly aids thing will go away and they can be friends forever.the production is top notch. but, of course, what really carries this movie, is the performances of the two leads - brad renfro and joseph mazzello. especially mazzello, who is simply stunning - he does convey a sense of frailty needed for an ailing boy, but at the same time he manages to make dexter a truly energetic and determined character. he shines at the scene where the boys confront pony: his impulse to protect his older friend lunges him forth, drives him to say what he says - and only afterwards, the horror is depicted on his face, as he realizes that what he himself said is true: his blood is poison... renfro also has his moments, in particular the scenes with his mother: he depicts perfectly how this macho, street-wise kid is left completely frozen and numb when faced with his abusive, storming mother, and can't get a word in to contradict her as she forbids his relationship with the ailing boy out of her fear and ignorance. annabella sciorra also gives a memorable performance as dexter's mother, who ultimately becomes, in a sense, a mother figure to erik as well.i've first seen this film when i was at school back in america, and loved it - not at all a given concerning movies of this sort. but the behavior of the kids in this movie was so real, i could easily relate to them. ironically enough, the teacher who had shown us this movie (a wonderful woman, i'm still in touch with her) got in trouble for it, as some uptight parent complained about it having the scene when the two boys are looking at a playboy... pathetic. seriously, will americans ever get over this ridiculous phobia, i do not know. there was a hardly-distinguishable shot of a playboy cover in the movie and thus it is not shown in schools... how sad. kids need to see this movie. it is more inspiring and educational than all the "official" after-school specials put together.oh, and one more thing. i know i'm rambling, but nevertheless... the score. it's great. i am a musician, and as such i know dave grusin from his records: he is a well known jazz pianist and record producer. up until this movie i really did not know that he did movie scores as well, even though when i later checked i found out that i had unknowingly watched several movies he worked on. really, a wonderful job there.all in all, a solid ten. i'd recommend this movie to anyone. and i'm definitely going to see it with my younger siblings - they can use watching a film like this among all the standard special-effect hysteria they usually see.

unbelievably close to real life feelings and emotions captured by joseph mazzello as a hemophiliac child affected by aids and his new young neighbor, a wanna-be tough redneck played to perfection by brad renfro. although the story may seem slightly farfetched (the two boys attempt to river-raft several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have the cure to aids), the emotion, actions and interactions of all characters involved are tragically close to real life. being a "big brother" to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after this film was released, i strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with aids. superb direction by peter horton creates the perfect mood and setting for each scene and draws the viewer into the various emotions affected by friendship, illness, prejudice and the final parting of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity.

this is one of the most touching films i had ever watched. no movie has effected me the way this one did. this is a great film and you have to see for yourself. i'm normally impregnable with these sob story movies but this one did it for me. i was in tears at the end. you'll yearn for the friendship that is portrayed in this movie. if i can give this movie a billion stars i could.

for unknown reasons this beautiful masterpiece didn't get well-deserved recognition and has been vastly under-appreciated by many american movie critics. so it's easy to understand that i've met lots of troubles trying to find this movie. finally i watched it and it was so beautiful, sincere and poignant that for the first time in my life i watched one movie five times in one week after getting the tape. the story is focused on the friendship between two young boys erik and dexter, eleven and twelve years old, who are very different from each other but they are becoming the best (and only) friends. the beauty and sincerity of their friendship have been shown in the cure so sincere and naturally as it has never been before. there are so many beautiful, heartfelt and poignant scenes (particularly on the river), which strike the heart and can't leave any human indifferent to them. the movie also is full of incredibly powerful and emotional symbolism, (particularly strong with erik's shoe) which also greatly increases visual impression from such beautiful work. the story, written by robert kuhn, is well written and on the contrary to overwhelming majority of modern hollywood's products practically every scene, every phrase and every sentence in the movie is meaningful and bring something important about characters and relations between them. peter horton, who as i know had no major experience in movie directing before, showed his great abilities and talents in this sphere. the cinematography is also superb with perfectly selected locations for the movie, but the most important is perfect acting, which with all above mentioned makes the cure one of the best movies ever. both brad renfro as erik and joseph mazello as dexter created wonderful atmosphere of sincere friendship and magnificent chemistry between two main characters. only one this movie (i haven't seen most of their other works) is enough to name them as one of the best actors of their generation. annabelle sciorra also give a terrific performance as dexter's mother. it's terribly sad that such talented actors didn't get wide recognition, while numerous overrated stars enjoy enormous publicity and huge salaries. finally it would be unfair not to mention amazing soundtrack written by david grusin, and terrific mark cohn's song (one of the best songs that i've ever heard in the movies) my great escape. so all that i can say about the cure is one simple word  great. at any point of view this movie is a beautiful, heartfelt and inspiring work of all people involved in making of this masterpiece. i have to credit all those people who put their hearts and souls into the movie and universal pictures, which among numerous formulaic commercial projects has found a way to make such a beautiful movie. but such movie so rarely come to movie theaters that very often studios themselves don't realize what gem they have made that they're unable to provide respective marketing campaign. the only one minor drawback about the cure for me is its short length (only 97 minutes). i don't want to write more about the movie because it's simply impossible to put its beauty and sincerity into words, so if you have any opportunity for watching the cure, rent it or buy it and you wouldn't be disappointed. 10 out of 10. sorry for my bad english.

the cure is an outstanding real-life drama that deals with a very sensitive subject. it is the story of the profound and dear friendship between two boys, eric and dexter. the latter has acquired aids from a blood transfusion. thus he and his mom (annabella sciorra) have become outcasts, shunned by the public and labeled as dangerous company, basically due to a common lack of public knowledge of the disease.when eric (brad renfro, known from 'the client' and 'apt pupil') and his mom move into the house next to them, he has to deal with public insults and the fear of catching aids himself. however, eric overcomes his fear and risks everything. at first he starts talking to dexter, but eventually he climbs over the fence and joins the witty boy (played by jurassic park's joseph mazzello) and his games. very quickly he develops a real friendship with dexter, who is delicately built and frail due to his condition.the central theme of the movie  the theme which makes it pervasively authentic and tragic at the same time  is how eric and dexter try to find the ultimate cure. at first they experiment with all kinds of plants and leaves  which is very naive, but also genuine at the same time, as it shows how young kids deal with such heinous diseases and how strongly they still believe in the magic of the world. when they hear about an alleged cure which has been developed in the south, they do not hesitate and take off for an adventure that will bring them even closer together and symbolizes the ultimate quest for hope.so they board a raft and head southwards on the mississippi river. what starts as a real adventure becomes a dangerous undertaking, which is emotionally intriguing and instructive at the same time. the scene when dexter reveals his fears and talks about the end of the universe, where everything is dark and cold, eric hands him his sneaker, a symbol that wherever the boy may have to go, eric is and will always be with him; he will never have to be alone. this sequence, which is one of the most compelling ones of the movie, features a very convincing interaction between the two actors, who manage to avoid awkward and corny dialogs and deliver a very genuine performance that is eventually smashing in its tenderness and honesty.i will not go any further in outlining the plot, as i do not intend to give away too much information. the ending however is emotionally tough and makes the audience so much a part of the tragedy that everyone who watches the movie will feel personally affected. this aspect makes this movie so strong, so outstanding and so convincing. the emotional burden on every character is so real and so thrashing that even the tougher members of the audience might need some hankies.a 10 is doing justice to this movie and is not too high a rating. there is hardly any other movie i have seen in my life so far that handles such an emotional issue with so much wit and sensibility. it is the story of how two boys make each other's life richer and how they teach each other lessons of life. thus dexter overcomes his isolation and sadness, and eric learns what really counts in life; and both of them realize how much of a gift real friendship is when it comes to the hardest moments of life.this movie is tragic  but its message is sheer inspiration.

and i do not understand why the show gets so much beating. in my opinion this show really is excellent. well the first two episodes were not that great but it picks up a load of momentum at the third episode. which seems to be typical for a steve moffat sitcom. i would rate it among the best sitcoms britain has ever produced.the show itself is a farce at its best, it is not along the lines of fawlty towers, but you definitely can rank it as high as a black adder, coupling, or the young ones! i am watching the first season, and all i can say is that i am happy i bought the dvd!the problem probably with this show is and why it got smacked so hard, according to the internet, that the original press release compared it to fawlty towers, and everyone was disappointed it was not! well even green wing is closer to fawlty towers than this show, all i can say is clear your mind from every prejudice, give the show at least a run until (including episode 3) and then decide for yourself!all i can say is thanks steve moffat for writing it and thanks for the entire staff pulling it off!

this one of the best and funniest comedy series i have ever seen! all characters are brilliant.mr. slatt (david bamber) is a very very irritated man, irritated by everything and anyone.he wants to do things and handle situations as best as he possibly can, but he never gets it right and only gets himself deeper and deeper in trouble. not supported by his wife janet, who only tries to get him deeper and deeper into the trouble he is getting himself into (and really does not need the help at all!).all characters are played/portrayed brilliantly. just imagine sending your kid(s) to a school like this.it is unbelievable that people do not like it (maybe some don not get the many many plays on words, that are featured many times per episode).it is also unbelievable that there is still no dvd release of it. there are only 2 series!so please, release it, let it go! so the fans can and will enjoy it!try it, you might just like it!!!just some names & words from the series: pumpman, man helmet, hot bitch, mount suzy, travis fellatio, cockfoster, arshead (and many many more).

i don't think this cartoon was as bad as some may think. of course, i was only five at the time it came out. but, i did find it very entertaining at the time and would still give it a look today if given the opportunity. batman and robin being voiced by adam west and burt ward was a nice touch, and gave it a sense of familiarity for me as i was also watching re-runs of the campy 1960's live action show "batman" at that age. this cartoon also introduced some new twists i had forgotten all about, like "bat-mite" for instance. looking back on it, i'm sure he was likely as annoying as many think, but he didn't bother me much at the time. the best i can recall, his voice sounded like a cross between dumb donald and orko. gee, i wonder why? :) anyway, give it a look if you can and make up your own mind. you might be surprised.

interesting story and sympathetic treatment of racial discrimination, son of the gods is rather too long and contains some hammy acting, but on the whole remains a fascinating film.story about a chinese passing as white (rchard barthelmess) starts as barthelmess leaves college after being insulted by a trio of brainless co-eds. he embarks on a world tour to discover himself and ends up as secretary to a british playwright (claude king). in monte carlo he meets beautiful alanna wagner (constance bennett) and they fall in love. but when she discovers he is chinese she goes berserk in a memorable scene.plagued by guilt and love, alanna goes into a mental spiral and makes a few attempts to contact barthelmess. after his father dies he takes over the business (banking?) and dons chinese garb as a symbol of his hatred of the white race that has spurned him. after a san francisco detective tells him the truth about his birth, barthelmess makes the decision to honor his chinese father and mother.and i agree that one reviewer here never saw this film. alanna declares her love for sam before he tells her of his recent discovery. and that makes all the difference in this film.barthelmess and bennett each have a few scenes where they chew the scenery, but on the whole this is a solid and interesting drama. frank albertson is good as the nice college pal, claude king is solid as the playwright bathurst, bess flowers has one scene as an oklahoma indian, and e. alyn warren is the chinese father, dorothy mathews is nasty alice. not so good are anders randolf as bennett's father and mildred van dorn as eileen. also note the gorgeous blonde to the right of barthelmess at the roulette table. what a stunner whoever she was!

a wealthy young man, raised as a son of the gods, must confront his chinese heritage while living in a white world.although the premise upon which this film is based is almost certainly a biological impossibility and the secret of the plot when revealed at the movie's conclusion makes all which has preceded it faintly ludicrous, the story still serves up some decent entertainment and good acting.richard barthelmess has the title role as the sweet-natured oriental whose life is terribly complicated because he looks caucasian. barthelmess keeps the tone of his performance serious throughout, gazing intently into the middle distance (a mannerism he developed during silent days) whenever his character is indecently misused. he makes no attempt to replicate his classic performance in d. w. griffith's broken blossoms (1919) and this is to his credit. beautiful constance bennett is the millionaire's daughter who makes barthelmess miserable. she is gorgeous as always, but her behavior does not endear her to the viewer and her terrible illness in the final reel is kept mercifully off screen.multi-talented frank albertson has a small role as barthelmess' improvident buddy. serene e. alyn warren and blustery anders randolf play the leading stars' very different fathers, while claude king distinguishes his brief appearance as the english author who befriends barthelmess.movie mavens will recognize little dickie moore, uncredited, playing barthelmess as a tiny child.the original technicolor of the flashback sequence has faded with time to a ruddy tint. the shot purporting to be the south of france instead looks suspiciously like avalon on santa catalina island, off the coast of southern california.

i'm sure the film contains certain gaps in logic, but i was so enthralled by it that i really didn't care. the movie plays out like a fun, lighthearted teen romp combined with a schwarzenegger-type action flick. it's packed with action, packed with excitement and has some humorous moments as well. sean astin is fun to watch, and i haven't seen louis gossett, jr. since i saw "diggstown" in theaters. he is a fine, underrated actor and i love watching him on screen. i just wonder what he's doing now. unfortunately, he might be starring in a lot of those direct-to-video flicks. hopefully, my assumption is wrong. anyway, this is a fun, edge-of-your-seat thriller and i definitely suggest you check it out. my score: 7 (out of 10)

'toy soldiers' is the story of five misfits boys (most noteably being sean astin, wil wheaton, and kieth coogan) attempt to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the american government imprisons the leader's father. lou gosset jr. plays the headmaster of the school, a headstrong guy who tries to instill in his students a sense of discipline.'toy soldiers' is a funny and pretty cool action, and certainly the better of hostage-crisis-at-school movies. i think most of the appeal comes from the teen cast, but also, the terrorists don't come off as completely useless whereas in some movies, they never seem to be quite the intimidating group that they should. trapped inside the boarding school, and threatened to be killed if the military or police interferes, this is a very formidable challenge for these group of guys who plan to save the school. they're actually pretty clever about it, too.i was surprised that it was a pretty good movie. it keeps a steady pace and doesn't get ridiculously sentimental or anything like that. astin and gosset jr. give good performances. i, too, agree that this is an underrated action movie.

i liked this movie.no one i know likes it, but i do.i didn't like it as much as the first one but it was still good. the script and plot may not have changed at all, but the story was better than caddyshack 1.the only reason i didn't like caddyshack 2 is...no rodney dangerfield!i think the movie would be better if rodney dangerfield had jackie mason's part. although i did like jackie mason in the movie, it would be alot better if they kept rodney dangerfield.another flaw in the movie, that i didn't hate as much, was dan akroyd. the movie was done 8 years after the first one. bill murray, "carl", could've quit his job as an assistant greenskeeper and joined the military, you know? if warner bros. had thought of that, it could've made the movie better, also.this was my comment for caddyshack ii.i give it 8.2 out of 10it could've been better, but good nonetheless.if you've seen caddyshack 1 and are debating on whether or not to see caddyshack 2, i say give it a try.

the only conceivable flaw of this film is it's title!! please stop comparing it to the first! i did in my previous review only to separate it from the first. if you haven't seen the movie and are curious, totally forget about the first and invent a different name for this. there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own. this is a great exponent of screwy mid-80s comedy. i seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first. anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus. i maintain, the only reason this is in the imdb bottom 100 is because of its title. i usually hate movies like these (i.e. adam sandler, will farrell, farrelly bros....), but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically. i dunno, maybe it's like a bad relationship i can't get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure. either way, this is the single most underrated movie of the 80s behind 'the stunt man.'robert stack- we love you!!! (1919-2003)

amazing, one of my favorite movies way down at the bottom. guess i can take some pride in not liking what "the general populace" tends to go for. jackie mason is hilarious in this movie, and so's randy quaid. i can never get enough of his "strong-arm" tactics, just like in moving. he was also notable in national lampoon's christmas vacation. love that guy.

i am in a vast minority here. i also didn't much care for the original caddyshack, aside from the chase/murray duo scene and select rodney jokes. okay, break it down: rodney vs. jackie- both jewish and have similar humor. rodney's a bigger name and more distinct. jackie has an incidental and more observational approach to his jokes and is more 'up yours' in this sequel. jackie's attitude toward everything is memorable and in a way, inspirational! his quick lines and over-confidence left me wishing i could express myself in such a way. rodney was good, but there wasn't enough of him, and he was more 'in your face' and dismissive. jackie, in a rare film appearance, makes a perfect sub for rodney (come on, a gun shaped hair dryer?!?!) really, look at the little things!stack vs. knight- both play snobby yuppies very well. ted knight, despite his wonderful tv/film career, kinda shows his age. but, he does pull off the snobbish demands of the part and we want to see him fall. ted looks kinda weak and is pretty annoying, playing his anger and frustration too slapstick, while stack is more incidentally snide and vengeful; you really hate him and enjoy see him constantly fail. stack wins with me.murray vs. aykroyd- well, both had great, vintage snl-like scenes with the ever-present and enjoyable chevy chase (ty webb). i did like the murray/chase one better. murray plays his great, annoying, chatty character with obvious improv skill and is loveable- yet annoying. and the exact same can be said for aykroyd. both get annoying after a while, but it's a tie.i really loved part 2 over the first. they are 2 totally different mooded films. part one is more drug/bathroom/sex humor with a cast full of great names. part 2 uses golf as a backdrop for a 'stick-it-to-the-rich' type of comedy that makes one feel better about being working class. 80s script? yes. a bit far-fetched? yes, but wasn't the first? an insult to the sport of golf? yes, it's a movie. thin story? yes, it's a comedy with actual humor- not 'dances with wolves'!! besides- part 2 has a much better soundtrack!! please- don't expect this to be a sequel to part one!! it is 98% its own movie and shouldn't even have the name 'caddyshack' in it. that said, i am a big fan of caddyshack 2 and it is a great exponent of 80s fluff entertainment with quality humor. viva jackie mason!!! to all the reducers- lighten up! it's a great comedy of its own. randy quaid was wonderful, jonathan silverman was wonderful, heck, everyone was!! all this chatting and now i feel like watching it! i think i will

i have no idea why everyone hates this movie to call it garbage a travesty an unexceptable sequel is just unfair i mean what else could they have made for a sequel then. cause seriously i think it should have had a sequel (rodney dangerfield) says: hey everyone were all going to get laid and then a little dancing goffer and thats it thats the end of caddyshack even though the film rating on first one was (r) and the second one was (pg) it was still lots of fun .(7/10)

like richard pryor, mason never got the material he deserved. whatever you know of him is probably wrong. get past the accent and go see his stand-up. you'll be very surprised -- he's one of the best stand-ups i've ever seen and i have seen a lot of stand-up comedy (from lenny bruce to eddie murphy to jerry seinfeld to chris rock -- jackie mason is definitely up there). he's known for being a comic's comic. even howard stern said he is one of the top 3 funniest comedians ever.the accussation that mason is no dangerfield is ridiculous. dangerfield is known for having been a huge mason fan. dangerfield's career was going nowhere for a long time until he started following mason's shows. that is when mason provided dangerfield with inspiration for his, "get no respect" routine. while i think dangerfield is great, see them both do stand-up and you'll see mason is the better comedian.

one of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is highly touted as an `in-name only' sequel. there's nothing wrong with that except this: the return of chevy chase as ty webb. this connects the viewer to this character (from the original caddyshack in 1980,) and makes fans thinking or wanting caddyshack ii to be similar to the first one.there are rumors that rodney dangerfield was supposed to return. he carried a big part of the first film, so his return would have put caddyshack 2 over the top. jackie mason is the `new' rodney for this movie and does a decent job, even though their comic deliveries are way different. dan aykroyd was great but not in the film enough. he should have been involved to the tune of how much screen time bill murray got in the first one. robert stack (airplane!) was good in the `new' ted knight/villian role. (we miss you, ted!) danny noonan should have been back. so many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later. bushwood should not have undergone the total makeover it did. instead, the characters involved, rather than the club itself, should have been the main focus like they were in the first one. when you watch this film, keep in mind that it isn't a major sequel and you may think it's another good or bad eighties comedy. fans of the first should see it but don't be shocked when the comparisons between the original and part ii are so far apart.

everyone is entitled to an opinion. the only critic who counts is yourself. i think this is a great movie. much better than the original.in "caddyshack", rodney dangerfield is funny, but obnoxious. he was asked to do the sequel, but things got in the way. jackie mason shows the saying that "less is more". he is funny, but a man with real family issues, a more rounded person. it's no drama, but a movie that makes you feel. actually in some points, you feel sorry for jackie mason, especially when his daughter walks out on him.it has a good soundtrack, and overall, a good sorry. a good end to the series.in the tv show "alf", alf says that he cried in "terms of endearment". the wife , kate tanner, played by anne schedeen, also says he cried at "caddyshack 2".

seriously. if this had been the first shack movie, it would have been passable as funny, silly and goofy. light satire commentary on the class system would make this an enjoyable late-night rental.however, everyone wants to compare it to the first film, and maybe that's not fair. the first film is a cult classic; what could possibly follow it up? nothing. so take this second film as a stand alone, and it certainly has its moments.jackie mason is amusing, doing his best rodney-wannabe impersonation. is he as good as rodney? no. are his lines as good? no. but he is funny. the rest of the cast falls in line as being decent, but not outstanding. you'll recognize faces amongst the cast and wonder how they got to where they are today.the film is predictable, but aren't most in this genre? again, it's not the best comedy you'll see, but if you like cannonball run-type fun, you'll enjoy this one.

caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly-held classic. people have criticised the film on a lot of grounds, but they all ultimately hark back to the fact that this is not caddyshack.i would begin by saying that we should just take caddyshack out of the equation and consider this film on its own merits, but i think that would be unfair. the movie does have a lot in common with its predecessor. the class-related themes of 'snobs versus slobs' and the desire to fit in to a class above your own are as prevalent here as they were in the first movie. the two things that are truly lacking here are bill murray and rodney dangerfield, who are replaced with dan ackroyd and jackie mason respectively.now i am not about to try and argue that ackroyd comes close to murray in the movie, but jackie mason is an admirable successor to dangerfield. he comes off as a cross between dangerfield and arnold stang, but without biting too heavily on either. i wouldn't say that he is anywhere close to being as funny as dangerfield is in caddyshack, but there is a whole lot more point to his character and his dilemma in the film.chevy chase only pops up and handful of times in the movie, which is another common complaint. maybe these particular naysayers didn't notice that he only popped up a few times in the first movie. for my money, his scenes here are a lot funnier, if somewhat over-directed.while i'm on the subject, it is really the over-direction of this movie that brings it down. it comes across as far more self-conscious in its attempts to get a laugh. many of the jokes are laboured and there's far too much of the gopher, who seems to have taken on a far more anthropomorphic personality and a voice, just in case we didn't grasp the idea that its meant to be funny.characters are similarly hammered home, particularly the smarmy yuppy kids. jackie mason rarely misses a beat, and is consistently likable and very funny, but we didn't need the tango sequence at all! the director is clearly not of the same school of thought as harold ramis. not to suggest that caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a little overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with a quirky music cue.all things considered, this is a fun, goofy movie with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at the time were saying. don't be put off by the appallingly low rating on imdb, check it out for yourself.

the casting of robert culp is probably the only decent move the production team made with this film. falk and culp were marvellous, but as culp was not falks nemesis this time, chemistry was lacking. columbo is only as strong as his opposite number, and this time he didn't have one.

i may be a good old boy from virginia in the confederate states of america, but this man does it for me. that mustache gets me riled up. i remember when i first saw a video of his. that girl he beat was amazing. the depth of his acting when they cut to his weathered facade was a new level of masculinity. it reminds me of the granite sculptures of our mt. rushmore. if i could ask him one question, it would be,"if you were a hot-dog, would you eat yourself?" will orhan be doing a reunion tour? take note from the greats like gordon lightfoot, true music from the heart never fades away. vive la john denver. gracias my friend, o.f.f.l. (orhan fan for life)

first of all, i should point out that i really enjoyed watching this documentary. not only it had great music in it, but the shots and the editing were also wonderful. however, all these positive things about the film does not change the fact that it plays to the orientalist "east meets west" cliché that bothers many turks like myself. okay, this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary turkish music in a very stylish manner which is a good thing, something that would show ignorant europeans and americans that this country is not just about murdering armenians and kurds. however, the problematic of the film is that it looks at what it defines as "east" from the eyes of the "west". i mean, like one jazz musician says in the film, maybe there is no east and west, maybe it is just a myth, a lie created by the ruling leaders of "western" countries in order to keep fear and hostility alive so that they could continue ruling the world and "keep the cash flowing"? why don't you think about that?

lloyd hamilton was one of the most imaginative (and among the funniest) of all the silent-film comedians. why is he utterly forgotten? unfortunately, the original negatives for a large percentage of his films were lost when the fox warehouse burnt in the early 1930s. hamilton was not handsome or graceful like chaplin, keaton and lloyd; nor was he dapper, like raymond griffith. and unlike harry langdon and (again) chaplin, hamilton did not try for audience sympathy.however, his films were hugely popular at the time of their original release, and they remain hilarious today. oscar levant once claimed that he asked chaplin if there was any other comedian whom he'd ever envied, and chaplin instantly named lloyd hamilton. the character most frequently portrayed by hamilton on screen -- a flat-capped naff, with fastidious hand gestures and a duck-like walk -- was later adapted by vaudeville comedian eddie garr (teri garr's father), and further adapted by jackie gleason as his 1950s tv character 'the poor soul'.'the movies', directed pseudonymously by roscoe arbuckle, is one of hamilton's most innovative shorts, and it's hilarious. we first see him as a country boy, bidding farewell to his family outside their homespun cottage, on his way to the big city. then he steps away from the cottage, and we see that it's in the big city, with traffic booming all round him!eventually, our hero ends up at a restaurant (uncredited, but it's the montmartre cafe in downtown l.a.) where all the movie actors eat between takes. there's an amusing gag when hamilton's bumpkin character meets three actors in costume and makeup as presidents washington, lincoln and roosevelt: this gag would have been funnier if the impostors looked more like the originals. finally, our lad seats himself at a table, hoping to meet a celebrity. sure enough, entering the restaurant and sitting at the very next table is a big movie star ... none other than lloyd hamilton! there's a very well-made double-exposure shot -- the join is nearly invisible -- when lloyd hamilton as himself greets lloyd hamilton as the country boy.sadly, hamilton's peak period of creativity was very brief. he began his film career in crude slapstick films as one half of a double act (ham and bud, opposite bud duncan), and had a brief and blazing period of stardom in shorts during the late silent period. sound movies were not kind to hamilton, and he was quickly shoved down the cast list in some crude early talkies. then he died young. fortunately, 'the movies' is quite funny, and a splendid introduction to this unique comedians' style. i'll rate it 7 out of 10.

yes, i know, roscoe arbuckle didn't like to be called 'fatty', but i couldn't resist the joke.this is a fine lloyd hamilton short from his peak period, directed by roscoe. the two work together with lots of good gags and roscoe's usual attention to the details of shooting the picture in an interesting manner. most comedians preferred flat lighting and a still camera to make them more interesting. roscoe uses a couple of long tracking shots and some nice camera trickery to tell his story and to show ham as a fine actor, as well as a talented comedian.this story plays with some interesting themes, like lloyd's classic move along: here it's about perceptions of reality and the confusion that movies make of them. or you might choose to ignore such issues and laugh your head off.

"classe tous risques" feels like the granddaddy of "the sopranos" in mixing the criminal and the domestic, and of the buddy film to feel as contemporary as "reservoir dogs."even as these gangsters are affectionately entangled with wives, children, lovers and parents, they are coldly ruthless, and we are constantly reminded they are, no matter what warm situation we also see them in. they can tousle a kid's hair - and then shoot a threat in cold blood. the key is loyalty, and the male camaraderie is beautifully conveyed, without ethnic or class stereotypes, even as their web of past obligations and pay backs narrows into suspicion and paranoia, as the old gang is in various stages of parole, retirement, out on bail or into new, less profitable ventures. an intense accusation is of sending a stranger to perform an old escape scenario. it is a high point of emotion when a wife is told off that she's not the one the gangster is friends with, while virtually the only time we hear music on the soundtrack is when he recalls his wife.streetscapes in italy and france are marvelously used, in blinding daylight to dark water and highways, from the opening set up of a pair of brazen robbers -- who are traveling with one's wife and two kids. rugged, craggy lino ventura captures the screen immediately as the criminal dad. and the second thug is clearly a casually avuncular presence in their lives, as they smoothly coordinate the theft and escape, in cars, buses, on boats and motorcycles, in easy tandem. this is not the cliché crusty old guy softened with the big-eyed orphan; these are their jobs and their families and they intersect in horrific ways.the film pulls no punches in unexpectedly killing off characters, directly and as collateral damage, and challenging our sympathy for them, right through to the unsentimental end, which is probably why there was never an american remake. it seems so fresh that it's not until jean-paul belmondo enters almost a third of the way into the film, looking so insouciant as a young punk, that one realizes that this is from 1960. sultry sandra milo has smart and terrific chemistry with him, from an ambulance to an elevator to a hospital bed.while the film forum was showing a new 35 mm print with newly translated subtitles, it was not pristine. the program notes explained that the title refers to a kind of insurance policy and is pun on "tourist class."

career criminal and crime boss, abel davos (lino ventura) has been on the run for more than 10 years, hiding out in milan, italy. in his absence, he has been sentenced to death in his home country of france for his crimes. disillusioned with his life in italy and with the police there closing in on him, he decides to return to his old stomping ground in paris. sending his wife therese and two young sons ahead to nice, abel and his next in command raymond naldi do one final heist, to fund their new lives back in france. the heist proffers a meagre half million francs, way less than their sources had suggested, despite this and with the police in chase they both make it to nice, where they hideout briefly. after stealing a pleasure boat from a local, they aim to make it to san remo a tourist spot where they will blend in more readily, but they are stopped by armed customs officers on a deserted beach, a shoot out ensues and therese and naldi are both killed. a now wounded davos with two kids in tow is going to be easily spotted by police, so he calls on his old friends in paris to send help, but they have moved on since their old friend went into hiding and are not too inclined to take a risk themselves, so they send small time thief, eric stark (jean paul belmondo) to rescue him. davos is disgusted that such a lowly thief is sent to his aid, despite the fact he hits it off immediately with the charming stark, he sets out to find out why he has been snubbed, but their betrayal doesn't stop there.classe tous risques (aka the big risk) was written for the screen by former death row inmate and crime writer jose giovanni (le trou, le clan des siciliens), with ventura already on board for the project, giovanniwanted someone unique to direct the project, ventura suggested an assistant director that had caught his attention on a previous project,one claude sautet, best known at the time for assisting georges franju on les yeux sans visage. sautet immediately agreed and the rest as they say is history. sautet crafted a fine gangster film, that plays heavily on characters and relationships. davos constantly in hiding has plenty of time to reflect on his life, past, present and future, his friendships that no longer seem to be what he believed they were, his now deceased wife and what will become of his two young sons. ventura as a character actor has always amazed me, being both comfortable and convincing in both the police and criminal fraternity, here his world weary performance is sublime and powerful as his world crumbles all around him, as the loneliness and solitude of a man on the run kicks in. ventura's former profession as a pro wrestler gets plenty of use as he throws parisien hoodlums around with a consummate ease. belmondo as stark enlivens the other storyline within the film, that of his budding relationship with a girl he meets on the road trip. with his forthright charm, his coming clean to this woman in danger that he is but a "voleur" and that "the only good thing about me is my left" as he knocks out her aggressor, is also a joy to behold, as she falls for him anyway. belmondo's performance was overlooked at the time, as godard's a bout de soufflé was released only three weeks previous, godard attaining the credit for discovering the new kid on the block, his versatility within these two films, being there for all to see and admire. sautet's film is a classy affair, using plenty of attractive locations, the film also has very sparse dialogue, sautet preferring to let the actors do the work with the merest of looks or glances sufficing to further the story, needles to say this noir fan will be checking out more of sautet's work in the future.

classe tous risques (the big risk) is repeatedly recommended every time i look up a jean-pierre melville film that i had to give it a watch as soon as possible. since i've been discovering melville and seemingly working backwards through his filmography, it would be easy for me to mistake this as one of his films, but it was made in 1960, by claude sautet, before melville would come and stake his claim on french neo-noir.classe tous risques has two of the best lead men of the time, lino ventura and jean-paul belmondo. ventura plays abel, a gangster exiled in italy with his wife and two kids, who wants to come back to paris because the police are closing in on him. after a roaring and fast paced opening with a big surprise, abel eventually gets hooked up with eric stark (belmondo) who wants to get into the criminal underworld. stark becomes abel's chauffeur and eventual only friend in an underworld that turns it's back on abel after everything he's done and been through. the film shows the the duality of the two men, the older abel at the end of his time after tragedy strikes him, and the younger eric starting off the same way abel did, falling in love with a beautiful woman who sticks with her man despite the world they are a part of. it never ends pretty for them, or their loved ones. its one thing to see a individual criminal come to his demise, its different when he has loved ones he risks taking down with him.much like melville's film, the seemingly simple story gets more subtlety complicated as it goes along. as usual, as what i feel with melville's films, it left my head spinning (in a good way) and dying to re watch it again to pick up what i missed the first time. classe tous risques is a definite keeper.

"classes tous risques" is one of the best "gangsters" films noirs france has ever produced.perfect cast :lino ventura,a young jean -paul belmondo (who made "a bout de souffle",godard's thing, the same year),marcel dalio and a fine supporting cast ;brilliant script by josé giovanni -who also wrote "le trou" becker's masterpièce the same year!what a year for him!;wonderful black and white cinematography by ghislain cloquet.and taut action,first-class directing by claude sautet,who surpasses jean-pierre melville .whereas the latter films gangsters movie with metaphysical pretensions,which sometimes lasts more than two hours,claude sautet directs men of flesh and blood,and the presence of the two children adds moments of extraordinary poignancy which melville has never been able to generate .and sautet avoids pathos,excessive sentimentality:the last time ventura sees his children,coming down in the metro (subway)is a peak of restrained emotion.ventura portrays a gangster whose die is cast when the movie begins.he thinks that he can rely on his former acquaintances ,but they are all cowards -we are far from manly friendship dear to jacques becker ("touchez pas au grisbi" ) which melville was to continue throughout the sixties-sometimes abetted by mean women (the film noir misogyny par excellence),living in a rotten microcosm,ready to inform on -we are far from jean seberg's simplistic behavior in godard's "opus"-.cloquet works wonders with the picture:the scene on the beach in a starless night when the two children see their mother die after the shoot-out with the customs officers is absolutely mind-boggling.there's a good use of voice-over,which sautet only uses when necessary;thus ,the last lines make the ending even stronger than if we have attended the scenes.claude sautet had found a good niche ,and he followed the "classes tous risques" rules quite well with his follow-up "l'arme à gauche" (1965) which featured ventura again and made a good use of a desert island and a ship.had he continued in that vein,france would have had a howard hawks.in his subsequent works ,only "max et les ferrailleurs " (1971) showed something of the brilliance he displayed in the first half of the sixties.he had become ,from "les choses de la vie" onwards,the cinema de qualité director who used to focus on tender-hearted bourgeois in such works as "cesar et rosalie" (1972),"vincent françois ,paul et les autres" (1974) or "mado" (1976)

i saw this film at telluride film festival in 1997, where one of the screenwriters, josé giovanni, was being honored. it ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura. the attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous. it is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film. up there with the best of melville. (the title in english 'class all risk,' in french 'classe tous risques' is word-play on 'classe touriste,' meaning 'tourist class'.

the film classe tous risques directed by claude sautet was not a film, to be honest, i had ever really heard of until the film forum in nyc said that they would have a 2-week screening of the film, with new english subtitles. when i also read that it was in the vein of the classic french crime films ala jean pierre melville, i jumped at the chance to check it out (at best it would rank up with his great works, and at worst i would get some good popcorn in a great theater). it was well worth the admission, as classe tous risques is one of those kinds of french films that is just waiting to be re-discovered (or discovered for the first time). with terrific, tense diligence, sautet keeps the suspense at a tight pitch for the first forty minutes of the film, keeping a good (if not great) middle section, and then ending it up with what is always expected with these films, but with fascinating motivations by way of the characters. with a film in the vein of this sort, you know how it will end, but it's the cool, observant journey that counts.the film features a performance with some real truth and honesty, amid the "old-school" criminal's code, by lino ventura as aldo, who at the start of the film (one of the best beginnings to a film in this genre and country) steals a hefty amount of money with his partner in crime). when there is a sudden, ugly twist of fate on a beach late one night, aldo is again on the run with two little kids. he gets the aid of eric stark (jean-paul belmondo, a role in tune with le doulos only with a smidgen more humanity and charisma), who is also a thief and drives him into paris. but there are some problems with some of aldo's old business partner's, and one old score may be just the right ticket. a couple of times the plot may seem to be leisurely, but it isn't. like melville, sautet doesn't allow any fat to his story, and it's a very tightly structured film, with some good doses of humor here and there (i was sometimes grinning at the audacity of the criminals in the beginning chase sequence, and also with a particular woman who had a finicky thing with her cat and a fish).along with a fine score by the great george delerue, exceptional cinematography, and a mood that is seldom met let alone matched now adays, classe tous risques is a reminder of that bridge between the real old-school film-noir, and the latter day crime films. gangsters in these new sort of "thug-life" movies have a 1000th of the class and honor of the thieves in this film, and is a second banana to the works of melville and jules dassin (a compliment i assure you). that it has a good realistic, moral edge helps as well.

odd one should be able to stumble into "classe tous risques" only by chance; it should be on any "best of film-noir" list, including imdb's.lino ventura is as good as ever; knowing of his dire, delicate family situation gives extra weight to his almost expressionless face and brief dialogues. belmondo's restrained performance under sautet's firm direction only shows what a wonderful actor he could - and should -have been."classe tous risques" is utterly mininal, dry and cold, without melville's artistic scenery, pretty faces and fancy cars. it is almost film-noir meet neo-realism. davos' few, hard words to his children describing their life of secrecy from there on get a hold on your throat to the end of the film. the final sentence of the film - a voice-over telling of davos' end in no more than ten dry, sombre words - leaves you with a hard punch in the stomach.a true jewel in the great crown of french film-noir.

this movie is simply one of the best movies i have the privilage of owning. it took me years to come up with this movie and it was well worth it. the movie is meant to be anti-drug propaganda but turns itself into the opposite while not even halfway through the movie. the relished look on the faces of the players as they receive their bounty of drugs is pleasing to all those who observe. untill the final phase pf their drug induced lives, heroin comes for its say. yikes! this is the anti-drug message that was so fabulously sought. the soundtrack for this movie kicks butt! by far it is one of pink floyds best albums ever! if ever the chance, take a look, listen, and moment to witness a spectacularly made movie.

surface is one of the best shows that i have ever seen. nbc is so stupid for canceling a great show like this and worse of all only leaving it half complete. nbc or someone else should give surface at least one more season just so it can be completed. it's as if nbc gave you a book to read and half way through it they decide to take it away from you and then you can never find out the ending. i just want to see what happens to everyone and most importantly see what happens to nim. i think i can say this safely about most surface fans is that we want to save nim! nim has taken all of our hearts away and then nbc just cuts them in two. come on nbc, just give surface one more season!

it's not often that a tv series grabs me right off the bat; a recent chance download of the pilot for surface had me glued to my seat for the entirety of the episode, after which i immediately set out on a fevered search to learn everything i could about this wonderful series. to my chagrin, i found out it had been canceled after a mere 15 episodes, despite its strong ratings and extremely favorable reviews. such a shame.since then, i've acquired the remaining episodes, and found the first 5 or 6 to be among the best television i've ever watched. just fantastic from start to finish, and as another reviewer commented, i loved how they ended every episode with a huge finish. i imagine watching it each week i would've been screaming with tension and just captivated, desperately waiting for the next episode to be released. growing up, i always heard that was how early serial movies used to do it, ending with a huge cliffhanger to get the crowds back into the theater for the next episode.well, it seems for some reason or another the suits decided to kill this off, and apparently the people behind the show must've seen the writing on the wall, because after episode 6 things definitely take a turn for the worse. i wouldn't say the episodes actually become boring but a lot of the plot elements become a bit more clichéd, and i've got to say, the final episode really left me feeling cheated. i just wish the show's creators were given a fair chance. the *only* other show that left me feeling like that was the first season of stargate sg-1, which just resonated tremendously, feeling very "true", soulful and made from the heart. surface was a great series, and maybe one day, some well-heeled tv lover will see all the outpouring of emotion about the show's cancellation, and bring back this show. one can hope, at least. :)

***spoilers*** whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, surface is superbly crafted. the cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art. conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans). close encounters of the third kind by way of creature from the black lagoon with a bit of jaws and godzilla thrown in for good measure, say. and there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here. this series surfaced, seemingly, from out of nowhere and, by sheer dint of its straightforward storytelling, carried the viewer along for the better part of an entire season. all things considered, a job very well done. i only hope it resurfaces next season...

what can i say? i got up this morning and turned on sci-fi and watched half of the first season and figured it all out. strange, unusual, and brilliant. it gives all potential, and to think at first i said this looks stupid. this has got to be the next best thing since x-files, but as always nothing will ever take down that show in my opinion. i am telling you, it's scary and then suspenseful and then mellow. towards the end you have miles as a love puppy with a weird pet that is a new species. you have two people on the run from authorities. and a killer tsunami about to strike! wow! and did i mention miles pet is a potential killer(well the rest of his species is). surface is a brilliant show with spins and twists that delivers it all.

john huston, actor and director better known for more robust fare such as "the misfits" and "african queen," directs his daughter, angelica huston, in what would be his last film. indeed, the film was released after huston's death. based on james joyce's novella of the same name, "the dead" tells the quiet story of a new year's celebration in 1904 dublin. huston, his cast and his screenwriters, including his son tony, have created a gem of a movie. the novella is among joyce's finest works (as well as being the only one that is filmable). the film is a tribute to huston's genius. he has taken a small,beautiful story and has made a small, beautiful movie. donal mccann and angelica huston shine (although "shine" is too showy, too flashy a word to describe their quiet, understated performances). "the dead" reflects the huston family's love for ireland and is, in its own quiet way, a fitting final movie for a legend.

writers and directors, by the nature of their craft, stand back a frame from the action in their work to show insights about characters and situations. here, huston and joyce have stepped back a bigger frame yet to show us the ultimate view of what it means to be human. until it's very end the movie appears to be about nothing much, the kind of typical circumstances that fill every day life. it is not until the end of the very final scene that we realize that it is in fact about everything.it is not possible to watch this final scene without simultaneously feeling pity, and also deep affection, for oneself and the rest of fellow beings.

because of the depth of his character studies and complexity of story lines, james joyce's works do not easily translate into film. yet john huston, in his last film before his death, achieved a perfect translation of joyce's story. he received great support from his son, as writer, and daughter, as actress.

"the dead" truly is a work of art. clearly, john huston meant to show that he was still "in the full glory of some passion" by making it, even as his body was failing him. this movie is powerfully affecting and lingers in the mind long after it is done. reading the joyce short story certainly adds more depth to the characters, especially gabriel's inner turmoil, but the essence is all there in this film. as a statement by an artist of his love of life and his craft, "the dead" stands alone.

john huston made many remarkable and memorable films. those most often and easily recalled were released long before his passing in 1987. it was that year, however, that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella "the dead." once long ago, a very wise man called doc asked me, "doesn't "the dead" seem remarkably more vivid and bright than any of the other stories in dubliners?" i tend to think that it is. the story and film both contain some of joyce's societal comments and criticisms, but for the most part, paint a warm and loving portrait of an ireland joyce himself so often railed against and would shortly leave. huston's handling of protagonist gabriel conroy, who realizes the world as he sees it is nothing more than an illusion, is simply remarkable. to claim that the film lacks plot is to miss the point. as with any of joyce's dubliners, plot--while most certainly present--is not the focus. plot is merely a tool for the conveyance of the protagonist's epiphany. in addition to a seeming lack in action, there is quite frankly little dialogue in joyce's short story for the director to lean on. huston's ability to translate what joyce puts in words into visuals is quite possibly the movie's greatest triumph. feelings, thoughts...gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in huston's portrayal. to claim that huston has softened his writer's criticism of society again misses the mark. while "the dead" may be painted with a cheerful hue, the complacency and pretense of the film's characters is but a comment on society on a smaller scale: we are the toddling old aunts; the embarrassing drunk; the tenor with the sore throat; the wife with the sad, rain soaked secret; even the self-deluded middle-aged man. but "the dead" belies its title. it is not a dark story. nor is it really that bleak. forget for a moment the snow falling on the living and the dead and the inherent symbolism in it; forget the shambles of a life gabriel awakes to at the film's end: it is only with the destruction of the illusions gabriel has of himself and of his world that he can truly go forward. such is the central point of the film. such is the central point of our lives.

saw this film at the nft in london where it was showing as part of the bfi's john huston season. i wasn't really sure what to expect and the first few minutes of the film gave very little away. in fact the rest of the film continued to give little away! no real plot, no action, no suspense, very little drama and, except for a short section at the very end, no scenery.the result of lack of all of these features was, however, a wonderful film. i don't fully understand why, but i think that its understated nature made the film almost completely perfect. the acting, script and, most important of all, the casting were all spot on and i can't remember walking away from a cinema feeling so good, but i still can't work out why. i just know that i will be getting the dvd (this is one of those films that will, i am sure, be just as good on the small screen as the cinema experience, provided that you can find somewhere quiet to watch it!) and i will be watching it again soon. i will be also interested to find out what my family and friends think of it. i'm sure that it will not be everybody's choice but i am convinced that a large number will agree with my view.9 out of 10.

the argentinian music poet, atahualpa yupanqui, once said that some folk music repeats similarly at any country of the world. they look the same but everybody consider them as their own folk music...this film, as i feel it, is about the same music that repeats all over the world at some time of each country's history. first, a few listen it playing and try to make the others hear it. then some, believe that they hear it, but they don't. then, nobody says anything and some people appear to listen to it. and others recognize that they have heard it, but didn't think that others might be hearing it. finally, everybody listen to the same music, and suddenly it doesn't sound any more...love and poetry, as a real nationalism and the legacy of a father to his children...why would he call the film, the dead when nobody dies? the spanish translation of the title refused to follow the same rule and we call it dubliners, following james joyce's title...a nice 1900 irish filmed postcard!

james joyce, arguably, could write some of the best sentences in the english language, and his short story, "the dead," which ends his collection the dubliners, containsin its finaleperhaps the most perfect paragraph in the english language. it's fitting that john huston, who held back in attempting to film this story, ended his career with it. as with the red badge of courage and the man who would be king, huston revered the literary source but made the adaptation cinematic. and with "the dead" (which was completed after huston's death by his son, tony huston) we get something nearly perfect in the marriage of literature and cinema.valuing all that cinema can do, as one of the commentators points out "this isn't the african queen" (nor does it need to be), this is the kind of movie that is uncompromising for an audience. all of us slogged through portrait of an artist in school, and one needs to bring the maturity of appreciating how words and images in and of themselves can touch us. as with silent films, huston seeks something pure here, and he works with the confidence of his many years and leaves the world a masterpiece that equals joyce's original.many veterans of the irish theater world are recruited to bring the story of a man filled with self-importance (and mock self-doubt) that's reinforced by the hosts of an annual party on the eve of the feast of the epiphany. what's in store for gabriel conroy is an evening of celebration, song, dance, poetry where he's asked to give the annual toast to the two sisters and their niece who host the party. he's distracted by the task wanting to rise to the occasion, and this distraction leaves him vulnerable for an earth-shattering experience, handed to him by his wife. while his ego is shaken when he hears a story from his wife's past, it's also a gift where all that seems to have mattered throughout the evening is swept away by the realization of impending mortality for all who are living.and rather than trying to make the last famous paragraph of the story "cinematic," huston brings in a voice over and we hear those incredible words recited as we watch "the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling." it's the perfect solution to a filmmaker's adaptation.the cast is all we would hope. since this is basically a testament to the power of the written word and how it brings us together through common experience each performer seems elevated by their role. anjelica huston as gretta conroy has a wide range to play, and her account of a young boy who once loved her sears not only gabriel conroy, but the audience as well.when i think of anjelica huston, it's the transformation she makes in this film; and when i think of her father, it's this film i remember first.

travis (james franco) is a young man riding a train for business reasons (we're to assume) who leaves his beloved phone behind. it gets picked up by a prostitute, terri (rachel miner), and when he goes to her city to pick it up, a series of events occur that are sure to stay with him forever.both characters have barriers they've put up to defend themselves from communication. but despite their facades, it's obvious both are eager to bust them down. in total there are about 30 or so spoken lines, but from the way james franco and rachel miner use their faces you might as well turn off the volume, words are unnecessary. a scene to look out for is terri staring at herself in the mirror. you can just feel her despair permeating the room.but, the movie isn't perfect. it's mostly filmed using hand-held cameras, which gets a bit distracting. mainly due to the acting of mr. franco and miner and the photography, the script's flaws don't stand out as much. still, sometimes it seems as if the story doesn't really know where it wants to go.all in all, this is the type of film that truly stays with you long after you watched it. an hour after you've seen it, you're still 'what-if'-ing yourself on the behalf of certain characters. it's not flawless, but still leaves you wanting more, wishing it were at least 4x as long.

i've been waiting years for the dead to come out on video, having pretty much worn my vhs copy to shreds. this is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays. it takes place on the feast of the epiphany (twelfth night), and is a simple, poignant vignette of characters attending a dinner prepared by three dublin women. central to the story is a fairly loveless couple, a wife who once passionately loved a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife, but feels incapable. all of the performances are stunning, and the script weaves among the various characters at the dinner beautifully. of course, its source material is james joyce's short story of the same title, and much of his narrative structure is kept fully intact. john huston's long career as one of hollywood's greatest filmmakers had a truly fitting finale with this film, which was scripted by his son, tony huston; stars his daughter, anjelica huston; and is dedicated to his wife, maricella. thank you to lions gate for picking up the rights to this film and releasing it on dvd. for lovers of all things irish or for folks looking for a literate, subtle, yet incredibly moving holiday film, this is a true gem.

naturally in a film who's main themes are of mortality, nostalgia, and loss of innocence it is perhaps not surprising that it is rated more highly by older viewers than younger ones. however there is a craftsmanship and completeness to the film which anyone can enjoy. the pace is steady and constant, the characters full and engaging, the relationships and interactions natural showing that you do not need floods of tears to show emotion, screams to show fear, shouting to show dispute or violence to show anger. naturally joyce's short story lends the film a ready made structure as perfect as a polished diamond, but the small changes huston makes such as the inclusion of the poem fit in neatly. it is truly a masterpiece of tact, subtlety and overwhelming beauty.

this is really the only chance to see the magic of james joyce's writing brought to life. his novels are all unfilmable (in any real sense) and this is the only long story he wrote. it was john huston's last film and did not reach the screen until after he had died, and it is easy to see his touch of greatness. the dead is poetical in its approach on the screen, telling us more about ireland than any modern movie on the ira and "the troubles" could ever hope to tell us. hopefully more people will watch this film and get to experience the finest of both john huston and james joyce, and perhaps visit this story in your local bookstore (and discover that it is probably the greatest short story ever put on paper).

i believe john houston's "the dead" is a true classic. not only was it houston's final film, he is quoted as saying "all i know about film making is in this film." the story, closely adapted from "dubliners" by james joyce, is a great ensemble piece featuring sterling performances by angelica houston, john's daughter, and a cast of english and irish actors who bring the story to life. this is a film that should be part of any serious collection, not only because it is visually elegant, but because the story is timeless and very appealing. the film is not hurried, nor is it charged with action. rather, the story unfolds from within the characters, who bring light and meaning to the dialog. the end of the film is stunning, poetic, and haunting. i recommend "the dead" without reservation as one of the finest films ever made.

not often it happens that a great director´s last movie becomes such a moving, brillantly performed and filmed masterpiece. the cast is excellent as well as the camerawork. what starts up as a merry coming-together of a group of well-educated citizens of an early-20th-century- dublin turns into a dark, philosophic narration about all our fear from death and the sometimes dark shadows of the past. thank you, mister huston, for this last piece of great cinema!

in print this is one of the greatest short stories ever written, brought brilliantly and poetically to the screen by this father-son team, working together, sadly, for the first and last time.it is fitting that john huston should end his career on a high note by bringing the work of one of his favorite author's to the screen, in what is easily the best joyce screen adaptation. huston made a career of adapting great works of literature to film, usually quite successfully. it is sad, and somewhat puzzling, that tony huston pretty much began and ended his career in film by adapting what would be his father's final project and picking up a well-deserved oscar nomination in the process.i once had the privilege of sitting in the company of the great screenwriter/playwright horton foote, who cited this film as one of his favorites in recent years (at the time it was still a fairly recent release). as a rather prolific screenwriter himself (and a brilliant screen adapter of his own works, as well as great authors such as faulkner, steinbeck and harper lee) he was obviously impressed with tony huston's first time effort, and possibly equally puzzled by his lack of output since then. if anyone has insights to share on the topic i'd be interested to hear more.

for his last film, john huston directed his daughter, anjelica, in this adaptation of the story from james joyce's "dubliners", and he gave us one of his finest achievements to remember him by.joyce is about as impossible to film as anyone, but "the dead" at least presents a traditional narrative to work with. much (indeed, almost all) of the important information in the story lies in the spaces between the lines, in characters' thoughts and expressions -- there are big moments, but they're cerebral -- they're not the stuff of which movies are made. but somehow, huston gets it right, and he manages a nearly flawless adaptation.anjelica is magnificent, and the movie is haunting and powerful.grade: a

there are so many '10 best' lists which could easily fit "the dead" - best screen drunk, best literary adaptation, best use of music not specifically written for the film, best use of poetry, best screen speech, best ensemble cast and finally, perhaps, best film ever made. this was john huston's last and greatest film, adapted by his son tony from james joyce's short story and set on the evening of the feast of the epiphany in the dublin of 1904. it is confined, largely, to one setting, the home of the morkan sisters, and not a great deal happens in conventional 'dramatic' terms. they entertain their guests; there is singing, dancing, recitations and much small talk but watching this film you can't imagine anywhere else you would rather be than in this company.finally, of course, it is 'about' much, much more. it is about love, loss and regret, those stable mainstays of great drama. in the film's closing scenes the tenor bartell d'arcy, (frank patterson), sings a song, 'the lass of aughrim' which conjures up in the mind of gretta, (anjelica huston), wife of gabriel, (donal mccann), the ghost of her first and probably greatest love, a boy who died in all certainty of a broken heart at the age of seventeen, and suddenly gabriel realises he has never really known his wife and that he has not been the great love of her life, after all. emotionally, these scenes are incredibly powerful, firstly as gretta recounts the circumstances of her lover's death and then as the voice in gabriel's head sums up his own feelings. this is great cinema, the monologues superbly delivered by huston and mccann.but then all the performances are extraordinary. this is ensemble playing of the highest order and while it would be invidious to single out one performer above another, has the screen ever given us a more likable, genial or convincing drunk than donal donnelly or has poetry ever been delivered with such passion that sean mcclory, (the ira man in "the quiet man"), brings to his reading of lady gregory's translation of 'donal og' here? added poignancy is to be had, of course, from the knowledge that huston himself was close to death when he made this film which seems to me the culmination of his life's work. death may well be its central theme but viewing this film is a life-enhancing experience.

john huston finished his remarkable career with one of the most perfect and sensitive movies i've ever seen. for his farewell he decided to adapt james joyce's beautiful short story, "the dead", and made not only one of the most faithful literature-to-film adaptations yet, he also crafted a movie that more than 20 years later still surpasses a lot of contemporary cinema.when i watched this movie a few years ago, as a student at university, i gazed in awe at the screen, marvelling at every aspect of the movie: acting, screen writing, direction, costumes, settings, music, cinematography. thinking about it now, i still can't of anything i'd criticise it for. huston just knew how to tell a good story.a good deal of credit should also go to tony huston. he knew better than to meddle with a text that is not only perfection itself but already visual enough for cinema. father and son let the story breathe and relish in the long, fascinating conversations between characters, and in the meaningful silences.donal mccann also deserves credit for the his performance as gabriel conroy. i had never seen him in movies before, nor have i seen him afterwards, but he gave one of the most moving performances i've ever seen.all in all, the dead is a fine cinematic experience, from a legendary director who never stopped being excellent.

easily one of my three or four favorite films. definitely one for the desert island. there is nothing `brilliant' about this film. rather, it glows warm and welcoming. the audience is invited to a party and, like any good party, the joy comes in the interaction of the guests, and what you learn as you progress from one to the next. with apologies to joyce, the film's title conjures up a number of ideas that keep audiences away. the film is not horrifying. it is not depressing. it is a beautiful look into a time that has past, within which people are growing up, and others are winding down. some are frustrated, and others are serene. and all around, ever present throughout the evening, are the people, and the parts of people, that have been laid to rest. the words these exquisite actors are given to speak are perfection and, set to the music of the irish brogue, are an auditory feast, particularly to us flat-toned americans. about the lack of brilliance i referred to above, i take it back. there is no other word to describe the final scene between anjelica huston and donal mccann. it speaks quiet volumes about  well, everything. some lovely snowy evening, rent this film and just let it happen before you. no gunfights, no car chases, no dinosaurs  just film at its most sublime.

this film, for what it was set out to be, succeeded. it's a short tragic film. although my choice of film are ones that really develop characters and their relationships, this film is meant to just give a taste, leaving you with the "what happens next" factor. after watching it, i really was wanting more, more of the characters back story, what influences they had to make them into the people they were. i think thats what the makers intended the viewing audience to think. the acting is amazing. there aren't many lines in the film so their body language, facial expressions, and overall presence needed to be powerful enough to withhold a scene. both franco and miner have that element and it shows. for them (especially franco) to take the time to make this, obviously says they believed in this film and wanted to be apart of it and for that, i appreciated the film for what it was. also i'm happy i own it so i can share it with other people that would've never known it existed.

the last film of john huston, the great american director of the irish descent is an adaptation of the last short story in the early collection "dubliners", of the greatest writer ever came from ireland. the film is a family affair. the dying director made it based on the script adapted by his son tony huston from one of the most poignant, beautiful and profound short story ever written in this language and considered by many the best english language short story. john directed his daughter anjelica in what could be her finest screen performance. the film is short, only 83 minutes. it's got no action sequences, no plot, it is almost non-eventful, and it may seem slow. the guests, friends and relatives come to the party that takes place in dublin during the epiphany week in january 1904, at the house of two elderly sisters who give annual dinner with music and dance. what viewers see for the first hour, is the ensemble conversation piece. the guests talk, listen to the music, discuss the latest opera premiere, and make jokes, sometimes awkward. gradually, the conversation turns to the long dead friends or relatives the memory of whom never faded away.this is the film you have to stay with, let it pull you in, listen to what and how the guests at the party say, how they communicate. pay attention to the body languages, to the looks at their faces when they drift away from the light, laugh, and music of the present to the long gone but never in fact left most precious memories where the dead of the title are not dead but forever young and so alive. if you do, you will be awarded with the final scene of such emotional power and impact that it will always stay with you. it will break your heart to pieces, pull them together and put it back transfixed. the film as well as joyce's story centers on gabriel conroy (donal mccann as james joyce's alter ego gave a very moving understated performance) as one of the party guests who arrives with his wife gretta (anjelica huston). gabriel is still in love, feels close connection to and fascinated with her. it is after the party, he discovers that even after many years of closeness, he does not know all about her past, her pains, her regrets, and the unforgettable emotions and loss she had lived through as a young girl, and he is no part of. for the first time, he looks at her and thinks of her not as the indelible part of his existence but as another human being with her own inner world, her own loneliness and sadness, and for the first time, "a strange, friendly pity for her entered his soul." it is he who narrates the final most powerful and profound lines of the story: "snow is general all over ireland. . . falling faintly through the universe, and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead." if you have not seen the film or read the joyce's story, please do. they are truly the works of art that leave the everlasting impression and would change something in you to the best.

it's a short movie for such immense feelings. the last 20 or so minutes are among the most intense in the recent years of the industry. huston (john) is dying and only love can make the difference. the actor's work in the long evening scene is absolutely marvellous.

an exquisite film. they just don't make them like this any more! we eavesdrop on an upper middle class family in dublin in the early part of the 20th century. they are hosting an after christmas dinner for their friends and relatives. their table talk is just idle chatter but it is so well written that one is engrossed. away from the dinner table some fine piano playing helps to create an intimate atmosphere as if one were there as one of the guests. perhaps a bit too perfect for an amateur player, the odd mistake here and there would have added to the magic of this film. no real story but real entertainment and an object lesson for up and coming film makers.

so many literary adaptations are disappointments. there are many reasons for that, but usually it is the need to cut down a complex novel to the size of a screenplay. the dead is unusual - it had to be 'padded', as the short story itself is a tiny, relatively short gem. it may in fact be the finest short story in the english language. in beautifully spare language it tells of the realization of gabriel conroy that his life, and the lives of so many around him are controlled by memories of the dead. even his own wife of many years loved a man now dead more than him.to bring such a short story to the cinema was always going to be tricky. john huston did a magnificent job. he never gave in to temptation to play it up or use fancy technique to expand on the story. it is simple and true, with outstanding acting. the only slight miss-step is the use of music to accompany the devastating final soliloquy.its rare indeed for a movie version of a literary masterpiece to be itself a masterpiece, but i think its fair to use this term for this movie. its not a bravura piece of film making, but it is simple and pure - i always think of ozu's movies when i think of the dead, its at that level of purity and simplicity and deep wisdom.

the entire movie, an artful adaptation of one of joyce's "dubliners" stories, takes place on the night of january 6 (epiphany), 1906. most of the film takes place at an annual party given by three spinsters (two sisters and their niece), where a group of upper-class dubliners gather for an evening of music, recitations and dinner. while there is very little plot per se, the interaction and conversation among the group reveals much about dublin in the early 20th century when the stirrings for independence were just beginning. the cast, all talented irish stage actors with the exception of anjelica huston, are universally wonderful, and one actually feels he is a guest at the gathering himself. the poignant final scene, between ms. huston and the amazing donal mccann, reveals much about the marriage of the characters. there is poignancy mixed with humor and insight, and for those who like quiet, thoughtful movies, "the dead" is highly recommended. my wife is from dublin, we make a ritual of watching this wonderful movie every january 6th. after many viewings it never fails to move me, and each time i glean something that i've missed before.

i have watched thousands of movies in my life and i believe this movie is the most "perfect" movie that has ever been made. by perfect i mean the storytelling, the plot, the acting, the staging, the camera work, etc. (this is a lay opinion; i have no background in film production.) a lot of movies have perfect scenes, such as the bartender filing a report with the police officer in the movie fargo. (indeed, that scene could play well as a short.) in the dead every scene is done to perfection, making the entire movie perfect. perhaps, john huston sold his soul to the devil to make such a movie. hopefully, daniel webster has gotten him out of the contract!

john huston was seriously ill when he made his final achievement,and it's thoroughly his testament:uncompromising,difficult ,a thousand miles away from crazes and fashions,it will stand as the best "last film" you can ever dream of.a very austere screenplay,no action,no real hero,but a group of people coping with the vanity of life,the fleeting years and death.the party doesn't delude people for long.admittedly,warmth and affection emanate from the songs and the meal,complete with turkey and pudding.but the passage of time has partly ruined julia's voice,first crack in the mirror.then the camera leaves the room where the guests are gathered and searches the old lady's bedroom.for sure,hers seems to have been a happy life,but it's a life inexorably coming to an end-a shot shows towards the end of the movie julia on her future deathbed-.maybe an unfulfilled life,because she remained a spinster,with no children to carry on .only some poor things,yellowish photographs,bibelots and trinklets.... but are a human being's hopes and dreams all fulfilled?look at gretta.she 's a married woman ,about thirty-five,she's still beautiful and healthy but she knows something is broken.what julia is today,she will be tomorrow,that's why,in her stream of consciousness,she goes back to her past,only to find out how harrowing her memories are: a young man committed suicide for her,a symbol of her youth now waning.the final monologue,if we listen closely to it,involves us all in this eternal tragedy,the doomed to failure human condition,john huston's masterly lesson.

this is my favourite movie of all time. and i always think of it as john huston's requiem.i must have seen it at least 20 times and never tire of it. the mood, the script, the singing, the dinner, it is like being invited into someone's home and observing the events and not able to participate even though you want to... it is a rare treasure, this movie and i cannot write enough praise for it.it is cast incredibly well, with quite a few abbey theatre faces and also the wonderful tenor voice of frank patterson. lady gregory's poem recited in the movie is one of the most moving ever written. anjelica's scene walking down the stairs as she listens to the song is one of the best performances every seen on film. i cry every time i see it..for all the right reasons.we have all had love lost at an early age and weep for our young hopeful selves.donal mccann acted in far too few movies for my liking, he just loved stage work and stuck to it, and it is our loss that we do not have more of his performances on film as he does so much with this delicate role by expression and the portrayal of a deep love for his wife that will never be reciprocated and he conveys such inner sadness at knowing this.if you want your movies action and plot packed avoid this, there really is no beginning, middle or end just a lens onto the characters at a dinner party in dublin 80 years ago and all the little nuances and shadings of the personalities portrayed so beautifully.bravo to all who were involved in this production. 10 out of 10.

hello all denver fans!i couldn't agree more with you guys! this show was so cool and cute, i i watched it as a kid in the late 80s. among denver are other favourite too, such as care bears and rainbow brite. i am 24 now, but it is still one of my favourite shows, and my favourite cartoon from the 80s. it brings back all the memories. the theme tune was great too, i get goosebumps whenever i hear it. it is sad that it lasted such a short time, but it has remained a firm favourite. its great that i am not alone and that there are people out there who liked it too. this is one of the cartoon shows i shall keep for future generations. viva denver! :)

heya denver fans! the animation is a cartoon's classic & one of my favorite too (and yes, it was broadcast in europe as well. including my tiny central-european country, slovenia! =:) oh, how i miss the 80's cartoons!! honestly, they were way better than today's children shows. more imaginative, creative, full of fun with good morals, more substance, great storyline and excellent character voices. computer animated shows of today lack all of these features. so all of you, who agree and want to bring back all the shows so that the kids of today's generation would see the entertainment that these cartoons brought to us, please log on the side posted bellow and sign a petition for a rerun of the 80's best cartoons! http://www.thepetitionsite.com /1/we-want-an-80s-child-cartoon-kids-show-channelcarpe denver! =) lejla

while caricatures and/or references to entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products is usually a staple in shorts like this one, they aren't used in quantity here. most of the individual gags are rather generic. as i'm going to give examples, there will be spoilers below: there are only three (well, technically four-there's a quick one at the very end of the cartoon) caricatures that i spotted, which is kind of low for this type of short, though one is a featured character with a fair amount of activity. they are jack benny (as jack bunny), leopold stowkowski and the inimitable ned sparks (as a crab on a can-chances are very good that, if a crab was involved in a warner brothers short in the 1930s-1940s, the caricature used would be ned sparks). there are also references to billy rose's aquacade and a riff on a radio show character called "henry aldrich" (coming, mother!), a play on superman (superguy here) and the villain is a take-off on "king kong". that's it for that kind of gag.the products themselves are mostly generic and the gags are more plays on basic items in unusual situations, such as turtles coming off of cans of soup to attack the villain as tanks, tomato soup cans doing "the can-can', gingerbread men who turn into paratroopers, using tissues for parachutes and so on. the gags are very good and it's an excellent example of a bob clampett cartoon. clampett had hit his stride as a director by this point and while it isn't anywhere near his best work, it's nothing to sneeze at either. this short can be found on looney tunes golden collection, vol. 3, which is an excellent set that i highly recommend. this short itself is also recommended.

once again, we are fortunate to see a gorgeous opening scene where the artists' work has been fully restored and we see this old-time grocery store on a street corner with the snow gently falling. inside are the rich colors of all the merchandise, from produce to canned and boxed goods to medicine to candy, etc.in essence, this is a story of those goods "coming to life," such as the animals on the labels of items, or a pie, or even a pack of cigarettes.the whole "show" is narrated by "jack bunny," a jack benny impersonator, with music from conductor leopold stokowski, who was in so many looney tunes animated shorts i have lost count. a lot of the humor is topical, so it pays to know who "little egypt" and other characters. the busby berkeley-type "aqua" number with bathing suited-sardines coming out of the can, and the tomato can-can dance were both clever! all of the above, and more, was in the first half of this slightly longer-than-normal length cartoon. the second half was about a king kong-type which escapes from the "animal crackers" box and terrorizes everyone. that part was not much, and ended on a somewhat stupid note. so..... an "a" for the first half, a "d" for the second, making it about a c-plus or b-minus overall.

adapted from sam shepard's play, this movie retains many play-like elements such as a relatively fixed setting (a roadside 50's motel in the southwest) and extensive, intriguing dialogues. a woman "may" is hounded by a man "eddie" (played by sam shepard). she tries to hide from him in the out-of-the-way motel, but he finds her. the film explores the history of their relationship, mainly from their childhoods, that has led them to this point. it's very easy to feel sympathy for the characters and to understand that their dysfunctional present relationship is a result of past events out of their control. we mainly watch them fight, make up, fight, make up and so on. one image that stands out in my mind, is of eddie hauling may over his shoulder kicking and screaming, taking her somewhere she doesn't want to go.the soundtrack is also perfect soulful country with vocals by a lesser known artist "sandy rogers". she has this country doll voice that almost yodels at some points in the album! this is the kind of movie that will stay lodged in some part of your brain/soul. in other words, go see it!

(warning - contains mild spoiler) a movie almost designed to make you pause and check your recollection of it - it's confined to an almost empty motel where the huge courtyard resembles a circus ring and the rooms seem like temporary withdrawal points rather than refuges; as the characters become increasingly preoccupied by the past, the present increasingly falls away, until the ultimate incendiary appearance of the countess in the black mercedes marks the fusion of reality and fantasy. whether or not their stories are true, and whether stanton is truly the father or just a crazy old man stepping into their stories, seems impossible to determine. the theme seems to be how love of an extreme and unconsidered nature messes with stability to the point where reality itself breaks down; where exotic, misplaced fantasy becomes dangerously tangible. the image of the burning motel - a symbol of dislocation beset by destruction - is an appropriately weird ending for this strange but effective, startlingly imaginative, movie.

why would i say that? because when the movie ended, i was in a good mood. so many people exclaim at the end, wow! bruce willis can be funny. for those of you who believe he learned how to act after the sixth sense, you must be very new to his career. he won an emmy for best actor in a comedy series before he did die hard. it's like saying, wow, the sky learned to deposit snow on the ground just because it's your first winter in life. the movie was hilarious. what boggles my mind is how some other comments made about this movie claims that there are no memorable lines or scenes. spoiler...the waaaambulance? i am not a loser? have you ever seen a grown up scream i am not a loser before?i thought this movie was great. it was funny, it was never boring and in a cheesy disney sort of way, it had a point to make. something to do with life and of course any kid movie trying to do that is in over it's head but for once, i didn't care.if you haven't watched it. do so. you'll like it.

i couldnt believe how well this kid did on screen, you will completely forget that they are actors and loose yourself in the movie. it is like watching home movies with a twist. i recomend this to everyone. highly.

the story is quite slow at the beginning except few interesting humour that come along the way but some of the plot still empty.the science on how the kid entered the 21st century is still a mystery except at the end of the movie, we have been shown of how.other than that, everything looks ok!

perhaps i was just in a really good mood when i watched this film. but, for whatever reason, i really liked this film. was it terribly original? no. was it a bit predictable? yes. and so what? it was still a really nice movie. i've always liked bruce willis (well, almost always, there was hudson hawk and the fifth element, after all), and he portrayed a selfish, sarcastic b***ard perfectly. maybe this movie isn't academy award material, but it sure is feel good material. go rent it.

in this dream-come-true, i found myself loving what was going on. it's a good movie, and should not be passed off as a corny fantasy movie. it's too smart for that. it's definitely a feel good movie, but with a nice message to leave you with. 7/10, b, **1/2 out of ****

well, it has to be said that monster man is a huge mess of a film, but somehow multiple different genres and a clichéd plot come together to make one of the most enjoyable modern horror films i've seen in ages! the two biggest styles that the film mixes are a 'road trip' style teenage comedy and a 'texas chainsaw massacre' style redneck horror vibe, and while one gets in the way of the other quite often; director michael davis manages to keep things moving thanks to the fact that the constant shift in tone means that we're never quite sure where the film is going to be taken next. things start out worryingly as we're introduced to two characters, both irritating in different ways. adam is a wussy virgin, while harley is a fat big-mouthed "a-hole". they're both driving across the desert to attend the wedding of some chick they both liked in high school. after a couple of strange events, they pick up a hitch-hiker, and then find themselves being chased by some maniac in a monster truck for reasons unknown...the idea of someone being chased by someone else in a bigger vehicle is hardly original, but the way the monster truck is used here is one of the film's biggest assets. the truck itself looks spooky because it's so haggard and rusty, and the fact that it bounces around the screen makes the unfolding action exciting and suspenseful. after a while, you begin to get used to the characters and once aimee brooks enters the fray, things start to look up. the teen comedy side of the movie actually works pretty well, as justin ulrich is always on hand to deliver some entertaining lines of dialogue and the scenes between the dorky virgin and the hot female hitch-hiker are interesting enough. just when you think the film couldn't possibly get any messier, things take a turn for the weird in the final third. without spoiling things, it has to be said that monster man features the sort of ending that couldn't possibly be seen coming, and along with the twist, is a big surprise. some people may feel ripped off by the sudden turn at the end - but i actually thought it worked quite well as it fits the film in that nothing here really fits... overall, this isn't a 'great' film by any means - but if you're looking for some silly entertainment, monster man should hit the spot!

before watching this movie from beginning to end, i happened to just catch the last half hour. ordinarily i don't watch a movie if i haven't seen it from the beginning, but a friend had it on and once i started watching it i couldn't stop.i'm really surprised this movie didn't get a wide theatrical release. this is quite a funny movie (often gallows humor) , and the monster and monster truck in it are quite menacing. the monster makes leatherface look pretty, and the monster truck is a like a cross between a world war i german artillery vehicle and a giant coffin.a timid twenty-five year-old virgin guy is on a long drive to stop the woman he loves from getting married. his ex-best friend tags along and rags on him constantly. they're menaced on the road by a vintage black hearse and the aforementioned monster truck. they also pick up a hitchhiker, played by the very sexy aimee brooks.i also watched the animated trailer with the director's commentary, and the electronic press kit and i found those both to be interesting. i would bet that the feature commentary with the director and the two male stars is pretty enjoyable too, but i have so many other movies to watch i've never seen before....

"gaming? nicotine? fisticuffs? we're moving in a descending spiral of iniquity!" so says the head of st. swithen's upon inspecting the master's common at nutbourne. the faculty and students of st. swithen's have been ordered to share facilities at nutbourne to avoid german bombs during world war ii. then there's the masters' library. "the diary of samuel pepys? abridged...well, that's something to be thankful for. what's up here? the memoirs of casanova? wasn't that the book we caught jessica james reading in the closet? decameron nights! well, really! what ever else this place may or may not be, it's no place to bring carefully nurtured girls!" yes, a terrible mistake has been made by the ministry of education. nutbourne is a school for boys. st. swithen's is a school for girls. and what makes this one of the best post-wwii british comedies, nutbourne's head master is wetherby pond...played by alastair sim, while st. swithen's head mistress is muriel whitchurch...played by margaret rutherford. "st. swithen's?" says pond. "you don't mean to say that yours is a school for boys and girls?" he asks one of the early girls. "only girls" she says cheerfully. "does this mean, sir," asks one of nutbourne's teachers, "that we are to expect 100 young girls?" "it means that not only have the ministry made a mistake in sending a school here at all, but that it is guilty of an appalling sexual aberration!" margaret rutherford's miss whitchurch, as positive and immovable as a battleship, intends to make the best of it, by briskly taking over nutbourne if possible. alastair sim's pond is exasperated up to his big bald head and is determined to salvage his school. in the meantime, there are 100 young girls and 170 young boys to be fed and places found for them to sleep (along with all their teachers). the cooks and caretakers, totally put upon, walk out. miss whitchurch and her girls, however, are up to the cooking tasks. "come now, angela," she says to one girl who is trying to stir something in a big pot, "haven't you made porridge before?" "yes, but no one ever had to eat it." "that's a defeatist attitude, my dear. stir it well and don't shilly shally." things are hardly going well when pond discovers four governors from a school he hopes to lead are arriving at any moment to see for themselves how well led nutbourne is. and miss whitchurch learns that four wealthy and influential parents have just arrived to see how their daughters are doing in the new -- boy free, they were told -- facilities. the only solution? miss whitchurch and pond, their teachers and their students, concoct a split-second shifting of classes to give the allusion that nutbourne has no girls and that st. swithen's has no boys. after the parents inspect a dorm and leave for a class, the girls in the beds duck under and the boys who'd been hidden under leap up into the beds, just as the governors walk in. the boys are observed at rugby and, as soon as the governors turn their backs, the goal posts are taken down, nets for lacrosse are put up, and just then the parents walk over to observes the girls. one parent spots her daughter in a science class, then moments later sees her in a choir practice, then moments later.... "there's angela again," she says to miss whitchurch. "why so it is," she replies, hustling the parents out to avoid the governors who are approaching just around the corner. "the child's quite ubiquitous." when we leave nutbourne, everything has been discovered. the students are milling about. the teachers are dazed (except for two who are kissing.) the education ministry has just sent several more busloads of students. the parents are speechless but the governors are not. "we're waiting for an explanation," one says sharply. pond holds his head and shudders. "can't you see i'm trying to think of one." the film moves from one complicated and ridiculous situation after another, braced by a very funny script and two hugely comedic performances by rutherford and sim. sim's droll exasperation and rutherford's implacable determination are so well matched that's it's a shame this is the only movie they ever made together. joyce grenfell, as gossage, st. swithen's tall, awkward, loping sports teacher gives them some competition. if you keep your eyes open, you'll also find some amusing references director frank launder works in, including a gong at nutbourne that looks just like a midget version of j. arthur rank's, a faint echo of the zither theme from the third man and a shot stolen from david lean's oliver twist, except this time the little boy walks up holding his porridge bowl and says, "please, sir. i don't want anymore." frank launder and his partner, sidney gilliat, were responsible for some of the best films produced in britain during the thirties, forties and fifties. they wrote, produced and directed, sometimes doing one, sometimes the other. in one way or another they were responsible for such first-rate films as green for danger (with a masterly droll performance by sim), i see a dark stranger, the lady vanishes, night train to munich, wee geordie, the belles of st. trinian's, the rake's progress and many others. with the happiest days of your life, launder wrote and directed while both produced. it's one of their best.

this film is just plain lovely. it's funny as hell and as old as the hills. the acting is superb and it's fascinating seeing post-war britain and how we used to behave in those days. this seems to have been some pre-runner to the st. trinians films (given the alastair sim and margaret rutherford connection - there's also a very young george cole in there who appeared in many st. trinians films) but i don't myself understand the connection. it was shown on bbc4 recently after a biography of st. trinians creator ronald searle, however i missed enough of the biography to miss the connection with this film. anyway a great film in its own right and something that should be preserved for all time!

this film was made thirteen years before i was born but i still think it is the wittiest, dottiest, most harmless piece of fun ever made. it simply could not go wrong with the cast of superb british character actors it boasts.where to start? alastair sim-peerless; margaret rutherford-ditto;the wonderfully alkward, innocent gossage, played to perfection by the imperious joyce grenfell. the caddish victor hyde-brown (a guy middleton special) and the rest of the staff sum up post-war middle-class england to a tee.the humour is sometimes obvious, but it is of that special "ealing" variety and is never offensive.i have watched this film more times than i care to remember and still laugh like a drain at the antics every time. the storming of the dorms occupied by the girls school, the magnificently-planned but ultimately doomed twin tours of the school and the chaotic ending involving the arrival of a third school to add to the anarchy, are priceless.it's an old cliché i know, but they really do not make them like that anymore. how i wish they did. if you haven't seen it, please do, you won't be disappointed.

a bumbling error at the ministry of education results in nutbourne boys school having to share with st swithin's school for girls. this bemuses the respective head teachers of each school and leads to all manner of chaotic goings on, however the two are forced to come to an uneasy alliance in the hope of averting major trouble.the happiest days of your life is based on the john dighton play from 1948, with dighton writing the part of headmistress whitchurch specifically for margaret rutherford. replacing george howe from the play in the role of headmaster pond, is alastair sim, and here in lies the crowning glory of this filmic adaptation, sim & rutherford are perfectly wonderful, bouncing off each other to keep what is basically a one joke movie, highly entertaining. directed by the gifted frank launder, and produced by the equally adroit sidney gilliat, the happiest days of your life is a quintessentially british movie, obviously a precursor to the st trinians franchise, the film entertains the children with it's high jinks clash of the sexes heart, whilst tickling the watching adults with its very saucy undercurrent. thankfully the chaotic ending cements all that has gone before it to leave this particular viewer with a grin as wide as nutbourne rail station, great fun 8/10.

after a long run in the west end this charming film re-cast margaret rutherford as the headmistress 'miss whitchurch' in this financially successful adaptation made in 1950.all interior shots took place at riverside studios in hammersmith, london. the exterior scenes were filmed on location at a public girl's school near liss in hampshire. during the 12 - week shoot both margaret rutherford and joyce grenfell were staying in a hotel nearby and would often visit the school during the evenings where they would happily enjoy the company of the real school mistresses.although the film's script contains only two original lines from the original play the leads and supporting actors are in fine form and you can only feel sympathetic for their predicament especially in the final scenes.

the play is cleverly constructed - begin with the porter, rainbow - & let the audience see the background unfold through his eyes. the film follows the play with great faithfulness, working, no doubt, on the simple premise that it couldn't be bettered. now throw in a host of superb character actors - & the result is a resounding triumph.a definite must-see.

at last, a great film that doesn't have to be edited for profanity or sex! it's a fun film that the whole family can enjoy. willis is great, as always. "rusty" was delightful. just enough action to keep interest going.

the happiest days of your life showcases some of britain's greatest comedy talents of its time in a traditionally farcical and upper-class-twit like fashion. generally it is a whistle-stop tour of stuffy english behaviour with the girls-only school providing a great setting for the dotty goings-on. margaret rutherford, alastair sim and - most especially! - joyce grenfell are all fantastic, giving us a lot of laughs as they express their utter horror at what they are having to deal with. as the film moves on, things get sillier and sillier with the tour around the school for the parents being a suitably crackers high point.at this point i will give special mention, again, to joyce grenfell and her wonderful character miss gossage. she is so extraordinarily innocent, silly, apologetic and ineffectual that she seems to steal the whole film. she provides the greatest laugh of the film when she flirts with a male teacher ("call me sausage!").whilst some of the film is slow or dated, and not always very involving, it still maintains most of its sparkle and barely pauses for romance. good for a silly, harmless giggle.7/10

this film, without doubt, is the clearest example of the british humour the germans can't understand. one-liners run rampant in a film spawning one of the greatest series of films in british cinema history (st.trinians). the story of bureaucratic incompetence amid post-war trials enables frank launder to direct maximum talent from all the cast. it's probably the only film in which margaret rutherford meets her match, in alastair sim, for forceful characterisation (she still wins though). joyce grenfell (bless her) and richard wattis both deserve mentions in dighton's masterpiece of english etiquette and stiff upper lip under pressure.no rutherford/sim/grenfell fan would be without this in their collection. absolutely brilliant. why 9/10? only 83mins long.

one of the flat-out drollest movies of all-time. sim and rutherford are at their best matching wits over the predicament of an all-boys and all-girls school sharing the same quarters. slapstick has never been this sophisticated.

from the golden period of british films, this has my vote for one of the funniest of all time. screened yesterday at my film society to a rapturous audience, i was astonished at how well the comedy has lasted (made in 1950!). it is really down to the expert timing and inimitable playing from two of the finest actors britain has produced: margaret rutherford and alastair sim. adapted from a play by john dighton, this farce is briskly handled by director frank launder. the plot is simple: a ministry mistake billets a girls' school on a boys' school. i will always laugh when i think of this film.

i can't remember exactly where i heard of them first, but i listen to a little of one song and liked it. went and bought the cd and had finally found the type of music i like. i heard about this video and knew i had to have it. it has a lot of clips from them playing in concert. let me tell you, watching this video doesn't even compare to them in concert. i've seen them twice in concert and don't want to ever miss a chance to see them again. the other two things it has is some interview, and even a video for one of their biggest songs. couple little side notes...i saw them at ozzfest 2001 and they ruled there, but seeing them in a smaller inside stage was much better (they had some really cool things to do with being able to cut out the lights) the other, in case anyone wonders, votary means a devout follower.

slipknot is a heavy metal band from the great city of des moines, iowa in which the rockers wear their own distinguished mask (i know someone already said this, but i need to fill up space for this review). the band members are joey, mick, 133, sid, clown, james, corey, chris, and paul. this band is one of the best new heavy metal bands in my opinion and should be heard by everyone that loves hardcore rock. another good movie is called "disasterpieces" which shows the band's performance at the london arena. the "my plague" video was shot there and is included on the dvd. the most kick ass song they made is also on there (sic). so if you love the band you need to see this and if you love heavy metal music then you have to hear this band.

i did it too. when i first saw the band, i dismissed them straight away without even listening to the music. then one day, out of sheer curiosity, i bought the cd and fell in love with it. so i bought the video. hold onto your lunch kids, this isnt going to be pretty! the video was excellent - a great opportunity to hear the music, see some of the promo videos, and meet the band...although i *still* dont know how they can cope with wearing those masks all the time! a must for all fans of the band, and fans of alternative music in general

this dvd usually sells for around $20. i wouldn't pay this much for the dvd if i had known what i was getting, but regardless this is a pretty good disc. it displays the knot in all their glory, with footage from their concerts... playing surfacing, wait and bleed and scissors among other tracks, including the "spit it out" music video, which was apparently banned from mtv.slipknot, for those who don't know, is essentially a symphony of the damned: nine masked men who display total chaos on stage, with machine gun drums, squealing guitar and vocals that will tear your face off and leave you wanting more. for those who've never seen slipknot before, i cannot recommend enough you get this dvd... probably off ebay or amazon so you can get a better deal.a short, though well made show of the knot.seven out of ten.

slipknot is a hardcore rock band from des moines, iowa. nine band members who all wear customized boilersuits, and personalized, homemade masks (eg. #6's clown mask, #0's various gasmasks, #8's tattered + torn crashtest dummie mask with dreadlocks). the music itself seems to walk the finelines between sane and otherwise, yet is performed so brilliantly and psychotic."welcome to our neighborhood" sounds rather a generic title, but the footage itself is something else. interviews with the band, soundbites from their latest, selftitled album, 2 live performances, and one banned-by-mtv music video (a brilliant homage to the classic kubrick film "the shining"), the movie clocks in at not even half-an-hour, but is certainly worth it. it is perfect for introducing any metal/hardcore fan to slipknot.

this is one of the most enjoyable teen movies i have ever seen (and that i wished was released to video). it was released the same year as another great comedy in which tim matheson played a role "animal house" (which is probably why it was overlooked). one of the most memorable parts of this film would definitely be the soundtrack, which could have and should have been a formal label release. the soundtrack features a lesser-known 70's act named high inergy whose song "we are the future", played a marquee role in the movie's prom scene. i remember purchasing the group's album "steppin' out" as a kid mainly because of the look of the girls and not necessarily for their musical talents. the closing song is one of the best ballads i have ever heard, and i can still hear it in my head. i wish i knew the group's name so that i could look for it somewhere in cyberspace.if you liked films such as "over the edge" and "rich kids", i think this is one that you will enjoy as well.

i waited long to watch this movie. also because i like bruce willis. the plot was quite different from what i had expected but still quite good. its a good mix of emotions, humor and drama.left me thinking over and again :)

i remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when i was 6 years-old (you do the math). i absolutely loved it. i was tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it (climbing the furniture, jumping around making monkey sounds). it started a fascination with tarzan and monkeys, but oddly enough a longer lasting love for christopher lambert (keep in mind that i saw highlander very shortly after this). 1984 was the last time i saw that film, until about a month ago. it happened to be on cable as i was getting ready for bed at 3:30 am and even though it was late and i was tired and i had to be at work at 9:00 am, i stayed up to watch this movie that i loved as a kid. upon viewing it i realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that, that andie macdowell's voice was dubbed by someone else. ian holme was of course solid as usual, and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up, but what was most surprising was how good lambert was as tarzan. he was great! the depth he managed to capture in so few lines, his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark, were just amazing.as i stated earlier i am lambert fan, but i'm used to highlander, the hunted and fortress. in this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again.so to make a short story way too long, i was a little disappointed that the film was not that good, but i was glad to see that lambert was good and i do not regret staying up until 6:00am to see it.

how his charter evolved as both man and ape was outstanding. not to mention the scenery of the film. christopher lambert was astonishing as lord of greystoke. christopher is the soul to this masterpiece. i became so enthrawled with his performance i could feel my heart pounding. the entireity of the movie still moves me to this day. his portrayal of john was oscar worthy; as he should have been nominated for it.

although films about edgar rice burroughs famous rousseauian hero tarzan have been seen by movie goers for almost a century now, this is the definitive version of the story. greystoke is the actual story of the origins of tarzan as set down by edgar rice burroughs way back in the second decade of the last century. i've been assured by experts.tarzan and sherlock holmes are probably the most filmed fictional heroes in history. i've no basis in fact for saying that, just a gut feeling. the most popular holmes was basil rathbone, the most popular tarzan was johnny weissmuller. and films that they made with both those characters will be criticized no end by purists.but greystoke is the real deal, a faithful adaption of burroughs first story concerning the origin of his hero. i can't think of another film which shows that tarzan learned french before english, but that is shown here and it's only natural since it was a french survivor of a massacred safari played by ian holm who discovers tarzan who has been raised by the apes since his parents who were shipwrecked on the african coast died there after his mother gave birth.his parents were in fact the son and daughter-in-law of the earl of greystoke and the surviving earl, played by ralph richardson is of course overjoyed to learn he has a grandson. of course there are others who don't welcome the new heir back in society. one who doesn't is andie mcdowell playing of course jane. she does not communicate with tarzan in answer to his grunts and monosyllabic commands. tarzan speaks a concise english, french, and understands the language of the apes as well. as for the language of love, tarzan and jane need no lessons.greystoke earned three oscar nominations for best makeup in regard to the apes, best adapted screenplay and a posthumous nomination for ralph richardson for best supporting actor. it should also have rated a nomination for cinematography of the jungle scenes in cameroun and the scenes of the british aristocracy in several landmark places like hatfield house and blenheim palace.for burroughs purists, greystoke is the real deal.

i have seen most of the tarzan episodes. certainly the rated x with o'keeffe & bo derek, which is totally deplorable.i have seen this version several times since it was originally shown.all the cast had memorable parts, great acting the ape sequences.last night i viewed same on spanish station and other than some french dialog all in spanish.as far as hudson not wanting andie's voice he did nothing until the very end. he viewed the dailies and could have hired a dialog coach.it seems silly that a story about apes and a man raised by them all speaking gibberish that hudson attacked andie.the story line in the movie was that she was an american cousin. the last time i checked carolina was in the usa.she was beautiful in movie and her eyes, and gorgeous hair, alabaster skin mystified all us males. she did not have to resort to bo's level.she has remained a lady throughout the rest of her career and should look at this movie (half her life ago),as a starting point. her performance, sincerity, made this movie enjoyable, believable that a half wild man could ascertain her inner beauty.great sending point for sir richardson, he did steal the movie.

while it comes no closer to the tarzan of edgar rice burroughs than, say, the johnny wiesmuller flicks did it does have it's own peculiar, and entertaining, slant on the story. its a well done tarzan movie. nice scenery, good photography, workable continuity, and a tarzan yell that echos the one described by burroughs. the players all perform well. the only bad points i found were, i think, related. it moves slow in places. that slow movement? makes this picture to long. it could easily have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter, which i think would have helped with the natural flow of the plot line and the character development. but the rest of the film works well enough to carry it over these two rough spots and still leave the viewer satisfied with the flick. short version of all the above ... its a very good tarzan movie.

i thought this was a very daring representation of the old hokey 'tarzan' concept made so popular by hollywood, weismuller, et al.yes; there is a lot of silly stuff. but then, the idea is silly. it is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be sired to adulthood by chimpanzees. i am tempted to say completely unbelievable, but that the concept has never been tried. and there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort. though under the circumstances i can see how that would be very difficult to avoid. we also now have a much greater insight into the issues of acculturation, and know that a human raised from infancy without human behavioural prompts would ultimately never learn them in adulthood.still, if you can get your head around that lot, there's a great deal to admire that is both imaginative and daring. lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb. i am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role i have seen him play. there are plenty of other excellent performances too. not least of which are sir ralph richardson and ian holm.what is particularly disturbing - and rightly so - is the simian perception of humans. we get to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor, dumb, helpless brutes over whom we so routinely lord it. and it demonstrates well how the phony 'civilisation' and 'morality' with which we cloak and justify our conduct, is no more than an expression of own selfishness and arrogance. it may seem a little overstated at times, especially in the hideous museum dissection rooms, but what we see isn't just a truth about the victorians; its a truth about the way we are today. it's one that needs to be stated, and cannot be stated often enough. holm's character's obsession with the 'ray-zor' as a symptom of civilisation - as if to possess facial hair were a primitive condition to be scorned - is an excellent case in point. primitive bearded readers take note.the story is depressing. ultimately it's a tragedy. because even though he returns to the jungle and the freedom from moral tyranny that is truly human 'civilisation'; we know he's doomed. before the third millennium is 50 years old, wild simians will be hunted into extinction as bush meat, and their environment developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to gratify insatiable human excess.in the end, it's a tale about ourselves. the path to extinction that other simians tread, must eventually be followed by humans.highly recommended for its ethical take, despite the hokey moments.

before i review this film, i must make a confession that is rather a bold statement to make as a film reviewer. anyone who has already read any of my previous reviews may know that i've always been controversial in a low-key sense, giving high marks for flops such as "captain america" and 1985's "creature" and panning such film classics as alistar sim's "a christmas carol" and "shakespeare in love." with that in mind, this confession might not come as a surprise:the simple fact is, christopher lambert is probably one of my favorite actors. woah, now, don't start getting crazy on me just yet. let me explain myself: i by no means think he's the greatest actor in the world. i clearly confess that he is not. he is certainly no morgan freeman or anthony hopkins, but i would say that his acting ability is probably somewhere up there with at least bruce willis. what i admire about him, however, are the human qualities that he brings into his action heroes. he is just an average guy who laughs and cries and bleeds, who is a hero because he has to be, not necessarily because he wants to be. it takes a lot, in my opinion, to be able to bring out those qualities in a character (especially in the movies he's worked in), and lambert's heroes are a far cry from schwartzennegger's or stallone's. quite frankly, lambert's characters are easier for me to relate to. hence, he's not the greatest actor in the world....he's just a personal favorite.i can't say that same, however, for his films. however much i appretiate his acting, it would be foolish not to confess that his choice of films leave something to be desired. most of them are, quite frankly, terrible, and any ridicule that he's gotten over the years from me isn't due to his acting, but rather his bad choice in scripts.with that in mind, i can say that his debut film, "tarzan," is one of his best films and probably his greatest performance. as i mentioned, it is effective becasue of the humaness he brings to the role, and for how seriously the director, writers and actors handle the material. this is a far leap from the b-movie action adventures with johnny weismeller from the 1940's. in fact, i would hesitate to call it an action movie. instead, it is a serious drama that takes all of e.r. burrough's material seriously, showing tarzan's quest to discover his real family in scotland after realizing that he doesn't fit in as a "white ape." he is torn in between his old family and his new one, which includes a wonderful sir ralph richardson in his final role. in an attempt to adapt to humans, his ape instincts also kick in, and he can't decide what he loves more: his real family, or the one that he's always known. all in all, it is a wonderful commentary on society, and a wonderful character study.if nothing else, it launched lambert into international stardom, which continued will into the 1980's with films like "highlander" and "he sicilian." unfortunately, it didn't last. but just wait a while....his latest career moves such as "gideon" and "resurrection" have proven that though he still have a long way to go, he's a competent enough actor to be able to perhaps make a... ahem.... comeback if he'll just pick his roles better.for now, however, here's the verdict on his first film:*** out of ****

the greatest tarzan ever made! this movie is done in a way that no other tarzan ever has come close in doing. it has every thing in it that you would want in a tarzan movie. no other tarzan movie ever has or ever will portray the character this well. i would say that if you have seen a tarzan movie and liked it you should see this one you will love it, and if you have never seen tarzan you should see this one and forget the rest of them.

i really enjoyed this movie. yes there was disrespect throughout the movie, but bruce willis learned, from the kid, that there is more value in repecting others, and his life of disrespect needs to change. this movie was a refreshing change from the trash that hollywood is trying to shove down our throats. there are some very good lessons to be learned in this movie. i really believe this was one of disneys best, even though a couple of things could have been left out. i was impressed with the lack of swearing and lack of sexual inuendos. it isn't perfect, but much better than most everything else out there.

i must confess that i don't remember this film very well. but, certainly i liked it. i think it was the best adaptation from burroughs novel, really. and of course it's one of the best movie from christopher lambert.a good movie about tarzan, as cult as the ones with weissmuller.

don't let the wildly varying reviews of the movie deter you. you'll love it or hate it according to your own tastes. however, if for no other reason, see "greystoke" to experience the excitement of a great actor grabbing your heart as he breathes life into his role. ralph richardson was not a great actor for how perfectly he could handle shakespeare; rather, he is to be remembered for his sensitive treatment of every character he portrayed. he was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor. his reading of the part of the sixth lord of greystoke, his last performance, is to be cherished by all who love the theatre.

this is one of bruce's most underrated films in my opinion, its an awesome heartwarming film, with a neat story and an amazing performance from bruce willis!. all the characters are great, and i thought willis and spencer breslin were just awesome together, plus bruce willis is simply amazing in this!. this is definitely one of bruce's best comedic performances (the waaaaaaaaaamabulance thing was great) and i thought it was very well written and made as well, plus the finale is especially cool!. it's good natured and it was cool how you can see russell's (willis) character change throughout the film! plus the ending was pretty good. i think this should be higher then 6.0 and it's one of the best disney films i have ever seen! plus it has many surprising moments throughout. all the characters are extremely likable, and it also has a cute love story angle too it as well, plus bruce and spencer breslin both had some really funny lines (holy smokes!). this is one of bruce's most underrated films in my opinion, its an awesome heartwarming film, with a neat story and an an amazing performance from bruce willis and i say its a must see!. the direction is great!. jon turteltaub does a great job here with really good camera work, and just keeping the film at a very fast pace. the acting is excellent!. bruce willis is amazing as always and is amazing here, he gives one of his best comedic performances, is hilarious had wonderful chemistry with both spencer breslin and emily mortimer, had some funny lines, and was dead on throughout the movie, he was one of the main reasons i liked this movie so much! (willis rules!!!!!!!). spencer breslin is fantastic as the younger version of russell, he was very funny and didn't get on my nerves once, he is one of the better child actors out there!. emily mortimer is good as amy and was really cute i liked her she had decent chemistry with bruce too. lily tomlin is funny as janet i liked her quite a bit. jean smart is good with what she had to do, which was not much. rest of the cast do fine. overall a must see!. **** out pf 5

hello, looking for a movie for the family to watch on a friday night? can't find what your looking for? i thought this was an extremely enjoyable movie. good for the whole family. i found that it had a remarkably rare combination of it being appealing to both adults and children alike. it was brilliant, to say the least. bruce willis's acting was top-notch, there was a lot of humor in it and overall, a great movie. in my opinion, it's a must-see movie. and i don't think that about a lot of movies, believe me when i say it takes a lot for a movie to get me to think that. it's clear that there was much work done by bruce willis and cast to get this movie done. excellent story, good acting, and again, overall a thoroughly enjoyable movie.

now for sure, this is one of the lightest-hearted stories that bruce willis has been in to date and yet,-- it is still touching. i really like bruce's style and persona, i haven't loved everything he has ever been in, but he brings it to the 'big-time' for me in most all his film endeavors.the story begins..... he is power, confidence and style with a capitol 's' . he drives a porshe he lives well, in a palatial estate with a grand view of the fair city. that's russell duritz. he is an image consultant to those who are on the top or rising to it. his acclaim, he is russell duritz, he knows what it takes to make it. it just seems that as life is going along swiftly and foundation-ally set, there is a problem, an intruder at his home, the alarm has been activated! russell can't seem to figure out (for the moment) what is happening to him. it's different and yet it is somehow familiar. a small boy, who looks exactly like....-- him. as their lives run smack dab into each other, there seems to be a reason that is screaming out to him, "you have unfinished business to take care of, now!"amy the supporting young lady of the story is probably the best balance that he has seen and has in his life. she works with him, puts up with his 'ego' and yet, she is smitten with russell. very much so. with rusty his past 'self' now in the picture and talking a mile a minute, singing too late at night, everything that was foundational is becoming like jelly! willis is fun, egocentric and at times out of his head in this lovable disney modern times classic 'the kid' and to add his little heavy-duty side kick spencer breslin is a perfect addition to this sparkling story of childhood to adult and back to childhood adventure. chi mcbride is an inspirational supporting character, as he is the heavy-weight champ, teaching 'little' rusty how to box to defend himself against the bullies on the playground. all in all this is a real winner of a movie with even lillie tomlin as the secretary and aide to russell. i originally saw this back in 2000' and then again years later, with equal enjoyment. this is a shiny family comedy that has a super ending that will warm the hearts of any disney fan recommended highly (*****)

when the first trailer for this film was viewed by myself, i was curious as to what angle the storyline would take. after all the plot of having one's childhood self return to the present leaves open many options. bruce willis however does a superb job in the role he was given. i was surprised to see just how well he could act in this part. this is also a good career move as many others have said but after seeing it i now agree. this film is mainly about remembering the kid you used to be, and coming to the realization that you aren't the adult you planned to be. this is a wonderful story and a gripping tale that makes us all think. usually we scorn at "what if..." movies. for example, waterworld attempted to answer the question "what if the world were to be covered with water and...?" but truthfully, nobody cared. this movie however effects everyone in the theatre. true, young children may not fully grasp the idea of growing up and having all your dreams fizzle away, but it leaves a great impact on the adults and parents of those children. this movie is definitely worth seeing. although, it will be better the second time around because you won't be thinking so much (about how the kid got there, and why and all that stuff) just relax and have fun. and take something with you when you leave that cinema. take that piece of your childhood you've forgotten and enjoy it.

the kid - at 39 years old russel duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has a great job, is respected (and feared), has a beautiful house and makes buckets of money. but everything comes at a cost, in this case no social life, no conscience and a fear of spending the rest of his life alone. he just needs someone to show him the way.as i watched the movie, i kept wondering why disney didn't pass this film on to miramax - not because it's particularly daring or edgy, but because it is clearly a movie for adults. this is exacerbated by the marketing campaign which is clearly targeting children - it is lumped in with trailers for "rugrats the movie", and "pokemon 2000" (aren't they passe yet?). but i quibble.i was impressed by the sensitive treatment of the subject matter - rather than the typical male midlife crisis that involves some pathetic sap buying a porsche convertible and acting like a moron, willis' character undertakes some serious introspection and takes stock of his life. his guide on this journey of self-discovery is himself at age 8 (they never explain how rusty arrives and frankly, i didn't care). young rusty's innocence and unbridled optimism give him a distinct advantage in divining the truth - he sums up russell's job as an image consultant thusly, "you teach people how to lie and pretend to be something they aren't". in order for a good script to succeed, however, you need actors to bring it to life. not a problem here.although willis has thrice ignored w.c. fields' warnings about starring with children or animals he has lucked out once again, meshing as well comedically with breslin as he did dramatically with osment. willis manages to balance russell's cutthroat powerbroker traits with vulnerability and confusion, without becoming ridiculous. breslin meanwhile gives a dead on portrayal of a kid from everyone's childhood - the one that always stuck out for some reason and got picked on. we also get two bonus performances: lily tomlin is great as russell's levelheaded assistant and jean smart is perfect as an insightful charming anchorwoman (i loved her in "guinevere").the kid is charming, heavy, and real. and it will appeal to adults of all ages.

from a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values, this one is definitely worthwhile. this is the second bruce willis film in a row that manages to tell its story with no nudity, off-color humor, profanity, or gratuitous violence. (i refer of course to the sixth sense.) both movies are engaging on more than one level. this one is appropriate for children as well, although as others have pointed out, it isn't a flick for kids. i was bothered that the time travel device that drives this plot is never explained, except that we know russell himself initiates it as a 70 year old. also, why does his dying mother have to come to school to get him when he wins the fight; why, if as his older self says, he has to fight that kid again and again for the next few years does his mother not have to come and get him every time, and why he doesn't learn to kick butt in the process. i also found the score rather annoying and not always appropriate to the action on stage. good use of the red plane as metaphor, however.

the kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant, russ duritz, who has lots of money, a good job, nice house, etc. the only problem is he doesn't have much of a social life as nobody seems to like him as he isn't always very nice. one day though things are about to change when an eight year old version of himself magically appears. this gives russ a second chance to make things right. bruce willis plays the lead role here and he gives a really good performance. the kid is a nice, heart-warming movie for everyone.

this is a totally awesome movie! if you haven't seen it yet, you damn well should. sure, the plot is slow to develop, the special effects are laughable, the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed, but as wrestler ddp would say; that's not a bad thing....that's a good thing! everything about this movie is hilarious, especially if you get the dubbed version, which has even worse actors. it's countless laughs until you get to the end, yearning for the sequel, where the mummy fights wrestling women. thus, i give it ten stars. unless you're one of those 'discriminating' and 'intelligent' people with good taste, who likes only 'high quality' films of the highest calibre, i recommend this utterly monkeydellic movie!

what a film. quite possibly the best i've ever seen, the direction, the production,the score and the cinematography,absoloutley wonderful. the acting is also excellent, and the man/robot scenes have to be seen to be belieived. i can not recommend this film enough. get it out on video now, turn the lights down and enjoy.

this flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of k gordon murray. that's because it was easy to find. it was on every public domain label in the vhs era, and before that, a late night t.v. cult classic, double knee thigh slapper. besides, how do you resist the title?for late comers, a brief explanation of it's merit: florida wheeler dealer k. gordon murray imported mexican horror films, dubbed them into english, then made a mint with them at the drive in. the mexican originals were weird enough to begin with; american boundaries and accepted horror film conventions were cheerfully disregarded. great, great set design and lighting were placed beside weird or laughable special effects. nothing in hollywood was as close as these were to out and out strange. now, mix in catholic influenced social conventions, mexican folk lore, and we are not in kansas anymore. add to that the english scripts they were dubbed into. most were written by reuban guberman, who wanted words to match movements of the actors lips on screen, not the literal translation. as a result the american soundtracks tended to run from overwrought to down right loopy. there's even a fan web site for murray that prints the best, most over the top lines for each movie. first time viewers to the films complain about the pacing, the purple prose, the production values and are told it's supposed to be that way..while the people laugh with enjoyment over things normally considered fatal film flaws. it all must be very confusing if you don't have a taste for it.this one was made back to back in 1957 with the two previous films in the series; the aztec mummy and curse of the aztec mummy. all three are now available on the 3 disc aztec mummy collection (bci) and it's about time. it has the k gordon murray version on one side, the original mexican production on the other side. the contrast between the two is fascinating. a lot of the times the original spanish is not much saner.robot/mummy starts off with a nice long flashback bringing you up to speed on the previous episodes, sort of..continuity was tossed out the window in number two, and it's downhill from there, logic wise. you don't even get the angel back, or any mention of him in this final episode. names, places, even family trees switch between films. after a while, you start looking for the continuity changes. by now, the series villain doc krupp is totally pig biting mad, nearly drooling with dementia and still wants to steal the aztec breastplate. rosita arenas is sent back to the past with another nice edit of the aztec mummy floor show, and wanders out into the dark in her nightie to help find that doggone breastplate again. the mummy isn't any happier with this then he was last time.the robot actually has a production credit. it was made by 'viana & co s.a.'. i mention this, because it looks like the grips came up with it between takes on a slow afternoon when the real costume went walkabout. nope.this was planned. wait until you see the controller it runs from. x box, where were you when krupp needed you??? the robot looks crushed to death at the end, but actually came back in two more mexican made movies..it had a fan base.. all in all, a funny quirky finish to a three movie series. sit back and enjoy.

this was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long. there was an aspect of film-noir contained in this movie and i am glad that nolan picked to film it in black and white. the plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged. even the dialogue was good along with the acting. it reminded me of what was to come in memento by not being in chronological order. i liked how the main character tried to use what cobb taught him for example saying "everyone has a box" which he put his personal things into. also, on the writer's door was the batman logo which seemed ironic because christopher nolan would later direct batman begins and the dark knight, two other great movies. there is a great twist in the end which i'm not going to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it, even though i kind of figured what would happen when cobb gave the young man d lloyds credit card. i also liked how the writer had a copy of the republic by plato one of my favorite philosophical books. this is definitely a movie you need to watch more than once to get the full aspect of it, plus it only being an hour long. there is also a circular aspect to it by ending where it began which i thought was pretty brilliant.

this film is superb, it has the same low-budget first film feel of 'pi' and 'clerks', but has the style of 'memento' (also by writer/director christopher nolan). the score, sound effects, photography and editing are almost 'memento' prototypes, and the story shows that christopher nolan is best when writing and directing. don't be put off by the low-budget look and acting, or even the short length of the film, and just watch it!

saw this at the hong kong international film festival, over three years ago. i went in with no expectations since christopher nolan was a no-name at the time, but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things i saw at that festival. it worked well on the big screen, with the technique of cutting the scenes out of sequence adding to the mood. mr.nolan gave a good account of its making at the end, enough to put anybody off starting out as a film-maker! i liked it better than memento although this was, perhaps, due to the lower expectations. and the fact that it was more of an art house movie.

i'm amazed that memento (which is an excellent flick) is so well-regarded in the top 250 and this one doesn't even appear!! what the hell is that?? to be honest - when this movie ended my knee-jerk reaction was that this movie is better than memento. after the euphoria of the fabulous ending wore off, i concluded that they are equal in their excellence. i am just confused about why its not in the top 50 along with memento. i'm going to venture a guess that (sadly) it's because it's in black and white or because (again sadly)that the characters all have british accents ...sadly because that is no reason to not appreciate a great movie like this.i'm telling you that if you loved memento, you will love following as well. brilliant!

following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood. the plot has many twists and uses displaced chronology. the event sequence complicates following following. if you are willing to pay attention, it is an exciting movie full of noir earmarks. with the running time at 70 minutes, there is a lot to take in, but the fast pace helps to keep the viewer enthralled.bill is a lonely, untidy fellow who takes up shadowing people and seeing where they go-what they do. he is a bit too conspicuous, however, and eventually gets caught by a well dressed, clean-cut bloke named cobb. cobb entangles bill in a world the poor boy is not prepared to live in. cobb is a smart rogue who seems to have complete control over the other characters. by the end of the film the disjointed story is explained thoroughly. the film is an excellent first effort from the talented christoper nolan, who would go on to make memento, one of the most original movies of our time.

this is an excellent film, but momento (nolan's other big budget film) is much better . i would recommend people go to see momento and then if they like that, see this film. the film is shot in black and white which i was a bit annoyed with at first but once into the film you understand black and white is the best way for the film to be seen. it is extremely gripping and reasonably easy to understand even though the way it is made is extremely clever. elements of the storyline i think are a bit daft but the film is definitely worthy of a second viewing. to conculde the film has a clever plot, clever twists and turns, very good acting and bearing in mind the budget of the film i have to say that it is pretty amazing.

there are two things that i noticed in this film. (this is not a spoiler, just a mistake in storytelling.) when cole takes bill to his first b&e, he finds the "box". as soon as cole finds it he says, "the box. everyone's got a box". a minute later, just before he dumps the contents on the floor he says, "we're actually very fortunate. you don't see these often".observation #2 (spoiler alert!)i had to watch the thing three times, i couldn't figure a couple of things out. then i watched the chronological version and saw that they were having flash backs from the latter to the previous during the time changes. so at some points we were actually watching three different times in about 1 min of wall time.that was a good thing because i don't know how many more times i could watch it before returning it to netflix.color me obsessive.

an excellent debut movie for the the director of batman begins, comes the following, a movie about a man who follows other people for inspiration of characters in stories he writes. one man he follows, he decides to go further and the man turns out to be more than he bargained for.using a cast of non-actors and his uncle, writing directing producing and otherwise completely making this movie entirely on his own with almost no budget and produced independently, this movie is much more than you'd expect.for anyone who likes memento and complex twists, turns, shocks, and messing around with time, this is definitely a movie for you.

christopher nolan's first film is a 'no budget' black and white film about a unemployed writer who begins following strangers, which in turn leads to robbery and also violence. it is very good.like in his later film 'memento' he doesn't present the story in a linear way. instead it jumps around somewhat so you end up really sucked in trying to piece it all together and early, apparently random, shots take on significance as the film progresses. this style also means the twists are much more effective.definitely worth seeing if you get the chance (especially if you like his later work and/or film noir)

brit director chrstopher nolan now has a career in america, and a reputation for making movies both popular and critically acclaimed; but this small film was where he started. and it certainly showcased his talent, with its striking black-and-white cinematography and achronological storytelling that prefigures his later 'momento', albeit in a less extreme way. thematically and mechanistically, the plot reminded me of david mamet's 'house of games', but the film still feels fresh and sharp, right up to the final twist of the ending whose flavour was expected, but whose pointedness is unexpectedly delicious. the acting, on the other hand, is not quite in the same class - the film has a stylised quality, and possibly to a greater extent than the director intended. but it's still a fine debut, simultaneously claustrophobic and beguiling.

i just found the entire 3 dvd set at wal-mart in the bargain bin for $5.50, so i thought i would take another look. total of 13 hours to watch it all (26 episodes). i was born in 1948 and saw most of them on tv in the sixties. many independent stations repeated them for many years.better than i expected actually, time has been kind to the obvious sincerity of it's creators, and to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all the allied fighting men and women. more abstract and arty than a straight forward documentary, but very truthful in it's depiction of the causes and final results of wwii. that war was greatly dependent on sea transportation, and the final victory was dependent on who achieved the final mastery of the world's oceans. the allies were the ones who were able to do it.interesting too, to see how they try to strike a balance between big events, and the individual soldiers and sailors that made them happen. the score is impressive, if a bit too much by today's standards. i read somewhere that robert russell bennett contributed just as much as richard rodgers to final score. i imagine that rodgers provided all the major themes, and it was up to bennett to fit them to the images. great job!should be seen by every ruler, or potential ruler. a warning to tyrants that wars are eventually won by ideals, determination, and the supplies to back them up. logistics: their quality and delivery will determine the eventual victors. the allies outproduced and surpassed the material quality of the axis, attacked their very source in the process, and insured their eventual defeat.sorry to see that the producer, henry salomon, lived a very short life. imdb's facts were rather skimpy, i have to find out more about him. he did a few more outstanding documentaries before his early death. might have more to say at a later timetrivia: i had all 3 lp records made of the background music, pretty good overall. unfortunately, the producers decided to add sound effects to the last one, relegating immediately to just novelty status, rather than for serious music listening. too bad too, because it contained some interesting but more minor themes in the series. silly stuff like 16 inch guns firing, torpedoes being fired, bulldozers, planes...just for kids mainly.rsgre

i spotted this film in a branch of the duane reed pharmacy in new york on holiday, and it seemed like a bit of silly fun. and sure enough, the whole premise is ridiculous beyond words - but it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable action film for kids, and their parents too.10-year-old ricky bernard (jordan garrett) has his head in the clouds most of the time, much to his father's (larry miller) dismay. as a member of his school orchestra, ricky and schoolmates fly to a concert performance ... and once again ricky's mind 'takes off' and suspects some criminal plot is happening.reluctantly aided by best friend sashi, who is a fan of hot sauce (what a strange plot device that was) and others they try to get to solve the mystery. oh yes, and ricky's skills 1,000 hours of flight simulator experience prove to be handy when he is called on to save the day in the film's thrilling climax! it was good to see eric roberts and mark dacoscos play parts in a family film. and watching the dvd interviews everyone seems to have had great fun taking part.i totally liked junior pilot; charming and good-natured performances, funny plot line and a real; sense of enjoyment and sheer silliness.if you are looking for an entertaining family film, you could do far worse than buy this one.

definitely worth renting! good clean family entertainment. my 4 and 5 year-olds (and i) loved it. kept them on the edge of their seats. i recommend parents sit with their younger children to watch this, as it can be quite suspenseful for them. it's not too often you can find movies that you can watch with your children, and so this is a rare find. some of the acting / realism isn't quite there at times, or maybe is a little corny, but children don't seem to notice or care, they love it. parts are predictable, but other parts are not - like trying to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. the movie doesn't have any really scary/creepy stuff, and so i doubt it will give children nightmares. it does inspire children to dream, which is something we need to encourage and foster more in our children. rent and be blessed!

mishima - a life in four chapters is in my opinion the best paul schrader film to this day. mesmorizing cinematography, accompanied with philip glass mystical musical score added a completely magical aura to the story of one of the japan's greatest novelists, whose originality and picturesque narrative are beautifully portrayed in this picture. as any gifted character, mishima was troubled with severe self conflicts, the main of them being the conflict between the "pen and a sword" as the director puts it in his final chapter, or the struggle between the sensitive poet with homosexual feelings, living in a notoriously masculine society with centuries long warrior traditions, thus widening the gap between the sensitive and the militantly traditional side of mishima himself.all schrader's films (and the ones he wrote scripts for) are basically stories of the inside conflict within a man that doesn't belong in an environment he lives in. that also goes for mishima, who, apart from japanese military school upbringing is brought up with love for theater and words. his demise consisted of both of these key points in his life, it was about words and theatrical ending in a life long play. film like this comes along once in a long while, and most will have to wait a lifetime to reach this beauty. 20 out of 10!!

the only pure life, is one that ends with a signature in blood.so says mishima anyway, a young sheltered boy who becomes a celebrity author. the life of one of japans most celebrated literary voices, is told from three perspectives, his life just before he and four members of his private army take over a japanese military base and commit ritual suicide(shown in color), flashbacks(shown in black and white), and scenes from his novels(shown in a kind of dreamy technicolor set design somewhere between traditional noh theater and "the wizard of oz". these stories are often told at the same time, but are edited to reinforce, the slow fusing of mishima's life with his fictions, until the end(or the beginning) when like the ancient samurai he so admires, he will be at a balance of pen and sword (when his words and actions are the same, and he is a full and "pure" being).paul schrader wrote the screen play for "taxi driver", and directed "cat people"(a bizarre erotic horror film, which left strange impressions on me as a boy), and in mishima, he comes closest to making a really excellent film.whats interesting is to watch the poet, the homosexual, the shy and awkward man with a low body image who overstates his tuberculosis to get of of ww2 (of which he seems forever ashamed), become a body building, samurai obsessed, a-sexual, media phenomena, all the while still writing prolific amounts of novels, plays, and short stories.a short and sweet version is to say mishima has no father, and becomes obsessed with masculinity, beauty, sex and self destruction, in some tragic attempt to feel connected to something bigger than himself, that he was always missing. watching him with his fellow suicidal cadets, you see him happy, delivering his big paternal speech, giving orders, and loving the control...until the speech itself, the point where pen and sword meet? of course, this ignores the subtlety of the story telling craft here which makes this transformation so natural and remarkable. though the story, fascinating at times, really isn't this movies greatest success. the cinematography, performances, editing,music(by philip glass), and set designs, are really what make this worth seeing, and more than a traditional bio-pic.one day i will pick, up a mishima book, he does seem to have an ear for prose, and for staging ideas, but for now i'm satisfied with the film.those interested in japanese literature, and post-war culture, should check out. fans of inventive combinations of facts and fictions, should enjoy as well.

i saw this movie on television as screamers and loved it. i heard an interesting story about this film. when roger corman released it to drive-ins in the summer of 1981, his trailer department sent out an advance trailer which was not actually footage from the film. it was allegedly footage of a naked woman being chased around a laboratory set by a monster. during the film's opening at drive-in's, irate customers complained the did not see the movie they paid to see. theater owners called corman and said their customers felt ripped off. so corman had to run off copies of the footage, and send the positive film to theater owners to splice into the film themselves. since the footage was never part of the film negative, it has not appeared in any video, dvd or television broadcast. has anyone ever seen this footage? anyone who saw this film at a drive-in in the summer of 1981 remember this?

action packed,with my favorite type of creature.i won't give any of it away if you have'nt seen it,cause it's worth taking the time to sit down and unravel in the mystery of things as presented in this film.it did gets slow at times and those were the moments my mind wondered which does easily anyways but moist of it kept me quietly thrilled,where you keep it in your head instead of letting it out,probably the mood i was in at the time.special effects and action sequences you could feel made up for the occasional lulls.of course there'es a duschload of movies out there exactly like this,the film still has it's own style and flavor,which i respect from underground independent horror movies anyways.

although the video box for many copies of this film claims it is about people turned inside out, this is a total lie. in fact, apart from the opening segment, the film isn't even a horror movie. with its sunken treasure, legions of fish people, and mad scientists, it's a lot more like a doug mcclure adventure movie. obviously, this film is no work of art, but it's kind of fun to watch... just be warned that the beginning is quite gory.

when a group of escaped convicts manage to flee to a remote island,they soon find that their new home is inhabited by a strangely menacing doctor(richard johnson of "zombi 2" fame),a mad scientist(joseph cotten),his beautiful daughter(barbara bach)and a horde of superstitious natives.the tribesmen say that the doctor has created grotesque half-human,half-fish creatures for evil,secretive purposes.and though at first the prisoners do not believe this,as they disappear,one by one,they begin to change their minds."screamers" is a very entertaining mix of "mysterious island" and "humanoids from the deep".there is plenty of gore with really cool decapitation scene and throat tearing to boost.the acting is so-so,but the film is fast-paced and entertaining.give it a look.8 out of 10.

fans of euro-horror flicks - portland's video/dvd store movie madness has a whole section devoted to this genre - can't afford to miss sergio martino's gut-busting "l'isola degli uomini pesce" (called "screamers" in the united states). here's the lowdown: some shipwreck survivors land on an uncharted caribbean island in 1891. the island is inhabited by a landowner, a scientist (joseph cotten) and his daughter (barbara bach). sure enough, it turns out that the landowner is making the scientist create a race of fish-men. and while the fish-men remain calm as long as they can drink their potion, they get nasty otherwise.this movie is sort of a mixture of genres: euro-horror, swashbuckling, voodoo, and maybe a little bit of "the island of dr. moreau". but it's mostly an excuse to have the fish-men disembowel trespassers; ya gotta love that! i wouldn't be surprised if the euro-horror genre gave quentin tarantino some of his ideas for "grindhouse". after all, the european horror directors have no scruples about what they show. this is one that you're sure to like.so joseph cotten is the only cast member from an alfred hitchcock movie (i mean "shadow of a doubt") who later co-starred with ringo starr's soon-to-be wife and audrey hepburn's ex (by whom i mean mel ferrer) in an italian horror flick. the things that we see in life...

screamers is an italian fantasy film (l'isola degli uomini pesce) bought by roger corman and released through his new world pictures. of course corman has to carve his initials on it by having one of his lackeys (dan t. miller) direct some additional gore footage before he has it released in the states.l'isola degli uomini pesce is a very entertaining retelling of the island of dr. moreau. it is 1891 and claudio cassinelli is shipwrecked on a mysterious island with a few newly escaped convicts. claudio comes across the stellar barbara bach and richard johnson. johnson plays the dastardly edmund rackham: a man who is able to manipulate scientist joseph cotton into turning the local native population into amphibious deep-sea diving creatures, (they look like a cross between the black lagoon creature and one of the humanoids from the deep), by convincing cotton that the mutations are being created for the highest of scientific and humanitarian motives.having discovered the lost city of atlantis, rackham is using the amphibious creatures to loot its treasures. sexy barbara bach plays cotton's daughter who has a psychic link with these mutations. in one memorable scene, bach takes a midnight swim with these mutants wearing only a thin white cotton dress that leaves little to the imagination. claudio discovers one of the convicts he has befriended has been turned into a gill-creature and then all hell breaks loose.filmed at the same time and in the same location as zombi 2, richard johnson didn't even have to change suits between films. the house where the experiments take place is the same house johnson uses to conduct experiments in zombi 2. talk about economic filmmaking!the additional footage features a few bloody beheadings, (way to go roger!), and a laughably bad cameron mitchell doing his best pirate imitation. all that's missing is the parrot.spanish title: le continent des hommes poissons

this movie surprised me. the box is misleading, the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading. the movie is quite gory, well-acted and beautifully shot. the special-effects are top-notch and seem to be ahead of their time, until you realize this movie came out in 1979, not in 1963 like it's tone would suggest. it is a unique take on the dr. moreau story, and one of the better versions filmed. the first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking, but the film doesn't ever really fall apart. definitely worth-seeing if you are a fan of dramatic costume/horror classics and gore-fests.

i finally got a chance to settle in and compare the two versions of this film currently going around -- first, the good old scummy, sleazy embassy vhs print called screamers, and then a new fully restored italian dvd by everyone's new favorite media company, no shame of italy.the american adverts about "men turned inside out" is as everyone says, totally misleading, and indicative of a roger cormanized take on what otherwise would be a superior fantasy-adventure thriller for grown ups. the complete italian version is a somewhat sprawling, well designed and deliberately paced take on "island of dr. moreau", and there's nothing wrong with that. it's a sumptuous, handsome euro horror outing with a brain, good plotting, character development, location shooting, period costuming and sets, etc.but i must admit that the 14 year old knucklehead weed puffer still lurking somewhere inside of me got a bigger kick out of the more lurid, sleazy and unkempt roger corman version, which has some nice over the top gore, a flashy but preposterous opening segment, and then the bulk of martino's original film, albeit somewhat abridged to make room for roger's idea of entertainment. the pacing was somewhat quicker, the shock sequences closer together, and you see just as much of ms. bach's fantastic form as you do in the extended italian version.i still don't have much of an idea about what the specific story concerns though: there are a number of plot twists and incidental characters that were somewhat hard to keep track of. a local voodoo subplot didn't help much, and it's funny how everything culminates in just another fistfight between the noble castaway prisoner and the mad scientist ... perhaps a few more viewings are in order. i will say this: fans of the movie should avail themselves of one of these pal imports and take a look at what is actually a movie rather than just another murky old home video -- the widescreen shot compositions once again reveal that martino had an eye for filling his screen with interesting stuff. nobody gets their heads ripped off like in the screamers print, but it's still interesting stuff, and once again proof that while his standards may have been pretty much confined to the area around the gutter, roger corman new good trashy fun when he had it made for him, and side by side these are actually better movies than they had to be.7/10

sure, most people will designate "island of the fishmen" as silly and trashy hokum, but can you honestly name one other movie that brings forward this many exhilarating themes? this italian gem stands for pure entertainment and features stuff like voodoo, volcanic eruptions, mutant fish-creatures, the mysterious continent of atlantis, treasure-hunting, a remote island filled with death traps and utterly mad scientists! all this and much more in one simple movie? yes, please! close-minded opponents of italian horror cinema can easily tag this film as a cheap exploitation version of "the island of dr. moreau", but the truth is that this is so much more! "island of the fishmen" delivers thrills and adventure from start to finish with surprisingly convincing special effects and astonishingly stylish camera-work. the story promisingly opens with a small group of prisoners, survivors of a shipwreck, washing ashore a tropical island. they encounter the sadistic edmond rackham who rules over a native tribeand a legion of genetically created amphibian monsters that live in the island's swamps. there are so many twists and additional sub-plots in the story that it's almost impossible to write a summary but, trust me, this gem is worth checking out. sergio martino once again proves that he's an ingenious filmmaker who has the talent to be commercial-minded and creative at the same time. he makes great use of the beautiful island location and also the interior sets look very impressive. the staggering underwater footage and imaginative scenery really lift this film high above the normal standards of late 70's exploitation. i don't quite understand why roger corman reworked the original so much and released it on the american market under a different title ("screamers"), because there are very few elements open for improvement. the cast members are all sergio martino regulars (with the exception of the great joseph cotton is a neat supportive rule) and give away great performances. in case you can get your hands on the recently restored german version, you're treated to fifteen uncut minutes of extra action. see it!

this is a very odd movie for harold lloyd--at least in regard to the sweet character he played in movies throughout the 1920s and 30s. instead of a nice guy, he and snib pollard are con men--out to rob everyone blind. in a particularly successful con, chester pretends to have lost a "very valuable ring" and a bit later, harold finds it as a stooge is also looking for the ring. the ring, of course, is a cheap one dropped and then found by harold, but the greed of the stooge is so great, he "convinces" harold to say nothing and sell him the "valuable" ring and then they run away to enjoy their luck(?). again and again they find patsies until they meet up with a woman who herself is a con woman (working with a guy doing fake séances). she arranges a nifty con and takes all the money they stole--and has a cop standing by to make sure they give her the money.as luck would have it, the two con men stumble into the lady's shady business when no one is home. soon, the lady returns and messes with their minds--releasing a lot of dirty tricks to punish them for their wicked ways.all around, this is a completely odd and contrived film, but it is also exceedingly funny, as the jokes work very well and lloyd and pollard make an excellent team. plus, while creepy and strange, i liked seeing pollard dressed like a lady.

i just watched this, an early harold lloyd short film that featured his "glasses" character on kino video's dvd of "the harold lloyd collection". he's actually a con man with snub pollard as his partner who gets discovered by bebe daniels who herself performs fake séances. what she discovers is that lloyd and pollard bilk many customers by dropping fake rings that are "lost". i'll stop there and just say this was quite funny especially when harold and snub enter the place bebe works and encounter some creepy contraptions and put on costumes like snub trying one of bebe's outfits. not too much slapstick but what there is of was also quite funny. so on that note, i recommend are crooks dishonest?

was struck at how even the acting was throughout. william haines had an acting range that is wonderful for silent film. not over the edge. there are moments where the camera work is most excellent, and combined with the story, like when he is waiting to see the superintendent, very well done. thoroughly enjoyed the flick.

a brash, self-centered army cadet arrives at west point with a dangerous wise guy attitude towards the corps.in a role obviously tailor-made for him, william haines shines in this highly enjoyable tale of honor & friendship. a grade-a scene stealer, haines during the first half of the film is up to his usual silly billy behavior, which under normal circumstances should have gotten him confined to the guardhouse. the last half, however, becomes very serious, leading up to haines' moral redemption and giving him a fine opportunity to exhibit his acting talents. if west point does not quite reach the caliber of haines' previous tell it to the marines (1926), this is doubtless due to the absence here of a costar of the charisma & quality of lon chaney for haines to interact with. however, this tribute to the army is very effective entertainment and should be appreciated on its own merit.joan crawford appears as haines' love interest, playing the virginal daughter of the local innkeeper. joan is pert & pretty and especially shines in her first scenes, when she meets haines on a hudson river ferry and is subjected to his usual immature antics. haines & crawford made five silent feature films together and were tremendous friends for life. he was the much bigger celebrity at this period and gave her many hints for getting ahead in hollywood. a superstar herself by the early 1930's, she reciprocated after his ouster from mgm in 1932 by encouraging his career change to interior decoration.little william bakewell is effectively cast as a plebe who idolizes haines; their relationship is actually given more of a sentimental treatment than that of haines & crawford.the film was made with the full cooperation of the war department. extensive location filming at the academy helps tremendously with the production's ambiance, which was given splendid production values by mgm.west point has been recently restored and given a rousing new score by david davidson.

haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks west point will really amount to something now that he has arrived. haines displays his easy, goofy comic persona as he takes on west point and joan crawford, the local beauty. great fun for the first half. and amazingly touching after haines's character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets. the new, humility-filled haines get s alast-minute reprieve to play in the bill football game against navy and, despite a broken arm, wins the game. great, rousing entertainment by mgm in this haines formula film, shows billy at his best. william bakewell also scores as the skinny follower. the handsome-but-goony character would be played by clark gable, cary grant, gary cooper and others in later decades, another take on the beautiful-but-daffy dames played by carole lombard and marion davies. west point is a winner!

i found west point to be an agreeable film, although i doubt that i would watch it again. the performances were convincing, with william haines as yet another obnoxiously amusing young man that has his come-uppance by film's end. it's hard to believe that stardom beckoned joan crawford less than a year after this film was made, as she looks rather awkward at times. i would apply the comment made by another concerning ramon novarro's "huddle" (1932) to this film as well. there is a great film waiting to be made here, but there is something lacking. the backdrop and integration of the corps was well utilized, but i was less involved than i thought that i would be. perhaps haines' character went too far, or got away with too much. his "repentance" did not seem genuine enough; and what kind of message did it send for him to run every play in the last minutes of the army-navy game? where's "the corps" in that? might as well have taken out the other ten men and let him do it all himself. also, i doubt very much that william bakewell's weak, puny character would ever have a real-life counterpart at west point.all this aside, the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring. it is a fine look into the daily practices of an honorable institution. thank goodness that tradition still means something at west point too, unlike the vapid "traditions" of ivy league schools, only half-heartedly engaged in these days.as to the score: it was appropriately martial. but, there was a distinct over-use of snare drums. using them for knocks on the door, scene transitions, et alu as well as in well over half the scenes got to be rather tedious. it rather lessened the viewing experience. i was ready to say "i get the point already." with that, enjoy the film, but don't expect too much emotional involvement.

william haines sparks this tale of a brash cadet who thinks west point will really be something now that he has arrived. terrific goony comic performance by haines was his trademark--one that made him a top box office star from 1928-1932 and one of mgm's biggest stars. joan crawford and william bakewell are fine too. and although this storyline may seem trite now, this was a huge hit, putting haines and crawford in a college football (a national craze during the 20s) story. after haines blows off his big mouth one time too often and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets, he turns in a wonderful performance as he swallows his pride and gets into the big game against navy. even with a broken arm, he wins the game for army and regains his place at west point. it's easy to see from this film and show people (with the always underrated marion davies) why billy haines was a huge star of the time. he needs and deserves to be remembered!

it is a shame that this series hasn't been remastered and produced on video by warner or some other professional movie house.copies of most episodes are available, but are usually of poor quality, being copies of copies of copies.as i understand it, 92 episodes were produced during its run, but only 15 are noted here.some of the series writers, such as richard matheson, went on to become noted authors.excellent series, well written, well staged and well produced.michael weldon,udon thani, thailand

this is a low budget, well acted little gem. alice, a small town massachusetts teenager, fed up with her existence, takes to the road to escape her mother who flips burgers and her own job as a check out in a super market. she sets out for florida and to stay with her wealthier high school friend who is a freshman at miami. after her car suspiciously breaks down on the thruway and she loses all her money, she ends up with a retired couple in an rv who also happen to be traveling to florida.. the couple, brilliantly played by judith ivy and bill raymond are overly hospitable and, it turns out, a prostitute and and her pimp. slowly, alice is lured into truck stop prostitution as the rv meanders down the thruway in the general direction of florida. through intermittent flashbacks, we learn a little more about alice and her desire to leave tiny milford. we also see the couple in a new light and their life and the choices made by the couple and alice all seem quite credible. an excellent, well made film that you will think about when it is over.

i seriously enjoy dr who.seriously, don't just dismiss me as a "sci-fi person", because i'm not normally. i caught on because a friend got me hooked when they started watching it. it is actually really funny, and more often than not, it's fast-paced. all of my family watch it pretty much and that's a miracle.christopher ecclestion is pretty good, but david tennant is brilliant. i think it's because he made the doctor so manic and it's just nice to have that little bit of eccentricity in a tv character again.i don't know what it is about it, but everything manages to work like clockwork. all i'm going to say is just try it. one episode (probably best if you don't pick the second half of a two-parter, though).

it was september 2003 that i heard the bbc were going to resurrect doctor who and make it " bigger and better " but i'd heard these rumours in the press before and thought that's all they were - rumours . but it was then mentioned that russell t davies was going to executively produce and write the show and then one saturday afternoon in march 2004 channel 4 news interviewed the actor cast in the title role - christopher eccleston . yes that christopher eccleston an actor i've always been impressed by since watching his film debut in let him have it and if he was getting interviewed on television it must have been true . as the months passed more and more information was leaked , billie piper was being cast , the daleks would be returning and the mill , the hollywood effects company who had done the fx for gladiator were contracted to do the special effects for the show . for several weeks before the first broadcast trailers galore heralded the return of the new series , massive billboards in london informed the public about the return of the show , tabloid newspapers carried massive photo spreads of the aliens appearing and christopher eccleston appeared on programmes as diverse as blue peter , mastermind ( which had a special doctor who night edition ) , this morning and friday night with johnathan ross . in fact this new series of doctor who must have been the most hyped programme in the history of british television , it had better be bloody good so was it bloody good ? undoubtedly it has been a major success with nearly every episode making the top ten shows in the tv charts . to give you clue of its rating success only one episode ( the ark in space episode two - febuary 1975 ) from the old series had made it into the top five tv chart . the opening series episode made number three with two more episodes either beating or equalling the previous record and this is in an era where there's far more competition in terms of tv stations and choice . let's laugh and cheer at the fact doctor who stuffed hit me baby one more time , celebrity wrestling and mauled ant and dec's saturday night takeaway . of course much of the success is down to the breath taking visuals and the casting of a well known prestigious actor in the role . for the most part everything you see on screen here equals anything you'll see in a spielberg / hollywood movie . there's a dalek invasion force numbering tens of thousands , exotic aliens , a 19th century cardiff that looks like a 19th century cardiff and night filming that is actually night filming and not done by sticking a dark filter over the screen . i promise you'll be hearing a lot more from the directors who worked on this series , joe ahearne especially will one day be in the hollywood a list there are some flaws to the new series of doctor who and all of them should be laid at the door of russell t davies . it may be contentious whether the soap opera and post modernist elements are successful or not ( in my opinion they're not ) but what's not in dispute is that the weakest scripts are all written by rtd . as i mentioned in my review of casanova he cheats the audience and he does the same thing here: when faced by armed soldiers pointing their guns at him the doctor bellows " attack plan delta " which makes no sense to anyone in the audience but allows him to escape from a tight spot , a naked captain jack suddenly pulls out a laser he's been hiding and rtd scripts are full of these type of cheats and deus ex machina type endings . in fact the final episode is spoiled greatly by the ridiculous concept of what the " bad wolf " is which seems to have got rtd out of a tight spot more than the doctor . and of the endings i'm trying to remember if any of them were actually down to the doctor ? more often than it's a supporting character or the doctor's companion who saves the day . the show is called doctor who not rose tyler so can we see the title character save the day please just like he did in the classic series ? one final point about the portrayal of the doctor is the way he's written as a grinning loon . eccleston is best known for his serious and gloomy roles and he's absolutely breath taking at scenes when he's showing grief , like the tear running down his face in the end of the world but more often than not he's written as a " tom baker on speed " character . it's obvious why eccleston hasn't done much comedy in his career - he's not very good at it am i starting to sound like i hate this show ? sorry i didn't mean to but it's just that while some anticipations have been met or surpassed some others haven't and they're nearly all down to russell t davies who thankfully is contributing less in the way of scripts in the next series of doctor who . let's see more traditional stories of a human outpost being under threat from monsters like we saw in the 1960s and 70s , imagine a story like the sea devils with a massive budget directed by joe ahearne ! oh and one last request - can we see these " next time " trailers scrapped ? they reveal all the best bits of next week's episode

i never saw doctor who before (at least not in any focused way), so i was new to the concept. i have to say that the new show works very well. it's funny (it really also ought to say "comedy" in the genre description; many plot turns are only acceptable because of their comedic value), it's well-written and it's making a meager budget go a long way. the human dimension is very strong and engaging, which is very rare in current tv shows.i've seen the first eight episodes, and #6-8 were my favorites so far. even types of stories that are all too easy to screw up (with time-travel, saving one's dead parents and that sort of stuff) works out amazingly well here.christopher eccleston is a joy to watch as the witty and light-hearted though occasionally morose doctor - if they can find a good replacement for him, i'll be quite surprised. but i'm willing to give the new guy a chance. there's little doubt, however, that the eccleston episodes are going to go down in history as classics.the relationship between the doctor and rose is particularly refreshing. the doc is much more of a father figure to her than a romantic interest, and yet there are hints of romantic innuendo between them, which however is much more emotional and human than sexual.a good show. the biggest drawback is the low budget - a show like this ought to have better special effects. and why they don't simply use some cheaper effects, i don't know. in this day and age, sfx don't have to cost a bundle - just look at the star wars: revelations fan film.8 out of 10.

i remember being so excited on saturday nights when i was a kid, waiting for dr. who. i thought it was the best show ever made. then, i grew up, dr. who went off the air, and no one i knew had ever heard of it. then i found out there was going to be a new series. i was a little nervous about it. was it going to live up to the expectations i had carried around since i was little? would they screw it up? would the dr. suck? would his assistant suck? would they create a more intimate relationship with the dr. and his assistant? yes, no, no, no, no!!! this show is wonderful!! i love the new dr. i love his assistant. i love the show. and i find myself excited on friday nights now, waiting for the "new" episode. i'm just now seeing 2005 episodes, as i live in the states, so i'm a little behind the rest of you. i hope the next dr. is as great as this one!

it would be great if a discussion on this medium length film is initiated with a brief tale about hypocrisy of hollywood people.it was in 1988 that chuck norris saw this film at cannes international film festival.he made a silly remark by uttering that the senseless killing depicted in dekalog 5 is far more effective than killings which have been filmed in his hollywood films with him as a potent action star.he was speaking about an innocent taxi driver whose face is brutally disfigured in kieslowski's film by a reckless psychopath who hits him cruelly with a big stone.there should be absolutely no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a dignified human society.this is the reason why chuck norris' statement appears as a cruel joke which defends violent means in a society which is increasing becoming restless.an honest reviewer would not be making a mistake if he/she states that kieslowski's film "dekalog: dekalog,piec (#1.5)" has universal connotations.this is because the events depicted in dekalog 5 can happen in any part of world.the best lesson which kielowski gives to us concerns levels of violence which are acceptable in a just society.this is the reason why the brutal slaying of an innocent cab driver is capable of causing a feeling of repugnance in us.we would not feel the same hatred for homicide when it appears in films featuring arnold schwarzenegger,chuck norris and jean claude van damme as they appear much too artificial.one can easily grasp that special effects and modern studio techniques can charm only toddlers but make no sense to serious film enthusiasts.kieslowski also champions helplessness of human beings in rescuing fellow humans beings from the clutches of death and misery.this is particularly interesting as time and again it has been proved that strict laws and capital punishments have not been able to prevent homicide.

a brutally straightforward tale of murder and capital punishment by the state. so painfully slow and accurate in the description of capital punishment (from the preparation of the gallow to the victim p***ing in his own pants before dying) it has the power to change your mind about death penalty. the whole dekalog originated from this story: the dekalog screenwriter was the powerless lawyer unsuccessfully trying to defend and then console the accused.

'identity . . . . i am part of my surroundings and i became separate from them and it's being able to make those differentiations clearly that lets us have an identity and what's inside our identity is everything that's ever happened to us' (ntozake shange qtd in "fires in the mirror").pieces like decalogue v used to intimidate me. i felt that if i accepted them, than i would be compromising something. what i thought before really isn't worth getting into. i understand what naturalism is trying to say. i experienced a tangible katharsis, and one that fell into existence piecemeal, and one that's still alive, that i still have to reckon with. it's still working inside me. the film wasn't sympathetic, per se. it doesn't need to say that the death penalty is a wicked thing. there are certainly wicked people; whether or not they should die is for another film. what decalogue shows is that good, beautiful people exists who kill other people when their society and primal urges jack them up. the 'science' of naturalism is what has helped me to appreciate decalogue v. it's not worth the writing space to go into why i would not let myself before, but i see now the worth in making art like this to 'make' people, or perhaps to make people do something. there's a method to lazar's compromise of his . . . light. much of that meaning makes sense only in retrospect. this should not be too strange of an idea: after all, how much of respectable science does not gain meaning in retrospect. i wince when i say it, but naturalism seems so much more productive and so much less nihilistic when i have the power to say to myself, 'this ruin, this process, this natural process, makes me want to buck the system.' i do not think naturalism is painting a doomsday portrait of humanity, telling us to give up our powdered wigs and head to the woods. instead, i think that it is cataloging proofs and experiments, that we are, of course, free to ignore. we can ignore it all we want, if we want to give the naturalists more corpses to bury. for surely, despite their aesthetic specifically designed without sympathy towards their characters' likely and catastrophic fate, they are impassioned by readerly inaction and writerly snobisme. i do see the delightful risk in the hope that the audience will understand what's to be done with what they see. as has been mentioned, there's danger in the hopeless seeing their fate immortalized in stone. there's danger in the hopeful disparaging the natural because it doesn't correspond to their world view.and i don't think that the 'hopeful' need be either wealthy or fortunate. i have not seen it, but it seems that the film american beauty proves the inadequacy of circumstance as a provider of vision or comfort. there are ascetics as well as gluttons as well as beggars who wonder where within themselves their humanity is, who grieve because they can't find anything that separates them from their landscape. landscapes can be powerfully and beautifully portrayed, but in reality, landscapes do not enact. they change, sure, and dramatically, but only by a large set of natural law which no one truly have power over. but it cannot be changed itself.

the dekalog 5 may be considered a violent accusation against the death sentence, according to the fifth commandment "thou shalt not kill": not by chance it puts the concept of a state fully complied with the provisions of an unjust law on the same plane as the figure of a murderer. "but the law might not imitate the nature, it might correct it," states piotr, the counsel for the defense, a real catalyst character, "the punishment is a form of vengeance aiming at returning evil for evil without preventing the crime. but in the name of whom the law takes its revenge? really in the name of the innocent ones?". the horrifying and detailed sequences of the last half hour of a man sentenced to death give value to the uselessness of the deterrent function applied to the death penalty with the purpose of intimidating all potential criminals. "desperate plights don't demand desperate remedies", kieslowski says in his message, teaching us how unrighteous can be the act of disobedience to a commandment of god that judges punishment the same way as crime is judged. there are three different moral attitudes here: the innate sense of rebellion of the murderer aiming at rousing the hostile torpor of the surrounding environment; the strong sense of chronic indifference of the victim inclined to laugh at other people's requirements; the deserving behavior of the counsel for the defense always ready to fight against adversity, in favor of human life. the struggle for life is ruthlessly vivisected all of the time; the characters are plunged into scenes of affliction and distress, in an urban landscape accented with greenish tones and seen in its own reflections through the windshield of a taxi. everything in "dekalog 5" conveys a dreadful sense of estrangement and isolation: descriptions of a waste undergrowth of violence and folly, scenes of precarious conditions of work, sinister appearances of buildings immersed in an anonymous aura of desolation, aimless wanderings through disenchanting environments. jazek, the main character, is compelled to struggle with an opponent stronger than himself: a town completely wrapped in profound indifference, apparently hostile, deaf to all his mute calls for help, while a faded photo of a little girl in a first communion dress goes on gnawing his soul. he's irremediably directing his steps towards a disconnected route to damnation seen through the deformations of the 18 mm. wide angle camera lens aiming at distorting every details, altering the reality, making it fade out in remote and alien echoes. kieslowski doesn't bring extenuating circumstances seasoned with honey-tongued tones of melodrama in favor of the defendant, differently from some hollywood stereotypes like "i want to live" (by robert wise). he doesn't slip on the banana peel of useless pathetic scenes to extenuate jazek's guilt and to mitigate the brutality of the crime, not interested at all in proximate psychological motivations to justify any display of extreme or violent behaviors and refusing to include any useless judicial proceedings. in other words, in kieslowsky's opinion "a crime is always a crime": according to the principle of "par condicio" he puts the prosecutor on the same plane as the condemned man, using many signs or symbols to represent a society seen in the most sinister light. and we can't remain indifferent: even if we don't agree with him, jazek's screams of anguish touch our hearts with pity in the same manner that terri schiavo's entreating eyes do.

dekalog five was an interesting viewing experience for me, because of the question kieslowski seems to subtly ask the audience. three men are the focus of this chapter, and kieslowski present the two involved in murder with traits both good and bad (in one's case, almost overwhelmingly bad). with such vile characters, i found myself almost glad that they would receive some sort of punishment. however, when the time comes for the murder (and it's subsequent effect on the murderer), kieslowski takes an interesting angle and seems to ask those of us who shared my view, "are you not as guilty as this man?" this sort of indirect address of the audience makes the finale of dekalog five that much more profound as kieslowski (as usual) doesn't stay within the literal confines of his theme. just as the other parts of the dekalog don't take their commandment's theme in it's literal sense, neither does dekalog five. it asks us what is murder, who is more guilty of murder, and what should be the appropriate punishment, if any? it's a fantastic film and, typical of kieslowski, absolutely stunning.

goldrush: a real life alaskan adventure is a great tv film for all ages. the movie focuses around "fizzy" (alyssa milano) who wants to go on travel for gold in alaska. the only person who hires her is pierce thomas madison (bruce campbell). what comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget. this tv film was just great. the acting is #1 (especially by bruce campbell and alyssa milano) and i also learned some information about the goldrush. i recommend this tv film to all without hesitation. it is also based on a true story.10/10

here is a movie of adventure, determination, heroism, & bravery. plus, it's set back in the late 1800s which makes it even more interesting. it's a wonderful, adventurous storyline, and alyssa milano is wonderful at playing the wholesome, confident, no-nonsense fizzy...a great role-model. this is one of my favorite movies. it is a movie to be watched again and again and will inspire you and enrich your life without a doubt. not only is the storyline excellent, but the movie also has fabulous scenery and music and is wonderfully directed. this movie is as good as gold!

while boris(aleksey batalov)is off to fight in war against the germans for his mother russia, his beloved veronika(tatyana samojlova)marries his conniving cousin mark(aleksandr shvorin)in a moment of weakness shortly after her parents were killed in an air raid over moscow. through various trials and betrayals, veronika will await word or letter from boris no matter how long it takes, holding hope that he will return to her.powerful piece of film-making boasts simply incredible photographic work by cinematographer sergei urusevsky. some of the many magnificently framed, moving shots include the scene where the camera follows veronika through a crowd of loved ones saying goodbye to each other as she rushes through the mob of bodies to say goodbye to boris..and doesn't quite reach him even as we watch boris looking impatiently into the swarm without luck. the sequence after the air raid where veronika walks up the standing stairs circulating up the destroyed building she once called home and the scene where mark makes his lustful move on veronika as another air raid continues just outside the building as wind rustles the curtains and flashes of light emanate inside are just two of many examples where sergei urusevsky shows his genius at framing images that will last forever on film. but, without the power and tragedy of the story regarding how war can forever shape the destiny of a couple who dearly, deeply love each other, this film couldn't hold up with the beauty of the visual alone. together, however, we're left with an amazing film..simply a haunting masterpiece from the soviet union after stalin breathed his last breath. i feel honored just have beheld such a great film.

in my review just submitted i referred to the young actress lead as katerina when it should have been veronika. i was so involved with character and the action i guess that i wasn't that concerned with names. anyway, she and the film are brilliant. as i said, the cinematography and the director's use of montage are worthy of eisenstein and his cameraman, tisse'. the production design is top notch. the placement of actors in the foreground, middle ground and background within any given mise en scene is worthy of study. stunning, memorable camera movement, and an ending that has an emotional punch that leaves hollywood films far behind. gee! heroic self sacrifice instead of walking into the rainbow. thanks again, john hart

river's edge is an extremely disturbing film written by acclaimed american screen writer neal jimenez.it is based on an actual event which happened at a time when most of american youngsters were trying to make sense of their lives.this is one of the most outstanding films made by american director tim hunter.much of film's attention is focused on a reckless murder committed by a feckless teenager.this unfortunate event sets in motion a whole range of questions about real motivations of youngsters in american society.those who saw this film during its initial release must have had vivid memories of great actor dennis hopper in a confused role as a sympathetic social outcast. matrix star keanu reeves also looks good as one of the teenagers before he reached star status.at a time when teen flicks are made without any kind of serious preparation,it is hoped that "river's edge" cannot simply be ignored as just another silly teen flick.it had massive impact on people who lived during turbulent times of the past when being an inhabitant of a sleepy town was akin to not having being born.for today's generation with their heady overdoses of internet props such as facebook,twitter and orkut,river's edge might appear to be outdated but its importance cannot be denied by any serious film admirer.

although i was hoping that i'd like it a little more, this was still certainly an impressive film. there were great performances by all the leads, and the story, while not what i'd call chilling, was still effective and it kept me interested. for me, the best part of this film was the look of the picture, for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well. i also thought that the low budget suited this movie, for i don't think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim. all things considered, it fell a little short of my expectations, but i'm still very glad that i finally sat down to watch this movie.

i finally saw this on video, after years of hearing about it. it is by no means a perfect movie, but it is oddly hypnotic - one of those rare, special films that creates its own world. ***spoilers*** first, the bad stuff. the scenes in burkewaite's class are excruciating. even if the subject is social studies, this guy is way over the top. his speeches are so overwrought they are laughable. and no teachers i ever had would grill their students like that, and tell the ones who protest to "shut up!". these scenes are brief, but they break the mood and pull the viewer out of the story. next, how the heck does layne just walk out of the police station near the end? also, what happened to samson's car after the first scene of him riding into town? he spends the rest of the film being chaffeured around by layne or feck. ***end spoilers*** ahhh, feck...this guy is great. dennis hopper effortlessly steals the movie. "check's in the mail", "i love company", "you're my friend" - every line is a classic. he gives feck an internal logic that makes the story work. incredibly, he actually makes the audience feel empathy for this guy, especially when samson talks about his (samson's) future.  by contrast, crispin glover is hard to take sometimes. yet the scenes of him driving around in the beetle are perfect - kids with cars in high school always have something to do, and buds to do it with. matt's low-key attitude makes a good foil for layne - their friendship is believable. glover's mannerisms are a little much, but he is consistent throughout. he drives the plot and exudes a sense of urgency that no one else does - just try to imagine this flick if layne were as much of a zombie as matt or samson - snoozefest! ***spoilers*** what makes "river's edge" unsettling is the fact that samson is not really evil, in the usual sense. he is kind of a boring guy who got sick of being taken for granted - in other words, he is like thousands of other boring guys. after he kills jamie, he starts to unravel, which creates some suspense as we wait to see when he will snap again. ***end spoilers***part of this movie's appeal is the way the action stays centered around the teens and their point of view. the parents are comic relief - clarissa's mom, tony's dad - or overwhelmed - matt's mom. this underlines how the kids hang together for the attention no one else gives them. it keeps the story focused on the relationships within the clique, and emphasizes that the only adult they can relate to is feck. "river's edge" is a textbook on alienation. it conveys how awkward, mysterious, and disconcerting adolescence is like no other film.

this film is so 1980's and that is what i like so much about it. it does an excellent job of conveying the feel of that odd decade. the reality that russian nukes could wipe you out at any time. reagan in the white house telling everybody that things were great, while more and more social programs were slashed. young people dropped out, but not as far as their parents of the 1960's did. young people still went to school, they just smoked so much dope that their sensetivities were all but dead. nothing effected them, not even the death of one of their classmates at the hands of one of their friends. how weird is it to realize that the murder was wrong, but you are not sure why. watching the characters deal with the crime is fascinating and telling of a very sick society. glover is great, keanu is great, hopper is incredible. one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen.

i didn't expect much from this movie, it was just one of those movies i thought i'd just watch because it was on television. i certainly underestimated this movie. it's about a guy who kills his girlfriend and brags to his friends. i was very happy with the acting, they had the characters played well. it was a particularly great scene when feck(dennis hopper) and john(daniel roebuck) are talking to each other about why john killed jamie. it's upsetting to hear how he explains that he wanted to feel control and thats why. but feck had loved the girl he had killed. feck felt remorse while john felt nothing, hell he was proud of what he'd done. it really makes you think about people. keanu reeves did a great job as matt, and ione skye was good. it's weird to see her as a valedictorian in 'say anything' and her as clarissa. every actor did great at .....acting. it was real nice for a change. it was a great movie and i would definitely say i recommend it.

you got to see it to believe it. shot in hollywood on the strip in the middle of the sleazy, anything goes 70s, this cheaply made flick must of really packed the inner city theatres back in the day. then again, i bet it had a one week run. actually, its pretty hilarious. the acting is dreadful, the direction non existent, but the hair, clothes, rotten pre disco music and the general out and out sleaziness of the story are mind boggling. sleazy, its very sleazy. highly recomended (if you can find it)

(possible ?? spoilers included, but nothing critical given away.)i just watched this classic low budget movie on video, and was knocked out by the level of energy present on screen. all the actors do themselves proud, especially john daniels, must see another of his films. not only does this movie boast great performances, but manages stylish sequences, like when the baron throws someone out of a window and we see shards of glass falling into a swimming pool which erupts from the impact of the fallen man, i love the way slow-motion photography was used in 70's cinema, dreamy and hypnotic. cool and witty black dudes spout great one liners while slimy seedy lumps of white trash come to unpleasant ends. i love it, my rating 10 / 10. if this ever comes out on dvd, count me in for a purchase.

i started to watch this show by accident, but i love it. the fact that main character is in a wheelchair is something that lacking in television, especially for kids shows. my five-year-old nephew (as most children do) would just stare at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of handicap but after he watched pelswick it just seemed to be a normal occurrence to him. every time he saw a wheelchair he would simply say "like pelswick" and go on with what ever he was originally doing. and yes the animation is a little crude, but if you can stand to watch through the first season of the simpsons then this isn't that bad. the "genie" is actually an angel who is there to help pelswick learn lessons in life. he can not walk some else said he could walk some of the time, i've seen every episode and he never to my recollection walked, he is a paraplegic he has no feeling below his armpits (he mentions it in an episode). as for the humor if you can get a copy of the "ntalented" episode, which lampoons boy-bands, you will instantly love this show.

eve is an eye opener, because of the great sceneries and the tech-no music in the backgrounds, we hear. this movie shows a good aspect on the human body being god's creation and to considerate about it, viewers can earn better respect on the legendary story of adam and eve (either if it's true or just a fairy tale, depending on what we believe) from watching this movie. actress/model inger ebeltoft's impersonation of eve is so good, there's no good word to describe her performance, and i can't imagine having another actress being eve. this movie to me, comes in really handy for the type of therapy of stress relief. we'd never fell so relax then before from watching this movie. this movie is a masterpiece, god supposedly wanted this movie to be made in the first place!mr. razbin!

the story of a little girl who was driven once by fear and now by pain, she becomes woman and a vengeful crime fighter. her power is to manifest strong anime characters onto herself. this movie fuses animation with live action as she wields her animated sword through all that stands before her. she struggles to deal with life, her demons, and her fears.young emily watched her parents fight and argue. she watched her dad leave her motherless. emily soon discovered she had the power to do something about it. emily grew through life traveling as a loner and at night she had the power to make a difference in the world.this movie is a great blend of animation and real action. there are many themes and metaphors that run deep through the movie. this movie is broke up as a 12 part series.

drawn by pain is easily one of the best pieces of cinema i have ever seen. here are my reviews of the episodes released so far: episode one was even better than i expected and from everything i had heard about it, i expected quite a lot. i am very impressed with the actors already. the father was creepy and played perfectly. the little girl is so expressive, she uses her eyes to convey such emotion. the animation was superb. the cinematography was amazing, each camera angle capturing the feeling of the scene perfectly. the editing was done so well, each scene blending seamlessly into the next. the music captured the emotions quite well and drew you into the story. i just can't say enough about how wonderful this episode was. it definitely whets my appetite for more! episode 2 was even better than the first one! everything i said about the first episode carries through, only you get to see even more of the character development. i can not wait to finally see episode 3, or the rest of the series for that matter. what is developing is an intriguing, character driven storyline with all the trappings of a big hollywood production, but without the pretension. so much is said, with so few words. this series is something like you've never seen and perched to become a real success.this episode was freaking awesome! no other words describe it! wow! everything that i've said about the previous episodes holds true for this one, and yet it was even better! i don't know how you manage to take something amazing and make it even better! the further character development proves that this is a completely character driven piece. the cinematography excels as it always has and draws you into emily's pain, fear, hate and emotional roller-coaster. i can't wait to see episode 4... or the rest of the series for that matter. you have truly outdone yourself!as much as i have loved the other episodes, episode 4 is the best yet. i love the character progression. i feel like we are really coming to know emily, her pain, and her internal struggle. the other themes i've stated in past reviews are continued. great cinematography, the writing is superb, the actors are right on with their portrayals and have made the characters their own, and the animation is simply amazing! another great job from the dbp crew!

this young filmmaker has a talent for capturing his audience quickly with unusual camera work and sparse but intense scripts. the concept here of combining animation with live footage is remarkably well-executed and the soundtrack is very good.the decision to release the movie in twelve parts online puts the onus on the director to make each episode fascinating enough for the viewer to invest in buying each upcoming episode. i only wish all motion pictures had this kind of commitment to keeping their audiences entertained throughout their stories.highly recommended.

the long kiss goodnight has just about everything action fans want: a witty screenplay by the guy who wrote lethal weapon, samuel l. jackson, and great action set pieces by renny harlin.seriously underrated. one of the best action movies ever.

this is movie is actually one of my all time favorites. i'm not a renny harlin fan because most of his movies suck, but tlkg hits its mark time after time. tlkg is about a woman named samantha cain (davis) who suffers from amnesia. she is married with a kid and as she qoutes "i'm a goddamn member of the pta." and then her world comes crumbling down as the pieces fall into place about her earlier identity. samuel jackson plays a con artist cop who does pi gigs, he is dragged along by her to solve her identity and to get paid some cash for his work. along the way we find out samantha is really charlie baltimore, a secret spy that was left for dead years earlier. the plot is great, making this story seem real and jackson does a great job as second fiddle to davis (whom always does a great acting job). the explosions are endless, the action is intertwined with memorable scene after memorable scene. pretty impressive visually though the kid got on my nerves at the end (watch out of the cars!) i'm tired of little kids screwing up a film to be saved but still, this movie is worth it as the kid adds to the film. again, this movie is really good, i never understood why it didn't make more at the box office but if it was a man starring in the movie i'm sure it would have grossed a hundred million. what is good is that over the years more people are discovering this movie and giving it good marks as the average of this film on this site has risen over the years. i hope it goes up further as this is one great action film. and i love action films

let me start by saying overall i enjoyed the long kiss goodnight. i would give it a 7/10. the good: 1. acting: samuel l jackson is entertaining in almost any role. in this movie he doesn't play his usual character, the type that is in control, instead geena davis is in control and sam is along for the ride. his timing on his lines are great and he is the high point of the movie. geena davis also gives a great preformance as samantha caine/charlie baltimore. she is a believable action hero and i don't think too many other actresses could pull off the preformance geena does. 2. the action: this is a very action packed movie. things are pretty much always crashing or blowing up or someone is chasing someone else. the special effects are pretty good especially for being almost 8 years old. i can see some green screen stuff but it doesn't detract too much from the acting.the bad: 1. why did it take half of the movie to set up the plot? this film needed to be edited in the script stage so that it didn't run as long as it did. maybe a drama or something can run this long but people really need to be into the movie the entire time to sustain it. i think that if you can stick out the first half you will be pleseantly suprized the second half. 2. geena davis is cold weather and a tank top but she never seems cold. 3. some things are unrealistic. sam jackson flies through a giant sign after he is blasted out of a room and then he lands in a tree and just gets up. when you see this part you will think it's a gag. overall fun movie 7/10

i thought this was a great action flick. a very good role for geena davis. she is a very versatile actress. one of my favs next to angelina jolie. i actually watched the long kiss goodnight right after seeing the new tomb raider movie. it got me thinking, charlie or lara? which one would win in a fight??? either way, both women are very strong, intelligent characters that are fun to watch. especially when they're kicking butt. i just hope to see geena in another film soon. seems like she's been out of the spotlight a bit too long. it would be especially nice to see her in another film with samuel l. jackson. now they make a great duo. watch this film if you haven't. you won't be disappointed.

a wonderful christmas story on the moving theme of "susie homemaker finds her inner amazon." no, i'm serious! geena davis's amnesia starts to improve when she is knocked on the head. from this familiar beginning, we move in an unexpected direction. good pace, good action, fun story, lots of explosions and mayhem.

i had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable tv and i can't understand why. geena outdoes arnold as an action hero in this film! geena is an ex-cia assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. she continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter. clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. it seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does. she hires samuel l. jackson, who is a former police officer. together they form a pair that is as entertaining as mel gibson & danny glover. when geena finally regains her memory she undergoes a transformation into the killing machine she once was with the song "she's not there" playing in the background. what follows is geena and samuel have to go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive. all through the rest of the film geena has to decide who she really is. the killing unfeeling machine? the mother/schoolteacher with the quiet family life? or a combination of both? especially, since the bad guys grab geena's daughter. great action scenes that rank up with any of the die hard movies!

there is a serious scene in this movie. a scene that lets you know that his film won't be pulling many cheap punches. it takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by assassins with automatic weapons. they make a break for it and just manage to get out in a hail of gunfire. the main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people that were caught in the crossfire. some would call that too sad and/or grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick. i call it honesty. most action movies tend to lean toward the "safe side" of showing violence and plot elements. this mostly means that in spite massive shootouts innocent people tend not to die or at least we don't see them die. the violence is all purely the good guys versus the bad guys with mainly the bad guys dying. a bit of common sense clearly shows this to be absurd.renny harlin showed a hint of this in his first (and sadly only) hit, die hard 2. the villains intentionally crash a plane full of people to get their point across. the scene was also filmed with a backup scene of a cargo plane with only a few people on-board going down, but the grimmer and probably more realistic scenario ended up being used. however, to fit the spirit of the first film, die hard 2 was mostly a "fun action movie." here, that grimmer and more convincing edge is pervasive. the violence is bloody. the one liners are hilarious, but with a certain style that more echoes natural human sarcasm than clichéd film wisecracks at key moments of action. the plot is also packed with more malicious intent than most action films. the villain is not just some rogue out for revenge or a mad grab at power. it is less ridiculous, but also more frightening than that. from recent films, the "bourne" trilogy almost gets there with its less cheesy than usual action film style, but this film is from 1996 and 7 years before "the bourne identity" with matt damon made it to the big screen.another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a heroine. and this is well before the movie version of "tomb raider" became a hit. what's more is that this heroine genuinely looks like she could take down john mcclane and then take his still lit cigarette. this movie marks geena davis's second action-heroine role and she still didn't manage to score a hit. while angelina jolie stars in "tomb raider" years later and scores a hit. the reasons are beyond me. completely.lastly, this movie isn't all dark edged. there are many outrageous and spectacular set pieces that one can only see in an action film. the climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of movie pyrotechnics, with more than one law of physics taking a convenient break. thus, there is formula here, but it is the anti-formula for the everyday hollywood action movie formula. --- 9/10bscdb classification: 13+ --- violence, profanity

i have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically. anyone who calls this movie trash or horrible just doesn't understand action films or recognize a good one. perhaps to some the incidents and outcomes may seem far fetched, but in my opinion screenwriter shane black ( lethal weapon/ kiss kiss bang bang) crafted one of the most well thought out action adventures you will ever come across. over the top or not this film flows like clockwork and the action just keeps coming. the final action sequence is one of the best i have ever seen in any film. the cast in this film crackles. genna davis gave a tremendous performance and its a damn shame there was never a "lkg" sequel. samuel l. jackson is hilarious as her sidekick mitch a down on his luck private eye trying to help her discover her lost past and make a few bucks. if baffles me how anyone could not like this film. it packs so many thrills and its so funny. the wisecracks in this film still make me laugh just as hard 10 years later. in my mind the first matrix film and the long kiss goodnight were easily 2 of the best and most original action flicks of the 90's. incidentally shane black made a fortune when he sold this script. at the time it was the highest selling screenplay and its worth every penny. it's so sad that audiences never gave this movie a chance, cause they would have witnessed renny harlins best film and genna davis like you have never seen her before. long live "the long kiss goodnight"!!

i am a happily married 49 year old female, who just happens to love this movie to death.geena davis' character is strong, smart and kick ass...............i thought she did an excellent (thats an understatement) job in this movie.i'm not real big on action movies, but i thought it was sooooooooooo sexy and entertaining.she is my alter-ego.............when she starts putting that assault rifle together in the old hotel room.....................i got chills...............she did it like she knew what she was doing............thats one of my many favorite parts in that movie........i think she deserved an oscar for her acting and physical roles........i'm going to have 'charly' tattoed on my back..............i'm one of those girls who will never be a victim......................i'm like her...............(shhhhhhhhhhhhhh secretly........and isn't that oh so sexy?)

i enjoyed this film immensely. i'm really into films where females kick lots of butt, so this film already had my hopes up for some decent entertainment. my hopes were met and exceeded less than 20 minutes into the film. the action, humor and wit this film contained easily made it one of my favorite films of all time. it had sam jackson and his undeniable screen presence, geena davis as i've never seen her before, demanding your respect and flat out taking it even if you don't want to give it.geena plays samantha caine, an amnesiac desperate to remember something about her past, but quickly realizing, the more she finds out the more she wants to forget and eventually becomes consumed until finally samantha is so more and charly is all that's left. but now, can charly and sam, two completely different women, possibly exist in the same body? we have characters that pop in and out of the film that nurture each side of sam/charly, like sam jackson, and craig bierko. craig is also irresistible as timothy, the sexy bad guy with no conscience.this film was perfectly casted, and perfectly acted, over the top and wonderfully entertaining. you watch the impossible happen and applaud when it does. so worth your time. watch it, you won't be sorry.

this film is a great rampage of action and comedy, it gets right in to it right from the start, there's no boring build up. the chemistry of the leading roles adds to the excitement and anticipation of the ending, even though my suspicions were not satisfied. the special effects worked brilliantly and were believable! would have liked a different ending but it still had me reeling in emotions. the story line unfolds well however it is a film you have to watch from start to end carefully to pick up on all the details, to fully understand and get maximum enjoyment.

i feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this film. it is apparent that their standards are so high that they will never be able to enjoy a film just for enjoyment sake. or, perhaps, their enjoyment is derived from the act of picking films apart; looking for any reason at all to dislike them?the long kiss goodnight is an action film, in every sense of the word. sure, there are holes in the plot big enough to drive a semi through, but none of them are enough to stop the flow of the film itself. i have never been a big geena davis fan, but i was impressed with how she was able to create two very different characters, samantha cain and charlie baltimore. in my opinion, it wasn't even necessary to have changed her physical appearance to differentiate between the two...her acting was more than enough to do the trick.more than anything else, though, this film was craig bierko's. in another's hands, the character of timothy could've been just another interchangeable villain. his decision to play him with a more casual approach was just the right counterpoint to all of the action scenes. it isn't often that you find an actor who can express himself so well with just his facial expressions...point in case: the scene in the freezer with charlie and her daughter. where most films would've cluttered the moment of "revelation" with unnecessary dialogue, bierko's eyes told the whole story.the basic plot? thin, to be truthful. a seemingly average housewife who suffers from amnesia slowly discovers that she had been an assassin. as her memory returns, so do the people who want the assassin dead. is she really samantha, the cookie baking housewife, or charlie, the cold blooded assassin? or maybe a little bit of both? for me, the long kiss goodnight was an enjoyable journey to find out.

"the long kiss goodnight" is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller, and a career breakthrough for geena davis. the plot is very familiar to that of the bourne identity but so what. the fight scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plotline is strong enough to keep you engaged for the 2 hours.it's directed with a slick sense of style and avoids most action cliches. geena davis is great as an action chick and gets past her usual "good wife" role. samuel l. jackson is good as usual as the supporting player. the film's baddie is overly cheesy though and you can tell what's going to happen to him. it breaks away from the usual run-of-the-mill actioners such as commando and on deadly ground and is definetly one of the best actioners in years. good fun and good popcorn entertainment. 7.4/10.

i hadn't planned on leaving a review, but seeing some of the other dreadful reviews for this movie, i had to say something.i'm not going to give away the ending or anything, but i do give away some important plot points in this review, so you should be aware of that. the short (non-spoiler) version of my review - samuel l. jackson and geena davis both kick butt in this movie, and it's a lot of fun. watch it.this movie is one of my favorites of all time. geena davis is perfect as the action heroine, torn between her existing life as a housewife and mother, and the memories that are resurfacing of her former life as a cia assassin. her performance is superb as she plays both facets of this relatively complex character perfectly.samuel l. jackson's performance is, as always, also excellent, as the private investigator that geena davis' character hired to look into her forgotten past. he does a great job of playing the unwitting sidekick to geena davis' tough character. some of the lines he utters in this movie are the best he's ever used in any movie he's been in.seriously, if you haven't seen it, do. it's a fantastic story with lots of unexpected twists and turns, and it's extremely well directed and acted.

this is a film that in no way reflects the real world. nothing in this film makes any real world sense or has any real world logic. it operates entirely in its own little world and your ability to accept it or not will determine your love or hate for this film.i love the film.somewhere at the very beginning i bought into the completely unreal premise of the hit woman regaining her memory as the past comes back to haunt her. there was a moment early on where i remember accepting that this was going to be one of those movies where the heroine was going to know nothing until it was needed, despite all logic that it wouldn't happen that way. "oh its one of those films" i said to myself and was hooked as the film took off on a wild two hour chase.this is an action film with brain and brawn as things follow there own internal logic and you actually have to pay attention to follow some of the twists and turns. i like this a great deal and am pleasantly surprised when i bump into people who feel the same way too. people either love it or hate it, if they've ever heard of it at all.if you like action films this is a film to definitely try. you may not like it, but it certainly worth the effort to find outand as always, leave reality at the door.

a small-town schoolteacher (geena davis) slowly begins to realize that she has suffered amnesia and really use to be a secret government assassin! soon, there are men after her and a small-time private detective (samuel l. jackson).this was action-packed, with some great special effects and really funny one-liners (especially from jackson). although the action may get a little silly at times, who cares? after all, aren't movies meant to be a good time?craig bierko is fun as a ruthless villain. the movie itself was an all-around good time. just don't expect to have to think too much about it because then, if you take it too seriously, then the movie actually won't be fun but stupid instead.this movie doesn't deserve to be called stupid or any other bad name.

amazing, amazing, amazing. what more can be said? jacobi is the best hamlet ever to grace the stage and captures every inch of the character. every nuance and element of hamlet is depicted and depicted well. some people have complained about his age, but you honestly cannot tell when watching the film. if anything, he looks drastically younger than 40. i only wish a more worthy ophelia could have been found. her acting is passable but she just doesn't look the part. the only real exceptional performances come from jacobi and stewart, who is a great claudius. the rest of the cast is good, but jacobi is what truly elevates this teleplay.

i have watched every version of this play that i can think of, including several on the stage, and sir derek jacobi is absolutely the best hamlet i have ever seen! he has the most wonderful voice for stage acting, and his expressive face will take you on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this play. the way in which he delivers his lines takes you on a journey through madness. he (as hamlet)can in an instant be loving, soft and gentle and in another instant be raging against the hell that is his life. you believe that he is in pain, you believe that he is angry, you believe that he is not a little mad. you believe he is hamlet.of course, some of the thanks obviously goes to shakespeare, :) but without an excellent actor to get the words from the page to the stage, it doesn't really matter how well written a play is.if you like shakespeare, you absolutely must see this version. if you don't like shakespeare, you absolutely must see this version. you will come away with a new appreciation for shakespeare if you do. the nuanced performance that sir derek gives will leave you breathless.

1. i've seen branaghs hamlet: branagh is too old, speaks frequently with a high pitched voice (unwillingly funny!) - not a convincing hamlet, and his directors qualities - poor ! (see also much ado about nothing from branagh - the funny parts of the dialogues have mostly been cut out not speaking of the directors mistakes in the dialogue cuts!) 2. i've seen hamlet 2000: i think the scenario is an interesting idea - but such lousy actors - all of them 3. orson welles hamlet is ok - but this bbc hamlet is the best! derec jacobi is convincing - seems a bit of a lunatic - very suitable! and patric stewart - wonderful, and claire bloom is a very attractive queen. you believe those actors what they are saying - i think this is the best compliment.

i have seen this play many times, from olivier to branagh, and this remains the one version that always stands out in my memory. many actors have captured aspects of this character, but for me, it is always derek jacobi's performance they are compared to and all others just come up a bit short.

part of the bbc filming of all of shakespeare's classic plays, this version of hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of shakespeare's most over-rated plays and hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character. i feel no sympathy for him, and i didn't after watching this.even when you have great actors like the great derek jacobi in the role of the dane, and patrick stewart as claudius and jonathan hyde as rosencrantz, it cannot disguise the lack of passion in the storyline. and when a good actor like jacobi injects passion into it, he renders the entire role incomprehensible. i just could not connect his physicalisation of the character to what he was saying, and this killed it for me. that said, he does get the "to be, or not to be" speech right, as his actions with a dagger make clear the character's suicidal intentions at that point in the play.the supporting roles, to me better written and consequently better played, are enjoyable, notably lalla ward's loopy ophelia and stewart's well-detailed interpretation of claudius.at four and a half hours, it is very long and best watched in bite-sized chunks. check it out if you're interested but be prepared for a long watch.

i was never in the past interested in this play although love shakespeare and have seen most of his plays now and enthusiastically studied some at school. something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to put me off. i never bothered to try to see hamlet until fairly recently deciding i should at least try to watch it and i borrowed the olivier version from the library. well, i struggled with it. olivier seemed far too old, not only in his looks but in his acting of the part. the play had been enormously cut to fit a more conventional movie length and i think must have missed out too much as i found it difficult to concentrate on it, soon became bored and annoyed by it. i still think olivier's henry v is the best version i've seen of that rousing play - tho' admit i haven't rewatched the beeb version yet and can't recall how it was when first shown.i heard of the branagh full length version of hamlet. although i enjoyed his much ado, i think the beeb version is far better and i wasn't entirely impressed by his henry v. but i was off branagh a bit after seeing his disappointing effort at a musical of love's labour's lost which is a play i like and was so well made by the beeb. finally acquiring the complete beeb shakespeare on dvd recently, i soon rewatched one of my most favourite shakespeare plays, richard ii, and was simply enthralled by jacobi in the part so was immediately persuaded to watch his hamlet next. what a revelation this play now is for me! yes, it is splendid, but i feel it needs an actor you can emphathise with to play hamlet and this for me is jacobi. amazing. intriguing to note that although he is older than i understand the character hamlet was, it doesn't show whilst in olivier it did. now i note he's also in the branagh version and had much to do with training branagh, so i shall have to watch that to see what jocobi does with claudius! i'm interested to discover jacobi has trained branagh as yes, you can certainly see the influence.and now i'm going to watch it all over again....

for those of you who've wondered what an art-house monster movie might be like, wonder no more. the daimajin trilogy, circa 1966, was just such a series. more period samurai epics than anything else, these three movies just also happen to feature one of the most (literally) monstrous deux et machinas ever. there's not a single facet of these gems that is unpolished, from the scenario(s) to the performances to the filmmaker's craftsmanship. even the special effects are handled with well-above-average skill, and are integrated (in most instances) almost seamlessly into the movie(s). if you're a gojira fan or a fan of samurai movies or one of us who just likes a good movie regardless of genre, i highly recommend the daimajin trilogy.

ruthless evil warlord samanosuke (superbly played to the hateful hilt by yutaro gomi) cruelly mistreats the peaceful residents of a small village. the giant stone statue majin eventually comes to life to destroy samanosuke and his wicked minions. director kimiyoshi yasudo and screenwriter tetsuro yoshida give the compelling story all the power and simplicity of an ancient age-old legendary folktale: there's a very strong sense of an ancient time and faraway remote place (it's specifically set in feudal japan), the good guys are noble and appealing while the villains are truly nasty and detestable, the occasional stirring swordfights are staged with considerable skill and gusto, the special effects are fine and impressive, the serious tone and steady pace never falter for a minute, and majin's last reel rampage of savage destruction is extremely lively, exciting, and more than a little scary. moreover, the fantastic elements of the narrative are given substantial credibility by being firmly grounded in a throughly believable dark, harsh and gritty world. this film earns bonus points for depicting majin as more of a brutal and frightening force of angry vengeance instead of a pure spirit of absolute good. veteran composer akira ifukube supplies a typically rich, robust and rousing score. fujio morita's sharp, moody cinematography likewise hits the bull's eye. the capable cast all give admirably sound and sincere performances, with especially praiseworthy work by jun fujimaki as the valiant, protective kogenta and tatsuo endo as mean henchman gunjuro. highly recommended.

with its rerelease by adv films, i've had a chance to watch "the giant majin" for the first time without the deep cuts and unkind words of a late night horror chiller theaters. guess what? it's a pretty damn good movie!the sets are authentic, the acting in subdued and believable, and the giant majin is stately, powerful, and unstopable. i loved the subtle fantasy touches (the enchanted wood, luck charm, etc), and the potrayal of the god as a little less than 'good'.this movie is begging for a remake in the new century!

this film is absolute cinematic genius. it has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance. the effects are nothing but stunning and the story will keep you hanging off your chair right the way through the movie. jack long plays the part of abbot white exceptionally well, he provides an immensely thrilling portrayal of absolute evil. if your a kung fu fan or just an action movie enthusiast this film is an excellent choice for anyone who is lucky enough to find a copy. for any big kung fu fans this movie provides a compelling insight into the world of shaolin. this film is definitely 10/10 quality and should be considered as one of the greatest eastern movies of all time.

this movie reminds me of 'eternal sunshine of the spotless mind' and 'garden state' not because of content, but because it is one of those movies that you don't hear about except through word of mouth, or you read the back of the dvd at the video store and think "why not". needless to say i was pleasantly surprised (like the aforementioned films) at how good it was and how much i enjoyed it.best seen with little knowledge of the movie and with only intrigue guiding you to actually watch it. also best seen with someone else or if you know someone else that has seen it - you will want to talk about it!! it's a beautiful film that stays with you well after you watch it. it's also an intelligent watch that requires little effort into figuring out parts for yourself.just enjoy :)

this is a beautiful, yet simple movie about one man, driven to find an answer, an answer he doesn't necessarily need but has structured his whole life around. it is heartrending, it is hilarious, it is glorious, it is tormenting, it is delicate and dynamic, i say it's genius.i have read jonathan safran foer's book everything is illuminated (mainly because i heard elijah wood was starring in the movie adaptation), and i was just enraptured by the characters. i laughed out loud more than once. and every time someone talks about what it's about, i hear the same hackneyed response, almost like it's one big long word: "it'saboutaguylookingforthewomanwhosavedhisgrandpafromthenazis." yet, this story is so philosophical; it goes deeper than that. that conversation about the ring and "in case." it really gets one thinking. suddenly, this story merges from a simple quest to an inner metamorphosis, and i find myself looking at things a bit differently now.i recommend renting this before, if ever, reading it, because the book had many obscene, downright perverted stories that were not included in the movie, mainly the history of jonathan's family that was not necessary for the film. a bit of trivia, i heard, is that wood's current girlfriend has a cameo in this flick as the drummer in the band that alex arranges to perform as jonathan steps off the train into ukraine.you spend half of the movie trying to figure out what it's about, exactly, and what jonathan is about, because his character is so withdrawn, like a turtle in a shell.it is magnificent, and in my opinion, one of elijah wood's best movies.

great 1980s comic strip comedy set in the south west of england. it is a tale of sex, drugs, cream teas and murder by the seaside. adrian edmondson, french and saunders, nigel planer (hilarious in drag) and robbie coltrane play a part. dennis (edmondson) tries to impress girlfriend by boasting he is involved in a multi-million pounds drug deal. this leads to complications with hilarious results. i am trying to find out the original picture ratio for this film but it does not appear under 'technical aspects' of the imdb site. i spotted the dvd in the shop and it appears to be in 1.33:1 (full screen) format. was the film shot in this ratio or was it originally a widescreen film with a pan and scan dvd? it would be useful to know as i hate pan and scan films. so come on imdb. could you find out for us?

this film is great! being a fan of "the comic strip presents..." i just knew i would love this film. and love it i do. i finally got round to buying a copy of this film early this year. however i was annoyed to find that it had been cut! so i'll keep looking at car boot sales for the original version.anyway, the film is about dennis carter (adrian edmondson), who tries to impress his girlfriend (dawn french) by claiming to be a drug dealer. however, dennis is overheard bragging one night in the pub and nicked! so dennis turns supergrass but the trouble is he doesn't know anything and starts to make up lies and dig himself into an even deeper hole! the irony of all this is that there is drug smuggling going on down in devon.this film is not as funny as i expected but it is still a really good film with some good laughs and a great soundtrack. it also has the best scene ever in a british film (robbie coltrane's walk across the pier set to "two tribes" by frankie goes to hollywood.so if you are a fan of "the comic strip presents...", of any of the cast members, or a fan of british comedy see it a.s.a.p!!!

a lot of 'alternative' comedy in britain in the 1980s was insular, misguided, overly-political, and unfunny, and the worst of the comic strip presents... stuff fell into this category. but this is at the other end - a remarkable film that works on different intellectual levels. is dennis a criminal mastermind or is he lying? is he telling the truth, bluffing, double-bluffing, counter-doubly-bubbly-bluffingwhatever? i've probably watched supergrass 20 or 30 times, and i still can't decide 100%. that's the wonderful thing. as well as ade edmonson, there are big roles for other early comic strip mainstays - french & saunders, pete richardson, alexei sayle, keith allen, nigel planer and robbie coltrane, though curiously enough not rik mayall. all of the comic strip cast - however much i disliked the hidden agenda of some of their members - are convincing actors, and turn in superb performances in this big-screen outing, while the richardson-richens writing team's work is so often pure genius, with nice little touches of detail throughout. ultimately this is a study of crime, criminology and human nature, in all it's wondrous complexity. and very funny with it. you will not be disappointed.

this film makes several nods to various science fiction films. the prologue reminds me of the one for the original theatrical version of thx-1138 (the trailer for buck rogers, here it was clips from some early japanese sf tv show). then the opening shot of the city in 2345 has the dragon blip flying overhead with a billboard, reminding one immediately of bladerunner. the bladerunner aspect comes evenmore pronounced when we meet the hero, who is called a replicant (he is blond haired and is called ryo, a homage to roy batty, rutger hauer's character in bladerunner?). a battle scene soon ensues which reminds one immediately of the matrix. the government forcing the population to take drugs is like thx-1138 and the chief enforcer, while looks like a cross between elvis and dan ackroyd, turns out to be a robot, very much like the terminator. the end battle reminds one of terminator 2 and the end result is hilarious. probably not one of the best sf films out there, but is enjoyable, certainly a lot more enjoyable than tripe like battlefield earth.

i taped this on sundance and had no idea that it was a miike film. i thought it was just another kung fu movie.then i saw things like the dancing sax player who sounded like an oriental gato barbieri, and i knew this had to be miike.i missed the beginning opening credits and had to wait till the very end of the closing credits to see miike's credits.so far he hasn't disappointed me yet. audition, city of lost souls, ichi the killer and the happiness of the katakuries were all good flicks, and now i've found out that this was the third in a trilogy.other than miike and todd solendz there's nobody making interesting films nowadays.

this is a film that has to be taken in context. it shouldn't be seen unless you've seen the first two films, but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set, or at least know someone who does. and you shouldn't go in expecting blade runner; the films budget doesn't stretch quite that far, and it's a far more zany ride.essentially the film is a science fiction set in future yokohama (shot in hong kong as is obvious) about a society where it's illegal to procreate. sho aikawa reprises a similar role from dead or alive 2 and riki takeuchi is a detective for the birth control cops. takashi miike isn't one to give all of his reasons to you on a platter, but one can assume that the law on procreation (enforced by giving people the pill) is there because of over population, increased life spans and so forth. interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly cantonese, whilst sho and riki (who play their parts, as always, brilliantly) speak japanese, and a few speak english. people have criticised the english as being wooden, but i found no problems with it. also, another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive; said that takashi miike was anti-homosexual. he may very well be (and not all artists have to be left-wing), but i can't see this film as an insult to homosexuals. he merely calls back philosophies of ancient greece when homo or bisexuality was more common. the film contains similar proportions of action-packed and poignant moments to doa 2, although in this film the action is more martial-arts based, and are done in a very good hong kong style. the cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes, with symmetrical shots, a good control on colours to give the air a polluted look, and it's nice to see uncut, lengthy shots that are so rare in hollywood these days. basically, there's a lot to like in this film: a good sense of humour, exciting action and some very beautiful moments. it's a great finish to the series. you could criticise it for being a bit cheesy, but isn't that part of the charm?

dead or alive: final, the movie that supposedly brings together the three films in the very loose dead or alive trilogy, and connected mostly by its stars, riki takeiuchi and sho aikawa and that each film has its share of bizarro-world fixtures and neuroses and heaps of violence, is admittedly the weakest of the lot. that none of the three films ends up being a disappointment is less a testament to the creativity of the material but to the pound-for-pound guts that director takashi miike takes with the surroundings and the material. here he presents an overtly dystopian future, however low-key, where a homosexual mayor/dictator (richard chen) has the entire village drugged except for a group of rebels. there's also replicants- robots- in this year of 2346, one of them is ryo (aikawa), a robot of complete lethal skill but also with the capacity to love and learn and so forth. then a cop, takeshi (takeiuchi) happens to be the mayor's top guard. but things start to unravel on both sides, ryo teaming up with the rebels and takeshi with his employer, though blood-soaked mishaps like a hostage trade-off gone bad, and with takeshi finding out his wife and son are robots (not done in an alien mood, mind you, just suddenly as if in a the power went out), and that he himself is one as well. and it all leads up to one last, inexplicable showdown between the two men.strange that there's yet another film where miike has peaks and valleys here, sometimes finding that middle ground of success where science fiction can have some meaning to it. but there really isn't anything to take from this story, except that the mayor/dictator is a dingbat with no back-story who gets his rocks off making sure his drug stops couples from getting pregnant and that everything remains under control. he also has along with him his love slave, i'd guess, in the hilarious non-speaking part of a saxophone player who also doubles sometimes as a human fixture when not plugging away the moody blues. meanwhile, we get the conventional sides to ryo and takeshi's stories, and they're never uninteresting, just not totally convincing enough to hold interest. of course miike isn't above having some fun, like when takeshi plops michelle (maria chen) in to the water to get her to swim after a near-assassination attempt on the mayor, or in having the original rebel leader speaking english for no good reason at all. there's even a playful homage to old sci-fi cartoons at the start of the film. but there's nothing very compelling substance-wise, with the exception of takeshi's minor turns at becoming "good" midway through the film (helping one couple get by with clearance to have a kid), and mostly miike's strengths this time are purely stylistically and in the choice of locations and sets.it's like a grungy japanese alphaville where everything still has a contemporary feel through all of the special effects. and i really liked the yellow-green tint miike used through the movie, as it impacted very well in outdoor scenes and added just enough grittiness in the indoor scenes. but as for peaks and valleys, one sees this ever more clearly- and the sci-fi movie channel level of visual effects, with maybe a few more dollars put into it- during the climax. this contains some of the funniest material in the most delirious, freudian sensibility from the director, even if it has to get started by unbearable contrivance; the way that ryo and takeshi finally meet up is sort of random and just a means for the producers to try and cheaply tie together the past two films, when it wasn't needed. on the other hand, in terms of the sheer guilty entertainment value of a flick like miike's where one sees something totally unexpected and very crudely sexual, it ranks right up there with the best scenes in happiness of the katakuris and visitor q. overall, dead or alive: final is a cheesy 90 minute effort that doesn't take itself too seriously, and is better off all the more for its wicked contrivances, militaristic decay and cultural hang-ups put on pulp-level display.

i love those kind of movies. blood, revenge, a lot of action, very dark, cheesy and more. but this one doesn't deliver the genre that you might expect. when i saw kite birds and ichi the killer before, i had fun watching those but why this one not? dead or alive: final is a decent anime and its not hardcore and don't even expect nudity in this movie.at least add some more action to entertain the audience. even the drama wasn't that good. well, i don't want to spoil the movie nor the plot.but i felt that dead or alive: final is a bit nerdy. so, without further to do. i don't recommend this movie to everyone but i recommend for the people who love decent and well directed anime.dr jacques coulardeau, university of paris dauphine & university of paris 1 pantheon sorbonne

the final installment sees sho aikawa and riki takeuchi (looking cooler than ever in his reversible overcoat!) pitched against each other for one last battle, this time in the future. the plot owes a lot to blade runner, but done in takashi miike's low budget, frenetic, comic style. i did feel that it was the weakest of the three doa films, and although the ending was still outrageous, it lacked the shock value of the previous two. compared to the likes of ichi the killer and visitor q, doa:final is nowhere near as extreme, but is faithful to the other two films in the trilogy. that said, fans of the first two (and fans of miike) will get a lot from this as it ties all three films together and gives a final explanation of the relationship between the two protagonists.

two actors play rival gangsters in three films, the final of which is a sci-fi film, that nods strangely to william s. burroughs, philip k. dick, and anime all at once. the robots are actually called "replicants", a reference to dicks blade runner(several visual allusions to the film can be found as well) and the bad guy is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with limiting procreation through use of a compulsory drug for "heterosexual love is fleeting, and homosexual love is eternal"....martial arts fights ensue, a first for the dead or alive films. the hilarious climax involves the two leads morphing into a winged robot with a gigantic phallus for a head, who personifies "destruction", which has been the path of both characters thus far, their individual minds and later literal heads functioning as something like testicles. the film ends with the mayor f*&%ing his free jazz playing boy lackey as the robot apparently tears down a wall around them, the last words of the mayor "oh f*&%", followed by a quick fade to black. part of me felt cheated, part of me confused, but mostly i was just laughing. a lot of the film is quite boring though, the best scenes bookend the film while the rest is far too slow. takashi miike has always mined the sexual motifs beneath male violence in action films, and this film with the exception of "gozu", reinforces this theme more than any other. sex and violence are two pretty basic themes, but like cronerberg(who the jazz interludes may be a homage to ala naked lunch)miike is able to show where the two connect, to hilarious an oddly cohesive effect.

the third part of miike's dead or alive trilogy is as unrelated to the first two parts as they were to each other, more or less. show aikawa and riki takeuchi are back again for the lead roles, but this time the movie thrusts us forward 300 years or so into the future... post apocalypse.riki plays a tough cop, an enforcer for the corrupt city's extreme police policies, and show plays a drifter who hooks up with a bunch of the city's oppressed rebels. the film must have been shot in hong kong, as most of the rest of the cast are cantonese speakers, with terence yin and josie ho being the most recognisable faces. there's also a hk stunt crew on hand for the films action sequences, which are very cool in a hk-via-miike style.this could be fodder for a dreadful low budget b-movie, but in miike's hands it of course becomes something more interesting. it's quite a slow, thoughtful film that meanders along and doesn't try to force anything down the viewer's throat. characters are rounded and interesting and the plot an interesting but fairly loose framework for the story to be hung on.all in all a fairly low key effort until the action scenes, which show miike's increasing prowess at directing and choreographing very nice action. watching the short making of with show & riki in wire rigs is really fun - you can tell they were having a great time the finale of the film tries to tie together the 3 dead or alive movies, which is quite unnecessary because each one is really self contained. miike's explanation of the connection is very funny though, and caps the series off quite nicely.not as deep or well developed as doa2, not as outrageous and intense as doa1... still another good miike movie though.

ok, this doesn't compare to the explosive tempo of the first part's opening sequence; nor to its visual shock value; nor, for that matter, to the melancholic suspense of the second installment. no, it's surprisingly and refreshingly different (apart, of course, from the two main actors). the tongue-in-cheek futuristic scenario drives the characters towards each other across genres and languages with an almost gravitational force. the moment of impact-conclusion is your choice of: a)shakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume; b)sublimation of violence into homo-erotics; c)humorous detonation of an impossible buildup. everything up to then is even less unequivocal.highly recommended to indiscriminate movie buffs who don't mind following foie gras with a hot dog; caution to those with more refined palates.

four unhappy women leave dreary london to spend an enchanted april in a castle on the coast of italy.elizabeth von arnim's novel comes alive in this charming little film which beautifully demonstrates the virtues of a literate script and ensemble acting. all the elements come together to produce a movie that, although nearly forgotten now, still produces a feeling of appreciation at the story's appropriate resolution.the actresses each acquit themselves splendidly. ann harding is the free-spirited wife longing for 'wisteria & tranquillity' far from foggy london. katharine alexander plays the quiet housewife wishing for the elegant responsibility of acting as hostess in the castle. jane baxter is the beautiful young noblewoman temporarily escaped from her throng of male admirers. jessie ralph steals every scene she's in as an old lady wanting only to be alone with her memories of the past.the men in the story are also well cast. as miss harding's husband, frank morgan has a rather complex role as a mousy researcher who has a disturbing personality change when he becomes a successful writer. reginald owen, as miss alexander's spouse, is marvelously pompous as a man well equipped to bore for england (his hilarious attempt to take an english bath in an italian bathtub is made even funnier with the assistance of charles judels & rafaela ottiano as the castle's harried servants). finally, ralph forbes, one of the decade's finest forgotten actors, is joyously eccentric as the ladies' lighthearted landlord.movie mavens will recognize an uncredited ethel griffies playing the proprietress of the hampstead housewives club.

my son adam (5 years old) is a big scooby doo fan. he like this film a lot. he particularly liked when the loch ness monster tried to attack shaggy and scooby. the vote score is his choice and reflects his love of the characters.having seen the "vampire rock" film first, this, not surprisingly, was very similar as they repeat a well worn basic plot in a different setting.few adults will come across this without having their own memories of the tv cartoon series and even fewer will watch it without children. you either like this or love it. i loved scooby doo for half an hour as a kid, i am happy my son loves it, i can just about put up with it now.

monster of mexico i do agree is the weakest of the modern scooby doo movies, mainly because of the weak plot and how predictable it all was. loch ness monster however, is a considerable improvement, with gorgeous animation, honestly scotland looked beautiful. the music is good, and the plot is well thought out. plus, there is some great dialogue, and the voice acting was fabulous, with casey kasem a consistent delight as shaggy, and the beautiful scottish singer sheena easten a pleasant surprise in a guest starring role. in fact, my only complaints were some strange accents in one or two members of the voice cast, with the exception of easten whose accent did sound genuine, and somehow the loch ness monster wasn't as well designed as it had potential to be. overall, a solid and enjoyable scooby doo film. 8/10 bethany cox

one of quite a few cartoon scooby doo films, "scooby doo and the loch ness monster" turns out to be entertaining, exciting, interesting, funny and also does a surprisingly good interpretation of the highlands of scotland. one annoying aspect of the film is the voices of many of the characters - american people trying to sound scottish in this film are unfortunately not succeeding all that well (although some people do better scottish accents than others).daphne has come to the highlands to see her cousin shannon and the highland games at blake castle. gravely shannon tells the gang that she believes to have seen the loch ness monster. when yet more chaos arises, the mystery inc gang have another mystery on their hands...good for scooby doo fans and for people who want to find out more about scotland! enjoy "scooby doo and the loch ness monster"! :-)

good job.that's how i would describe this animated scooby-doo adventure.this is so far the best of the animated scooby movies i have seen.i liked the story.i thought it had some depth to to it.the movie is also well paced.it doesn't get boring for a minute.it also has an interesting group of characters(besides scooby and shaggy and the gang,of course)plus,the movie was a real blast.i has a lot of fun watching it.i also liked the great scottish music.it was very catchy and infectious.naturally,we know that scooby and the gamg will solve the mystery,but it's still fun getting to that point.the animation is also pretty good for this movie.i would love it if they did a 3d animation scooby adventure,but we'll just have to wait and see.for me,scooby-doo and the loch ness monster is a 7/10

scooby doo and the monster of mexico was no doubt the weakest of the modern scooby doo animated features. loch ness monster is a considerable improvement.this time the gang head off to scotland to see the highland games and visit blake castle, daphne's ancestral home. and wouldn't you know, the castle happens to be in the 'quaint' fishing village of drumnadrochit, on the shores of loch ness.during their stay they meet a few interesting folks. first there is fiona pembrooke, a scientist who has drowned all of her money into finding the loch ness monster.sir ian locksley, the boss of the national heritage museum of scotland, he is staunch non-believer of nessie.the haggarts, the own a cozy inn on the shores of the loch. the sons are a couple of local jokers, always into mischief.del chilman, a wild, paranoid hippie dude who is convinced the monster is out there and will stop at nothing on find her.and finally, duncan macgubbin, the dock master who has seen nessie too many times to count.most of these characters are stereotypes, which gets a bit annoying as this is teaching younger audiences a load of crap and giving the wrong impression. however if you can immune yourself to it you'll be alright. being from scotland i can't help but wince at the awfully mimicked scottish accents. fact: we don't sound like that.soon enough nessie, looking rather more demonic than 'usual', shows up and causes havoc. looks like the gang have another mystery on their hands. the usual chase scenes, clues and shaggy's wacky disguises follow. there are plenty of laughs. the animation is splendid, with some atmospheric scenes and locations. and the plot a lot better than monster of mexico.the only bad thing this time around is the music. i miss louis febre's scoring and the songs here are pretty rotten too. where are the hex girls when you need 'em?the region 2 dvd is in crystal clear 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen (the region 1 ain't) with dolby 5.0 sound. some okay extras are included. definitely worth getting.

cool flick. enjoyable to watch. hope to see more from fred carpenter soon. i really like the location setting with all the new york references. it was interesting the way it all unfolds in the end. the suspense factor was effective and the acting, though kept simple, was also effective in portraying the characters. there are a bunch of neat little tricks incorporated into this film that make all the better. i think the supporting actress did a great job in her role. the casting and directing in this film seem to be sewn together seamlessly and the quality of the shooting is quite impressive. the movie is not without its soft moments either, which gives it a nice sense of balance.

i am a talent manager. i have been for 15 years now. i have discovered some wonderful talent. they have been in movies, commericals, braodway and television. in my opinion eddie monroe was cast wonderful. i love seeing the ability of real people. not just a name. the actors in this movie were very natural and believable. i was very entertained by this film. i love a movie with a few twists. i also enjoy when at the end of the movie the puzzle is solved. i still would like to know what happened to the large sum of the money.(when you see the flick you will understand what i am saying.) the mobsters all look real ???? i would like to see this film on the big screen. the footage was shot really well. the scenery of new york was the new york that i know. have a happy 2006 and may this movie make it to the awards.

i have seen a few of fred carpenter's movies on showtime, pay per view and video/dvd and i enjoyed most of these films especially with a few beers, (carpenter knows how to entertain)"eddie monroe" and "murdered innocence" are my favorites. i recently viewed a promo dvd of "eddie monroe" and everything from the cast to the storyline and directing all worked smoothly. (doug brown's music score was sensational.) i enjoyed seeing frank sivero ("goodfellas", "new york, new york" and "the wedding singer"), he is an amazing and very underrated actor.but i especially liked the performance of paul vario who played uncle benny, i looked up his acting credits on the imdb and i found out this was his first starring role. where has this guy been! give fred carpenter credit for discovering great new talent, it's only a matter of time you'll be seeing this guy costarring with pacino and deniro. as i mentioned carpenter knows how to entertain and when your working with a limited budget it is amazing what carpenter can produce.(i read the vent magazine interview and carpenter has never made a movie for more than $400,000.00 dollars.) before i watched "eddie monroe" i saw "rocky balboa" and "the good shepherd" both great films. "eddie monroe" took me on a ride to a surprised ending because of a very good script, good performances from the entire cast(craig morris is a movie star waiting to happen and the lead actress jessica tsunis was hot!) great cinematography, direction and doug brown's music score. as i stated i recently seen "rocky balboa" and "the good shepherd", if i were to write a comment about those two movies i would be saying some of the same things i have stated about "eddie monroe", the only thing those two very good films don't have in common with "eddie monroe", they didn't cost a few hundred grand. great movie and i didn't even drink a beer.

one of my favorites non-mgm musicals, it's a classic!> rita hayworth is in top form, her beauty leaps out of the screen. gene kelly shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph. phil silvers is the perfect second bananas, and eve arden injects this movie with a lot of class. the structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why, in this era where major broadway shows come from the movies, cover girl hasn't been adapted to theatre.

in brooklyn, the nightclub dancer rusty parker (rita hayworth) has a simple but happy life dancing in the mcguire's, owned by her boyfriend danny (gene kelly). rusty, danny and genius (phil silvers) have a ritual on friday nights: they order oysters in a bar, trying to find a pearl. the life of rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the vanity magazine. she is invited to work in a huge theater in broadway, whose owner proposes her. she loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style, missing the love of danny and her old friends. 'cover girl' is a delightful romantic comedy, very naive and having magnificent parts, such as the beauty and talented rita hayworth dancing, singing and acting; gene kelly, specially in two scenes, dancing with himself and with rusty and genius on the street; the songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectaculars. danny, the character of gene kelly, is almost nasty with his chauvinist behavior. rita hayworth surprised me with her talent: i found her amazing in 'gilda', but she is stunning in 'cover girl'. in accordance with the information on the cover of the vhs, 'cover girl' was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot, giving continuity to the story, instead of just being 'thrown' in the movie. my sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent gene kelly festival and they loved 'cover girl', therefore i dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations. my vote is nine.title (brazil): 'modelos' ('models')

rita hayworth lights up the screen in this fun, fancy and delightful musical starring gene kelly. rita plays nightclub dancer rusty parker who has dreams to be a successful broadway star. unfortunately, her career is getting no where in danny mcguire's night club. when one of her fellow dancers says she's going to enter a cover girl contest, she decides to follow her dreams and enters. she reminds the publisher of her grandma, who he was deeply in love with many years ago. but when she finds this success, her boyfriend is not happy about it.i had never seen rita before this, and i am so glad i did! she has such a scene presence and is a very good actress. there are some good numbers in here, not the best of any musical but they are melodic and good to listen to. one thing i didn't like was gene kelly's character. he should have supported his girlfriend! but anyway, that's perhaps the only criticism i have about this movie. cover girl is a glorious, fluffy film - perfect escapism. not everyone's ideal movie, but a wonderful movie nonetheless, due to rita hayworth's star power. great movie, truly impressed.

i really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it. rita hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous. although a musical, i thought rita hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well. as far as her dancing, i think she was excellent. even betty grable pretty much endorsed rita's dancing in this film as she commented that rita danced rings around her own dancing and let's face it, betty grable was an excellent dancer. the cinematography and vivid colors are also noted. rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but she's also in love with her mentor played by gene kelly. does she leave kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love and broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever? you'll have to watch the film to find out!

a fantastic musical starring gene kelly and rita hayworth. he owns a nightclub where she dances. she's no star yet, but she gets a big break when she's chosen as a cover girl for vanity, whose owner was actually in love with her grandmother. when he sees the resemblance, he picks her right away for a contest his maganzine is running. hayworth's newfound fame at first works wonders for kelly's club, but her star rises so quickly and so high up that his grasp on her begins to falter. this isn't the most original of plots, but the two leads really make it work. it also helps that the screenplay is great. kelly's not yet at his peak, especially his peak as an actor. his dancing, however, wow. hayworth is the star, but kelly claims the film's most memorable moment as he dances passionately with his own reflection. it's obviously a take-off of fred astaire's shadow dancing in swing time, but i think kelly one-ups it, which is hardly believable. in fact, this has got to be the most amazing dance sequence in film history, save perhaps the finale of an american in paris several years later. the rest of the songs are also excellent, and the musical numbers are even better. too bad rita didn't sing her own songs (well, she may have a couple of them, as her singing voice seemed to be different sometimes). her dancing is wonderful, as is the rest of her acting. it's hard not to love her in anything. she's really one of the few truly beautiful women from the classic era. not plastic like many of them; no, you can really see the warmth in that woman. her smile is so disarming. phil silvers has the role as kelly's best friend, and he is also very funny. the trio of kelly-hayworth-silvers is obviously the kernel which became the kelly-reynolds-o'connor trio in singin' in the rain eight years afterwards. one of the biggest musical numbers in the film seems almost completely pilfered with the "good morning" number in singin'. i do think singin' in the rain is the better film, as cover girl is a little rough around the edges. this roughness, though, just adds to the charm. there are aspects of this film that beat singin' in the rain, and even an american in paris. for instance, the central relationship is more emotionally involving. instead of the dominant older man chasing the little girl (leslie caron and debbie reynolds were just teenagers, after all), we have a very nice relationship with two people who seem more like equals. there is no chasing around - an aspect that does unfortunately turn a lot of the best musicals a little sour, you have to admit. kelly and hayworth are a couple from the start, and when that begins to fray, i really felt it. 9/10.

this has got to be one of the better post-astaire musicals made by columbia. produced by arthur schwartz and directed by vet charles vidor, this picture really put gene kelly on the map and cemented rita hayworth's reputation as cinema's premier female dance partner. she plays a bit of a dual role here since she performs contemporary 1940s numbers with gene and co-star phil silvers, but also puts her in the role of her grandmother, a nightclub performer in the late 19th centry.the music should also be singled out because this was i believe the last project that the legendary jerome kern (most famous today for "old man river" and "smoke gets in your eyes") worked on, and his lyricist was the equally legendary ira gershwin. they supplied a score that is full of charm and characterization. the music for the historical sequences is especially noteworthy because it's so perfectly styled in the early 20th century idiom that was kern's original period. it's a bit like picking up a record from one of your favorite bands from the 1970s and hearing them do a song in the original style of that time.the story is pretty inconsequential, which is fine with me because this film is as close an approximation as you will ever be likely to see of the 1930s/40s golden age of broadway musical comedy style on film. even the 1940s war propaganda aspects of the film's music give it extra charm as the talented trio sing "make way for tomorrow" and even humorously poke fun at america's enemies and use period slang such as referring to "gremlins".probably the most memorable performance in the film is kelly's dance to the "alter-ego dance", which found him arguing with and then dancing with himself as a metaphorical image of the battle of the conscience. this prefigures much of his later work and also stands an effective and memorable scene in and of itself.fans will want to seek this out for various reasons -- kelly fans will see this as a rare chance to see him outside of the confines of mgm with a different set of co-stars and music superior to his usual mgm material. hayworth fans will want to see rita in glorious color at the peak of her fame and ability. and fans of classic broadway musicals will definitely want to hear kern's final score and marvel at the quality of gershwin's lyrics and the compatibility of their styles. this is a definite gem in the crown of columbia's musical program.

rita hayworth is right there where she should be - as a "cover girl" in this 1944 technicolor film also starring gene kelly, phil silvers, eve arden, lee bowman, and otto kruger. rita plays a beautiful showgirl, rusty, working at a small club owned by the man she loves, danny (kelly). each friday they go out for oysters with genius (silvers), the club comedian. they all hate oysters, but they're looking for a pearl. when they find one, all three of them will have good luck, they believe.rusty auditions and wins the role of cover girl for a magazine - she starts off ahead of the other contestants because the magazine owner (kruger) sees a resemblance between rusty and the girl he once loved, who turns out to be rusty's grandmother. once she becomes the cover girl, the world opens up for her and her dreams of appearing on broadway come true. danny wants her to have her success, but at the same time realizes he's lost her."cover girl" has exuberant dance numbers and songs by jerome kern, with rita dubbed by martha mears. rita is at her best playing both rusty in the present and her grandmother in the past. for such a sexy, desirable, gorgeous woman, she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of domineering men. none of this ever showed on screen, nor did the fact that she didn't want to be a movie star. she is one of the true goddesses and brought everything she did to life. gene kelly is in a serious role here, but gets plenty of chances to dance and sing. phil silvers is very amiable and funny as the in-house comic and best friend.this is a very good movie with no dull spots. the only problem i had is the idea that rusty has to choose between a successful career and the man she loves. when supermodel jinx falkenberg, who plays herself in the film, speaks of getting married, she's warned by her boss not to, that she's too necessary to the modeling business. we're not told if rusty continues with her career or goes back to work at danny's - but all signs seemed to point toward the brooklyn club. why couldn't she have had both? nevertheless, you can't beat "cover girl" for top entertainment, beautiful color, lovely music, great energy, fine performances, and its most fabulous asset, the glorious rita hayworth.

this is a little-seen anti-war film that has been ignored for too long. the time is thanksgiving of 1972. the place is a typical suburban home somewhere in texas. the oldest son has just comeback from vietnam and he is having a hell of time readjusting to the life he had left behind. and the family does not know how to handle the problem. i honestly don't think i'm exaggerating when i say this is one the most heart-wrenching war films i've seen. the funny thing is that there are only a handful of combat sequences in the entire movie. most of the story takes place inside a house over a period of a couple of days. but the kind of war that takes place in this home is as intense as any real battlefield action. the film does something that is difficult to accomplish; somehow, estevez and his team have created a film that embodies the entire vietnam experience. and considering the similarities between vietnam and the current invasion of iraq, the film is surprisingly relevant. estevez does a magnificent job with material. he gets a lot of help from a hand-picked cast. martin sheen and kathy bates in particular are superb as the parents. a truly moving film. highly recommended

i had never heard of this film and only got it because i am a martin sheen fan. now i am stunned as to why it did not receive the praise and recognition that it truly deserves. the four characters all make you feel for them, the father trying to assert his authority, the mother still clinging to traditional family values and both trying to keep up appearances despite the total fragmentation of their family, the daughter wanting her own life and the son haunted by his experiences in vietnam. one felt that this was a scenario that must have been played out in thousands of 'ordinary' families after vietnam. emilio estevez as jeremy was superb - totally unhinged by his war experience which none of his family could relate to. the screen chemistry between him and his real-life father martin sheen was amazing. and there were times when emilio's anguished face was so like martin's in "apocalypse now". i feel sure that just as martin has counted apocalype as one of his best films, emilio will count this one as one of his best too. the scene with the gun was totally mind-blowing, as all the emotions were there on the family's faces. brilliant acting by estevez, sheen and kathy bates. i watched the film for the first time last night - and today the lead story in the news was about a gulf war veteran who had shot several members of his family. how many more young men are going to have their lives destroyed by war?

this movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a christian environment and learned that appearance is everything. she and her son, who just recently returned from vietnam collide in some very tense issues. the relationship has no connections intimately and is a great accurate portrayal of what it is like to live with someone who is false and only looks at the surface of issues. kathy bates does an excellent job of portraying a woman of false faith who is either oblivious to her cruelty, forgetful or just doesn't want to be confronted. jeremy's wrath is never feared and it leads to a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings about his fathers love for him. this is a very honest look at some family dynamics after a traumatic event leads one to despair.

estevez, martin sheen and kathy bates are superb in this portrayal of a vietnam vet home from the war but still haunted by it. bates plays a clueless mother who just wants the family to be a "family." sheen is terrific as the father who tries to understand what his son is going through but is too wrapped up in his principles to really empathize. the setting is thanksgiving day and the relatives are coming for dinner. estevez, who plays the returning vet, wants no part of family tradition and insists on wearing his combat fatigues to dinner, explaining "this is what i wore last thanksgiving." the bickering and family arguments are priceless, particularly the "peanut brittle crisis," but the ending is both gripping and terrifying. it has to be seen to be appreciated.overall, one of the best movies i've ever seen.

this movie is powerful. i watched this movie at 3:00 am and i was suppose to be at work at 6:00 am, needless to say i was late to work. i could not bring myself to get up off my bed to go to work. this is the most powerful movie that i have seen in a long time. and that made me cry and feel the pain of the family. i think emilo did a wonderful job of directing this film. i agree with the previous comments from other views that this is the only movie that i have seen that has brought the war home and showed what a family had to go through, what a veteran went through. it is almost heart breaking to think that back then people just thought you could come home from a life changing experience and be the same person you were before you left. kathy bates reminded me of my mother in a way. i believe she really showed how women felt and acted back then. i am surprised that this film wasn't up for more awards.

an under-appreciated, unseen gem. estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in poignant, heartbreaking fashion, the tension that arises between a son who's been to hell and back, and his parents, who can't begin to understand the emotional scarring left behind. it's not unlike born on the fourth of july, in that it deals with a soldiers' emotional and mental breakdown after serving in vietnam, but while that one focused more on the politics of post-vietnam (anti-war speeches, etc.), this one deals with a much more personal topic: family. one man's struggle to return to normalcy after a life-altering experience, and his parents' failure to see the change that has occurred.estevez delivers a smoldering performance as jeremy collier. you can sense the pain and frustration bubbling beneath surface. there to match him inch for inch is his real-life father, martin sheen. it's a trip watching these two act off of each other, as you get the sense that they're constantly trying to one-up one another. it's like the presence of each other inspired the pair to do their best, and their performances triumph because of it.recommended to anyone who appreciates solid acting, writing and directing. and to any vietnam war buff. ****/***** (8/10)

emilio estevez takes the wonderful play homefront and makes it into an engaging movie.the war at home has an exceptionally strong cast -- all seemingly digging deep into their characters. the acting here is top notch!credit must also go to director emilio estevez. the visual transitions between past and present were ultra smooth. the sound effects during the battle scenes were chilling and effectively added to the tension.remove all of the viet nam elements from the story, and still left would be interesting characters wrestling with the good and bad of the full range of family dynamics. (a viewer might see this point more clearly by keeping in mind the "discovering the old photo" scene from the beginning as the rest of the movie is watched).as a movie, i found the war at home to be more direct and to the point than born on the 4th of july. a fine effort -- almost a 10.

this is one of the best musicals of the 1940s. the glorious technicolor shows off rita hayworth's beauty and spectacular hair. she should have made more movies in color, but then columbia was hardly in a position to splash out money for technicolor spectaculars.rita is a wow as rusty parker - she more than keeps up with gene in some of the most sparkling numbers ever. she also looked beautiful in turn of the century gowns, so she was given a chance to play her own grandmother.the film opens with "the show must go on" - it looks great to me - but danny mcguire (gene kelly) is not impressed. his motto is work, work, work!!! one of the dancers, maurine (lesley brookes) is determined to better herself and is going to audition for vanity's golden wedding cover girl competition. rusty just happens to find herself at the auditions as well. in a very funny scene maurine has just had a so so audition and seeing rusty, gives her a few tips on how to impress the judges!!! "don't be shy and demure - chatter and sparkle". rusty does so with gusto!!!they decide on maurine and go to the show to see her but john coudair (otto kruger) sees rusty - she reminds him of someone from his past. cornelia (eve arden) is still having nightmares over rusty's audition. "whose complaining" features genius (phil silvers) and the dancers, dressed up as working girls - (rusty is a cabbie).john is remembering a long lost love (rusty's grandmother, maribelle hicks) the first time he saw her singing "a sure thing" - set at the races. meanwhile danny, rusty and genius are looking for pearls at their local diner. they then launch into the happiest song of the 1940s (in my opinion) - "make way for tomorrow"."put me to the test" is a spirited song and dance number featuring danny and rusty. in the meantime rusty has been chosen cover girl and danny mcguires' is the place to be seen. lee bowman appears as danny's romantic rival and puts a damper on things. lee bowman is probably the most boring leading man ever - so danny never needs to worry.rusty (dubbed by martha mears) sings "long ago and far away" and it is danced beautifully by danny and rusty. the gowns that rita wears are stunning. travis banton and gwen wakeling designed them. danny wants the best for rusty but is afraid he will lose her. gene kelly is also fantastic in the "alter ego" number where he dances with himself."poor john" is another look back to the turn of the century - it was written in 1906 and is an extremely funny song poking fun at rich relations - hayworth looks gorgeous in an amazingly quaint outfit. look for al norman in both "poor john" and "a sure thing". he was an amazing eccentric dancer, who appeared in several early musicals, including "king of jazz" and "paramount on parade". he was easy to spot.the "cover girl" dance is just wonderful. rita was so talented - beautiful and a great dancer. after a bevy of beautiful models parade through covers of america's top magazines, rusty bursts through in a beautiful gold gown dancing down a ramp to the very catchy "cover girl" song. gosh i just love this movie!!!!highly recommended.

this is a very enjoyable, fluffy, glamorous musical from the 40's. 'cover girl' made rita hayworth (formerly the dark-haired latin senorita margarita cansino) into a bona-fide, all-american star. it confirmed gene kelly's amazing talent as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. it epitomises the exuberance and colour of the musical genre.rita hayworth is great as rusty parker- it is her picture, and her presence is always at the forefront. her singing is dubbed, but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with kelly. i think that rita was highly underrated as an actress- she plays every scene superbly here. gene choreographed the dance sequences (he was basically given almost complete creative freedom here), and his 'alter ego' dance number is amazing. such artistry. the stand-out tunes are 'make way for tomorrow', 'put me to the test', and, of course, 'long ago and far away'. the plot is rather thin, yet it does have a moral. it's about the perils of quick fame and fast money, and how any happiness with only these factors will ultimately be doomed. this will cheer you up, lift you up to your feet and make you laugh.that said, 'cover girl' is not the greatest musical ever produced- it has a number of flaws that must be addressed. one can say that a little bit of phil silvers goes a long way. his character gets tedious rather quickly. however, i was impressed with his dancing ability and how he was able to keep up with gene and rita. another major problem is that too many songs are just not that great. the 'cover girl' number looks fantastic, but i'm not a fan of the lyrics or the singing. 'poor tom' is a huge downer. i think it's one of the worst numbers i've heard in a 40's-50's musical yet. it stinks. the grandmother sub-plot borders on being ridiculous. but that's only my opinion. others may like these elements.still, apart from it's faults it's a very, very good film, much better than most of the product churned out today. the dancing and singing is sublime, the production values are excellent, and it's mood is infectious.8/10.

this is definitely an outstanding 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of charles vidor. rita hayworth, (rusty parker),"charlie chan in egypt", sang and danced with gene kelly,(danny mcguire), "anchors away", danny mcguire owned a night club in brooklyn, n.y. and was in love with rusty parker who was a dancer in his club along with phil silvers,(genius),"coney island", who was the comedian in this picture and also worked and dance together with danny, rusty. otto kruger, (john coudair),"duel in the sun" played the role as a promoter of a cover girl magazine and decided rusty parker was going to be his top model. jerome kern's music is heard through out the entire picture and the song, "long ago & far away" is the theme music for this musical. this film was nominated for many awards and was a big hit at the box office during ww ii which kept peoples minds off of the war that was going on at the time. rita hayworth and gene kelly were instant hits and their career's exploded on the silver screen for many many years. great musical and a film you will not want to miss, this is truly a great classic film. enjoy

rita hayworth as rusty parker is the cover girl du jour--she's one of the dancing girls in danny mcguire's club, the most special one according to danny (gene kelly) and pretty much anyone who comes across her. take for example, vanity magazine magnate john coudair (otto kruger): enchanted by rusty's resemblance to her grandmother maribelle (also played by hayworth in flashbacks), whom he wooed devotedly when he fell in love with her, he tries to relive his youth by fixing what he thinks went wrong between himself and maribelle. he doesn't believe that danny could give rusty happiness, or everything she should be entitled to--he even gets danny believing this himself. when rusty shoots to fame as vanity's 'cover girl', danny drives her away into the ready and waiting arms of noel wheaton (lee bowman). so what happens when danny returns to town with his sidekick genius (phil silvers) in tow, only to discover that rusty is marrying wheaton?as a musical, cover girl benefits from the beautiful score and songs written by jerome kern and ira gershwin, including the oscar-nominated 'long ago and far away' (possibly one of the most gorgeous ballads ever written and beautifully, sweetly sung as a duet by hayworth and kelly), maribelle's number 'sure thing' (the more lacklustre 'poor john' isn't a kern/gershwin collaboration) and 'put me to the test'. the dancing, of course, is top-notch, since gene kelly had more than just a hand in the choreography. it shows in the simplest of dances, for example his dance with hayworth to 'put me to the test', or the joyfully exuberant 'make way for tomorrow' number (performed by the trio of danny, rusty and genius)... which foreshadows the reaction gene's character has to the police cop in the title number in singin' in the rain. kelly especially scored a technological and artistic coup with the 'alter-ego' dance. like its successors in anchors aweigh and an american in paris (jerry the mouse and the 16-minute ballet respectively), this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity kelly brought to the modern film musical: wanting to use the film medium to present dances that couldn't be showcased on a stage, and years before cgi, kelly insisted on dancing with the one person who could possibly match him in talent and style--himself. the number is hardly five minutes long, but it (and kelly's genius) still takes one's breath away, even sixty years down the line. this is the reason i watched cover girl, and if nothing else, this dance is truly worth it.you can tell that a great deal of money was lavished onto cover girl and rita hayworth--not that she doesn't deserve it. witness the scene when rusty hits broadway--the large screen showcasing all the different cover girls gives way to a staggeringly large stage rigged for rusty's entrance. hayworth is indeed one of the most effortlessly beautiful girls on show in the film, and she dances with a style and grace that is almost worthy of kelly. (very few of kelly's co-stars have that honour.) she is hilarious in some scenes, for example her drunk scene when john and wheaton come to get her from joe's.for some reason, however, her performance still lacks the spark of greatness which would help cover girl overcome its general curse of mediocrity. that curse is only lifted whenever gene kelly is on the screen (dancing or no), or when eve arden as john's long-suffering secretary 'stonewall' sidles by with another cutting comment or clever observation. since the film, in the end, belongs to hayworth, neither kelly nor arden can save it as a whole. this isn't to say that the film is bad--it isn't. it's enjoyable, with great songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to look at. but it's just not quite a classic. the dancing is classic though--so watch cover girl for that, and you won't regret it.

"the love letter" is a somewhat pleasant, very very low-key romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few words in a mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passions and longings of a sleepy sea-side town's inhabitants.it's not for all audiences. "the love letter", i feel, benefits from it's simple and quiet tone. never intentionally wacky and phony like most romantic comedies it's quaint, picturesque, and comfy. however, for these exact same reasons, many viewers will be bored and disinterested.the cast is nice. it's great to see tom selleck again, and is such an underplayed role. and it's hard to believe this is the same kate capshaw we met 15 years ago in "indiana jones and the temple of doom". she's quite naturally good here; improving in every role i've seen her in since grating on indy's nerves. and is it possible capshaw is just getting lovelier and lovelier with age ? ( what is it about that spielberg!?)it doesn't amount to much; but after another noisy summer movie season i'll probably look back with brief fondness for this light-as-a-feather romance.

the love letter is one of my all-time favorite books, so naturally i was skeptical when i heard it was to become a movie. but, i liked it. i found myself grinning through the entire movie. i admit that it isn't a great movie but definitely a pleasant hour and a half. i thought that capshaw and scott were perfect as helen and johnny. just as i pictured them. and the town and scenery were just right as well. i recommend this film, but don't expect too much, just enjoy it.

i thought the movie was pretty good. i really enjoyed myself as i viewed it. however, the last scene at johnny's birthday party was cut way too short. i, myself, was an extra in that scene and was upset with the results. but other than that, (and the weird casting), the movie was superb.

"cover girl" is the best musical rita hayworth ever made. ms. hayworth will always be remembered for "gilda", however, the next movie would be "cover girl". the story is great. it is about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes it big in show business. she does it without the help of her talented dancer/director boyfriend (gene kelly). mr. kelly is given the chance to choreograph the musical numbers. the dances are spectacular. it is fun to see phil silvers, a comic, do the musical numbers with ms. hayworth and mr. kelly. the supporting cast is perfect. lee bowman is given a chance to be an interesting third wheel, the other boyfriend.

this movie was a sicky sweet cutesy romantic comedy, just the kind of movie i usually dislike but this one was just cute enough to keep me interested. it was really funny in one moment (probably why i liked it) and then just as serious in the next. plus, it had ellen in it and i've always had a soft spot for her.basically, the owner of a book store, helen (kate capshaw) finds a love letter in one of the old couches in her store. she thinks it is for her and goes crazy trying to figure out who sent it. she has kind of shut herself off from the world, so it really throws her for a loop. eventually, almost everyone connected with her finds this letter and they are all getting mixed signals which creates some really funny moments.like i said, i am usually not one for this type of movie but i really wound up enjoying it and recommend it highly.

this film ain't half bad. it may be a little long at times, but carried along by beautiful scenery, an immensely beautiful love letter and great actors, you forget time and enjoy. the grand prize, however, goes to blythe danner and geraldine mcewan as..........well that would be telling, but they are just great!

i thought that the love letter was a pretty good movie. there were certain things that could have made it better. but kate capshaw is absolutely beautiful, and she showed it in this movie. i wish that there could have been a few more revealing scenes of her, but it was still a very good movie. it was very fun to watch!

so well done. the photography, sound, music and the performances were the best. it's also an amusing story line that brings a smile to your face with each scene--i loved it and i'm a 60 year old heterosexual guy. each character seemed to fit their part to a tee. it's the best performance that i've seen from ms. capshaw--she's been in more movies than i thought, but this was a wonderful achievement. i suppose it's a plus to have spielberg money behind you allowing for a fat budget and all the best that money can buy technically. two of the cast have successful t.v. shows of their own now--it's easy to see why. tom selleck does his usual good job.

aside from the fact that this movie was filmed mostly in rockport ma, which is a beautiful town where my mother once rented a small storefront and i spent many a pleasant summer as a child, it is fun and cute little film. i must admit that i had no desire to actually see this movie even though i have a weakspot for romantic comedies (i don't know why). the trailers i saw were not appealing, the cast did not look that interesting and i had no idea what the plot would be about. in the end i found it to be an interesting meditation on relationships and family. i thoroughly enjoyed myself and must admit that i thought that this film was one of the most overlooked gems of last year. i am disappointed that so few people seemed to have enjoyed the very "human-ness" that this movie presented the viewer with.i have read many bad reviews of this film, and must admit a certain level of shock at the cynicism that is prevalent in them. as a grad student i consider myself to be quite cynical, but this was a beautiful little film that deserves much better than it got.

this is one of the better feel-good films of 1999 with kate capshaw leading an all-star cast about a small town and a love letter. first off, the scenery is beautiful, and anyone who sees this film and doesn't want to move to this location is crazy! for the cast, capshaw is stunning as the lead actress who captivates the emotional roller-coaster role. tom everett scott is charming as the "author" of the note throughout the film, and the always delightful ellen degeneres is hilarious! blythe danner and the actress who plays the bookstore saleswoman are both terrific, too. although it was unsuccessful, the film is great as it is both short and sweet and well as very romantic. 10/10

this is definitely a girl movie. my husband found it utterly boring, but i think this is a really sweet movie. it's amazing to think that just a note can bring so many people together. this is a great get-away for anyone who loves a cute, funny romance!

i'm a large scarred heterosexual male ex-bouncer, ex-rugby player, and ex-boxer, and i love this movie.it's no "mystic river." it's a piece of fluff. but there is room in life for fluff, and when that fluff is engagingly shot, well-acted by attractive, likable people, cleverly plotted and full of good dialogue, there's even more room for it.i'm not the biggest tom selleck fan. but he's good in this. so are julianne nicholson (love her bald head and freckles), ellen degeneres, kate capshaw and even tom everett scott (that thing you do!).the scenery is nice, the mood is upbeat, there's heartache and wistfulness and farce and even a little redemption.any (male) reviewer who disses this movie is, shall we say, not perfectly confident in his masculinity. in the meantime i'll continue to catch bits and pieces of it without apology whenever it shows up on cable.

the love letter (1999): starring kate capshaw, tom everett scott, tom selleck, ellen de generes, gloria stuart, blythe danner, jessica capshaw, alice drummond, bill buell, erik jensen, margaret ann brady, walter covell, patrick donnelly, lucas hall, christian harmony, christopher nee, breanne smith, marilyn rockafellow, sasha spielberg, jack black.....director peter chan, screenplay maria maggenti.based on the novel "the love letter" by cathleen schine, director peter chan's film version, released in 1999, was not a big box-office draw, not even for a romantic movie with some comedy elements. while it was not as popular in theaters, it soon became a beloved film on cable television and on vhs/dvd. set in a seaport town in the good old usa (i forget the exact location), this is the story of a mysterious, passionately written love letter who sparks emotions and confusion among the principal characters, each who think the letter is personally addressed to them. by the end of the film, we don't know who the lover or the beloved is but the power of the letter has altered the lives of nearly everyone in the small town. the cast is made up of wonderful actors who have fared well on tv and film, among them kate capshaw in the lead role of middle-aged beauty helen, a bookstore owner, comedienne ellen degeneres as her friend/employee janet hall, young hottie tom everett scott as johnny, the young 20 something guy who falls for the older hellen and an older tom selleck as the firefighter george matthias who must compete with johnny for helen's affections. there are cameo roles by veteran old hollywood actress gloria stuart, who is best known to modern audiences as the elderly rose in "titanic" (1997) and a cameo by kate capshaw's own daughter (with husband steven spielberg) jessica capshaw. the love triangle is between a middle-aged woman, an older man and a young man, each of whom feel as passionately for helen as the writer of the mysterious letter. the conflict lies in helen's indecision. will she choose the right person ? which man has the most to offer her ? johnny is in a relationship with a girl his age who loves him with a passion all her own, and is in fact, a kind of reminder of what helen was like at her age. george is in the process of divorcing his wife and has lived a worldly and eventful life. a cultured intellectual, he takes helen on an opera date, where the tragic death of puccini's ultra-italian heroine tosca moves helen to explosive tears. there are lots of beautiful vistas of the charming coastal town, rendered beautifully by cinematographer tami reiker. the score is a paradise of romantic and lovely songs - " i've never been in love before", "i'm in the mood for love" and "only the lonely". ellen degeneres as janet hall, who is consistently late to her job at helen's bookshop, who endlessly dates men without being able to find the right guy , is simply wonderful. she has not lost her comedic flair, even though at this point in her career she was not appearing much on tv or film because only about two years before her hit mid-90's tv show "ellen" was cancelled because of her "coming out" as a lesbian and the new lesbian subject matter of the show. here you even find comedian jack black, long before he made it big, in the bit part of a fisherman. this is a moving film about human emotions and making decisions that are significant, about the human need for a passionate consuming love and the general love of escapism brought not only through books, letters, and music, but through a genuinely loving and secure relationship. this is a great film with wonderful moments and an infectious romantic spirit.

helen (kate capshaw) owns a bookstore in the sleepy, coastal town of loblolly by the sea. divorced, helen has a young daughter who is going to camp for the summer, giving mother a bit more freedom. working at helen's store are the manager, janet (ellen degeneres), a man-crazy village-gossip girl who has eyes for the handsome fireman, george (tom selleck), and two young college students, jennifer (julianne nicholson) and johnny (tom everett scott). one day, helen stumbles across a romantic, tender love letter and she suspects that johnny has written it for her. throwing caution to the wind, helen and johnny begin a small-time "thing". but, the letter subsequently lands in others' hands, including janet's, who thinks george has sent it to her, and johnny's, who imagines helen has penned it for him. and, on and on the letter goes. but, in truth, george possibly has eyes for helen and jennifer has fallen hard for johnny. the town's museum curator, too, may have a secret love. will tangled affairs like these ever straighten themselves out? this is a cute movie with a gorgeous setting and capable stars. each of the main actors gives a pleasing performance, including the addition of blythe danner and gloria stuart to those mentioned previously. then, too, the coastal scenery is most lovely, the costumes quite well-chosen, and the photography very nice indeed. there are a few surprises, including a subtle gay plot development, which may not please all viewers. but, for those who love romantic comedies, this one should be included on any list of good choices for the genre.

a good story about rusty parker (rita hayworth) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would have to leave the small dinner theater where she works with danny (gene kelly) and genius (phil silvers). rusty is in love with danny. all three are good friends and every friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl (they never eat them). the story line provides numerous opportunities for songs and dancing. the movie has two questions that rusty must answer: is fame all that it is cracked up to be? and is less really more if you are happy? answering those questions makes the movie. the movie also does a good job of showcasing the talents that all three principals had. never a dull moment!

although it's definitely an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours and it's always worth a watch, this film never quite meets the targets that it should for two reasons. firstly, after the first forty-five minutes or so it focuses heavily on helen and johnny, who are far less interesting characters than most of the others - janet, jennifer, george and miss scattergoods are all much more enticing. although at first this works, since in life we don't always know everything about everyone else, and because the point is being made that perhaps helen is slightly self-involved, it quickly wears thin and we want to see more of the other characters.secondly, the film seems to lose its way in terms of plot in the second half. the letter itself holds far less significance than it does in the first half and, again, although this works well in some ways, it seems odd to leave so much of the potential displayed in the first half behind.overall, this film is sweet and good-natured, with some genuinely hilarious moments - for example, janet explaining condiments to an avid audience. the lazy but quietly desperate atmosphere that helen feels is heavy and the sense of living in a small seaside town is accurately portrayed, but the film isn't quite as intelligent as it's trying to be. it just misses being both a light romantic comedy and being a clever portrait of life. however, it's still good and if you get the chance, it's definitely worth seeing.

i normally don't like romantic films, but i love this film very much. the story is really touching, and the ending is very appropriate. i feel i really care for many characters in this film. i feel i can feel their feelings. while most romantic films always make me feel detached and bored, this one completely makes me feel involved, starting from the scene of capshaw running along the beach with scott until the ending scene. i want to rate this film 11 out of 10, because i want to give an extra one point for the ending. the acting part is very strong. kate capshaw has a good opportunity to show her talent. though i'm not impressed with scott in `dead man on campus,' this film completely changes my viewpoint towards him. he's so irresistibly charming here. geraldine mcewan is as terrific as ever. this film might not be as good, complex, deep, or believable as other films which deal a little bit with the same kind of relationship, such as `l'ecole de la chair' or 'post coitum, animal triste,' but `the love letter' can still be proud of itself as it casts a rare different light on that kind of relationship. and that difference makes this film eminently enjoyable. by being unambitious and relying on great charms of small stars, dreamworks, this time you really make my dream come true.

this film shows up on the premium cable channels quite often and, i find that i keep watching it over and over again. the performances are wonderful, and the material has so much happening that there is always something new to take away from the film.maybe i am too often distracted when watching films at home, you know the drill, the dogs bark, the phone rings, the popcorn finishes during the credits. but this film is about people and what motivates us, what enlivens us, what causes rifts between us, and what inspires us.for me, it is films like the love letter that keep me taking a chance on new films. frankly, i am surprised that the film is not better known. i would love to see blythe danner and geraldine mcewan in many more roles. they are a delight to watch. kate capshaw is wonderful and i had no previous idea that she would be. ellen degeneres plays a role that is much more complex than simply being the comic relief.this film provides interesting visuals as a proper background to the characters and their interactions. i find it refreshing every time i take the time to watch it.

this is an unusual film because although it was made by twentieth-century fox because it's one of the few pairings of barbara stanwyck and her future husband, robert taylor. barbara stanwyck had been making films for many different studios (rko, paramount and selznick) at about the time she made this is my affair, but taylor was an mgm contract player so he only appeared in this film because he was loaned to fox--something studios occasionally did during this era.the film is interesting because many real-life people have roles in the film, though the piece is otherwise pure fiction. you'll see actors playing william mckinley, teddy roosevelt and admiral dewey. i can't recall any film with mckinley or dewey in it as a character, though i do remember roosevelt from the wind and the lion and a couple other films. three cheers for seeing a "lesser president" in a film as a major character! the film begins with mckinley taking a young lieutenant (robert taylor) aside and asking him to be a special agent for him--and telling no one--not even the secret service. that's because the president fears that someone within the agency is tipping off a gang that has been making a long string of robberies--all based on inside information. so it's up to taylor (who is not known for his manly roles--especially at this stage of his career) to pose as a thug and find the gang responsible and the inside man.however, there are two serious complications. first, while he is able to find the gang members, one of the gang member's step-sister is stanwyck. taylor finds that he's fallen in love with her but he must also do his duty and turn them in to the authorities. second, because mckinley is the only other person who knows the truth, serious problems develop when mckinley is assassinated and taylor is on death row for the crimes!!! the film did a nice job of creating a story and placing it within a historical context. while today most people don't remember mckinley nor remember that he was assassinated, the film is set in this interesting time period. the acting is pretty decent, as the stars are supported by victor mclaglen and brian donlevy, though i must admit that donlevy's role was pretty tame and ordinary compared to many of his other film roles. overall, it's very interesting, well written and not too sappy in the romance department. a good outing for all.

a bland title disguises this solidly-carpentered example of old-fashioned hollywood entertainment, this film proves a largely successful hodgepodge of several disparate elements: a period piece, a romantic drama, a crime movie and a political thriller. interestingly, though made by fox, its protagonists  robert taylor and barbara stanwyck  were both usually associated with other studios; their on screen chemistry here is palpable and eventually led to marriage in a couple of years' time. while a bit too young, taylor is a dashing hero (a marine personally appointed by president mckinley to uncover the culprits behind an organized clean-up of numerous banks); unsurprisingly, no sooner has he tracked them down (led by smooth brian donlevy and thuggish victor mclaglen) that he falls for a chanteuse (naturally, stanwyck) who has thrown her lot with the gang  although, truth be told, singing is far from being the actress' forte! similarly, apart from having to prove his worth to make it into their fold, he has to vie with mclaglen for stanwyck's attentions; by the way, the practical joker persona of the former reminded me a lot of charley chase in sons of the desert (1933) which, incidentally, was likewise directed by william a. seiter. later on, taylor is in two minds about involving stanwyck in the impending bait and tries to offer his resignation to the president while eloping with the girl  but the jealous rival disrupts his plans. the robbery gone awry, we find donlevy dead and the other two in jail; taylor's hopes for mckinley's intervention  having meanwhile learned the identity of the elusive and obviously prominent 'inside man'  are seemingly dashed when the president winds up assassinated himself (a great plot twist, though the resulting eleventh-hour suspense feels contrived)! to get back to the film's jumble of styles, even if the vaudeville sequences are a matter of taste, the romantic triangle slows things up and it skimps somewhat on the thriller aspect, this emerges a handsome production indeed  with the actors already mentioned ably supported by the likes of john carradine (who unaccountably disappears after just one scene!), douglas fowley, sig rumann and, as two american presidents, sidney blackmer (the bubbly theodore roosevelt) and frank conroy (mckinley).

in 1937 darryl zanuck, who had recently moved from head of production at warner brothers, was trying to get his newly created company, 20th century fox off the ground and on a level playing field with his old bosses at warners and the glitter palace at mgm. "this is my affair" was an attempt to cash in on the current success of historical films set around the turn of the century ("san francisco" "in old chicago")and in retrospect he succeeded quite mightily. the plot is fascinating. a trouble maker but heroic naval officer (robert taylor) is given a secret assignment by president mckinley to uncover a ring of bank robbers that are paralyzing american finance. he finds the gang but falls in love with their female mascot (barbara stanwyck) and must decide between love and duty.not everything about this vintage film works well, but overall it is a good slice of studio film-making. the plot gimmick would be borrowed by kurt vonnegut for "mother night" (the lead role of that film of the book was played brilliantly by nick nolte) and seems quite believable, at least within the confides of studio make believe. as a fan of old movies i am always thrilled when i stumble upon one that i have never seen and "this is my affair" was no exception.

cool action - yeah the premise has been done - but not this way - that's the trick. hey folks - shock - it's an x-file.to me - it's cool that scully/mulder have almost no scenes together -- they have to adapt, rely on each other's intrinsic sense about what's really going on - and each other's adaptation skills. they read into each other's moves and get the job done.... (sort of).oh yeah --- really good acting -- do these people get paid to do this? or- a slow day when the convenience store doesn't call them into work. (hey - duchovny - where's the day-old donuts?? malcolm - get to school...)

another decent offering from the pen of vince gilligan.a pre-"malcolm in the middle" bryan cranston plays patrick crump, a deranged guy who eventually hijacks mulder via gunpoint and has him driving west at high speeds. it has something to do with his severe head ringing (& possible deadly combustion--his wife just experienced it), and the pressure only seems to be relieved by heading towards the left coast. only mulder could relate to this guy's plight, and actually bond with his captor before the all night ride is completed. meanwhile, scully seems to have solved the case with a possible remedy for mr. crump, and will meet them at the ocean. check it out to see if our dynamic duo can hook up at the pacific and somehow rectify mr. crump's big problem.

drive was an enjoyable episode with a dark ending. basically a man and his wife are infected in their inner ear by a high pitched sound wave being emitted by some military equipment. some favorite parts of mine from this episode are mulder's dialogue in the car, and the scene where scully goes in with the hazmat team and find the little old deaf lady completely unaffected by what they thought was a virus. the ending of course is tragic in its realism because it leads the viewer to believe that they are going to actually be able to pull off this elaborate plan to save the victim but when mulder arrives the man is already dead. 8/10

as much as 'the beginning' showed that we're still going to get "classic" x-files, drive showed that the x-files was going to explore new territory. they start by giving us a unique teaser to drive, with the news camera footage. it was an interesting transition from the the tv to the real events. i would've liked it even better if they had kept that news footage camera for the entire teaser and not cut to the inside of the car. upon viewing this episode live back in 1998 i was thinking, "am i on the right channel?" that first autopsy by scully flooded me with big words that i don't understand. i think she learned her lesson to always wear a mask before performing an autopsy. silly scully! what is the deal with the lighting in the autopsy lab? it's as dark as a tomb in there! how are they supposed to see what they're doing in there? assistant director kersh gets his first lines in this episode. i have no love lost for that man. he is the third recurring character in a row that is introduced that you love to hate, the first two being diana fowley and jeffrey spender. i guess the producers felt that there was too much love going on for mulder, scully and skinner. so they needed to add some characters to give our favorite agents some grief and incite our ire as fans. i love the quarantine suits worn by scully and her team with the cool helmet light bulbs. boy. it's really smoky or foggy in dry northern nevada at night. can we say the word "effect"? drive is a cool episode, but looking at route 36 on my u.s. atlas, there's no way mulder could've maintained a speed of 70-100 mph on that road. if he had been on i-80, the freeway, maybe. but no way on a state road with that many curves. all of the filming inside the car looked very authentic. excellent job by rob bowman. it looks nothing like the old days of the obvious blue screen or clip of passing scenery outside a car window on a stage. this was a fun episode, but some of the inaccuracies keep it from being a great episode. it keeps you on the edge of your seat, so hold on for a fast ride!

it took a loan out film to columbia for gene kelly's home studio mgm to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films. cover girl also became rita hayworth's signature film for the gis and their pinup fantasies during world war ii.kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in brooklyn where rita is a featured dancer and phil silvers the comic. of course kelly does a bit of hoofing himself there.hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire otto kruger when it turns out that kruger had loved and lost hayworth's grandmother. in some flashback sequences from the gaslight era, hayworth also plays her own grandmother with jess barker playing the young kruger. you might remember jess barker was the husband of that other legendary screen redhead, susan hayward.broadway producer lee bowman also is attracted to hayward, but he's not interested in nostalgia. he wants her for his ziegfeld follies revue and in fact the biggest number of cover girl is the title song of the film. it's nicely done in follies style.hayworth also gets to sing a sure thing in a gaslight era number and in the only song in the show not written by jerome kern and ira gershwin, hayworth also does an old english music hall number poor john. when i say sing, as everyone knows rita mouths words. singing here is done by nan wynn.the biggest hit of the show is long ago and far away which is introduced by gene kelly. it was one of the biggest hits of the world war ii era and one of the biggest sellers jerome kern ever wrote. it happens in fact to be a favorite of an aunt of mine who with my uncle will be celebrating 60 years of marriage this september. long ago and far away was nominated for best song, but lost to swinging on a star.what really sets cover girl apart and what makes it a milestone film for gene kelly is the two numbers put me to the test and the alter ego number. harry cohn decided to do what louis b. mayer had refused at mgm, to give kelly creative control of his own material. kelly later said the alter ego number was one of the hardest things he ever attempted in his career. in it he dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and intricate. in fact after one more loan out film, christmas holiday at universal, louis b. mayer never loaned out gene kelly for the rest of the time he was at mgm. and he did get creative control from then on.with that dazzling technicolor cinematography and rita's red hair and gene kelly's boundless creativity, cover girl was and is a classic and will forever be so.

a straight-forward x file that shows that action is always the equal of intelligence. rob bowman's direction is crisp and sharp, the episode looks just as fresh now as it did almost a decade ago. david and gillian both give fine performances and both seem to relish the lack of baggage - it's a standalone x file that even non-fans could happen upon and enjoy. junior brown gives both the leads a run for their money during his scene with them, he's so convincing that you could believe the crew drove to the middle of nowhere and knocked on the first door they came to. bryan cranston is intense and energetic as patrick crump, he has since admitted in interviews that he knew next to nothing about the x files prior to this role, a fact that makes his hit-the-floor-running performance all the more incredible. a brilliantly dumb episode.

i first saw this masterpiece on vhs 10 years ago, and the powerful interpretation on angry-kid-painfully-against-established-society it carried stayed in my heart since then. director hector babenco is such a good humanity, who finds a delicate angle to tell the story of how urbanity kills the childhood of the kids from poverty class. even the outcast kids have their innocent beautiful dreams. but the corrupt reality never gives a chance...thanks to the publishers for the recent dvd release, i now can keep this great movie to my favorite collection.

this movie has an outstanding acting, by marilia pêra, and a stunning dicretcion by the argentine hector babenco. this is, in my opinion, the best brazilian movie ever made. the movie was filmed with child from the 'favelas' , the brazilian ghetos. the children weren't actors and were casted by babenco in the city of rio de janeiro. the story is about the criminal children that are arrested in the correctional prison, that looks much worse than alcatraz. the children are constantly raped and beaten by the policeman. unfortunately this is not purely fiction, in brazil it does happen till today. a must see for those who like violent movies. but take your mother off the room, because it is a hard movie.

trust the excellent and accurate junagadh75 review! this film is compelling and moving in that roughest, most brutally beautiful film-masterpiece "way". file under unforgettable strong meat. or films that howl at the moon. pixote gets into your nervous system and elevates you despite the pain on the screen. here's an unrelated list of films that did the same thing for me, i.e. "engaged, destroyed, transformed,inspired, resonated... this category transcends nerdy film top ten lists that seek film perfection.

the story takes place on the streets of sao paoulo in brazil where a young boy named pixote grows up alone without his parents. left troubled and with no direction, pixote gets taken into a child asylum with other adolescents from the street. behind closed doors terrible things occurs within the staff and within the child-groups. and there is one last trigger that gets the place blown up, the last incident that makes pixote and his friends decide to break out and escape. from there on begins a journey overwhelmed with strong bonded friendships, friendships torn apart, love and hate, criminal activities and simply chilling on the beach talking about things, something someone like you and i also does sometimes.i think this film is perfect in so many ways because it touches you on so many levels, it did that with me anyway. the document-like style used to portray pixote and his surroundings does it seem more realistic, and the actors, who really are street children and have lived similar lives, helps the humanity in the conditions seem more natural. it has a social comment about child abuse too, but i think what makes the film so great is that the pressure is on the story and not on the political views. the last scene, which i find the best piece from the film, strikes me as something beyond nothing i've seen before. so full of emotions and yet so unsentimental makes this film a truthful, believable, unbearable, unforgettable story-tale. a true heartbreaking masterpiece which is so underrated!my vote: 10/10

to speak relatively, if one were only to see now hector babenco's "pixote" (1981, brazil;pronounced as "pi-shot"), after having seen quite a number of films that deal with street children, juvenile delinquents, kids in trouble (truffaut's "the 400 blows", bunuel's "los olvidados", de sica's "shoeshine", nair's "salaam, bombay!", bresson's "mouchette", nugroho's "leaf on a pillow", etc.), one might be afraid that the plight of the kid portrayed in the film might not affect one anymore, having been "de-synthesized" already after going through the emotional roller-coaster ride put in motion by the previously quoted films.thankfully, that won't be the case. for babenco narrates his film in such a matter-of-fact manner ("artlessly", as one film reviewer put it, in a positive light) and that his central child performer, fernando ramos da silva (13 years old at that time and a street kid himself), gives such a no-frills, wounded performance, raw in its simplicity (that hardened face, those lonely and longing eyes) that one is hard put not to be pierced in any way. (such a feeling may achieve such a heightened realism when one learns that the child had only lived but a short life, having been involved in street crimes after the film and subsequently murdered.)in about first half of the film, pixote and his fellow street kids and delinquents spend their time in a repressive state-run reformatory school, where brutalization and humiliation, rape and murder, are the norm and culture;where they are forced to confess to their "crimes", on the flimsy notion that under the brazilian law, underage felons are not "punishable" for their offenses. for these kids, the dubious freedom offered by the streets is more preferable than the harsh rehabilitation provided by these supposed well-meaning authorities. within the walls of this supposed protective establishment, these young souls are soon to discover that love and care from parental figures are likewise nowhere to be found, if not to a degree worser.(for pixote, the only form of escape comes from puffing grass and sniffing glue, secretly smuggled inside the reformatory.)when the kids burst themselves into a small-scale "revolt" to finally express and then fulfill their collective desire to get back to the outside world--their "home"--the intensity and form are of such a kind that one can't avoid thinking of the schoolboys' revolt in jean vigo's influential "zero for conduct". it's only that in "pixote", the "uprising" is made to appear on a gutter level.once pixote and his small group are back on the streets (the film's second half), they engage in robbery, pimping and drug-dealing to fend for themselves, along which they get to meet sueli, a battered but kindly prostitute. sueli willingly accomodates the four lost souls, in such a way that she allows her customers to be robbed by them and that she provides more than motherly care (at least to one of the children).one would have thought that the street kids have at long last found the one person who can provide them the love and warmth that have been sorely lacking in their lives. but as dubious as the freedom that these kids believe the streets are providing, this new-found "maternal figure" cannot but stay forever. jealousy, squabbles, differences, and murder have only set the kids apart--and for good. and during that defining scene where pixote, prompted by the circumstance, gets to shoot not just sueli's arrogant american customer but also his fellow street urchin ditto (more than a son to sueli), he thereafter literally goes back to "infancy", as he sucks from the right breast of the disoriented woman, right there and then materializing his lingering desire for parental affection, the image itself both sad and unsettling.it is so that sueli, in a probable coming back to her "senses", lamentably pushes back pixote from his "nourishing" position and rejects him, for good. thus, in a quietly wrenching moment, pixote, with that young-old face and those sullen eyes (not entirely dissimilar, though in a different context, to the young boy's mien in elem klimov's harrowing "come and see"), gets himself up, puts on his coat and takes his gun (yes, a gun!), and sets off to nowhere, walking along the train tracks and with the morning light just beginning to show up. with that scene, babenco may just be doing an homage (amongst many other homages found in different films!) to the iconoclastic final scene in truffaut's "the 400 blows".but whereas we got to know what has become of antoine doinel three years later in the short film "antoine et colette" (as well as in three other feature films in the years thereafter), we are left grappling in the dark as to what lies ahead for pixote after he finally disappears from the last frame, that being the last time that we'll get to see this real-life street child (notwithstanding the fate that eventually befell him in actuality)."pixote" may not be as nearly as whimsical as "the 400 blows" or as hallucinatory as "los olvidados", but it still stands out among films of similar theme and texture because of its simple, raw power.

pixote is directed with barely a shred of sentimentality. and yet i more than imagine hector babenco owes some of his film-making chops with this film to vittorio de sica's neo-realist style, in particular shoeshine (that film, as with pixote, takes place mostly inside a children's prison). and yet while i might still prefer de sica's film if it came down to deciding between the two it's so close because it is, no pun intended, like choosing between two children. they're both marvelous works of raw drama, and with pixote babenco has an extra edge and harrowing quality to deal with in that this isn't filmed in conditions brought on after a world war. this is how it was in brazil- one would see it with slightly more flair and awe in city of god, perhaps in some of the same locations- and these children were on the streets before and after the film was made. some aren't alive some 20+ years later, for all anyone knows.the "star", pre-teen street kid fernando ramos da silva, plays the title character, a youth without a father or really any family who will look out for him, and placed among dozens of other street kids and delinquents in a reformatory for boys. the conditions couldn't be much worse, and are made even more unbearable as two children are killed one after the other by some cause of the guard duty. there's a riot, and an escape, and halfway through the film we find pixote with a few other youths, including lilica a practical transvestite not even 18, and they become pickpockets, drug dealers, whatever to get by. none of this, i should repeat, is shown with a kind of ham-fisted earnestness- certainly you would never in a million years see ron howard or paul haggis direct this kind of picture- and yet there's an emotional honesty to everything exactly because nothing is trivialized.nearly every scene is significant to showing how fragile life is for pixote, and how he could be killed or die some way at any turn, and so without even reaching puberty yet he has to be on the level of those around him who are a little older (though not by much at all) and become things that will haunt this person forever. despite babenco's usage of a tender and mournful musical score and one or two scenes with people crying a lot, nothing feels forced. as with de sica, maybe more-so given the consistent conditions of san paolo and rio street kids, he's a natural director of children, and coax's out of ramos da silva and jorge julião and others some really fine work that provides just the right touches of "cinematic" drama (that is not so real that it becomes documentary, which isn't a bad thing per-say) and even subtlety in some scenes.pixote may not be as well known as it's later 21st century brazilian films that look back on the horrors of rio, or even neo-realist films, but it should be. anyone wanting to get a good, hard glimpse at what it was like should seek it out at a library or other and soak in what is the best foreign film of 1981.

when i saw this film, it reminded me of all the greatest dreams i had (mostly filled with robots)i can relate to eledore's problems and i have a similarity to shiro, and this is a great film to watch (if you're a goth who is bitter and eccentric like me!). all in all, watch it before it's out of print!

i just re-watched 08th ms gundam for the 2nd time. it is so much better than gundam wing. i can't wait to get the dvd and see what was edited out of the series. this is great to see the gundams actually move about clumsily through the land. somebody really thought over writing this move script.see this today,.

the 08th ms team features two hopeful romantics from different sides of the conflict. aina, the zeon officer, and shiro, the federal forces' new pilot, meet in a battle in space, throughout the 12 episode series (and one "movie") the two debate their love for each other while trying to come to grips with the war that surrounds them. it features a romeo and juliet romance and unbeatable animation. by far one of the best to hit american shores. suit up!

ramin bahrani sets up a scene early on in chop shop that immediately had me identifying with where the character of ale (alejandro polanco) and his friend were coming from. the two of them get on a subway, and as soon as the doors close they ask if they could have everyone's attention for a moment, and that they are selling candy bars or m&m's or something, and then they proceed to sell some bars. if you (as i) have ever been on a subway in new york city, at any time, this is the kind of situation that happens so often you almost don't notice it. often the people on a subway will see kids like these or minorities selling something or announcing and talking about something on a subway and not pay them any mind. bahrani's focus isn't necessarily just on kids who hock things for sale on subway rides, but on survival and the state of being one is in when in the lower class in america. it is, subsequently in his hands, thoughtful and heartbreaking, usually at once.to compare it to pixote or the bicycle thief isn't too far of a leap (actually in the latter at least the father and son have each other), though bahrani is specific in his intentions in his documentary style. we care about this character ali, no older than eleven and working in a car shop cleaning some cars and helping take apart others, and his sister who comes from out of town to stay with him. but it's not simply because we're force-fed any clichés, aside from, you know, a brother and sister (more-so the brother) trying to take care of one another. bahrani makes the story accessible through the simple aspiration ali has, the kind of goal that is possible attainable in his situation: saving up enough to buy a used food truck that ali and isamar can operate themselves.it's all ali is working for, but what bahrani shows us in brutal detail is this work, what ali has to do to make it happen even if its distasteful things like ripping hubcaps off of tires from cars in shea stadium or, at one point, stealing a purse in a desperate moment. this makes it all the more serious an issue when ale sees what his sister does for money on the side at night, doing sexual favors for men in an abandoned truck on the side of the road. he doesn't mention it and pushes it aside, but its always something that adds to the tension, something ale wants to protect his sister from. it adds to the tragedy when ale finds out the real cost of what it will take to make the food truck into a profit-maker, a cost that just further adds to the anguish that he just internalizes.one could look immediately at the fact that ale is an orphan in such a neighborhood as the one in the area of queens the film was shot in- naturally, as with a work of neo-neo realism (lets just call it realism), featuring practically all non-professional actors in the parts of the mechanics and workers and people on the streets- but bahrani is focused more-so on the here and the now, and that is what makes chop shop so immediate and heartfelt. not a trace of melodrama is in the film, barely even music accompaniment aside from the live latino music coming from the cars and radios. sometimes bahrani will focus on a very subtle moment that makes it pronounced in further scenes, like the way ale is awake but acts like he's asleep the first night after he witnesses isamar's late-night tryst, and we see as she slinks into bed she probably knows he's awake but neither can say a word. or, in a lot of other scenes, poetic touches that seem seamless, like when the man shows ale how feeding the pigeons work.it's rough and gritty, as you can expect, and it doesn't give much hope for its main characters despite the few moments of happiness sprinkled about. it's also a superbly shot hand-held film, where the technique, as with a lot of movies made in its urban-set tone and approach, informs and compliment the subjects on screen and what they're doing, but it also is never recklessly shot or too flashy. the filmmaker has a superb 'real-life' cast (ale was plucked from a nyc public school without any experience) and knows how to not waste a shot, while at the same time achieve a brutal artistry with just showing what he shows. it's not city of god or pixote; it's its own little masterpiece on a character or characters we usually would just not give a second look to (or a first one barely) on our way in a city such as new york. if you're not moved by ale and his daily struggles, i don't know what to do for you.

this almost documentary look at an enterprising boy who lives in the body shop area outside of new york is real all the way. real lighting. real sound. less editing in the whole movie than in 1 minute of most movies. and while there is very little script, there is a story. shot in primary colors, almost all red, white, blue and yellow, we get a real sense of the life of a boy who is making something from nothing. he has a place to live that he makes his own, has a good job, and is trying to bring his sister into his little universe. the people in the chop shop area also give us a look at this culture which i didn't know about. they mostly seem decent and pay ale what seems like daily, seeming truly concerned about his well being. the actor (i think) playing ale says more with one facial expression than one can imagine. this reminded me what a true small movie can accomplish. it shows what kids are capable of, even without much support and love. definitely recommend.

chop shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters! i cannot begin to describe how wonderful the performances are in this movie. this film is for anyone who wants to watch a powerful story and see an example of what contemporary movies should look and be like.this film is about a young boy, alejandro "ale" who works and lives with his teenage sister, isamar "izzie" in a one-room tiny loft in an auto shop. the story takes place in a part of new york city (that i did not even know existed--willits points) where there are endless junkyards and body shops. here, bahrani tells the story of two forgotten children hoping to support themselves by buying and fixing up a food van.ale makes money helping at the auto shop, and izzie helps at a food van; both, however, earn extra money on the side. ale sells bootleg movies and stolen car parts; izzie results to selling herself. their lives are surrounded by grit and grim, but even though both witness, live and barely survive within their harsh world, their love for each other is never tainted by the filth that surround them. and occasionally they are able to laugh and enjoy moments of their childhood that is being stolen by the reality of struggling to survive and stay together.the best comparison i have for chop shop is that bahrani's juxtaposition of an innocent love between family members against such a bleak atmosphere is as powerful as pasolini's mama roma combined with the struggles of growing up too fast in an adverse environment just as in bresson's mouchette.having co-written, directed and edited both this film and his first, man push cart (which won awards all over the world), bahrani is a total package filmmaker.i can only hope that his films will not be hidden treasures for long!

chop shop. written and directed by ramin bahrani ( man push cart). bahrani specializes in character driven studies in naturalist style films about the sort of little people that get passed by every day, without anyone ever really noticing they are there, in new york. these are people who have been pushed to the very fringe of society. they exist in a sort of grey world, many of them migrants whose legal status in america is appears somewhat doubtful. where do they come from ? how did they get there ? how do they cope ? where will they end up ? these are not feel good stories as such, but stories about survival at its most basic, day to day level. ale is one such street kid. he has no education and hustles anyway he can, to save money, he is also not beyond turning to petty theft. mostly he is anxious to be reunited with his older sister. we see him in the early scenes ringing a safe house looking for her, but not having any real success. a young friend, carlos gets him a job in a chop shop, in the shadows of shea baseball stadium. eventually his older sister comes to live on site with him, but he is jealous of the motives of her friends and suspicious of how she makes extra money. he dreams of buying a food van and setting up a vending business with his older sister. bahrani shoots all his films on location. there is nothing glossy or glossed over about them. this is life as these people have to live it, in the raw. lt is not pretty although it is never ominous, and the slightly despairing air that hangs over much of the film, is the same one that hangs over these peoples' everyday lives.the script is also very natural and the characters are given plenty of scope and room to work in. polanco is outstanding in the lead role, and gonzalez gives solid support as the older sister.

a friend brought me this movie and at first i was hesitating, the pace in the movie was so slow that it was admittedly boring at the beginning. but the life scenes were attractive, it's like observing than watching. it turned out to be simply stunning throughout the film, the way how the director handled the life scenes to reflect the reality was confounding but somehow also overwhelming. it's like understanding the real life of a lively person than watching a movie. mr alejandro polanco and miss isamar gonzales did their roles so well that it's more like telling us their own stories. indeed they used their real names in the movie.

this gundam series only follows gundam 0083 stardust memory. the story takes place during the same time line as the original gundam in the year u.c. 0079 the time of the one year war, but the mobile suits are designed as new models are and are as a result look more articulate. the hero of the story is a young lt. shiro amada, who may lack any real combat experience but makes up for it with creativity and effort.his life get complicated when he meets aina sahalin a jion ace pilot (the enemy), the to end up falling in love and begin to change their attitudes about the war around them. the other cast of characters in the story are not there for background either, every one in this story has a history to them.there is also another ace mobile suit pilot in this series that can be added into the pantheon of ace mobile suit pilots. right up there with char aznable and anavel gato is norris packard, not the top villain in this series, but his presence give the 8th mobile suit team a hard fight. 3 of them against norris and his single ms-07b gouf custom mobile suit.in conclusion this gundam along with stardust memory is a must see!!

i'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of black snake moan. it's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though i think director craig brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. it's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though christina ricci's character, rae, typifies those. it's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. it's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end. and it's certainly not about the south, where "everything is hotter," though it's set in the south and it's undeniably hot; holy smokes, even the tag-line writers didn't get the point.black snake moan is a parable about mississippi delta blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what they're playing about, how it heals them.it's as though the film producers sat down with a blank slate and asked, "ok, if we were going to help people understand what the blues are really about, what would it look like?" so they set it in the rural south. then they dream up two characters, one whose wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town. then, we throw in grizzled worldliness touched just a little by folk religion (they know jesus wants their lives, and though they respect him, they know they can't give him that), some violence between men and women, and lots and lots of steamy sexual images, including -- ready to go over the top? -- a black man in a sleeveless undershirt holding a half-naked white girl captive on the end of a 40 lb chain. fill it with authentic delta blues sounds, make it about a genuine blues picker, use music as the main healing element in the plot, slap clips of blues-man son house on both ends, and voila -- you have a modern parable about what the blues are all about. even the film's climax is not character conflict, but the whole town dancing steamy dances to hot, raunchy blues.of course, there's a bit of a dilemma here. rae (ricci) is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust, and is being healed by lazarus' (jackson's) homey religion and steadfastness (and don't forget the chain.) but then, we're shown the restored rae dancing raunchily to blues at the end. is this an expression of a restored, healthy life force, or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place? brewer wants it both ways, but blues really is about sex and violence, not to mention depression. i suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without unleashing either. i have my doubts.not for the first time, samuel l jackson plays so well that we forget we're watching samuel l jackson; the man is unbelievably good. he even picks some of his own tunes in the film, and his playing is authentic, dirty, and hot. christina ricci isn't usually this good, either. granted, half her job is done by the costume that wasn't there and her slinky figure, but she's a marvelous combination of cynical lust, rebellion, and vulnerability; bravo to her, she's arrived. i was impressed by the country preacher, john cothran, jr. i had to check the database to assure myself that he's a professional actor and not a genuine country minister.parents need to be aware of what they're getting if their kids bring this one home. the language is pretty far off the charts, the first half-hour is full of graphic sex, and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film (lazarus means well and is decent, but honestly, chaining a woman to the radiator?) plus, ricci spends half the movie dressed for sex; if you've got teenage boys, they'll be licking the screen halfway into the film. i don't recommend this for kids of any age. adults only, please.that being said, black snake moan is informative and accurate about blues, folk religion, and sexual abuse, and tells a tale that's redemptive in lots of ways. it's unorthodox, but well worth the time. and, my goodness, is the sound track hot.

this movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. it is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. sex and love. women's emotional abuse of men, men's physical abuse of women, sexual child abuse, fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.i promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. and the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect. music is outstanding the writing is powerful and acting from everyone was brilliant.and the dvd has some great features, including samuel jackson's background of learning to play guitar and feel the blues.this movie is not for children and i even caution parents of teenagers.

i actually though that black snake moan was great movie which takes place in the south. the story follows a man named lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. lazarus finds out that rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. samuel l jackson and christina ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that lazarus and rae become best friends. i was also amazed by sam's ability to play an electric guitar and being able to sing. s epatha merrkensen is great as lazarus' love interest angela, justin timberlake plays rae's boyfriend ronnie who is underused in the film but does the best that he can to deliver a fine performance.

in "black snake moan," writer-director craig brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. the movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. after the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and i'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into "happy ending" territory for my liking). and that's not to mention the archival footage of musician son house, ruminating on love and death (and heavily foreshadowing things to come, of course). yet in a strange way, these demerits are also qualities of "black snake moan," the tale of aging lazarus (samuel l. jackson), recently dumped by his wife (for his brother, no less), who comes across near-death nympho rae (christina ricci, easily giving the hottest portrayal of trailer trash on celluloid ever); nursing the girl back to health, he chains her to his radiator to overcome her demons, and hopefully redeem his own fallen self. while there is a definite prurient appeal in watching ricci fall out of her skimpy outfits, her performance is risky and mature--not a trace of wednesday addams to be found, and she easily holds her own with jackson, who personifies "the blues" in his portrait of a flawed, god-fearing man. while heavy-handed, the scene where lazarus sings rae a song in the midst of a lightning storm/blackout is compelling, as is a scene inside a jumping blues club that makes you wish you were there. the setting is strong, and a case can be made for the literal symbolism (the chain, the radiator, the strange blurry man who haunts rae's libido) being a deliberate outgrowth of superstition and spirituality. and it is the conviction with which this spirituality is played that lends "black snake moan" much of its strength--the committed performances of jackson and ricci make this a film that goes from wrenching to uplifting with, well, seamless grace. while justin timberlake's jealous lover is a plot contrivance i could have done without, neither he nor the sledgehammer subtlety can keep this from being a fascinatingly meditative film.

i suppose this is what is called southern gothic.it stars samuel l. jackson, christina ricci, and also justin timberlake is featured in a role. timberlake does good work, much to my surprise, i didn't expect it of him.when you're lost and you can't find your way home--that's the black snake moan.the people in this movie are definitely lost in many ways, psychologically and emotionally damaged, betrayed by those they trusted and loved and filled with a lot of pain.samuel l. jackson plays a blues singer/musician--whose wife has messed around with his brother and now left him for his brother, along with aborting a child he had hoped to have with her.christina ricci's character is a woman who was sexually abused when young--this has turned her into a self destructive nymphomaniac; allowing men to treat her badly.the story lies in the intersection of these two characters lives. it is a love story, but not a sexual love story, between them--the older black man and the young white woman.it is different from most films hollywood grinds out.i highly recommend it.10 stars

this if the first movie i've given a 10 to in years. if there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. a $4 mil box is a disgrace. people don't know what it's about. if you have any appreciation for the blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. how many people knew jackson could sing, and damn fine too. you hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. after seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word. yes, it's gritty, sexy, down home truth, bizarre and in-your-face real. isn't that the best reason to see a movie? those that get my meaning won't stay away from seeing this another week.

if you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. if you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. you've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. the surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie. look for a final scene that is an unexpected evidence of a wounded person healing. perhaps we who wonder why we wallow in the abundant profane will learn that love can be located above the loins in the heart. from the pumping pounding follow the rhythm to where where love is sacred.

i really think this movie deserves some oscars! i really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from samuel l. jackson, and mainly by christina ricci!! i'm a big fan of hers, right since i saw her in addams family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! i love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...i think she is...and i love her eyes)!! the movie is about many things...people say that is religious...people say that it's about racism...people say that is about drugs...people say that is about nymphomania...well...maybe is a little bit of all that!! but what i truly feel is that this movie has a high level of eye opening for what blues is...what it stands for...and mainly were it comes from: life...heart...pain...sorrow...and above all...spontaneous feelings!! i hope you get to see it...if you are that kind of person that likes a movie not only from the pictures or the story it tells...this is a good movie to see...if your not...well...see it anyway...cant hurt that much, and you get to see christina ricci acting so horny!! she's a fox!!

i was surprised by how great black snake moan turned out to be.being a fan of christina ricci and samuel l. jackson id figure id give this a try.well when this was over i was just left stunned by how great this film truly was.i mean everything was dead-on great and very accurate for that matter.this film shows how the great director and writer craig brewer(who made hustle & flow another great film) can just take anything even something that seems ludacras and make it into this.well, i like how it is just a good time, like its a film that just makes it there own in a good way.also i love that it doesn't show big steroeypes of the south and how its been portrayed in things as the most repulsive place to be, but not this film it makes very accurate and because of that very reconisable.the cating in this was just phenomenal especially from christina ricci(who deserves an oscar for this role), the always great samuel l. jackson, and even justin timberlake did a great job as well.overall almost everything is great about this, and while its not everyones type of film its definitely worth a viewing from anyone who can enjoy a good time. three cheers for black snake moan!!!!9.3 out of 10 stars

(my synopsis) rae (christina ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with ronnie (justin timberlake) to fulfill her needs. ronnie must report to his national guard unit and leaves rae all alone. rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. after a party, rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. the next day, lazarus (samuel l. jackson) finds rae and carries her home. lazarus gives medical care to rae, and believes that he can also save her from herself. rae is like a dog in heat so lazarus puts a 40 pound chain around her and his radiator to keep her from going out looking for men. lazarus has problems of his own, because his wife has just left him for another man. lazarus turns to his blues music to relieve his pain.(my comment) the movie has a deep meaning to it once you get past the sex and violence. the film has a different feel to it. the story is raw and almost puts you in the movie as if you were there. the 40 pound chain is a good metaphor, and symbolic of a chastity belt. you don't give love away to anyone, but you keep it for your true love. the chain could also be a parallel to a wife who is chained to the kitchen, yet rae didn't cook. rae only wanted to have sex all the time whereas a wife may not. i think craig brewer (writer & director) has made an extraordinary movie, and samuel l. jackson sings a mean blues song. the story is emotionally charged, tackling the subjects of race, religion, music, and sex all into one. (paramount classics, run time 1:56, rated r)(8/10)

in mississippi, the former blues man lazarus (samuel l. jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. he finds the town slut and nymphomaniac rae (chritina ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. when her boyfriend ronnie (justin timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of lazarus and rae, and tries to kill him."black snake moan" is a weird tale of faith, hope, love and blues. the gifted christina ricci has an impressive performance in the role of a young tramp abused since her childhood by her father and having had sex with the whole town where she lives. it is amazing the versatility of this actress, and probably this is the most mature work that i have seen christina ricci perform. samuel l. jackson has also a fantastic performance in the role of lazarus. the soundtrack is one of the most beautiful i have ever heard in a movie, with wonderful blues. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "entre o céu e o inferno" ("between the heaven and the hell")

craig brewer grew up in tennessee, it is evident in his movie. forget the black guy on white girl action. it happens, but it isn't samuel l. jackson on christina ricci. more importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this tennessee town. how they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. while shrinks make millions in the cities of the north, midwest and west coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator. it is a interesting concept and one that may not settle well with everyone.brewer shows us the region he grew up in. yes it is still tainted with racial problems, though worse problems exist in many metropolitan cities. this is in the subtext and not the main plot of the story. people live a more simple lifestyle, yet life is still complex and excruciating.jackson and ricci do a fantastic job in this film. jackson the aging-former blues guitarist who eeks out a living on his small farm. his wife of 12 years leaves him for his brother, so he spirals into depression. meanwhile ricci and justin timberlake have a last wild sexually charged night before he ships off to the army. ricci suffers from a childhood of sexual abuse, though that isn't revealed until later, her torment can only be quenched by sexual forays with various boys (black and white) in the town.when ricci is beat up and left for dead on the road near jacksons farm, he finds her and nurses her back to health. he believes it is divine intervention that this half-naked white girl is left in his care. he clutches his bible and prays for guidance. he refuses her sexual advances and instead treats her with dignity, respect and care. something few men in her life have ever done.she in time sees jackson as a man of honor and morals, yet he also carries his own pain. he plays his guitar and sings to her. yes it's the blues and damn good too, with the minister counseling her, she slowly understands how to deal with her childhood sexual abuse. jackson, through ricci's transformation, realizes he must let his own pain heal.justin timberlake comes back, discharged due to "anxiety problems". as he searches for ricci, who has been living with jackson during her recovery, he finds out she has been promiscuous and unfaithful to him.he finds her and jackson at a bar, where jackson has decided (as part of his healing process) to come out retirement and play the blues again. timberlake follows them home and confronts jackson and ricci.you will have to see the movie to get the rest of the story. should you decide to see this film, remember to look at it from the aspect of a foreign or independent movie. it is a slice of life, from a particular region of america that few of us get to see. it is interesting and revealing. it also shows us that regardless of the color of our skin, we all have similar problems that can be fixed with similar solutions.

unlike some of the former commentators, i was (and am) an avid fan of the carpenters. face it, christmas would never be christmas without the carpenters. that said, i believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting karen's life. the movie was enjoyable to see on primetime tv, but the content fell a little short. i suggest that you all look into getting some of the carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's. you cannot believe how awesome a drummer karen was. cynthia did not capture the extent of karen's talent. also, karen was beautiful but had a bad hairdresser. my choice for playing karen is hilary swank. i would love to see a more substantive story, because there was more to karen than meets the eyes when listening to we've only just begun. i have tons of unreleased carpenters' music, and it is absolutely excellent. (her singing of california dreamin is to die for).

i first saw this movie back in 1994 or '95 during my freshman year in high school when it was on lifetime. after i first saw it, i thought it was wonderful. sure, it may not have run longer, but it is as accurate as can be in my own opinion (regardless of what anyone else may think). cynthia gibb was great at portraying karen, and mitchell anderson was okay as richard. louise fletcher (yes, who played nurse ratched in 1975's "one flew over the cuckoo's nest") was fine as well, but i found her version of agnes (karen and richard's mother) to be a little bit of a control freak. i am an extremely huge fan of the carpenters, and i believe that karen's voice was and still is so wonderful. it really saddens me about the fact that she is gone and had left this earth too soon, but thanks to the never ending popularity of her music and her angelic voice, the music will live on. anyway, back on track to this movie, it really is a mystery to me and possibly other people (fans and non-fans of the carpenters) as to what caused karen to end up getting this problem with her health. was it the media that was responsible or was it just karen's decision? i would not believe that it was her decision. it could have been the media from one article that was printed out about her somewhere in '70, when their hit "close to you" came out (from what was shown in the film). there are some other moments in the movie as well. richard's struggle with drugs, and karen's brief marriage. i did not hear about her loss in february of 1983, as i was not yet into watching the news; i had found out years later. i don't know if there will be another movie about the carpenters or karen made in the future, but until then, this movie will do fine. i will say this though: if karen had disregarded the false details of that article or any future articles that might have been published with similar content calling her "chubby" (which must have been quite an insult), she would still be here on this earth today. i know that she is in heaven and probably entertaining everyone with her beautiful voice. god bless you, karen!!

one of the better made for tv biopics, i just wish it had told us more. i have read many biographies and seen other things about the carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the constraints placed on it by the family. cynthis gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring karen to life. one of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into karen's anorexia. in the reading i have done about the disease (especially cherry boone o'neill's wonderful book, starving for attention) anorexia appears to be a disease of control. karen saw her weight as one thing in her life that she could control. she felt that she was being controlled in every other aspect of her life. don't get me wrong, i believed she truly loved the music, but she felt she had little control over her career. she truly loved her family, but they did not express it well, and she didn't know how to make her family understand her. the film could have touched so much more on that. i treasure the music i have of the carpenters and wish she was still alive to contribute more to music today.

there is a clever little scene in the karen carpenter story, where both carpenters are in a recording studio, and richard makes an impromptu decision to have karen sing for the owner of the studio.richard picks the wrong key for karen to sing in, so karen is singing above her natural range. you can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face; he figures she really can't sing. richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. the next thing you hear is karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take. nicely done! for some reason, i have never forgotten that scene.the karen carpenter story chronicles the meteoric rise of the carpenters, and karen's struggle to overcome anorexia. a lot of things are glossed over. this isn't a documentary, and the movie left me with a lot of questions. very little is mentioned of karen's solo venture (the cd was released only a few years ago. if you buy it, you will wonder why they waited. it's some of karen's best work. the songs aren't as timeless as her work with brother richard, but it was a great recording, in my opinion).i have heard it said that, you can be listening to a cheap, time-worn little radio in the middle of the third world, that would seem to produce more static than anything else. but when a carpenter song comes on the radio, you would think you were listening to a $1000 hi-fidelity unit.watch this movie!

i didn't personally know karen carpenter, nor, richard for that matter, so i must go by how the movie portrayed her. i think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother richard. however, from what i did see and learn of karen, i felt her pain, share her sadness, and she was a very special person to me growing up. i know that i wasn't born until 1965 so i didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but i definitely grew up listening to her music and i have fond memories of her music. i remember the song about the "radio" (every sha la la la every whoa...so fine,) etc and i remember "we've only just begun! as a matter of fact, i memorized many, many of her songs and some people (quite a few) tell me that my voice sounds almost identical to her!!! ( i am not joking on this). i also used to be anorexic during high school and part of college (1978-1987) to be exact and weighed anywhere from 82 pounds to eventually 120 pounds in 1987. i developed some pretty serious health problems from that which helped me to identify with the actress portraying karen in the movie. the mother (agnes) was very much like my mother in many ways and i could also feel the pain that karen must have experienced. for, my mother was often unfeeling, critical, and disapproving as agnes was (if this was true to accuracy). the movie was helpful in identifying and getting to know karen on a more personal note by not just hearing her music but by seeing what she was going through. it is quite difficult to portray a person's entire life in 2-3 hours and recount every single detail perfectly so i would have to say that there is probably no biography that is that accurate. i will give this story an 8 though! i wish i did know karen personally! i would have died to meet her!! i would have loved to have shook her hand, given her a hug, or talked to her. i feel her warmth and love every time i hear one of her songs and she is greatly missed.

the tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values, but very surface and slightly altered biography. dramatizes richard's discovery of "we've only just begun" and karen's marriage troubles admirably (the "superstar" montage was a nice touch), yet notably leaves out the disagreement with neil sedaka, the contribution of tony peluso's guitar solos, etc. gibb is sweet in her karen persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real carpenter's personality. anderson is in fine form as the creative and take-charge richard, and fletcher makes her mark as the loving but overbearing agnes. the most haunting moment of the original broadcast is the use of "goodbye to love" in the background of a commercial displaying an anorexia hotline.

i was half-dozing as i watched a late night selection of short films--but sat bolt upright from the first frames of "i shout love" and could not take my eyes away for its full, brief, perfect length. with incredibly assured pacing and performances, this film maintains its funny/sad/insightful tone throughout. the credits at the end went by so quickly and in such small type, i had to go online to find out the person responsible for this master work. what a pleasing surprise to see the name of sarah polley, a major actress who is too seldom seen.kristen thomsen (tessa) and matthew ferguson (bobby) turn in rich, touching performances as a couple in the throes of breaking up. as they work through a reprise of tessa's favorite moments from their time together, both actors reveal dimensions of their characters and their relationship in ways that bring nothing but honor to their talents--and to the director/writer's skills. the film creates a moving narrative with laugh-out-loud moments and caught-breath sorrow."i shout love" is unquestionably one of the greatest and most memorable short films i ever expect to see. it has wit, heart and stunning originality. it matters.

so real and surreal, all in one. i remember feeling like tessa. heck, i remember being tessa. this was a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending. i especially liked the protesters tangent. it is nice to see symbolism in a movie without being smacked over the head with it. if you get the chance to see this, take it. it is well worth the 30 minutes.

this is a very moving film that takes a new twist on somewhere we've all been: a relationship as it's about to end. kristen thomson's performance as tessa, desperately trying to hold onto her connection with bobby for just one more day, is extremely convincing and moving and takes you right into the story. who hasn't been faced with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out tearfully, "just one more night!" when he does give her one more night, the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think about how precious every truly close relationship can be, and how each one - whether permanent or not - should be treated with respect, rather than simply thrown away.

in moments of desperation were willing to do whatever it takes to win. i loved how the maple leaves futility was used as a metaphorical basis for bobby and tessa. the acting was accurate by far superior from the hogwash intake given by the film industry.great editing! at the end of the short i felt it was a bit incomplete but so is life and this is were life and art waltz into cinematic masterpiece.excuse me while i rinse off the cheese whiz, but i guess it's acceptable at certain times.two scenes which i must point out are: the bath tub and the couch scene.the couch scene for tessa was a defining moment and 360 of the human condition. throughout the short i viewed her as a brute, but now we see her true reality. her mind spoke before her heart. need i say more about the bath tub scene.

at the beginning of this film, which i found myself watching on ifc in the wee hours of the morning, i was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort. the feeling of being trapped with no way to escape was so powerful that i didn't know if i wanted to continue watching...although it didn't really seem to me that i had much of a choice, so compelling was the situation.gradually, though, that feeling of discomfort waned (although it never really disappeared entirely), and i felt drawn into tessa & bobby's predicaments, and really just hoping against hope that they might get back together.really just a moving, powerful story fit snugly into a tiny package. i had no idea that sarah polley had anything to do with it until perusing her trivia, so now i love it even more.i definitely recommend it. ...if your lucky enough to catch it on the independent film channel sometime, or wily enough to figure out some other way to view it.

excellent and moving story of the end of a uniquely intimate affair. then again, the point of the film, to paraphrase another comment, is that every relationship can be unique and intimate. a truly quality short film which caught me at my busiest, yet had the power to pull me down onto the sofa and watch, fixed and quiet, for the duration. bobby and tessa are powerfully moving characters and anyone who has suffered the end of a love affair will find this film to be a cathartic exercise. beyond that, the 'film within a film' idea plays out very well with this cast and is quite riveting, though in a somewhat melancholic way.

i lack cable-vision and no longer have "directv". so being a rural resident i have to wait for dvd releases. being a lover of blondes but not blonds, i of course not only have "barb wire", but i have "stripperella: the complete first season". i've not yet found "vip" or a second season for stripperella. i have the "baywatch hawaiian wedding" dvd. i have the issues of "playboy" that pamela denise anderson posed in. i could go on. i love pamela! there is no one or anything that could make me feel guilty about enjoying stripperella. but there are certain elements that i dislike, but live with, for other series depict smoking and alcohol consumption too, some times. but those are my personal peeves and i try not to let them ruin the fun of a series like this for me. i too was taken aback by the change in animation style, but i adapted. however, the amount of female nudity decreased, and that is a big disappointment as one expects a lot of it in a series with a premise like this. but then again i adapted. one of my favorite episodes of "mork & mindy" was when they got to meet robin williams! so of course one of my favorite episodes of "striperella" is when pamela & tommy visit the club and the comparisons begin! if there really is a "season 2" i hope that i can find it, for as a completest, i need to complete my collection. i recommend this for other admirers of the female form and lovers of blondes. (hey! psst! "blonde" & "blondes" are the feminine form for spelling "blond"! your software should already know that!)

"stripperella" is an animated series about a girl named erotica jones (voiced by pamela anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as "the tender loins" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as stripperella, a.k.a. agent 69 who works for a government organization. as stripperella, erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun. the creator of the character and the series is stan lee of marvel fame (and creator of spider-man).back in late june of 2003, spike tv (then known as the new tnn) premiered a thursday night block of three animated shows. those shows were "ren & stimpy: adult party cartoon"; new adventures of classic kids show characters ren and stimpy for adults done by original creator john kricfalusi, "gary the rat"; about a lawyer who is turned into a human sized rat starring kelsee grammar of "cheers" and "fraiser" fame, and "stripperella"; the adventures of a stripper who doubles as a superhero voiced by pamela anderson and created by stan lee. i remember seeing all three of the premiers. i was anxious to see ren and stimpy as i love the original show. i was a little let down. it was alright but it seemed to take things a little too far; seeing the two have gay sex together was a bit much. though gary the rat wasn't bad, the best of the three was easily stripperella. the animation was really good, it had an awesome intro song, it had some good talent behind it, and it was funny as hell! the show was just so silly, i don't even know how to begin explaining it! after four of five weeks (if not a little less) the animation block disappeared, which was weird because i know it got good ratings and it was advertised everywhere. i was disappointed to see stripperella go but several months later i found out about new episodes that aired at like 1:00 am. i only got to see one and though it was funny as hell and i was glad to see the show back after all that time, something seemed a bit off....in the beginning of it's short run, "stripperella" had great animation. it was dark, moody, realistic, and somewhat sexy too. the stripperella costumed looked good too, the character was drawn well. after the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. instead of dark and realistic look it originally had everything was now really colorful and cartoonish. stripperella received the biggest changes though. before she had normal long hair, now she had hair bigger than peggy bundy's (married with children) if even possible. also, the eye mask actually shows her eyes now; before it was just white you saw which was cool since it was more superheroish. also, the upper part of her costume was kind of a vest-type thing with a collar and her costume was dark blue; that changed to her costume being a bluish-violet color and her upper costume being really crappy looking in comparison. in short, the show was a cartoon and very over the top silly beforehand, but the second-half it became more cartoonish looking and though still laugh-out-loud hilarious, it became more zany as well; for example, there was a later episode about a were-beaver...yes, a were-beaver. anyway, instead of complaining about the mid-series changes, "stripperella" only ran one season but it was a very good show. like the tales from the crypt film "bordello of blood", it may be really campy but it's really fun. as long as your not a prude you'll find yourself laughing repeatedly at this show. i haven't seen every episode because i haven't got the dvd yet for two reasons: #1. paramount released and they have this screwed up policy about not including any extras on nearly all released tv shows, even though this was the entire show (i would have liked to see some commentary's maby explaining the animation change and interviews with pamela anderson and stan lee) and #2. the awesome kid rock song during the opening was replaced. now i'm not a fan of his, but that intro sang was the theme for the show! if your not going to pay to have any extras at least pay to have the original intro song you jack-asses. the show also had a few interesting guest stars such as john lovitz as cheapo and mark hamil as the plastic surgion who hates models. also tom kenny (spongebob) was on the show as the owner of the strip club in most every episode. stan lee has a cameo in one episode too.the breakdown: pros: had a great look to it at first, funny as hell, a very fun show, great voice talent for the most part, chief strogenoff (watch the show and see some of the stuff he does), and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier.cons: the mid-series animation change and the crappy dvd described earlier. aside from the fact that some of the humor could be kind of dumb at times i have nothing really negative to say about this.overall: stripperella is a huge guilty pleasure of mine and it's a shame it only ran one season. it was a very funny, sexy, actioned packed cult series that i hope to see air on adult swim someday with the original intro intact and possibly give it another season like family guy. check it out even if it is on the lousy dvd. you will laugh yourself silly.rated tv-ma: crude and sexual humor and nudity, runtime: about 25 minutes per episode, score: 9/10

the best bit in the film was when alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole. it was also brilliant to see alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film.alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa.i've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit. a brilliant idea by the script writers. alan must be brought back into eastenders so he can do the same to peggy.alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor. watch out if you're a girl and he finds you and pulls your knickers down.

i love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was rose. rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? does our society teach this? can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? to what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? how is a "typical" human alike or different than rose? lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like france or italy? i loved that this movie provoked all of these questions in me, while it entertained, stimulated, and kept me guessing to the end! every time i've watched it, i have learned more about the film and myself.

------ spoilers----- spoilers----- spoilers--------just a few small ones saw this on satilite channel, missed the first 30 min of movie, will keep this comment short and informative.the movie is basically about 5 characters,the acting is very bad for afew characters. 1 girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people but it backfires and the 3 kidnap the 2. this is one of those types of movies where the script writers try to be thought provoking or philosophical, mysterious and ... you get the point; but do to their own, personal, lack in thinking they fall terribly short. like one of the captives who is supposed to be some type of psychology nerd - looks the part but his tongue can't speak it. the writers think that if the nerd uses a lot of 8 letter words amateurishly - unknowingly i believe - that the viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it. i wish i could give an example but i cant recall any - exactly as it was said. the ending was bad as well. but the one female captive acted her role as an old and relatively wise lady, although she, as well as the rest, had a lot of cliché s.so why would i give this movie a 7 stars if i thought all the above? simple, i give the entire seven stars to lisa keller - one sexy a$$ momma. she is fine lol. i am an appreciator of beauty, and she is exactly that. but don't get me confused because i'm not a pervert and this movie is not a porno in any way. their is somethin about her i cant explain, but i like it. i remember the scene where a captive has broke free and as he looks for a way out, bumps into keller. she tries to get way but she doesn't have a chance. he throws her down, kneeling on the stairs and he pulls her pants down, no panties ;). now, although she has an amazing ass - and the this shot leaves little to the imagination for a long 30 seconds i think - it was her facial expression that got me. she wanted it, and that look had me thinking i was behind that. i would have torn that booty up! after that expression, i jus couldn't look at her objectively anymore, i was in love. lol. i am glad to have seen this movie but if lisa keller wasn't playing the lead role, i would have changed the channel.. well... after i had seen the scene i mentioned above. i am a lisa keller fan know, but is seems that she isn't a consistent actor, seeing this 2003 movie is her latest. but i am lookin forward to another movie with her in it.

comic secret agents have made a comeback in recent years, with mike myers' 'austin powers' and rowan atkinson's 'johnny english', and more recently steve carell in the big-screen version of the hit '60's show 'get smart!'.back in 1974, it was david jason who was wearing a shoulder holster and carrying an attaché case full of documents marked 'classified'.'the top secret life of edgar briggs' was his first starring role in a sitcom, after years of being a supporting actor in such shows as 'six dates with barker', the 'doctor' series, and 'hark at barker'.humphrey barclay had found him working in a pier theatre in bournemouth and was sufficiently impressed to include him alongside michael palin, terry jones and eric idle in the children's comedy show 'do not adjust your set!'.'t.t.s.l.o.e.b' cast jason as 'edgar briggs', a well-meaning but incompetent agent for the secret intelligence service. whereas john steed wore a bowler hat, briggs had a trilby. whereas napoleon solo carried a radio pen, briggs owned a pipe. objects fell to bits in his hands. he read confidential documents in bed while his wife ( barbara angell ) perused woman's own ( on one occasion it would be the other way round ). when he tracked a pair of russian agents to a heliport, he accidentally switched on the airport's tannoy system, and broadcast his plans to capture them! when he hid on a train so as to photograph a meeting between an s.i.s. man and his enemy-contact, it moved off with him aboard and took him straight to brighton! when he tried to organise the defection of a female russian scientist, he took a 'short cut' to elude his pursuers, only to wind up hopelessly lost in a car park. yet, like 'inspector clouseau', he always seemed to come out on top at the end, much to the dismay of his colleagues.as previously mentioned, he was married. his wife jennifer was understanding about the sort of work he did. though they had a row once which resulted in her yelling at him from the window of their high-rise flat: "secret service this, secret service that! you never stop thinking about the secret service!". he shouted back: "think of the neighbours! they're not supposed to know i'm in the secret service!".briggs was part of a team of agents whose number included 'coronation street' villain mark eden ( he was the psychotic alan bradley ) as 'spencer', michael stainton as 'buxton', and 'doctor at sea''s elisabeth counsell as the lovely 'cathy strong'. they answered to 'the commander', played by the late noel coleman. the commander was kidnapped in one episode, leaving briggs temporarily in charge of the s.i.s. - which naturally horrified everyone.this hilarious show was by richard laing and bernard mckenna, who had written for the 'doctor' series. rather than spoof bond, it was more of a send-up of the serious spy shows such as 'callan' ( though it had a bond-style theme tune ). furtive meetings in underground car parks, code-breaking, stolen missile plans, that kind of thing. jason brought a lot of energy to the role, doing a lot of his own stunts, such as briggs falling off a ladder whilst decorating his flat, and tumbling down a hill in a wastepaper bin, and were reminiscent of those to be found in the 'pink panther' films.'briggs' had all the ingredients to be a smash-hit. unfortunately, it was not networked. in the london area, it was put out on sundays at 7.25 p.m. where it was trounced in the ratings by the b.b.c.'s soapy drama 'the brothers'. it was then moved to fridays at 7 p.m. because i.t.v. wanted to showcase its latest american import - the t.v. version of 'planet of the apes'. briggs never found an audience. a similar fate befell jason's next major show: 1976's 'lucky feller'. it was not until 1977 and 'a sharp intake of breath' that he found his first successful solo vehicle.you can see the title sequence ( along with two brief excerpts in german! ) for this series on youtube. unfortunately, that is all you can see. jason will not permit his early starring shows either to be repeated or released on d.v.d. a great shame. for the moment, however, edgar briggs' life will have to remain top secret.coda: i have seen a number of episodes recently and i'm pleased to say it stands up incredibly well.

i'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. however, seizing me is really an amazing piece of work. the story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. my partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. it was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to "get tea" and i felt compelled to have a shower. the story was gripping but we were clearly unable to handle all the energy in one straight shot. (it delves into the gritty and grimy side of people, but doesn't leave you there). i thought about the characters and deeper meanings for a long time. i would highly recommend this one. still be prepared for an experience you might not be expecting.

i was mighty impressed with nurse betty all the way through. it has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending i shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.if theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was morgan freeman and chris rock's interaction. these two are great and it warms my heart to see rock isn't going to do crappy big hollywood fare like lethal weapon 4 for the rest of his life. freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore. hell, kiss the girls was watchable with him in it.renee zellwegger does the best she can with her role, and kinnear is good as her obession.sweet movie with a nice touch of gratuitous violence in it to satisfy the bloodlust of the male. 9 outa 10

if i'd only seen the poster for nurse betty, i probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. but after i heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at cannes, i decided to give it a try. what i got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. rene zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse' betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. i also liked morgan freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian chris rock. the film bounces continuously between comedy, drama, romance, and thriller. yet despite this apparent identity crisis, it holds up quite well. i found my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end always waiting for the next twist in the story. the entire cast is strong, if not spectacular. my only real complaint is that director neil labute (who made a splash a few years ago with the very impressive and dark in the company of men') relied much too heavily on many cliched hollywood conventions. the mood-creating musical effects he crammed down our throats during each sentimental scene were unbearable! and he did the standard old "let's take some of the minor characters and pair them up at the end in an illogical and unnecessary romance" trick, just to make absolutely certain everyone goes home with a smile on their face. why must directors and writers treat their audiences like idiots??but the movie is still much too enjoyable to be dragged down very far by these annoying irritations. in a very subpar year for movies, 'nurse betty' ranks as one of the more pleasant surprises of 2000. 8 out of 10.

this is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. the true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. the unbelievable story of a guy who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. gosh, is this what life made us be? people deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? "toto, i think we're not in kansas anymore".

renee zellweger is a kansas housewife whose domineering husband is mixed up in drug trafficking. two professional hit men -- morgan freeman and his son, chris rock, murder the husband in his dining room. zellweger, unobserved by the killers, witnesses this and undergoes a dissociative reaction, assuming the personality of a nurse -- the eponymous betty -- who is a character in her favorite soap opera. believing herself to be the tv character, zellweger takes off in her husband's car, which has a load of dope in the trunk, and travels to la where she hopes to link up with another character in this mindless afternoon drama, "dr. david ravell", greg kinnear. not realizing she is being pursued by the two hit men, she drives to la where she manages to link up with kinnear and is actually written into the show as a nurse named betty. a handful of men in the know, including the local sheriff, catch on to what's happening and also seek zellweger in la. the ending is believable and poignant.if that sounds crazy, it's because it is. and it's the writer's responsibility, john c. richards. the curious thing is that richards and the director, neil labute, with considerable help from the performers, just about pull it all off. this isn't a plot that has been cast in a familiar mold. nope. i give it bonus points for sheer originality. somebody went out on a limb. somebody took a chance on a movie that was not a copy or remake of something that had made money ten years or fifty years ago. i imagine the people involved, down on their knees every night, praying fervently. i don't know if the film was remunerative but it's mostly successful on its own aesthetic terms.it's what might be called an "initial premise" movie. you start off with a single transformative event, in this case the murder of zellweger's husband and her adoption of a genuinely new personality, and follow the resultant logical paths realistically. "groundhog day" is another, better and more intricately plotted, example. "nurse betty" has its logical cracks, where the incidents give up their plausibility. eg., at a party in la, zellweger finally runs into kinnear, the guy who plays her ex-fiancé on tv. she's stunned (because, after all, she thinks she's betty, who lost her fiancé long ago). she approaches kinnear and a couple of his colleagues and introduces herself as "nurse betty", the character. she addresses kinnear by the name of his tv character, "david ravell." the group are puzzled at first, then convince themselves that she's an aspiring actress who insists on staying "in character" during the conversation -- and afterward, too, after kinnear has become fascinated by her and the others bored. kinnear drives her home and even when she kisses him goodnight, she's still in character, leaving kinnear wide-eyed with astonishment at the relentless way she captures the character of betty. on the next date, kinnear returns her love. that development, the relationship between zellweger and kinnear at this point, is a crack in the logic, the kind that's absent from "groundhog day." by the end of night one, kinnear, like any other person, would realize that zellweger is a few clowns short of a circus.the rest of the film, which includes many digressions, succeeds beyond expectations. the relationship between morgan freeman and his insolent, nihilistic son is marvelously spelled out. morgan is flawless in his exasperation. he manages to fall in love with the image of zellweger as he unearths clues to her whereabouts and activities, and at the end he can't bring himself to shoot her. she's too sweet to shoot. after her transformation into betty, she left a note behind in kansas. "i want to help all life, whether it be animal, plant, or mineral." who could harm the author of such a preposterous connative statement? his admiration of her comes as an epiphany, as he stands near one of the floodlights at the rim of the grand canyon. zellweger, dressed as dorothy, or maybe the good witch of the east -- well, characters that, like zellweger, are from kansas anyway -- appears to freeman and he embraces her and kisses her tenderly. it's a scene that's at once eerie, romantic, and a little spooky. i once stood at one of those lights and threw some shredded paper into the updraft from the dark canyon and found myself surrounded by a thousand swirling bats who had misperceived the fluttering shreds as moths.right. where was i? okay. i was trying not to run out of space. zellweger's performance deserves plaudits. everything she does, every movement, every utterance, is naive and tentative. she really is a likable character -- and that despite the fact that she's no glamor girl by hollywood standards. but -- what an actress. compare her performance as the bumptious 19th-century hick in "cold mountain." just the opposite. but then everyone is up to snuff in this enjoyable film. allyson jannings does a fine job in a minor role. watch her when she tells greg kinnear that she's considering killing off his character in the soap opera in a drowning accident. kinnear is one of those narcissists who wears the kind of ten-thousand dollar thin black leather jackets that were popular at the time. he chuckles and says, "oh, one of those castaway deals, right? okay, how do i get back?" jannings doesn't answer. she just smiles at him with those enormous blue eyes and tilts her head mockingly.not a masterpiece of film-making but a good, original, professional job by everyone concerned.

minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the dvd.held together by a wonderful central performance from renée zellweger, nurse betty is a dark yet deceptively good-natured comedy.suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder, already-troubled and desperately unhappy waitress betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long-lost fiancé and sets off from kansas to hollywood to find him.instead of making jokes at the expense of betty's mental state, writer john c. richards is very sympathetic, with zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless. crucially she's never really a victim despite this and while she undoubtedly suffers horribly the motives of the characters who treat her poorly are all understandable - even greg kinnear as the object of her deluded affections may be an egotistical, blinkered, arrogant pig but he genuinely believes that she's merely a quirky wannabe actress with bags of talent rather than an insane stalker.the farcical ending where all the main protagonists descend on the same place (in this instance betty's house) at the same time to have it out is as old as cinema itself but it works quite well here, even if the shift in tone is unfortunate.zellweger is ably supported by kinnear and morgan freeman both doing solid work, and it's especially pleasing to see chris rock show restraint in his earlier scenes.not nearly as cruel as you might expect, and not at all mean-spirited, nurse betty - while far from being a laugh riot - is a solid entertainment elevated to something considerably more by the lead actress.

renee zellweger is betty, a kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (greg kinnear), and who is married to del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while betty secretly watches. it leaves her unhinged, believing that kinnear is really the character he plays, dr. david ravell, and that she is his rn ex-fiancée. she heads for la to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk. pursuing her are charlie and wesley (morgan freeman and chris rock respectively), the hit men who inadvertently killed del before they found out where the drugs were hidden. they pursue her across the country, while charlie gradually falls in love with his image of her.and in la, things get totally bizarre, as no one realizes that betty is delusional. alternately funny and touching, this movie is almost perfect. stop reading commentaries and go see it.

betty sizemore (renee zellweger) lives her life through soap opera "a reason to love" as a way to escape her slob husband and dull life. after a shocking incident involving two hit men (morgan freeman and chris rock), betty goes into shock and travels to la, believing that she is destined to marry the show's main character (greg kinnear).nurse betty is that rare thing, a lesser known film with an all-star cast and a fluffy rom-com plot that surprises with it's terrific script and spot on acting. indeed, such a plot makes one question the r rating, but it's warranted all right. the shocking incident that sends betty over the edge is a tad too graphic compared to the light, amusing comedy that is to come and feels like something out of a different movie, but at the same time it is necessary to believably show betty's transformation into the doe eyed, lovable nut job she becomes.as we go along with betty on her journey, director neil labute works some extraordinary magic which makes the movie unique and high above your bog standard comedy of error. an example of this would be betty's first meeting with her crush. she pours her heart out to him and he plays along, thinking she's auditioning for a part on the show. even as we are aware of the ludicrous nature of betty's ramblings, the music swells as she speaks, giving us, the audience, betty's emotional perspective. we almost believe what she is saying, yet we understand that her mind is fractured. whereas other filmmakers would try to accent the ridiculousness of the situation to wring every ounce of possible comedy out of the scene, labute is sensitive to his main character and treats her with the utmost sympathy and understanding.the banter between the hit men played by freeman and rock is priceless, the excellent script doling out clever line after clever line for them to riff off of. freeman in particular is excellent as always, pacing himself as his character slowly and blindly falls in love with his own ideal of betty, not even truly knowing who she is or what has happened to her. aaron eckhart once again shows versatility in the thankless role of betty's no-good husband and he is almost unrecognisable. the other revelation here is kinnear, whose portrayal of the soap's star is not too overcooked. there's a tendency to lay on the celebrity bastard cliché as thickly as possible, and kinnear resists, instead imbuing him with a pompous yet restrained self importance, despite simply being a soap star.the soap opera is realised so well, it could almost exist. labute and co hit the nail on the head with this one and a good thing too. if the soap opera had been too satirical, a large part of the film would not have worked. to do a "days of our lives" spoof as seen in friends would have been the wrong move for this movie. the dedication to detail pays off, as the style and feel of the soap opera begins to bleed into betty's reality more and more, while keeping with the overall unintentionally comedic aspect of the genre. the scenes on the set feel real, as opposed to some films in which the atmosphere feels so manufactured, you wondered why people who do it for a living can't get it right.the neat resolution of the final act, while being a tad predictable, is wholly satisfying overall. it's a shame that after labute directed this wonderful film, the mainstream came calling for him to direct the abysmal remake of the wicker man, a fine example of a man so totally above the material given to him. unfortunately, one cannot absolve him of all responsibility.if you haven't seen nurse betty, it's something to discover. if you have, it's worth a re-visit. there is a charm to nurse betty that is infectious, even if it may not leave you thinking that much afterwards. a hidden gem nonetheless.

how do these guys keep going? they're about 50 years old each, and act as if they're only 30. they play 3 hours of music at every concert, and barely break a sweat. this dvd is their first concert in rio, brazil. although the people don't speak english, they try to memorize the words to the most famous rush songs, and try to sing a foreign language at the concert with their best friends.from tom sawyer to the spirit of radio, this concert dvd will keep you in the chair not wanting to pause or move away from the classics that you've listened to when you were young. this is their 30th reunion tour (started in 1974). i went to their scranton pa concert, and this was just as good, although in pa they didn't play freewill, so i was upset.they have freewill, they have the trees, they have yyz, the pass, driven, dreamline, red sector a, limelight, roll the bones, 2112, and much more. 10 out of 10, because nothing else compares. if you never go to a rush concert, then at least buy this dvd.

personally, i regard "the egyptian" in an extremely favourable light.it was introduced to me by a well-known australian movie commenter & critic named bill who was renowned for his insight & broad vision of people & places & particularly of films. this movie fitted the bill perfectly & i came to appreciate his commentary & enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as i watched it, as i was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.to me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing & fascinating production! yes, i am aware of its flaws! but it was so enticing  the young man of idealism learning from & inspired by his father  the peasant treated like rubbish in his suffering  the opportunistic friend however flawed but nonetheless loved by his friend, the central character sinute  and to be sure, a flawed hero too, like so many across humanity of all societies & across all timebut lovable & worthy of love too! yes, i believe in a christian god, but too, i acknowledge the rights & respect that should be due any human being of good heart, who would not or will not disrespect the rights of his fellowman without just cause. as such, i endorse this film & its presentation of a man of good heart & conviction in his belief in the sun-god he was devoted to. such people will always be welcome in my world vision, and hopefully, in many more beyond.so too, the drama in the ensuing movie i have watched often as surely as it has touched my heart & soul, as surely as it seems to have infuriated critics in its era. it is captivating, watching the struggles & grief & loves of sinute, the physician! when i watch it again, i am always reminded of my friend in heart bill, the film critic, who dared to oppose all the critics long ago who rubbished it. he added criticism of too many critics  that they make statues to honour stars, on the screen or in history, but they do not make statues to honour critics! and beyond all this, i am reminded with each viewing of a superb & touching spectacle, of a beautiful & well-presented drama, that was not just relevant to the 1950s or some bygone era. it was meant for you & me, across time & place, to every man & woman & child & to their personal aspirations for love & freedom & overcoming obstacles to misunderstanding & gross injustice & tragedy appealing to those of simple faith of many religions, that it seems too many regard as cause for war! take a night off from invitations or unjust violence, from bigotry & judgemental attacks on others injustly executed & consider the merits of this offering. not to the sun god, or to power that proves time & again to be so transcient .. let this outstanding movie wash over you, like waves onto a beach, like the passing hands of time  like life was meant to be. and maybe, you will find yourself carried into its world of possibilities! lost offerings no more! 9.9 out of 10!

i'll bet i watch this film 4 or 5 times a year, and will do so more often, now that the hollyweird moguls have seen fit to put it on dvd, because it's a classic with a capital "c"! this film is timeless! how can people pay $10.00 nowadays to see the junk that comes out of hollyweird with movies like the egyptian; the ten commandments; ben hur; captain newman md on tape; dvd; and cable movie channels; i could go on forever, but this film is so great, and for a relative unknown, edmund purdom carries the movie like atlas carried the world. the story is wonderful, the acting is first-rate, and the graphics at the end are so powerful, you sit in your seat for a few minutes, just trying to let the words sink in! really a knockout of a film. i'd give this one 15 stars if they'd let me! they don't make them like this anymore, but they should!!!!!

this was the second cinemascope spectacle that fox produced after the robe. notice how some of the roman sets are redressed to pass for egyptian sets. the film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (alfred newman and bernard herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). however, the principal acting is a bit weak. edmund purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. the best performances come from peter ustinov as the one-eyed slave and polish actress bella darvi as the babylonian temptress "nefer". i find this movie in general to be strong on plot which is rare for these large spectacles produced at the time. all in all, the film does an interesting and entertaining job of social commentary on what egyptian society might have looked like.

i saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with "valley of the kings." these movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in egyptology. (in 1975 i visited egypt!) seen today, "the egyptian" suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches, but it's a glorious movie to look at -- the sort of thing hollywood, alas, just doesn't do anymore -- and it has a great story... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or vengeance-is-mine affair. too bad 20th won't re-issue restored prints of this to be seen on the big screen.

i would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. i just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces sinuoeh, the lead character. i remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time i saw it. apparently, she was a holocaust refugee, discovered by a french husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. she died very young and under tragic circumstances. gene tierney is also outstanding in this film. like other neo-biblical films of the 1940's and 50s, "the egyptian" reflects the morals and values of that time, but is still great entertainment because the performances are terrific and the story so well told.

there are many film now on dvd, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. the egyptian, along with el cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. many people from my generation learn a lot about history of egypt, medieval spain and even the incas, (the first time i heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with charlton heston called the treasure of the incas), same happened to me with egypt, or rome seen many "bad" epics of the era. many production values, excellent use of color (the de luxe color was more brigit and sharp that the ordinary technicolor), maybe the cast was wrong but in any case, the film did manèged to give us idea of the life in ancient egyptin and was in a way the motor to go out and buy the novel, my mika waltari, one of the best, if not the best historical-novel ever published. also oust anding was the superb score by alfred newman and bernard herrmann. i saw this film many times when i was a boy, it was not the big box office hit that fox studios wanted to afther the robe enormous hit, in cinemascope and stereo was a wonderful eye popping sp4ectacle. i have the lasser disc version.m the only way to see ito its wdisescreen format. soon i hope will appeared.

"the egyptian" is set during the reign of one of the most fascinating figures of the ancient world, the pharaoh akhnaton, who, thirteen centuries before christ attempted to introduce a monotheistic religion, atenism, to ancient egypt. the main character, however, is not akhnaton but rather the fictitious sinuhe. as a baby, sinuhe is found mysteriously floating in a basket on the river nile and adopted by the physician senmut and his wife. when he grows to manhood, he follows his adopted father into the medical profession, initially working (as his father did) among the poor of the city, but he comes to prominence after he and his friend, the ambitious young soldier horemheb, save the pharaoh's life while on a hunting expedition in the desert. sinuhe is appointed court physician, but becomes obsessed with the babylonian courtesan nefer. sinuhe not only ruins himself in a vain attempt to win her love, but is also disgraced when his neglect of his duties means that he is unable to save the life of akhnaton's daughter.sinuhe flees into exile, where he achieves success as a healer in neighbouring countries, but returns to egypt when he learns of a hittite plot to invade. although akhnaton readily forgives him for his previous offences, sinuhe finds the country in turmoil. the pharaoh's attempts to introduce a new religion have led to civil strife between his followers and those of the priests of the old polytheistic faith, and he is too pacific by nature to take any steps to confront the hittite threat. sinuhe becomes embroiled in a plot by horemheb, now the general of the egyptian army, and akhnaton's sister princess baketamon to overthrow the pharaoh and replace him with a more effective monarch.the film's weaknesses arise mostly from its two romantic subplots. in the course of the film, sinuhe is revealed as the long-lost son of the previous pharaoh and half-brother to akhnaton and baketamon. it might therefore surprise a modern audience that she should fall in love with him; marriage between brothers and sisters were not necessarily considered as incestuous by the standards of egyptian royalty, but the standards of 1950s cinema audiences were generally less liberal on this point. in any case, the horemheb-baketamon-sinuhe love triangle is an unnecessary complication and detracts from baketamon's role in the film, that of the voice of cold-eyed, cynical realpolitik.the nefer subplot, which takes up most of the first hour of the film, is overwritten and excessively melodramatic. nefer is morally worthless but fascinating, and the role needed an actress of great beauty and also great dramatic skill to make her credible, especially as nefer achieves the difficult task of winning sinuhe away from a woman as lovely as jean simmons (who plays merit, sinuhe's rival for her affections). it is therefore unfortunate that the role went to an actress as comically inept as bella darvi, whose only qualification was that she was the mistress of the producer, darryl f. zanuck. darvi was not only a wooden actress, but also spoke with a thick foreign accent, made even more incomprehensible by a lisp. she was not even particularly attractive by comparison with the two legendary hollywood beauties in the film, simmons and gene tierney who plays baketamon.the film is better when it concentrates on its main political and religious themes. the other actors are better than darvi, although peter ustinov as sinuhe's servant kaptah makes the same mistake as in "spartacus", that of trying to bring comic relief into a film that does not need it. his voice, anyway, was far too patrician for a "comic servant" role.edmund purdom, a little-known british actor, was thrust into the main role when marlon brando pulled out at the last minute, but more than adequately fills the great man's shoes, even though his style of acting was quite different. he copes well with the challenge of showing the changes in sinuhe's character, from unworldly idealist, to lovesick fool, to embittered cynic to the enlightened visionary of the final scenes. victor mature was never the most expressive of actors, but he is well-suited to the role of horemheb, a practical, down-to-earth man of action. he is better here than he was in his other epic from 1954, "demetrius and the gladiators". simmons is luminously beautiful as merit.michael wilding (hitherto best known to me as the second mr elizabeth taylor) plays akhnaton as a would-be philosopher-king who ends as a sort of holy fool. his inability to make difficult decisions makes him an unsuitable ruler, but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice which lend him an air of moral greatness far beyond those who hope to replace him on the throne. although aten had more in common with the supreme being of the deists than with the old testament jehovah or the trinitarian christian god, there is a quite deliberate attempt to draw parallels between atenism and christianity. in the film the atenist symbol is the "ankh", doubtless chosen because of its resemblance to a cross, but in reality it was a common egyptian hieroglyph for life, not unique to atenism. akhnaton's language often has a biblical ring to it; his comparison of himself to "wind whistling in the desert" recalls john the baptist's "voice crying in the wilderness" (hence the title of this review). sinuhe's finding in the river parallels the old testament story of moses.at the end of the film sinuhe, who has become the inheritor of the spirit of the dead akhnaton, achieves a moral greatness of his own. the message of the film is that, while we may need practical men of action like horemheb, we also need visionaries and thinkers who are prepared to ask the question "why?" for all its faults, "the egyptian" is a film which is idealistic and humane in its approach to both religion and politics. 7/10

i was on my way out one morning when i was checking something on the t.v. and came across this film. i don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. what a fun and interesting one to watch. well, my meeting was pushed back, because i couldn't get out of this film. it had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history, and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. well, there was a lot of realism in it. the acting was good for a 1954 film. subtle and genuine actions on the part of the characters that had me watching what they were going to do next. that is why i ended up watching it. i don't know why they don't show it more often. i would rather watch this than some films they play more than necessary. for history buffs, people who like period films, and those that are in the film appreciation groups will like this one. "the egyptian" has a variety of flavors dealing with a lot of things to look at in human nature that has not changed since it's time. what does that say about us? those that don't like movies that take their time to unfold and tell a good story....are not into film.i haven't had the time to rent it if it is available, but if i get a chance to see it again, i would probably vote it a 10.

i saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. i've seen it 4 more times since. i had never heard of it before and i consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. a true, polished, diamond in the rough.this gem of a movie revolves around jon voight (lead character "conrack") as a young schoolteacher assigned to yamacraw island to teach the islands' children, all in one school. at first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home. the heart of the movie is conrack finding inspiration to awaken their young minds to the world around them. the students quickly reward their teacher with an eagerness to learn and a remarkable ability to grasp concepts that, only a short time before, had been foreign to them. conrack uses unconventional and clever teaching techniques that happen to be, oh a little fun! god forbid. learning and fun? together? can't be, or so says the ones in charge. to avoid a spoiler, i shall just say that conrack finds resistance with the boss man....and the ending is truly bittersweet.i am a 35 year old white male with some teaching experience, so i should identify with the lead character, pat conroy (aka, conrack, mr. petroy). but i don't, i identify with the black kids. as a kid, i was bussed to the school on the other side of town from the 4th to the 6th grade, circa 1979. these kids in the movie remind me of my classmates then. luckily, in 4th grade as a 8 or 9 year old, one doesn't understand racism. i just remember we were all being kids, playing 4-square, kickball, hide-and-seek, and running relays.this movie is very moving. there are delightful and poignant moments from beginning to end, non-stop. i found myself many times with tears in my eyes, then suddenly laughing out loud. it's a funny movie."git away from that winda!!".... "sir, if you're prepared to accept crap, i should tell you that rabbit just did it in your lap."..... "so, you the white schoolteacher, mr. conrack. my grands love mr. conrack. you a good looking teacher, you a good looking white man."..... "wind 15 mph from the east. small boat warning. small boats beware. big boats ok, don't gotta worry 'bout nothing.".... "not a fry cook, but eleanor roosevelt, not a share-cropper, but (something latin)...that's latin..hey wait!".... "conrack sing like a frog....i sing good, whatcha talkin' 'bout?!".it still mystifies me that i still hear nothing about this movie or that it has very little reputation or following. i intend to seek out more reviews, comments, background, and "making of" tidbits, if they are out there. what amazes me is the acting given from the untrained kids. one of the kids, mary, i understand was an actress, and you can tell. however, the other kids have plenty of lines and genuine reactions. i wonder how they did it! i'm guessing that conrack and mary had precise dialogue to work with while some of the scenes unfold naturally or ad-libbed.conrack is a special movie. in my opinion, it is one of the very few movies that are so good and so unknown. others in that category are king rat ('65), dark passage ('47 with bogie and bacall), gods must be crazy ('80), and bad day at black rock ('55). i recommend them all. but first, take a seat in the class of mr. conrack.

pat conroy's autobiographical book "the water is wide" proves to be something of a southern "up the down staircase", yet despite the teacher-going-against-the-odds formula, "conrack" really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash. these students (uneducated black kids on an island off south carolina) are actually shown learning, and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. the one actual actress in the bunch (tina andrews, an amazing performer) plays the "tough nut" conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charms, it all seems a breeze. but the story is not ready-made for a happy ending, and i wasn't prepared for the quiet simplicity of the finale. it's beautifully done. the script veers off course every now and then, but director martin ritt is very smart to always fall back on jon voight's solid presence. scenes such as the one where he drives around in his van venting his frustrations over a loudspeaker don't add up to much, but the whole film is filled with episodes which spark emotion, and the actual ending is their payoff. **1/2 out of ****

i first saw this film when i was in the 8th grade and i remember that it had a profound affect on me then. i saw in again about a year ago (i am now 29) and it still moved me in similar ways. this is a great movie that personifies the struggle of "principle vs. pragmistism". voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any psuedo-racist leanings of the superintendent, mr. skeffington. that story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change, and more specifically, cultural change. often at the expense of children. when these battles finally come to a boil, pat conroy loses and pragmatism reigns triumphant. or does it? the children that he has to leave are better off for knowing him, more exposed to the "real" world and to classical music. the other teacher at the school gained respect for him and he learned much about himself. a great film with a heart-breaking ending. i recomend that anyone who enjoyed the film to read the book, "the water is wide", by pat conroy. it will stay with you!

the ma & pa kettle characters were highly popular and controversial. the films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. one obvious reference is 'the beverly hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. you could even say the 1980s sitcom 'newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. still, i wonder if betty macdonald, the washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good. her portrayal of hillbilly characters makes them the butt of many jokes in terms of their alleged sloppiness and laziness. (the real life family that macdonald based the kettles upon, successfully sued...claiming they had been ridiculed and humiliated with these less-than-flattering references). sure, it's comedy and the situations bring us a great many laughs and fun moments...and political correctness as we know it today did not exist in the 1940s and 1950s. but i think macdonald could've still written these characters more sensibly and universal international could've had its scriptwriters show them on screen with more dignity (there's such a thing as good taste). the more realistic moments are when the oldest son tom is ashamed of his rural heritage but learns to accept his parents and siblings for who they are. for their part, the kettles have to realize that they don't exactly fit into a modern world. that's not a joke...that's a sober truth.

the further adventures of ma and pa kettle almost seamlessly picks up where the egg and i left off. for the first solo adventure of the kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. leonard goldstein, associate producer of the egg and i, was producer of the further adventures of ma and pa kettle. with many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the macdonalds to the kettles works very well. there is a reference to ma beating birdie hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in the egg and i. the prize money from the quilt contest was to be used to send tom kettle to college. in this movie tom is returning home as a college graduate.there are two plots intertwined in this movie. one is the comedy of the simple mountain family moving into a state of the art modern house. the other is a light morality play on how environment affects children as they grow up.pa kettle (percy kilbride) wanted a free tobacco pouch for entering a contest, and ended up winning a house. his disappointment at not getting the free tobacco pouch is played for laughs quite a bit. when pa plays with dynamite he is totally oblivious to the explosion. kilbride never flinched in the scene as the debris from the explosion fell around him. he played the part to perfection. in his autobiography, jack benny mentioned how impressed he was with percy kilbride's deadpan delivery. kilbride took that comedic device to a high level of perfection.ma (marjorie main) and pa move into the new house with modern conveniences that confuse ma and pa almost as much as they help them. ma adapts far more quickly than pa. included with the modern conveniences is a television, a very new household item in 1949. moving walls, hidden beds, and plumbing fixtures are used as comic props, but the attention is on ma and pa, never the props themselves.tom kettle (richard long) meets kim parker (meg randall), a magazine writer who feels that hygiene and environment are essential for children to realize success as adults. tom is a bright, self-made man who contradicts the theory that success can only come from a pristine environment. this subject is briefly discussed in a couple of scenes, but left to subside. it was also the only serious discussion in this otherwise whimsical movie.seeing the kettles moving out of their run-down old house to move to a new house would almost be a disaster if it were not for the characters staying true to themselves. ma was the practical one, just as she had been in the the egg and i. pa was the fish out of water that provided the best comedy. he never felt at home in the new house, but the actual location of a comfortable bed would never be of concern to him.

there is a need for this kind of entertainment in our modern world. you can watch "ma and pa" with adults, with your family (kids any age or just by yourself like me. they are gentle, but gentle is so refreshing in a society of kids killing kids, a horrible war, inappropriate prime time television and poverty. we don't even get a hint of where all of those children came from! give me modern plumbing and i'll gladly become a kettle. humor does not require offensive language. it is hard to follow conversations in shows where every other word is bleeped. relax, take your shoes off, and climb in your recliner with a good old-fashioned glass of lemonade, and just breathe easy watching ma sweeping the chickens off the table at lunch time! pj

the film begins with a cranky old broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor richard carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. however, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised). however, while this seems like bad and contrived writing, it is not....as this is all part of an elaborate ruse by the writer to have a group of actors in the home act out his plot. however, part-way through the ruse, the producer and his browbeaten assistant figure out that the murder mystery taking place in the home is fake and think the whole affair is pretty funny. what no one realizes, though, is that an escaped maniac is loose and he is about to enter this contrived little plot--making for some wonderful twists and turns. so when it seems that there is a real murder, the actors are truly terrified while carle and his sidekick are convinced it's all a hoax. while i have explained some of the plot, there are many more aspects of the film you'll just have to figure out yourself--and it's surely to keep you entertained and guessing.considering that this is a b-movie in the public domain, i certainly did not have very high hopes for this little film. however, i was thrilled when the film turned out to be a much better than average flick--with a very interesting and novel twist on the old clichéd plot about a dark and stormy night spent in a mansion. plus, while the plotting of the film was very good, the dialog was even better--with lots of sparkling wit and a nice light-hearted pace. full of pleasant surprises and well worth your time.

i have this movie on a collection of inexpensive b-movies. it's not restored, in fact, the audio was difficult to discern for the first few minutes.at first, it seemed like a typical haunted house film, and feels very much like the forerunner of clue, murder by death, house on haunted hill, etc.about a half hour into the film, the storyline takes a really interesting twist--and it goes from being a cliché melodrama to something entirely different, and far more entertaining than i had initially thought.check it out, it's a great deal of fun, even if the long clips and wider shots (and near lack of music score) make it feel a bit creaky by today's standards.

one of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as "the murder mystery", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. and since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced). aspiring playwright charles belden saw in this renewed interest in murder mysteries a chance to make a name for himself, after warner bros. picked his three-act play, "the wax works", to create the 1933 horror film, "mystery of the wax museum". belden joined independent filmmaker frank r. strayer to keep making films, and "the ghost walks" was one of his best.in "the ghost walks", john miljan plays prescott ames, a young playwright who wants to impress a famous broadway producer named herman wood (richard carle) with his new play. ames takes wood and his assistant homer (johnny arthur) to his country house for a reading of his play, but his car ends up stuck in the mud during a terrible storm. the three men ask for refugee in an old mansion which happens to be property of one of ames' old acquaintances. inside the house, wood and homer witnesses the strange relationship between ames and the house owners, however, this is all a plan conceived to impress wood: everyone in the house is an actor playing a role in his murder mystery. unfortunately, the murder committed is done for real, and while wood and homer think it's all fake (after discovering ames' original plan), the cast knows that someone inside the house is a real murderer.as expected, charles belden's screenplay for "the ghost walks" features the classic elements of the murder mystery stories of its time, as we have the stormy night at an old dark house as setting, the obligatory group of suspects, and the touch of comedy. however, what's interesting here is how belden makes the film a real spoof on the genre with the many twists he puts in his story to play with the clichés of murder mystery plays. the dialogs are excellent, full of wit and lighthearted charm, and while the plot certainly loses a lot of steam by the end (it follows the murder mystery routine anyways), it never fails to be interesting and entertaining thanks to its smart twists and specially its quirky characters. interestingly, there's an obvious gay subtext that while stereotypical, it's never denigrating and it's genuinely funny at times.by 1934 director frank r. strayer was already an experienced craftsman in the poverty row side of the film industry, but his partnership with writer charles belden would give him a couple of his most interesting movies, and "the ghost walks" was one of them. while obviously done on a shoestring budget and the typical production values of independent films of its time, strayer manages to take advantage of his set and makes an atmospheric movie that fits nicely the mood and tone of the story. the pacing is a little too slow at times, but strayer knew that the power of his film was on belden's script and makes the most of it, letting his cast to make the most of their characters with excellent results. certainly the execution is a bit typical and unoriginal, but strayer makes an effective albeit restrained work in this film.as written above, the screenplay is filled with great lines that make the quirky characters shine, and fortunately, most of the cast play with this to their advantage. veteran character actor richard carle is remarkably funny as cranky producer herman wood, adding a lot of charm to his character, specially in his scenes with johnny arthur, who plays the flamboyant secretary homer. arthur is the one who gets the most best scenes, and he gives and hilarious performance as the cowardly yet witty assistant. john miljan is just effective as presocott ames, nothing amazing, but nothing really bad, and the same could be said about june collyer as gloria shaw (the obligatory love interest), whom is just fine. however, donald kirke is really enjoyable as the malicious terry shaw, and it's a shame he didn't get more screen time.as usual with frank r. strayer films, the low budget hurts the film badly, as while strayer makes the best he can, the film still feels kind of plain at times. however, the main problem is problem the very slow pace it has, as even when the film is filled with sparkly moments of witty dialogs, it moves at a pace so slow that can become boring and tedious for moments. it also must be said that while effective in their roles, miljan and collyer are pretty dull and average when compared to arthur and carle, and one wishes the movie had been more focused on the comedic pair they make than on the main couple. finally, as written above the ending is kind of weak and not up to the high standard of the first and middle parts, although credit must go to belden for keeping creative plot twists appearing until the very end.one could say that charles belden is an unsung hero of the murder mystery genre, as among the many horror and mystery films that came out the b movie studios nicknamed as "the poverty row", "the ghost walks" is easily among the best (alongisde strayer's previous film, "the vmapire bat") despite its shortcomings. and even when it's definitely not a masterpiece of the genre, it's a nice way to spend a night enjoying the way it pokes fun at its own origin as a murder mystery play. a very recommended film if you like the genre. 7/10

on their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. they make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. if you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.this is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it. the cast is across the board excellent and they're more than willing to have a good time with what is good material.i would love to say that this is one of the best of the genre, it should have been, but for me something happened on the way that made me down grade the rating to only seven out of ten. i can't tell you what it is, not for certain anyway. perhaps its the sense that i knew where it was going almost from the outset, or perhaps its something else, i'm not sure what, but there was something that i couldn't shake that made me like this film despite wanting to love it. it just missed being great and somehow fell short.that said i do suggest you see it. it is after all a very witty film, that entertains fully, despite just missing being great.

the ghost walks is a nifty little mystery with a great twist, snappy dialog, and best of all a pansy played to the twittery hilt by character actor johnny arthur which never demeans or denigrates his character. mr. arthur is great in his role of homer erskine bringing great comic relief as the secretary of the broadway producer herman wood, played by another great character actor richard carle.they play off of each other superbly.although the acceptable words of the time sissy and cream puff are used to describe the character of homer, it is never mean spirited or meant as denigration, and are not spoken by the manly males of the film but by his employer, who fires and rehires him every other scene and who displays an almost exasperated affection for his devoted employee.there is a great scene where homer tells his boss that he has devoted the best years of his life to him and has been everything but a mother to him.the mystery angle of the film is very entertaining, and the twist at the end might just leave you in stitches.for a low budget poverty row picture, this film has superb set decoration and great costuming.director frank strayer ably handles his cast and this film holds together much better than some of his other low budget mystery attempts, but he had a great script to work with and some wonderful actors to carry it through.this film is a must see for devotees of poverty row films, old dark house mysteries (they actually managed to work in the lines "it was a dark and stormy night)and it has the added bonus of being an early representation of a gay character in film where nothing bad happens to them in the end.this movie is available for download in the public domain film section of the internet archive at archive.org.

both jackie and candice are terrific in this movie. they are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. in particular, the way candice pronounces the words "puerto rican" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. i had seen the original of this movie, called "old acquaintance", starring bette davis and miriam hopkins. they allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other. hart bochner and meg ryan have supporting parts and are both excellent, in particular bochner, who never got many decent parts in movies, as far as i am concerned. george cukor did not make another movie after this, so this was a good one to go out on.

gosh, i am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. for example, i had no idea who george cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. all i can say is..i really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. can that ever exist? well, in certain doses, yes...and this film let out in a bit on ... "how".being a youngster with not a lot of life experience at the first time i saw this so i focused more on the "rich" and "famous" part between the two. at the time, i had no idea there was a difference and what would happen to two women who discovered there was...and how that would effect their friendship. through their men, their career, the decades that defined them. and coming to realize one thing remained stronger than anything else...their friendship and knowing each other more than anyone else could have.then i got older, studied film a bit... and watched this film again with my best friend from high school. we do understand the 'rich' and 'famous' angle ... and we are still the best of friends...but this film is not a cinematic masterpiece...it can be seen as a bit campy at times...a little over the top at points (kinda on a 'dynasty' and 'dallas' level to me..) and honestly i can identify with the "teddy bear" scene for we do share a bear that means a lot more than a stuffed fun toy through our trials and tribulations with men/careers, et al..so its not as over the top as it seems....! as many already said, seeing meg ryan and matt latanzzi and dack rambo and david selby are great in this 1981 piece. this is a nice "chick" flick!

recently i saw this movie again (after 25 years). in the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between jacqueline bisset's character and michael brandon's character. the rented version did not have this scene in it. did i imagine this?or, is this part of the "clean up" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not "appropriate"?i love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and i and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together. her husband thought it was us as well.thank you, joan

i loved this film because of the dialog and superb acting by candace and jacqueline. however, i never knew until now, watching a bette david marathon on tnt that this film is a remake of a 1943 bette davis classic called old acquaintance. bette co-stars with miriam hopkins who she was in a terrible feud with during the making of the movie because bette had had an affair with miriam's husband who directed her in a film before they made old acquaintance.anyway, both are worth every minute spent watching. i highly recommend this film if you like a lot of dialog and drama. it's a study in the psychology of women and their relationships with each other, in my opinion.

i finally received my dvd today, viewed it and i'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film. as you may have read in previous reviews of "rich and famous" that the edited for tv version of the film that somehow made it onto vhs sometime in the late 90's but, now wb has corrected the error and released it on dvd complete with the airplane restroom scene, matt lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the hotel room where liz (jacqueline bisset) calls merry (candice bergen) a c**t! it's all there and looks better than ever! a crisp clear digital transfer, widescreen, and special features that include original theatrical trailer and a vintage 1981 featurette called "on location with rich and famous" with cast and director interviews. if you love this film as i do you won't be disappointed with purchasing this dvd. glad to finally have this on dvd well worth the wait! thank you warner bros!

george cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. itself a remake of bette davis' campy "old acquaintance" written by john van druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.bergen and bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. liz hamilton (bisset) is a "serious" writer, intellectual, and elegant. she meets her lifelong best friend merry noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition. later in their lives, when liz is a "promising" but blocked writer of serious fiction, merry decides to try her hand at writing, which infuriates her pal because of merry's casual approach to the craft she herself takes perhaps a little too seriously. much to liz's chagrin, merry's trashy novels hit pay dirt, and ultimately, her old friend liz is judging her novel for the national book award. bergen steals the show as the haughty writer of steamy bestsellers who schemes to bring together the broken pieces of her life in conjunction with her final literary triumph, but alas, things are never that simple.the supporting cast includes david selby, whom you might remember as the tragic quentin collins from dark shadows, hart bochner and, of course, a deliciously young and mercurial meg ryan in her first film role since leaving the soaps. rich and famous is catty, campy, witty and wise. it culminates in a new years fiasco that stresses the enduring nature of true friendship, and i never let a year go by without watching it on new years eve. watch it and you'll see why.

george cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. the unsung hero of his generation. nobody mentions cukor in the same breath as john ford, howard hawks, william wyler or billy wilder and yet, look at his filmography. from sparkling comedies "the philadelphia story" "adam's rib" "holiday" psycho melodramas "gaslight" "a double life" a great semi western "heller in pink tights" not to mention "my fair lady" or "travels with my aunt" he was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera. i feel a certain tenderness watching "rich and famous" flashes of the old master still very much in evidence. candice bergen gives us for the first time in her career glimpses of the wonderful comedian she was about to become. jacqueline bisset is a throwback to the days of greer garson and loretta young and hart bochner steps in, teasing us, promising something spectacular that will eventually materialize in 1989 with "apartment zero", meg ryan, as bergen's daughter is already meg ryan. as tired as the formula is, it remains a cukor film and for what i gather one of almodovar's favorite movies.

the year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'the gunfighter' by henry king, and 'wagon master' by john ford. 'the gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced zimmerman's 'high noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns.however, i personally find 'wagon master' superior to it's contemporary counterpart. ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west. although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring. frontier scenery is well used as it supports the poetic narrative perfectly. add naturalistic camera work and we are transported among the mormon travellers to witness western folklore told in cinematic means.

the performances by the male leads make this long-hard-journey west interesting throughout. the soundtrack by the sons of the pioneers is one of the most beautiful i have every heard. the journey itself is somewhat episodic, and joanne dru is badly miscast. overall, this is a very heartwarming and heartfelt western.

what can you say about a short little film filled with secondary actors and no "stars", with absolutely no bad performances, not one poorly delivered line of dialog, and with the cold violence on one hand being balanced by the warm "heart" of the protagonists in the story? it's a jewel, a diamond, a little valuable gem of a western that evokes the spirit and legend of the american west. a west not settled by grand heroes like hickock or cody or masterson or earp, but by the spread of the everyday man and woman, farmers and ranch hands, merchants and miners and lumbermen, whores and barkeeps, and entertainers of the day, some looking for riches, some for peace and quiet, some for religious freedom. it is, perhaps, a very spiritual story, though not promoting any particular religion, for even the non-mormon cowboys portrayed by ben johnson and harry carey jr. act in kind and noble ways toward everybody in the story, regardless of religious affiliation and beliefs, and go out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the wagon train comes upon the stranded medicine show people. and in true biblical fashion, like david and goliath or samson and the philistines, they are the guardian angels sent to the wagon train who eventually have to go head to head with the evil incarnate clegg clan, likening them to the serpent in the garden of eden, and regretting what it is they have to do afterward. it's a sweet folkloric tale of the west that hits every target john ford takes aim at.nowadays i have a western santa claus whose red outfit is covered with a denim drover coat, whose red stocking cap is replaced by a brown stetson, who carries a burlap bag of presents and a coil of rope. to my santa i added a winchester rifle with a sling to put on one of his shoulders and a colt revolver to tuck into his waistband. when people at the office ask why my santa has to carry guns, i simply reply, "snakes!" after all, isn't the spirit of the christmas season one where everybody should get what they deserve? fifty five years later, especially post-911, the philosophies and attributes demonstrated by the characters and story of this movie are still as relevant today as they were back then.

i first saw this movie on tv back in 1959 when i was eight years old. i knew nothing of westerns then but recognized ben johnson from the movie "mighty joe young." what attracted me to "wagon master" were the great songs sung by the "sons of the pioneers." merian c. cooper, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. cooper hired max steiner to create the mood for his classic creation king kong. steiner would later win an oscar for the theme for "gone with the wind.' cooper was also the producer of "mighty joe young." if you remember, music was important to the big ape which would only respond to the sound of stephan foster's "beautiful dreamer." in 1947, cooper would partner with john ford, who directed "wagon master." of all of ford's famous westerns, this one is my favorite which features his brother francis and a sullen janes arness.

most of us kids growing up in the 40's or 50's were western buffs but this was one that had escaped me until seeing on the movies for men channel today. i loved the film's story, cinematography as well as the superb casting of ben johnson and harry carey jr. in the lead roles along with the ever dependable ward bond. apparently this movie was the inspiration for the later television series 'wagon train' which featured bond once again as the boss of the wagon trains heading west. johnson steals the film with his horse riding skills and it's nice to see an actor doing his own stunts like ben does in this movie. other notables include the lovely joanne dru as denver and an early non speaking role for james arness who later became famous for his marshal matt dillon role in 'gunsmoke.' if you like films of this genre you can't fail to like this one.

for my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director ford ever made. the dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l the story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any american black-and-white film. owes an awful lot to sergei eisenstein's editing technique, but never as coolly detached or 'scientific' as eisenstein could frequently get. and a great musical score. a magnificent panorama of an important and poorly understood episode in american history.one little quibble: it's not clear why the film involves the mormons, who, as far as i know, were never the pacifists the quakers and amish were. this confusion leaves a slightly bitter after-taste.however, the rest of the film is such a feast, this is easy to ignore. in all other ways, a true masterpiece of american cinema that needs to be revived and looked at again (and again and again).

this small john ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. it has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey west of a party of mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all ford's films, (it's on par with "the sun shines bright" which he made a couple of years later).there is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental. the splendid performances of ford's stock company, (ben johnson, harry carey jr, ward bond, jane darwell etc), adds considerably to the film's authenticity while the nearest the film gets to a full-bodied star performance is joanne dru's denver. dru was a much finer actress than she was ever given credit for as were bond and johnson, who at least was finally awarded with the recognition of an oscar for his work in "the last picture show". as he said himself, 'it couldn't have happened to a nicer fella'. add bert glennon's superb location photography and you have a genuine piece of americana that couldn't have some from anyone other than ford. this is a film that truly honors america's pioneers and is full of sentiment and feeling.

by 1950, john ford had already fully-developed the ideas and motifs that would form the core of his most successful westerns. always present, for example, is a strong sense of community, most poignantly captured in the joad family of steinbeck's 'the grapes of wrath (1940).' within these communities, even amid ford's loftier themes of racism and the pioneer spirit, there's always room for the smaller human interactions, the minor friendships and romances that make life worth living. 'wagon master (1950)' came after ford had released the first two films in his "cavalry" trilogy  'fort apache (1948)' and 'she wore a yellow ribbon (1949)'  and it covers similar territory, only without the military perspective and, more damningly, the strong lead of john wayne. ben johnson and harry cary, jr. are fine actors, but they feel as though they should be playing second-fiddle to somebody, and ward bond's cursing mormon elder, while potentially a candidate for such a role, isn't given quite enough focus to satisfactorily fit the bill.in 'wagon master,' ford seems so comfortable with his tried-and-tested western formula that any character development is largely glossed over. ben johnson's romance with joanne dru is treated as an obligation more than anything else, and harry cary jr's charming of a mormon girl is so perfunctory as to be almost nonexistent in the final film, leaving one to ponder the survival of deleted scenes. only in charles kemper's charismatic and shamelessly-villainous uncle shiloh does ford try some different, and it works, even with his being surrounded by a troop of insufferably hammy slack-jawed yokels. where ford does succeed is in orchestrating the conglomeration of three distinct races of americans  the values-orientated mormoms, the easygoing horse-traders, the eccentric travelling showmen  into a cohesive community of pioneers looking towards a bright future. this apparent harmony is thrown into disarray by the arrival of uncle shiloh's gun-toting outlaws, who exploit the lawlessness of the western frontier but ultimately lose out to the noble cowboys who "only ever drew on snakes."ford reportedly considered wagon master among the favourite of his films, and perhaps this has something to do with the absence of big names like john wayne or henry fonda. armed only with his stock selection of usual players, ford is able to generate a sense of community by avoiding placing focus on any one character, though most of the mormom travellers still remain completely anonymous. despite being undoubtedly well-made, i can't help feeling that this film only does well what other ford pictures did even better: the terrific majesty of the the western frontier was presented more beautifully in 'she wore a yellow ribbon'; the romances and friendly squabbles among community members took greater prominence in 'fort apache'; the early relations with native americans, only hinted at here, were more thoroughly examined in 'the searchers (1956)'; the bold pioneering spirit of the early settlers was explored more movingly (albeit by henry hathaway and george marshall) in 'how the west was won (1962).' 'wagon master' is pure john ford, but it isn't a landmark.

i don't think i really have any spoilers in here but since i do describe a couple of funny scenes, i'll check the box saying 'might contain spoilers' just to be on the safe side. now...i hardly know where to start. by now you know the basic outline of the story - horse traders travis (ben johnson) and sandy (harry carey jr.) take the job of guiding a mormon wagon train west to their 'promised land' and along the way encounter a variety of trials and interesting characters, most notably the outlaw clegg family.anyone can enjoy this movie. you don't have to be a fan of westerns to like this one. for one thing, johnson and carey are two of the most quickly likable characters you'll see in any movie. carey in particular is animated and outgoing, almost like a big kid - while johnson is a little calmer and wiser, kind of like an older-brother figure. i get a kick out of the scene where they sell the sheriff one of their 'gentle horses' for ten dollars; then inform him that the horse has "some peculiarities - you might say failings"... travis elbows sandy who lets loose with a shrill whistle, sending the sheriff's new horse off on a wild bucking fit with him in the saddle. the look on his face as the horse finally dumps him and gallops away is priceless.pay attention to the music... even if you never thought you'd be a fan of the sons of the pioneers, listen to "shadows in the dust" as the wagon train is shown in motion with some of the people walking along between the wagons. it's a truly beautiful song- too bad only half a minute or so of it is in the movie. i want to hear the whole thing sometime.one thing that impressed me greatly about this movie is that much of it must have been almost as hard to make as the real situation it portrays. teams of six horses pulling wagons up steep mountain trails, straining to make the top - this was no simple and easy film. it must have been risky for the actors, the stunt people and the animals as well. fording rivers too, this movie has plenty of authentic-looking action involving the movement of the wagon train. it should be mentioned that both harry carey jr. and ben johnson were extremely competent riders, both with many years' experience riding, roping, and doing all manner of cowboy-type things. carey grew up on a ranch where his family employed many navaho indians and in fact he learned to speak navaho before he learned to speak english. no rhinestone cowboys in this movie - "travis" and "sandy" were the real thing through and through.watch for the scene when miss denver throws out the pan of water from her wagon, hitting travis's horse in the face... the horse starts bucking, eventually throwing him off it. watch the look on sandy's face when denver tells travis 'i'm sorry you fell off your horse.' another favorite scene of mine is when harry carey jr. (sandy) gets into a bit of a tiff with one of the mormons. they're working back to back getting their gear ready, and after sandy gets disgusted with the other fellow, the two of them get into a rear-end bumping match that quickly turns into a rolling-around-on-the-ground fist fight. even after the elder (ward bond) stands them up and separates them, the two combatants continue trying to get at each other. the mormon (named 'jackson' in the film) gets one final kick in at sandy so high it hits his shoulder. it's a really funny scene from start to finish. i don't know what else i can say about this movie other than that it has a good story, very engaging characters, beautiful scenery and plenty of action balanced with humor and a bit of drama. oh, it has been colorized, at least in the version i saw; not the most beautiful color film you'll ever see but i think i prefer it to black and white. i give this one a ten and i don't give out many 10's. one of my favorite movies, without a doubt. and, judging by the other comments, i have plenty of company in that assessment.

this film has to be as near to perfect a film as john ford made. the film is magic, a masterpiece, the reason ford was, well ford. if you want to know why ford was great this one explains it.the photography of course is superb, black and white as black and white should be, wonderful shots, not an over the shoulder conversation in it, pure ford, great moments, big and little. the famous ripped pants of ward bond. apparently two dogs kept invading the set and fighting so ford wanted to use them in the fighting scene, but instead of fighting one dog ran away and the other attacked ward bond and ripped his pants, which caused ford no end of mirth. a whole scene around plaiting a rope. the way ben johnson burn then snuffs his rope, wonderful foreshadowing and anticipation of the final. harry carey's naive courting of prudence. the usual ford line about being scared and not showing it. bond's horse accidentally falling in him and its left in the film. johnson and bond are fantastic in that scene. lord help any ford actor who does not stay in character while the camera is rolling even when a horse falls on top of you.a couple of very sweet romances, not intruding on the whole focus, two very likable leads, not to mention for the girls, the number of times the cameras focus on ben johnson's rather delightful backside.lots of old time stuntmen getting lines and roles, cliff lyons, frank mcgrath. some wonderful character studies mostly of faces staring, all the villains and main stars. a set of villains to rival any group in any western.many many fordian shots of faces, groups, children, women, small things happening, foals in the background (ford seems to love images of foals), women in aprons, allowing the moment as wagons cross rivers and the camera lingers.this is probably not a western as much as an artist's picture that happens to be set in the west.lucky the film was made in 1950 because it is impossible to imagine such a film could be ever made again, but then it is such a work of art that it would be a sacrilege to attempt it

this film is about two horse traders who agree to escort a small group of mormons across the desert. along the way, they encounter a murderous family of thugs who menace the peaceful folks and put their pilgrimage in jeopardy.wagon master is what i would term a "little" john ford film, as it obviously did not have the budget or scope of some of his other westerns. in particular, this film lacks the big-name stars like john wayne but allows some of the usual supporting characters to take center stage. long-time ford stock character actors ben johnson, harry carey, jr. and ward bond have been elevated to starring roles and perhaps the one who came of as "the" lead was probably johnson--though the other two got nearly as much screen time and focus. this is not a bad thing, as the film worked just fine without the big star--and is well worth seeing.now this isn't to say i loved the movie. it was very good but certainly not perfect. in particular, as far as the music goes, you'll probably either love it or hate it. i found the sons of the pioneers' music a bit schmaltzy at times. it did evoke a nice mood, but seemed to occasionally dominate the scenes. i think a little would have worked much better. plus, with their incessant singing in the background, i kept expecting roy rogers to pop out at any moment. another minor problem is that the plot was amazingly simple and the ending was pretty much a foregone conclusion.however, and i am glad to say there is a 'however', despite this being rather formulaic and sentimental, the film still worked well. this was primarily due to john ford's nice, as usual, direction as well as ben johnson's exceptional performance. he was able to provide an excellent anchor for the film. another plus for me is that i saw this in the same week as brigham young, another film about the mormon migration. while brigham young was a bit silly and overly "saintly" in its portrayals, here the mormons were less "perfect" and more like real people--with foibles and personalities. oh, and speaking of brigham young, it seems as if jane darwell was the 'go to' girl for mormon-themed films during this era, as she was a major supporting character in both films. considering that she died in brigham young and it was set about 20 years before wagon master, this is some stunt!also, if you'd like to catch a glimpse of the famous jim thorpe, he's in a tiny role where he plays the impassive indian dancing next to jane darwell around the camp fire.

wagon master (1950) dir: john ford production: argosy pictures / rko radio pictures john ford brings the stock company out into the utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. no john wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.this ensemble piece nominally stars ben johnson (as travis) and harry carey jr. (sandy). they're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of mormons, led by ward bond, are being shown the exit. the group is about to embark on a trek to their own settlement, but they know the odds and the harsh terrain are against them. so they hire travis and sandy as wagon masters for their trip. along the way they run into and take along a traveling medicine salesman and his two female cohorts (alan mowbray as the doctor, recalling his appearance in my darling clementine and joanne dru as his "daughter"). tension is added when the murderous clegg gang comes upon the wagon train. and there is also an atypical (for hollywood) meeting with the navajo.most of the story and humor is driven by the clash of ideals/cultures; first between travis and sandy and the mormons, between ward bond himself (he's constantly trying to suppress his urge to curse and be a reformed man), between the doctor and his ladies and the mormons, between the wagon train and the outlaws, and finally, everyone and the navajo. there is also a classic ford scene of a rowdy dance which expresses one of his signature themes of civilization coming to the frontier.again, no duke here, but i've found ben johnson, especially the young, cocksure ben johnson, to have an engaging screen presence of his own. he comes with his own backstory, with that drawl and also when you see him doing all the stunt riding himself. he's great here in one of his early credited appearances. harry carey jr., although having been around for a few years by this time, is still pretty raw at times, but he's likable. ward bond is his usual marvelous, blustery self. i've found joanne dru to be a drag in whatever i see her in, but here she's mercifully unobtrusive. other familiar faces include jane darwell, francis ford and hank worden, playing 'dumb', like he will in the searchers a few years later. it's not any more amusing here.there is some absolutely spectacular b&w photography by frequent ford collaborator bert glennon. not only is there the typical masterclass on the landscapes and horizons, there is also some flourish in a handful of scenes with shadow and (sun)light. the soundtrack features the legendary country music group, the sons of the pioneers. can't get more cowboy than that.***½ out of 4

a couple of cowpokes help a group of mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. this low-key western is unusual for ford in that it lacks any big stars. johnson gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and carey work well together. dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. the best performance is given by ford favorite bond, playing the leader of the mormons. in fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running tv western "wagon train" before his untimely death at age 57. featuring beautiful cinematography, ford regarded this as one of his favorite films.

the western can be divided into many sub-genres. one of the broadest divisions is that between town westerns and plains westerns. most westerns are a mix of both, but at one end of the spectrum you have pictures like high noon and rio bravo that take place almost entirely in a settlement, seldom venturing out into the real outdoors. at the other end you have ones like wagon master, where there is barely a homestead on view amid the wilderness.director john ford normally thrived on the "bit of both" westerns, shooting the interiors with an emphasis on their being small and confined, and then contrasting this with the wide open exteriors, which appeared both exciting and dangerous. wagon master has a typical frank nugent script, with some interplay between seasoned oldsters and green youngsters, but still it presents ford with some fresh challenges. in this picture, the dangers do not come from the harshness of the landscape, they come from within the group in the form of the cleggses. what's more, the absence of real interior scenes means the outdoors could lose its impact over time.however, ford was a real maestro when it came to manipulating space. he shoots scenes of the camp or the wagons so the frame is surrounded and we get that same sense of enclosure as we would in a genuine interior. also, compared to his other westerns, he does not in fact open out the space too much, having the wagon trail wend its way through canyons and passes rather than cross the stark and empty plains. one of the few moments where he does throw the landscape wide open is when the indians are spotted and there is the possibility of a threat from outside.wagon master features some surprisingly effective moments of comic relief, and some great contributions from the quirky cast. harry carey jr. was shaping up into a fine actor like his pa, and this is one of his better early roles. joanne dru was disappointing in she wore a yellow ribbon, but she appears more at ease as a character with a bit of sass, and is actually fairly good here. jane darwell, who won an oscar in the john ford-directed grapes of wrath a decade earlier, appears here with sole function of performing a running gag in which she sounds a feeble old horn. still, with her great timing and movement she makes the piece work. francis ford, in one of the many mute drunkard roles he played in his little brother's pictures, is at his cheeky best.and now we come to lead man ben johnson. although he was by no means a bad actor, he was never going to become a big star like john wayne. and yet, with his effortless horsemanship and easygoing drawl, he was one of the most authentically "west" players around. and this brings me onto my final point. this was apparently one of ford's personal favourites, despite it seeming fairly unassuming. wagon master has no grand theme or dramatic intensity, it is simply the genre playing itself out. i think this is what ford loved about it. it's a picture for the ben johnsons and the harry carey jrs, not the john waynes or the henry fondas. small in scope, but worthy in its class.

although i liked this western,i do have to say,it's not one of my favourite john ford westerns.for me,it just lacks a certain something that most of his other films(the ones i have seen anyway)possess)i'm nit sure what that something is.it's not something tangible.anyway,the gist of the story is about a mormon wagon train which is being used by a band of outlaws as a hideout from a pursuing posse.ford employs a lot of his regulars here.there are some interesting characters,some nice scenery,a bit of action,and excitement.it all adds up to a watchable experience.it's certainly not boring.just not quite up to the usual john ford standard.for me,wagon master is a 7/10

watching the wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great ford films, like the searchers, my darling clementine, the man who shot liberty valance, and the grapes of wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. the story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of mormons get to california. along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some navajos. there's a lot of adventure and excitement on the trail, and the film is imbued with fun and beauty. the music is absolutely beautiful. the scenery, again from monument valley, is as beautiful as it ever was. plus, how can you go wrong with james arness? the wagonmaster might not be one of john ford's better known films, but it is nonetheless a must-see if you get the chance. 9/10.

it has been recorded that john ford made the "big, blockbuster" movies so that he could afford to make the "small" movies that he loved so well. wagon master, with a young ben johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. the location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains indian are all trade marks of ford. as in many of his other films, eisenstein, the great russian director's influence is seen in this film. the supporting cast including ward bond, russell simpson, and jane darwell are excellent as well as the many, minor character actors ford used, including his brother (the one who plays the drums). while ben johnson went on to win a well-deserved supporting oscar for the last picture show, his co-star, harry carey,jr. did not reach those heights. although his father, carey, sr. became a western leading man in ford's early films, carey, jr. spent most of his career in supporting roles. for fans of john ford, and for fans of western films, this one is a must.

travis and sandy(ben johnson and harry carey, jr.)are horse traders coerced into selling their animals to a mormon group and guiding them across the frontier to a settlement. what they do not expect is to encounter the notorious clegg murderers, with their wounded leader uncle shiloh(charles kemper). ward bond portrays elder wiggs, the main voice for the mormon group moving the wagon train to the lord's destination. along the way, they also encounter "doctor" a locksley hall and his "hoochey koochey wagon" and lend them help.lovingly directed by ford who pays close attention to detail with realistic problems any group would encounter during a rugged wagon trail. the film has a wonderful cast made up of character actors with nary a true star in the film which is actually a blessing to see, if just not for a change of pace. young johnson and carey, jr. come off real well, but this is bond's film to shine as he has the best lines. johnson is the one who seems to understand ruffians and brutes like shiloh and will certainly come in handy when certain conflict might develop as the clegg boys ride along side them a piece.i'd have to say this is one of his best and most least appreciated westerns and seems to flow very well.

two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. the scenes of the corral in the town where ward bond and ben johnson negotiate prices, and bond introduces the idea of them (johnson and his partner played by harry carey jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with bond. once on the trail they come upon joanne dru, who maybe john ford saw in red river, and offered her a much better part in this film. in the morman train are a number of notable characters. the mormans are a peaceable group who are challenged along the way by a truly lowlife group of outlaws. in their case (the outlaws), in the case of the people on the train, and later a band of navajos whom they encounter, and in the well written characters played by ben johnson and ward bond, the film completely evades stereotypes, while the camera seems to spend as much time giving the viewer the big picture of monument valley framing the train as it moves along with a few water crossings along the way, in stunning black and white and then coming back to what's happening in this rolling community, all to the accompaniment of the beautiful vocalizations of the sons of the pioneers.

together with the even more underrated , the sun shines bright, wagon master was one of ford's favorite films. it is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well acted by members of ford's 'stock company', including jane darwell, alan mowbray, ward bond,and harry carey, jr.like almost all of ford's films,it is a meditation on freedom and community. it is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of indians than in most of ford's movies. ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of american democracy.

one of my favorite westerns and one of john ford's best in my opinion. no major stars, but ben johnson shines in most everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. matching him is ward bond as the crusty mormon elder leading his people west. john ford's stock of character actors, including harry carey, jr., jane darwell, russell simpson and hank worden, provide ample support, as does eerily silent james arness, a member of the outlaw clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train. the mormon trail into utah was one of the most arduous and demanding enterprises ever undertaken. we can't really get the feel of that, but we do see ordeals that had to be overcome by pioneers on the way west; river crossings, long stretches of dry, waterless desert, encounters with indians and the like, all set to glorious song by the sons of the pioneers. the mormons actually did dig sections of the trail with picks and shovels, as depicted in the movie. my main regret is that it wasn't made in color, but i believe there is a colorized version. by the way, those craggy rocks featured in various scenes are called the fisher towers, located near moab. highly recommended viewing.

this little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. because it was a little picture, john ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs. he was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. he was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. some of them such as ben johnson had been discovered by ford and given opportunity to show their talents. johnson was recruited by ford because he was an authentic cowboy from oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work. years later he would win the coveted academy award for his brilliant performance in "the last picture show." ward bond even outshines ben johnson in this movie. he is not the wagon master, that role is played by johnson, but because of this movie he was later given the role of wagon master in the classic television series "wagon train." ironically one of the bad guys in "wagon master," james arness, would star in the hit television series "gunsmoke" on a rival network to "wagon train." ward bond plays the leader of the mormons heading west who often backslides to his sinning days by cussing only to be called down by fellow mormon adam perkins (russell simpson). when any bothersome situation arises elder wiggs (ward bond) yells, "blow your horn, sister ledeyard!" the mormon sister, played to perfection by jane darwell, then blows so hard and loud that even the devil must have been shaken by the sound. darwell and simpson were famous for playing ma and pa joad in ford's classic version of the john steinbeck novel "the grapes of wrath."another of the great character actors in ford's company was hank worden, who plays one of uncle shiloh clegg's notoriously mean but not too bright outlaw sons. worden would become famous a few years later for playing mose in ford's "the searchers." worden lived to be 91. he was still making movies when he died.the wagon master travis blue (ben johnson) and his partner sandy (harry carey jr.) are horse traders who never take their job seriously, having a lot of fun along the way, especially with the local sheriff. they get mixed up with a mormon wagon train heading west. ford's beloved monument valley is the setting for most of the film. the main reason for the teaming is a redheaded mormon beauty prudence perkins (kathleen o'malley) who catches sandy's eye. along the way the train picks up a hoochie coochie show which includes a charlatan doctor (alan mowbray) and two soiled angels (joanne dru and ruth clifford). also joining up along the way is the clegg family, wanted for murder and armed robbery. ford shows how arduous a journey west by wagon was in those days. the songs in the film were written by stan jones of the legendary sons of the pioneers. jones' writing was almost as good as that of bob nolan, who had previously done much of the writing for the group. jones' most famous song, not in this film, is the much recorded "ghost riders in the sky." the sons of the pioneers do the background singing in "wagon master." this adds to the overall impact of wagons rolling west.it should also be noted that the acclaimed native american athlete jim thorpe from oklahoma plays the role of a navajo leader. this was his last film appearance. he died not long after "wagon master" was released.

in crystal city, a group of mormons hire the horse traders travis (ben johnson) and sandy (harry carey jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to san juan river. along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack dr. a. locksley hall (alan mowbray) and the prostitutes denver (joanne dru) and fleuretty phyffe (ruth clifford). then the sadistic outlaws clegg boys decide to join the mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the sheriff of crystal city that is chasing them. when the navajos cross their path, they are invited to visit their hamlet for a dancing party. when the wagon train is near to their destination, the clegg boys threaten the settlers, forcing sandy and travis to take an attitude."wagon master" is another great western of john ford. the sequences with the wagon train crossing the desert and the hills are impressive. the adventure of the group of mormons is funny and very entertaining and the songs fit well to the plot despite being dated. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "caravana dos bravos" ("caravan of the braves")

it takes a while to get adjusted to the sound of sons of the pioneers , but then you thoroughly enjoy it. if the soundtrack would be played by an orchestra like max steiner or dmitri tiomkin it would lose its folkloric character. the music conducts the film, everything seems to follow its rhythm. the whole cast is excellent. ben johnson and harry carey jr. are the young men guiding the caravan. ward bond is the mormon leader and joanne dru is a flirting actress. ford was able to make of what would be an ordinary western, something totally different and original showing us the music, the dances, and most of all, the people.

wagon master is a very unique film amongst john ford's work. mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by john ford himself, the story that was elaborated by frank nugent and director's son  patrick ford and turned into a screenplay, and because of director's personal opinion regarding it, wagon master is the film john ford called the one which `came closest to being what i had wanted to achieve', to say so is not to say a little, but as ford confessed once to lindsay anderson, his favourite was nonetheless my darling clementine and not any other. wagon master has all ingredients one might expect to find in a john ford's film. wonderful cast delivering his best, thou not featuring any major stars, except the most `fordian' of all actors  ben johnson. very peculiar small characters, who provide an obligatory comic relief, and wagon master has quite a few of them such as horn blowing sister ledyard (jane darwell) in her shot but very inspired gigs. and last but not least legendary monument valley with john ford's fifth passage through it after stagecoach, my darling clementine, fort apache and she wore a yellow ribbon. the film starts with two friends cowboys travis blue (ben johnson) and sandy owens (harry carey jr) being hired to be wagon masters or guides for a caravan of mormon settlers who are headed to silver valley, a place that's for them like a promised land. on their way they are joined by a very peculiar dr. locksley hall (alan mowbray) with two beautiful women, who are supposedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors. they are headed in the same direction simply because they were recently driven out of the nearest town and have no other place to go. nothing particularly unpleasant happens till they bump into cleggs, a dangerous family gang consisting of father and his three sons who are on the run from the marshal of the town where they recently committed murder and bank robbery. overall wagon master is no more nor less than one more precious pearl in a necklace of john ford's wonderful westerns. a must see. 9/10

this film blew me away. i thought i knew a little about the attica prison riot. after watching this, i see i knew nothing. the story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate. both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting. the flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. it's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real. it was not only a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in american history. i'm with ebert and roeper. i give it two thumbs up.

the killing yard is a great film, although uneven at times. morris chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate, and the presence of alan alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. the emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's "flashback" scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured. i was not even born when the attica riot took place, however, through extensive research, i find that "the killing yard" does the story all of it's fair justices. i would definitely recommend this film for viewing by any educational or activist group as a much needed learning tool.

usually, alan alda plays characters that are too "soft" and overly verbal -- it's probably how he really lives. this time, he fits the character. though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered.the 1971 attica prison riot and the state of new york's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. only a few journalists have told the true story. this film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the attica riot/revolt. attica had a major impact on this country. maybe the movie will stimulate someone to research the history.i can't remember a feature movie made from the perspective of the prisoners -- though there is a great pbs piece with the actual attica survivors/participants. the perspective of the guards held hostage is explored in "against the wall" with kyle maclachlan, samuel l. jackson, clarence williams iii, and frederic forrest.back in the day, we shouted, "attica! attica!" it was nice to hear it in the movie. brought back memories.the worst part of the movie are the natural wigs morris chestnut and the other african americans must wear. it would have been easy for these people to grow a 'fro.

i really like this show. it has drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one. i am 28 and i am a married mother, so i can identify both with lorelei's and rory's experiences in the show. i have been watching mostly the repeats on the family channel lately, so i am not up-to-date on what is going on now. i think females would like this show more than males, but i know some men out there would enjoy it! i really like that is an hour long and not a half hour, as th hour seems to fly by when i am watching it! give it a chance if you have never seen the show! i think lorelei and luke are my favorite characters on the show though, mainly because of the way they are with one another. how could you not see something was there (or take that long to see it i guess i should say)? happy viewing!

gilmore girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, wit, and charm. at age 16 lorelai gilmore gave birth to rory gilmore. she left her parents house and got a job. now, lorelai and rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. they are best friends. the girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and tv shows, and are constantly quoting them. in the first season, lorelai needs money to send rory to chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents. they are happy to give them the money, but in exchange, rory has to come have dinner with them every friday night. i highly recommend this show. i love it!

i'm not the type of person to watch t.v. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or too dramatic! but this show is perfect. everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. everyone has their own personality and lorelai gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. rory gilmore is a good role model for all girls. she takes pride in wanting to attend harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. she's a loyal friend and always the peace maker. there's subtle romance which is what i like, personally. not the mushy gushy romance that not many people get to have in their lives, but a realistic type of romance. every character eventually gets it, and they don't find their prince charming at first glance and they don't just "fall in love" with every guy that comes their way. it's a realistic show but when you watch it, you better brush up on your movies, pop culture, and random facts because lorelai gilmore is always making references. i fell in love with this show and if you give it a chance, so will you.

gilmore girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows i've ever watched, (second only to my most favorite television show of all time, f*r*i*e*n*d*s). the quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. just some random comments, i recently (finally) began watching season 6 and wow! it's one of my favorite seasons so far. i love the luke-lorelai thing and all the drama in the various episodes is (as always) exhilarating. the only thing i'm not so fond of is the surprising bad attitude and reckless actions rory has suddenly 'adopted'. unfortunately i don't find this very realistic and hope it's not just a way to stir up some more drama to keep the season going strong. all in all great season though and i can't wait for the next!!!~ ashly a.k.a. "tookie clothespin"

hands down, the best drama/comedy show on television. a cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. lorelai gilmore (lauren graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. rory gilmore (alexis bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both. with the help of luke danes(scott patterson) and sookie st.james(melissa mccarthy) and an enormous variety of other hilarious characters, this show easily remains one of my favorites. what really puts the show over the top is the complex yet, incredible and witty writing often using references from pop culture to the mink dynasty.

this show is really great. it's smart.it's funny.it's great acting and writing. this show is really the fastest show i've ever seen. the dialogues are really funny and well acted. lauren graham and alexis bledel have a great chemistry.you really do believe they are mother and daughter. this show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with lorelai and emily. just watch this show i highly recommend it.it's great and definitely the best show on the air. season 7 stars tuesday september 26th, 2006, 8/7c on the new the cw

people need to give this show a chance. the people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes. one needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. all of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. they make mistakes, but they are realistic mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. also, for the most part the acting is superb. lauren graham has been snubbed of an emmy for six years now. someone needs to give this woman the credit she deserves. same goes for kelly bishop who plays emily gilmore so perfectly. also, it's nice to see a show that can have a young girl at the center of it, and not be filled with teen angst. rory is a smart girl, which is also not seen a lot on television today. if only other shows could capture the wholeness of this show...

i have watched this show from the beginning, and i am a 45 year old man. to me, this is so much more that a show that appeals to women. this is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family none the less. it centers around a mother and daughter, lorelei and rory gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. lorelei makes her home in fictional stars hollow, ct, a small new england town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family. the show also throws in the relationship between lorelei and her parents, richard and emily gilmore, old money dar wasp people who do not approve of lorelei's choices in life, though lorelei doesn't care. the relationships story and through line are what makes this show, in my opinion the finest on the wb network (soon to be the cw). watch this show!

when the gilmore girls started in germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique. it was a series and i even did not know someone in it. later on, i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard (a movie, i absolutely adore). i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time. i do not do these things all the time but when i do these things i feel a little bit like a gilmore girl. even my boyfriend started to watch them and that tells something. from season to season it got better with the scripts and the stories. they have a open mind and by being different from every other show, you want to be like them.

this is a really great series. i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet. it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mom and me. ya for gilmore girls. um, i'm running out of lines. but i love how luke and lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they so needed to be together. and i absolutely just love sookie st. james! she is so awesome . and the show wouldn't be anywhere without michel. the whole show is dry humor, sarcasm, and life in a very small town where everyone knows each other....especially the gilmore girls.

wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, lauren graham and alexis bledel! they're simply wonderful! i'm especially a big admirer of lauren graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a "monster" of an actress as well! i'm not saying that alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like lauren better! anyway it's a real delight seeing them on screen, "sparing" with words! in the words of the immortal jim carrey "b-e-a-utiful!"

honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it everyday on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the lorelei's are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it's an hour long which is a major plus because you can't ever get enough gilmore! even in one hour.. emily and richard gilmore are kicks (loralie's parents, rory's grandparents) they're you're average rich parents.. emily president of the dar and richard a well known lawyer and yale alumni st.. rory is following in the footsteps of her grandparents and this could not make them any happier, of course, rory's mother is so very proud of her but her whole life has worked on ultimately defying her parents and rory going to yale did not help her on that journey but believe me, every episode she does get closer ;)

the idea of young girl, who gets pregnant at the age of 16 is nothing new to the drama genre. but it is pretty new if you take a look at the comedy genre. there is this basic plot of lorelai and rory, mother and daughter. lorelai comes from a wealthy background, got pregnant with 16 and ran away from her parents' house at 17. but this series does not start there, it starts when rory is 16 and everything is just about the problems of a single mother, who has terrible problems with her parents and about all those problems you have when you are 16.okay, now again this sounds pretty normal, but there is this little thing called joke. the gilmore girls talk incredibly fast and they make like 60 jokes a minute. even if you don't understand all of the jokes, since they contain hundreds of references to films, music, gossip, history, literature and politics. sometimes you even get confused, but that really is the fun. and not only it is fast, it's smart and wonderfully sarcastic. in addition to that it is not only funny, it has great drama parts in it and you can take some lessons from it even home. which is a thing that does not go for every single tv- series.so watch it! it'll lighten your mood and help you through hard decisions!

this is definitely an excellent show. i don't have cable, so i started renting them, because my friend recommended it. i thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that kind of thing. but it was not. it is surprisingly deep. it is also very witty. it moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. it is a comedy-drama, which is rare when well done. it is about rory and lorelai's relationship. instead of the classic mother-daughter relationship it is a story of the best friend relationship-- about a mother and daughter. the characters are perfectly cast and all do a superb job. it is definitely the best tv show i have very come across.

i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love gilmore girls! i've gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like lorelei. my friends say that i talk and act like lorelei. lorelei and rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it. my vocabulary has widened from watching gilmore girls. lauren graham and alexis bled el are perfect for the parts of lorelei and rory. i think luke and lorelai should get married because chris has left lorelei and rory way too many times. and has broken lorelei's heart too many times too.

it's the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! i just love them!! i watch it every day! i have the episodes from the internet! here in romania is being broadcast the 6 season! i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season. until now, season 5 is my favorite one :d i love it because logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. i have liked dean too, but logan is best. i would like lorelai to remain with christopher, because he is beautiful. this show is good for all ages and is worth to be seen. i really want the dvd's but i think that here in romania will never appear, because i think that they don't even know that they have fans here. but, no matter what, i'll be watching it. bye!!

i didn't catch gilmore girls when it first came out, so still doing some catch-up on the first season. i read through most of the users comments and for the negative ones, i have to ask, what show are you watching??this show is a classic, great lines, characters and good acting. and best of all, not your standard formula show always with an occasional twist to the story. there are probably more women who see themselves reflected in the lorelai/emily relationship then in the lorelai/rory relationship. the people and storylines are not pc but they are real!!if you find the dialogue annoying, i suggest you tape the show, so you can rewatch the parts don't understand.

obsessed!!!!! i have every season of gilmore girls and i think the reason i love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. and its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. i think gilmore girls is one of the bests shows on t.v. shows of its time. its fun because they talk so fast you can't get everything the first time its nice to go back and laugh at the other jokes. also they have so many references its amazing how smart it is.and you can relate to the characters also their so real and there actors are superb from the witty lorelai to the hermit luke to the immature kirk the show is just amazing. i definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and spend sometime with there family this is definitely the show for them. there is only one word that can describe gilmore girls....classic!!!!!!

every time i watch this show i just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. the dialogs, or monologues rather, as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. for example, the episode i watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (i forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the gilmore family dinner into all-out war. and these were just the few seconds or so.so it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content. the scripts they use must be enormous.but then every once in a while something happens. the babbling stops and suddenly there are these wonderful silent, emotional moments. for example, this week it was lorelai's breakdown at the estate agent's. i just thought it was the best piece of tv i have seen for a long while.almost makes everything worthwhile.

i have been hooked on "gg" since midway through 2001-2002 (2nd season), when i tuned in to see "smallville" 10 minutes early. thanks to "beginnings", i now have all but 2 episodes on tape, right up through last night (ep. 4.9). i am a middle-aged straight male, and this is the only weekly tv show i watch. i love this series because: a) lauren graham is a damn fine-looking woman, and funny and smart to boot; b) the dialogue is extremely well-written; c) it is flat-out hilarious, putting overrated garbage like "everybody loves raymond" to shame. many current tv comedies have been heavily influenced by the highly successful and much-despised slime-pit known as "married with children", where the viewer is encouraged to deride and feel superior to the characters. in "gg", the characters have faults, but we can see our own foibles in them, and laugh with them, not at them. this is stimulating tv, where the writers challenge us to keep up with rapid-fire exchanges and out-of-left-field pop-culture/literature/current events references. i get immense pleasure out of watching these episodes over and over again, catching all the one-liners and references to previous episodes. stars hollow is its own little world, one that i will happily continue to visit as long as the series runs.

i absolutely fell in love with this girls. let me tell you something: i am from romania and here is only the sixth series running bunt every other day that is on usa tv i check the internet and download it from there, so i am in line with the rest of the world. i can not believe how deep i am in this show. i become to know absolutely everything about them i looked on the internet what's rory's car what are their middle names and stuff like that: rory is also leigh and lorelay is victoria. i can not understand why but my boyfriend does not like them and i try and try to make him see how wonderful they are but without success, but he does understand me and lets me be with my "obsesion" with the gilmore girls. i adore them. i really hope that if someone see's this will give them a try : you won't regret it

this show is my absolute favorite. this show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. lauren graham is perfect as lorelai gilmore, a single mother who is rory's best friend. alexis bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent rory gilmore and keiko agena is one of a kind as rory's best friend, lane kim. i love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. kelly bishop is wicked great as emily gilmore and edward herrman is terrific as richard gilmore. scott patterson is a joy as luke danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch. the community, miss patty, babette, mrs. kim, taylor doose, kirk and other's are always laugh out loud funny, quirky and interesting that always makes the snappy one-liners stand out. this show has changed so much over the years that it won't ever get old. gilmore girls is an original and clever show that keeps you watching. that is how good it is. i give this show a 10/10 rating.

gilmore girls is my favorite tv show of all times. they only aired the first 2 seasons in india but i've watched the rest on dvd or read it online. it's very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist isn't sneaking around her mother's back but has an open relationship with her. the chemistry between lauren graham and alexis bledel who play lorelai and her daughter rory is really great. all the acting is excellent and the characters, though extremely quirky, are still believable. the residents of stars hollow show all the amusing bizarreness of small town life, which is contrasted by the endless snobbishness and social norms that make up the high society life of lorelai's parents. on one hand there are dance-athons and firelight festival's while on the hand you have cotillions, dar meetings and cocktail parties. all the character's develop a lot and there's a happy ending for more or less everybody. there are dramatic elements but also a lot of very witty humor. rory's boyfriends are all incredibly hot as are her friend lane's. basically it's a cool, funny, very satisfying show which encompasses all the aspects of life and gives you a feeling of -if you work hard enough and wait patiently, you'll get what you want even if it wasn't what you intended.

the gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. sharing everything, trusting each other completely.i like the gilmore girls but i am not sure why. the mother, named lorelai (lauren graham), and the daughter, named rory (short for lorelai, played by alexis bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. there are some funny supporting characters, such as luke (scott patterson). he and lorelai like each, may be even love each other, but neither of them really acts on it. they have their little moments. there are some other supporting characters, most of them very funny, and with their won touching moments.what i like the most i think is to see the relationship between the young mother and the daughter who is becoming an adult. the dialogue between them is quick, sharp, funny and sometimes touching as well. the band they have is beautiful. the gilmore girls makes you feel good so try it.

fuckland is an interesting film. i personally love the dogma movement. i wish it had lasted longer. it seems to have already died. many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. i don't know why. it's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the french new wave. besides fuckland, i've seen the first three in the series, festen, idioterne, and mifune. they were all great, festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. fuckland isn't up to those others. i was just fascinated with the filmmaking. it's played as if it were a real documentary, with a real person who was so obsessed with his camera that he refused to put it down. at a few points in the film, it becomes clear that it is a work of complete fiction, but that illusion was protracted for an amazing amount of time. i wish that the filmmakers would have come up with something a bit more interesting to put onscreen. it is basically about this guy, fabian, who is an argentinian visiting the faulkland islands. argentinians were only in the last couple of months allowed onto the islands, and fabian plans to impregnate the women with argentinian children. he sets his eyes on one, and most of the movie is spent on her seduction. the two actors are very natural. camilla heany only kind of hints that she is an actress. fabian stratas seems completely real. the politics of the film are somewhat confusing to me, since i have only an inkling of the situation surrounding the island and its recent history. i was 3, i think, when the faulklands were invaded. the final bit of the film doesn't work at all. i don't get what the filmmakers were going for there. still, fuckland is an interesting dogma experiment. it does break some dogma rules, though, notably the no extra-diagetic music rule. there is a lot of that. 7/10.

text taken from 2001 melbourne international film fest guide.fuckland the title is a pun based on the film's lead actor fabian stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.fabian is an argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. his master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the delicious camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half argentinians. fuckland creates the illusion of a documentary and maintains a fish-eyed perspective that gives the film a voyeuristic flair and intimacy.

this is a truly great film, with excellent direction. the core plot element, the painting of mila's ass is captivating. i really can't express in words just how much i enjoyed watching mila getting her ass painted repeatedly.connor

i can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but i can say that i enjoyed it. if there is a god, the sound track will be released, ilona sekacz' work is truly enduring. twenty years on i am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.the story surrounds the entry into society of catherine moreland. somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in gothic stories (early pulp fiction?), catherine descends on bath in the company of mrs allen where she meets henry tilney. she is invited to visit the tilneys at northanger abbey, the seat of the formidable (and somewhat financially challenged) general tilney, who has the unfortunate misconception that there is wealth afoot.where mutual attraction mixes with family finance, dispute is inevitable. this coupled with catherines vivid imagination, leads her to fear for her safety. her eventual departure is marred by accusations and counter accusations of deception and connivance.but the attraction between catherine and henry stands these trials. he returns to provide a happy ending. this final scene is especially compelling, given the incidental music of ilona sekacz.it may well be a "bad" production from the purists viewpoint, gaudy costumes and shaky performances not withstanding, but for me it's 88 minutes of bliss.

i got this movie with my bbc "jane austen collection" (5 dvds of old bbc adaptations) and didn't like it at first. it's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so i thought, one of the qualities that i enjoy in all other austen movies: cheerful common sense. the nightmare scene in which mrs. richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.i still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but i do love hearing mrs. r. saying, dreamily, while she sews, "my only acquaintance...tore my gown." this movie is now my current austen favorite. i've watched it 7 or 8 times so far. the acting, to my mind, is incredible. the way i notice good acting is when i find myself looking up from whatever i'm doing (sewing, though not my fingers together, hopefully, or boondoggling or whatever) in order to watch the character deliver his lines. it's the turn of expression, the cast of posture, that make the words come alive -- that's what makes good acting, as far as i'm concerned.well, i watch almost every part of "northanger abbey" because almost all the actors play their roles with such charisma. peter firth is amazing as mr. tilney, the perfect blend of bathian fop and real, masculine hero - you're not sure until the end whether he's after catherine's money or not. i love his touch of (welsh?) accent. mr. and mrs. richards are charming: the combination of their behaviors - especially mr. richards' high voice, lending counterpoint to his wit and wisdom - makes them so real. general tilney as the hard-hearted father who may possibly be a murderer is fascinating, too. and captain tilney, the grinning rake who is so clearly enjoying himself... and the moneygrubbing sister and brother whose names i can't currently remember - the two of them are so perfectly, at once, smart and smarmy.the other reason i love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all the jane austen adaptations. i know this was one of austen's weak points (well, it is as far as i am concerned): even though all her novels are love stories, it's hard to feel that her heroes and heroines are really in love at the end. and if they're aren't really in love, then what's the point? all the other adaptations i've seen (other than the early olivier/garson one) have pretty cold-fish kisses at the end, if they kiss at all. i don't at all like sex in movies but it really is necessary to have a heartfelt kiss in the end. and the ending kiss in northanger is a doozy.the over-the-top approach to costumes, music, and lighting work very well as far as i'm concerned. and the script is extremely clever - the way we are educated about gothic romance, highlife in bath, cathy's normal country upbringing, etc., is very well done, as they usually are in bbc productions. also, i like the part when the little black page does the cartwheels. and the marchionesse, i think, was an entirely appropriate and very clever expository device.some people have objected that this version is the opposite of what jane austen intended to do in northanger abbey - she meant to make fun of gothic romance, not promote it. but i don't think she meant to put "mysteries of udolpho," etc., down. she was just making the point that you need to distinguish between reality and fiction. and this point is made when mr. tilney chides catherine in his mother's room. besides, general tilney was a villain, albeit a prosaic one. that point was meant to be made, surely.

although it strays away from the book a little, you can't help but love the atmospheric music and settings.the scenes in bath are just how they should be. although if you have watched it as many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene, but that aside, i like the scene where they are in the hot baths, but did the men and women really bathe together like that? you could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women. it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on, but perhaps this was the style at the time. the ballroom scenes were very nice, the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful. i especially liked catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene.northanger abbey looked suitably imposing, but i enjoyed the bath scenes better.schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as catherine morland. googie withers gives the best performance as mrs allen i feel.ugh peter firth as mr tilney, he just talks a load of rubbish, and is not a clergyman as he should be, it's hard to think of him being in love with catherine, but then the book never really gave that impression either.general tilney is played reasonably well by hardy, and stuart also gives a sort of good performance as isabella. ingrid lacey did not give a good performance as elinor tilney. as for john thorpe, well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but i quite like it.i can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me. the marchioness! i hate her. she is not part of the northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy.some of the script is peculiar. when catherine is asking elinor tilney about her mothers death she asks "i suppose you saw the body? how did it appear?" what a silly thing to say! elinor's calm response is stupid too.anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me

i'm a fan of independent film. dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it's at for me. some of the other posts are right: "wannabes" isn't going to rival "the godfather" for best mob film ever. on the other hand, "wannabes" is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. my problem with one of the other reviews:- conor dubin stands out as the only irishman in a cast of italians- dubin is a jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an irishman. he doesn't stand out at all, rather, delivers a great performance.this didn't win many awards, but it is deserving of a saturday night with a bowl of popcorn. i found it for 7 bucks at blockbuster and was pleasantly surprised to say the least! highly recommended.

heath ledgers acting in this film really bugs me, but overall its a great watch. bryan brown is excellent when i dont normally like him, but then his whole gang are a great piece of work. jimmy is a hapless wannabe gangster who cant seem to do a thing right (spoilers: loses pandos money, ackos car and nearly bumbles a bank robbery) but still comes out on top.didnt know what the two kids were in it for at the start but they ties some storylines together nicely.all in all a damn fine piece of australian cinema 9/10

the movie is made in a style that resembles lock, stock and two smoking barrels, with lot's of subplots, fancy camerawork, cool music and that great tongue-in-cheek aussie type of humor you'll find nowhere else. how this movie has escaped the european and american audience is a mystery!

a gritty australian film, with all the elements for success. two hands represents the ability of australian film makers and actors to produce top-quality, popular material. the film has a fresh angle, and uniquely incorporates drama, suspense and comedy.i found this film thoroughly enjoyable on so many different levels - but can also appreciate that it might not be everyone's 'cup of tea'. the film carries a distinct aussie humour, as it portrays the seedy underworld of sydney, and explores the lives of a young man (ledger) and young woman (byrne), swept up in the local crime scene.two hands deals with the theme of good and evil, both on an interpersonal and personal level and looks at the issue of consequences for 'our' actions.the camera work is snazzy and the dialogue humorous. with bryan brown who plays pando and heath ledger as jimmy, battling it out on-screen in the most bizarre situations - this aussie film is certainly not short of acting talent.this subtle action/comedy has become somewhat of a cult favourite, and one of mine also.

this movie gives you more of an idiea how australians act. even though the castle is a great australian movie, it's a bit out there. this movie is by far the best aussie flick i have seen (haven't seen dirty deeds yet) and probably would be my favourite movie. the point is, if you haven't seen it, go see it. if a crime/action/comedy is your thing.

before i start my review here is a quick lesson in australian slang which may help you with viewing the movie and understanding some of the other reviews from australia and overseas.in australian slang "thongs" are a pair of rubber sandals (not to be confused with the same american word that pertains to butt revealing underwear), "stubbies" are a brand of australian short, a "stubby" is a small can sized bottle of beer, and a "stubby holder" is a foam insulator for a small bottle of beer.if you love black comedies about smalltime criminals then you will love this movie, unfortunatley a lot of people on imdb with weak stomachs and no appreciation of dark humour have reviewed this movie which unfortunately makes this movie appear to be more mediocre than what it is. a lot of reviewers have also compared it to lock/stock and pulp fiction, while it is the same genre, it is a completely different and original style.a lot of reviewers have also panned this movie for using heath ledger's characters dead brother to open and guide the narrative for this movie, without watching the movie closely enough to realise that his brother was killed by the same villain that wishes to kill heaths character, this is explained midway through the movie but not clearly enough for most to understand.this movie is also reminiscent of lock/stock and reservoir dogs in that it is the director/writers debut feature, and for a debut feature it rates as well as these two movies, as a matter of fact like lock/stock and reservoir dogs i rate this movie as a 10/10 for a director/writers debut, unfortunately unlike tarantino and ritchie jordan fails to live up to expectations in his subsequent movies like ned kelly.this movie is one that you should definitely add to your dvd collection and is one that holds up to several viewings quite easily.

a good story, well-acted with unexpected character twists eg. vicious murderous gangster bryan brown teaching his son macrame. although it succeeds as an action drama where you hope the good guy (ledger) and his gilrfriend succeed, it also has some hilarious ironic black humour eg. the bank robbers who become radio competition "winners" and their reaction, the busker's revenge etc. well worth watching.

two hands restored my faith in aussie films. it took an old premise and made it fresh. i enjoyed this movie to no end. i recommend it to those people who like guy ritchie films. bryan brown was fantastic and just about perfect in a role tailor made for him. ledger was adequtely dumb and his performance anchored a very satisfying movie for me.

i saw two hands back in sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. it's got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). like much australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and jordan should justly feel proud of his work.anyway, it was on tv just now on channel 4 in london, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out! so if you watch this movie, make sure it's the original version.

i'm afraid i must disagree with mr. radcliffe, as although he is correct in saying this isn't a comedy, it has many other merits. the plot is a little mad at parts, but i believe it it all fits together nicely, creating a satisfying, enjoyable film. the last scene was rather abysmal compared to the rest of the film, but the actual ending of the plot a few scenes previously is very interesting, showing just what someone will do under stressful circumstances.i would recommend this film to fans of thrillers and action movies, but if you're a fan of gangster movies then as long as you don't expect expect something as deep as goodfellas then you should still find it enjoyable.

brilliant film! i am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like pulp f. but thats how it is with post pulp era. many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. but this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from tarantino, which is a good similarity!anyway the film's about a guy bloke in australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang, and ends up in a debt and deep s*it. to his assistance is his deceased brother (anyone remember val kilmer in true r.?) to pay of his debt and escape from the gangsters who are on his trail. the gangsters are cold blooded, but take the time to play chess and focus on the upbringing of their children! they also get served tea from their granny while planning a bank robbery and have trouble what to do with their kids during the robbery. so a humorous gangster flick with heath ledger in good form (though i'm not a fan) , and bryan brown in great action as a gang leader.

pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn't understand this wonderful film. what a sad life he must lead!this movie has more to say about life and relationships than most i've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the "ordinary people" type of film. it is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.the whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps shakespear's "midsummer nights' dream." beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat.i look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable. it's like re-reading a favorite, treasured book.

great fun for an evening on the sofa. don't expect academy award stuff with this but it will leave you with a smile. the performance by bruce spence is truly good. the soundtrack shows off some great old australian talent. check out this and other true aussie films.

this film predates the australian films road warrior and priscilla of the desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in the dialogue, locations, photography, direction and political philosophy. the photography is notably confident. the direction is stylish and for the most part well done. if you liked the early australian films by bruce beresford, peter weir and george miller then you'll love "oz". the direction also reminds this reviewer of edgar wright's contemporary work. that similarity suggests that "oz" was far ahead of its time. the critics of 1967 hated it and the public stayed away - 1960s australia, like 1940s usa, was in some ways the sort of place where conformity was important, whereas this film is very different to what those viewers would have expected, especially after reading the promotional posters. this film will most likely have more appeal to contemporary audiences: it's still quirkily awkward and self-conscious, but in a contemporary european way rather than a 1960s australian way. joy dunstan (who later appeared in the australian tv series 'prisoner') plays her role with less raw passion than her contemporary jacki weaver might have done, instead dunstan's character in this film conveys some of the rather whimsical strength of australian women most famously represented by kylie minogue playing charlene mitchell in the australian tv series neighbours and further developed in later roles in her career. men will also enjoy this film, which presents various masculine issues in a different way than most other mid-sixties films from the usa or even australia. in particular, bruce spence (who later went on to play tion medon in 'star wars iii', the trainman in the 'matrix' films, and the chopper pilot in the 'road warrior' and 'thunderdome' films) plays a central and sustained role which solidly supports the rest of the cast. this film is worth seeing for bruce spence's performance alone. 7/10 for some minor continuity problems.

wow! an amazing, lost piece of australiana and a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one. this film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. as a retelling of the oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities. the chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in australia will delight fans of the genre. this film used to be double featured with the rocky horror picture show, an indicator of the type of film that oz is. while not as frivolous or well constructed as rhps it's hard not to have fun with oz.surprisingly, oz has aged well- perhaps a by-product of how determinedly set in the real australia of 1976 it is. the passage of history shows that many of the ideas being explored would eventually enter the mainstream. the willingness of the film to give prominence to gay characters is notable, especially as it dates to the 'revolution' period for the australian gay rights push.the performances range from flinchingly amateur to finely nuanced brilliance. the direction is lacking in subtlety and much of the dialogue may have benefited from an extra draft or two. somehow, these flaws add to the appeal of the film which is mercifully unpretentious. much like australia in the 1970s this film has a certain naive charm.there are several connections to the original australian stagings of the rocky horror show which will keep obsessives on their toes.oz is most certainly a minor classic and a potential cult favourite worthy of review. laugh at the atrocious 70s fashion, swing along with the ausrock soundtrack, leave any expectations at the door and oz is likely to delight.

i rented this obscure aussie relic a few years ago to show at a friend`s place and it was an instant success.the classic tale of the wizard of oz with a decidedly cornball 70`s australian twist.the acting isn`t exactly shakespeare society stuff here,but later ,"mad max"star bruce spence is a beautifully understated surfie/scarecrow and there are some wonderfull comic turns by gary wadell and robin ramsay as a deliciously 70`s camp fairy godmother/father character.also note the musical contribution from ex-daddy cool frontman ross wilson on the title song.in a similar vein to later-day aussie comedies such as "priscilla queen of the desert".good fun.

due to its predictable, second-rate title, (the one it was distributed under in italy, at least) i didn't expect much from this movie. thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house ("la casa maledetta" means "the cursed house"). well, i had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene! the constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres, reminded me a bit of the exorcist and some of its decent italian rip-offs, but this was going to be something completely different... this is more like hitchcock meets italian thriller! very well written and directed, good actors, interesting plot... ok, i've tried not to spoil the viewing of "7 hyden park" for you, which i'd highly recommend to everyone. p.s. am i wrong, or when joanna crawls or tries hard to stand (she's paralyzed from the waist down) her feet and legs move a little too much? (... and i'm not talking of the "bad dream" sequence.)

the last film by underrated director alberto de martino ("the antichrist", "the killer is on the phone") is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans. there are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, phony priests), loads of creepy moments, plot twists left & right, outstanding music and  last but not least  a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror! what is it about ordinary child dolls that make them so creepy? when the anonymous man, dressed up like a priest, assaulted a little girl and the broken head of her doll bounced down a flight of stairs, it really sent cold shivers through my spine! years later, the young girl from the prologue is an adult woman bound to a wheelchair. she inherited a lot of money but uses her fortune to stimulate fellow handicapped people to practice sports and to remain positive-minded. she  joanna  falls in love with her personal coach and they get married right away. naturally, he's only after her money and starts terrorizing joanna by making her relive the childhood trauma that crippled her. the repeated images of a sinister looking priest, guided by eerie tunes and a nursery rhyme, provide "formula for a murder" with a ton of genuine scares and alberto de martino's directing is very resolute. the acting is quite competent, with david warbeck ("the beyond", "the black cat") in a glorious greedy villain role. due some plot holes and a lack of originality, this movie might not be able to compete with italy's best horror efforts, but it definitely deserves more attention. many formerly obscure and unknown italian gialli received marvelous dvd-releases and, hopefully, "formula for a murder" will be given the same treatment really soon. in the meantime, good luck tracking this baby down!

a very suspenseful giallo from the director of "l'anticristo"(1974),this one begins with a brilliantly-handled sequence involving a priest,a little girl,and a broken doll.however the main story is about maniac(david warbeck)marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money.the plot,whilst not original,is really suspenseful,the acting is good and there are several skillful and gory murders.the score by francesco de massi is quite effective,some of which can also be heard in lucio fulci's "the new york ripper"(1982).highly recommended for fans of italian cinema!

a formula for murder isn't a well known giallo, but that isn't to say it's not a very good one! the film is directed by alberto de martino, the man behind cult classics such as the antichrist and blazing magnums. the film was released late on in the giallo cycle, but more than stands up to many of the films released around the 'golden' period in the early seventies. despite a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists, and a host of well defined characters. the film is, perhaps, not as exciting overall as many other films in the genre; but this is more than compensated for by the assured way that the central situation is fed to the audience, and the tension resulting from that. the plot begins by showing a fake priest raping a young girl named joanna, before pushing her down a flight of steps. we then fast forward several years and the girl is now a woman, who is unfortunately in a wheelchair. she is being trained for a sports event by craig; a man who also has romantic designs on her. however, his proposal isn't met with glee by joanna's personal assistant, who also has romantic designs on her.the film features a plot twist half way through that makes up the backbone of the movie, and while it's not exactly logical; it's good to watch and hints that you're in for an interesting movie. director alberto de martino is clearly not afraid to show a few outrageous gore scenes, and the best of which in this film features a priest being battered to death by a spade - and i personally wouldn't hesitate to name that sequence as one of my favourite giallo murder scenes! the plot can be a little uneven at times, but generally the action is very good. the director spends what seems like an eternity on the conclusion to the film; but it's absolutely packed with tension, and the way that it plays out is good in that it takes advantage of all the plot points that have gone before it. the musical score, taken from fulci's the new york ripper, works well in this film also and, breaking a giallo tradition, de martino's film also features some rather good acting performances from cult veteran david warbeck and christina nagy, in her only feature film role. overall, this film isn't one of the easiest giallo's to come across; but its well worth tracking down and comes recommended to fans of this sort of film.

alter egos do not come funnier than the creation of sacha baron cohen's ali g. completely misled by his delusional and non-existent sense of the middle england suburban surroundings that his social background consists of. he persists on living the style of a los angeles gansta. while still living with his gran in the london suburb of staines, he keeps tight control of his posse, the west staines "massiv".spending his spare time between me julie, his girl, the posse and teaching local eight year old scouts at "keep it real (advanced)" lessons at the government funded john nike leisure centre.this is where the story takes off, being told that the government funding has stopped, ali g then proceeds on a one-man quest "in the struggle for justice i iz willing to lay down me life, just like martin luther van dross did". being his reply to the local media crew when interviewing him on hunger strike while chained to a fence.charles dance here plays david carlton, the sinister and devious deputy prime minster, who is "even more eviller than skeletor". using ali g, unknowingly, to lose the prime minster 18,000 votes three weeks before the general election. seeing ali g as a bumbling idiot, his plan backfires. ali g suddenly becomes an over night sensation and a saviour of the people, working directly with the prime minster. the story becomes more sinister and with hilarious consequences.ali g indahouse is a great british movie that brings the hugely talented attributes of writing, along with dan mazer, executive production and acting of sacha baron cohen. charles dance and michael gambon, as the p.m. play their parts with great seriousness among the gags and hilarity that is ali g.ironically, seeing the parodies playing their parts in a world that really is real, and who are continually preaching "keep it real" from their own little world that is the west staines "massiv" is true comic paradox.directed by mark mylod, his first full length feature film since directing television work such as shameless, shooting stars, the fast show and the smell of reeves and mortimer to name a few.very real and very funny.

if you like his show you might be a little disappointed. this movie has some very funny moments and the laughs are pretty constant but none are very memorable or as funny as the things on the show. the beginning sequence is really really silly and funny, and a great start. yes! borat does make a cameo appearance.if you are a fan then watch it! if you don't know him or don't like him then don't bother. 6.5/10

no real plot, no character development, no scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? the only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as borat. sure, the ending drags a bit, but if borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. sacha baron cohen is possibly the greatest comedian alive, and here he gets more laughs than jude law on a nude beach. i dare you not to laugh.if you can pull the ten-foot pole out of your behind for an hour and a half and just enjoy some well timed and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story about a stupid character, see this stupid movie. you'll be glad you did. keep it real!

the way i found out about this movie was when i watched american pie 2, at the start it had a trailer for ali g indahouse, i watched the trailer and it just forced me to buy the dvd, it looked incredibly funny! so the next day, i went to my local store and picked it up for £3.99 (bargain!). the film is about ali g, who is a "gangster" of the west staines massive crew, who's rivals are the east staines massive crew. ali has a "cub scout" pack of children where he teaches them how to survive in the "ghetto" by teaching them how to swear and steal cars, after ali finds out the government are stopping the money coming to the leisure centre where ali teaches the kids, he runs for mp for staines and overthrows another mp in his attempts to get rid of the leisure centre to make room for an airport in staines. throughout the film there are laughs aplenty as ali gets up to some crazy stuff! borat makes an appearance for a few seconds in the film too, this is a definite must watch film for all you sacha baron cohen fans out there!

i saw the messiah:- the first killings and i thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes i have seen, ever. it was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, i cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. jamie draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is jez clifton, the cop. to be able to do that, well, i certainly wouldn't be able to do it, well not without cracking anyway. i really do love and care for jamie draven with all of my heart and i always will, until the end of time, i think that jamie is the sweetest, cutest, sexiest guy in the world. i absolutely love jamie in ultimate force also because he looks god damn sexy in the blacks that he wore. i love jamie love paula draven-x-

messiah was compulsive viewing from start to finish. the story centred on apparently random murders of men in london in various gruesome ways. dci red metcalfe (ken stott)has to find the truth which, to his surprise, is a little closer to home than he might think.gripping drama and ken stott was brilliant. hopefully we have not seen the last of dci red metcalfe.

obviously inspired by se7en and sometimes even more gruesome; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). great script and acting (i was especially impressed by ken stott and there were no weak points in te cast). good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. one of the best thrillers i've seen since years. although it was scheduled on bbc in three parts i watched messiah on video in one take. one point of critic; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.

i saw messiah 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of seven but it`s still compelling . much of my praise has to do with ken stott`s performance as dci red metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . it`d be easy for stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way . likewise the murders are very shocking but - unlike the sequel where the murders are carried out onscreen in a rather ott manner - there`s actually little violence shown .my only criticisms are that the red herring was too obviously a red herring which meant i wasn`t taken in by the shock twist ( and you would probably see the shock twist coming so i won`t bother with a spoiler alert ) and that when the real murderer was revealed it seemed both slightly far fetched and caused a few plot holes to appear in the story . if i remember correctly the sequel had similar problems once the murderer was revealed so maybe it`d be a good idea not to make messiah 3

having read the other comment about this superb piece of tv drama i felt compelled to balance things a little. if you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be british, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. ken stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including edward woodward and art malik. recommended. (in response to the earlier comments, although i accept that 'red' would not 'normally' drive away from a hit and run, he had just witnessed his brother arrested for murder, and i am fairly sure he does not see the boy move.)

i have to say when it comes to book to movie adaptations the bbc rarely lets me down. now regarding this mini-series. i love the starling novel, it's by far the best murder/mystery i've ever read. the mini-series, it defiantly made my day when i saw it. the primary story was kept near perfectly intact. the characters match the ones to the novel very well, the personalities and mannerisms were spot on for red and jez. i thought duncan was done very well as was kate, eric came off as too much of a simplistic character, he had a little more depth in the book, but they also altered his sub-story so that may have had to deal with it. of course there are changes, but most are cosmetic, but some i found disappointment in, the sub-story with eric murder charge was changed and that changed the whole dynamic between red and eric for the movie, and they cut out the triathalon training jez was doing. some of the other events in the book are changed to be viewer friendly. over all if you liked the book, you will like this, if you like the mini-series, then you'll love the book. i must say, this is the most accurate book to movie adaptation i've seen.

i have been a mario fan for as long as i can remember, i have very fond memories of playing super mario world as a kid, this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new. super mario galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing mario franchise. there is much very different about this game from any other mario before it, while still keeping intact the greatest elements of mario, the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space.the story begins much like any other mario game, mario receives a letter from princess peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the mushroom kingdom. upon arriving at peach's castle mario finds bowser and his son (bowser jr.) attacking the castle with their airships. bowser kidnaps princess peach and then lifts her castle up into space. in the midst of the castle being lifted into space mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet. mario is found by a talking star named luma and is taken back to the luma's home, a floating space station, here mario meets many other lumas and also meets their leader, a woman named rosalina. rosalina tells mario that bowser has taken away the space station's power stars and scattered them across the universe, it is up to mario to help the lumas find them and save peach, thus the adventure begins.the way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies, each galaxy consists of multiple planets that mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the power stars. mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity, some planets are small and others are big, many planets are similar to classic mario environments. the best thing about the game are the controls, all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same, but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. you shake the remote mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game, and it will as well activate the shooting stars. you can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment. then there is the graphics, these are by far the best graphics on the wii, it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks, you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 games.my only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to, and also the story is pretty weak. the worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game, no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives. still these minor problems aside it's a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging. this is the type of game that we've been waiting for on the wii.a perfect 10 out of 10!

i saw what i believe to be the best australian film of the year so far, jon hewitt's acolytes.acolytes is a stylish thriller with a killer premise. get thistwo bullied and molested teens discover a local serial killer in their suburb and then set about blackmailing him to kill the bully who molested them. hewitt has picked a top notch cast including excellent new comers sebastian gregory, josua payne and hanna mangan lawrence to play the teens. add to that three, yes, thats right three great psycho's! lead by joel edgerton in an outstanding performance of serial killer du jour, belinda mcclory his deranged spouse and michael dorman as the teen raping bully, with swastika tattoos. once you add these teens and these menacing adults, all hell breaks loose hewitt has crafted a balls to the wall serial thriller thats damn original and accomplished. you can see the influence of larry clark and david lynch's twin peaks but hewitt makes it all his own, in a qld suburban back water, always ringing with the drones of emptiness. the script by shayne armstong, shane krouse and hewitt is tight.if marketed correctly this film could be a break out hit with teens. the next wolf creek? it could well be. it makes all the right moves. the teens are real ala larry clark. they don't suck and have an attached pc agenda, they are non communicative, good looking and hip. the killers are dark with real menace. joel edgerton steals his scenes as the mild mannered local ted bundy, who sports a butterfly on his 4wd spare ala john fowles the collector. dorman's petrol head rapist pours on the menace that tops suburban mayhem and provides a creepy thug who you can't wait to see buy the farm.the film is fast paced, tough and brutal. not only that, it displays a confidence and directorial mastery from hewitt that is surely to win him an if or afi nomination, if not award! its nuanced and poetic mise en scene, brilliant sound design, excellent cinematography and tight structure mark it as clearly one of the best directed oz features i have seen so far this year.the film leaves you shaken, thinking and unsettled. its a truly great edition to the return to genre going on in australian cinema at present. it will surely garner the interest of hollywood. oh, and did i mention it got into toronto? what other oz feature films can say that much? the world should get ready for a new auteur, jon hewitt.

i would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment. i watched this not expecting too much from it. the fact is that the cast were superb, especially the lead teen female. the dark sides of them all came through, all were messed up in an not obvious way. there was an underlying current which ran through the movie of teenage angst and sexuality. the serial killer role was played well also as you could feel he had gone through what they had as children. what this movie is, is a strong drama/thriller. yes i would agree they don't do the obvious, but you could relate with the messed up teenage heads they did what they did and it is believable. also a decent dark ending, instead of which could have so easily been an opt out happy one. the attention to detail in the movie was fantastic also. i very good solid 7 out of 10. a little slow at times, but lets a thinking person see where the characters are coming from.

people who say that some of what the looney tunes cartoons show is inappropriate for children have apparently forgotten something: they weren't originally intended for children. they were produced for the cinema, to be shown before feature films, and so they could show anything that they wanted. "tweety's s.o.s." has that bad puddy tat sylvester finding tweety aboard an ocean liner and boarding the ship to try and get him. but two things work against sylvester: granny is vehemently protecting the canary, and sylvester easily gets seasick (we don't see him throwing up, but with his green face, they make it perfectly clear that he was doing just that!). and then of course, the seemingly cute tweety has a bad-ass streak.it's just great to see how these cartoons weren't afraid to go all out; whatever they thought about showing, they showed. we need to understand that cartoons weren't always supposed to be cute entertainment for children. really funny.

this is one of those tweety and sylvester cartoons that made this legendary pair second only to bugs bunny in terms of looney tunes popularity.besides having all of the stock situations for this duo (sylvester feeding out of garbage cans, the "i tawt i taw a putty tat" line, etc.), tweety's s.o.s also stars granny, who is one of those types of supporting characters that these warner bros. classics had in abundance to enrich the color and flavor of them. this time out the cat and bird are aboard an ocean liner and the gags that are extracted from this situation are creative and lively.what a day that was in cartoon history when friz freleng decided to pair his sylvester with the departed robert clampett's little yellow bird.

before i forget, let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. from garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. if this wasn't animated, critics would be lauding the "direction" in here, because it's really good.to the story: sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. while brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole he spots tweety in his cage. tweety spots him, too, and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat. anyway, sylvester runs over, opens the porthole and says, "hello, breakfast!" tweety slams the porthole window on his face and says, "you bad old peeping tomcat!" the cat falls into the water.the undaunted sylvester quickly sneaks back aboard ship, tiptoes into tweety's cabin, grabs him and is ready to leave when - wham! - there's "granny" at the door with her umbrella. sylvester takes a beating as the old lady protects her pet bird once again. but, "flippety gibbet," says granny, "i've dropped my glasses. i can't see a thing without 'em. heavens to betsey, where are those cheaters."now sylvester has the upper hand....and the normal cat-trying-to-catch-bird shenanigans are on again, like granny's glasses. sylvester's most clever act was to take her glasses and paint a picture of tweety on them, so when she woke up and put them on, she'd see the bird and think it was okay.overall, a very entertaining animated short that was a lot of fun to watch. as you can tell by the quotes, i love the dialog in some of these old cartoons.

sit back and let director bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of india. when was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie? this movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in india. if you didn't want to visit india before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now. this movie has dancing girls, a chase scene, and the mafioso involved. but it has a lot more. thanks, bharatbala, for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale. i loved the ending. we women don't want illusions in life, we want reality. p.s. i was carolyn's friend at the sonoma film festival and met you briefly. good luck with your distribution efforts and i'm talking up the movie a storm.

i just saw this at the philadelphia film festival. it was the most wonderful movie - the best i've seen in quite a while. the enticing character of isa is an open, exploring and (as remarked in the film) love-filled person - guilelessly portrayed by the beautiful camille natta. the accompanying music is soothing and transporting, a balm to the soul.each character seems to be conflicted in some way - and their interactions (w/ conflicts) make for a great story. the tale told by a.k. hangal as the old man was most magically done - i wanted it to go on and on.that hari seemed to remember his "place" throughout added get power to the story - a refreshing change to the bubble-headed plots of many modern writers.all and all, an excellent film. go see.

based on a william faulkner short story, two soldiers is a top notch short film, a movie that has enough story, emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end. the story involves two dirt poor mississippi brothers, one only a kid, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the japanese attack on pearl harbor. the younger brother, played brilliantly by newcomer jonathan furr, doesn't want to let his older brother go, and he sets out on a quest to enlist in the army himself. ron perlman gives a gruff but touching peformance as the army colonel who decides to help the kid.because it is only 39 minutes long, this gem will be hard to find (it will most likely be confined to the festival circuit for now), but remember the name aaron schneider--this picture marks him as a director to watch.

"strangers on a train" was one of those film classics i had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing. i finally watched it a few weeks ago and, as always with any hitchcock movie, it not only stood up to the test of time, it far surpassed most thrillers being made today. you can see the inspiration for future action movies here - the climactic ending with the out-of-control merry-go-round and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of jan de bont's "speed." of course, "strangers" is over forty years older than "speed" and contains no modern special effects, but the visceral thrill is there - hitchcock was a true genius.the not-so-subtle gay side of bruno (robert walker in an amazing performance) has taken form in many other psycho-stalker-figures in future movies. consider him a male version of jennifer jason leigh in "single white female." he knows about guy before he even meets him on the train - we almost get the feeling their contact isn't incidental - and is soon entirely obsessed with him.hitchcock loved the oedipial elements in his movies (also see "psycho" for more blatant undertones) and there's a lot of that here. bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother. his effeminate ways and obvious homosexuality must have just slipped by the censors in 1951, when gays were not "allowed" to be portrayed on the screen - yet hitchcock gets the message through effectively when we see bruno in the lounge on the telephone wearing a very non-masculine robe, flirting with guy and responding to his mother.the deep layers of this movie make it a fast-paced thriller than you can return to again and again - unfortunately it's being remade as a big-budget hollywood production, but after seeing the original i honestly can't imagine anything surpassing the sheer white-knuckle thrills of this movie.

even though some unrealistic things happen at the end (i.e. a cop shooting a gun into a crowded merry-go-round where any number of innocent could be killed), this still was an intense, enjoyable thriller, one of alfred hitchcock's better films. robert walker is excellent as the chilling nutcase, really convincing giving a fascinating performance that is almost too creepy at times. his co-star in here, farley granger, is okay but is no match for walker, either in acting or in the characters they play. it's the typical hitchcock film with some strange camera angles, immoral themes, innocent man gets in trouble, etc. unlike a lot of his other films, i thought this one was a fast-moving story with a very few dull spots. being an ex-tennis player, i enjoyed his footage of some excellent old net matches that featured some good rallies. hitchcock's real-life daughter patricia has an interesting and unique minor character role in here. she didn't just get the job because of her dad; she can act. also of note: the dvd has both the british and american versions and there were some differences in the story. this is a classic film that is still referred to in modern-day films, even comedies such as "throw momma off the train."

alfred hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers, and many of them have gone on to be hailed as some of the greatest films of all time. one film that tends to get somewhat lost under the vertigo's and the psycho's is this film; strangers on a train, the most compelling film that hitchcock ever made. the story follows guy haines, a tennis player and a man soon to be wed to the senator's daughter, if he can get a divorce from his current wife. one day, on the way to see his wife, he meets the mentally unstable bruno anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall; and one that could ultimately cost him his life.the conversation aboard the train between bruno and guy is one of the cinema's most intriguing and thought provoking of all time. what if two people "swapped" murders, thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime, and rendering their motive irrelevant? could this truly be the perfect murder? what makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that guy is lead into could happen to any, normal everyday person. everyone has someone they'd like to get rid of, so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his? the chances of it happening are unlikely, but it's the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of strangers on a train; and in this situation, anyone could. is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of bruno anthony any better than robert walker? the man was simply born for the part. he manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene he is in. the character of bruno is a madman, but he's not a lunatic; he's a calculating, conniving human being and robert walker makes the character believable. his performance is extremely malevolent, and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality. unfortunately, robert walker died just one year after the release of strangers on a train, and i believe that is a great loss to cinema. nobody in the cast shines as much as walker does, but worth mentioning is his co-star farley granger. granger never really impresses that much, but his performance is good enough and he holds his own against walker. also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person; and that is how it should be. ruth roman is guy's wife to be. she isn't really in the film enough to make a lasting impression, but she makes the best of what she has. alfred hitchcock's daughter, patricia, takes the final role of the four central roles as barbara, the sister of guy's fiancé. she is suitably lovely in this role, and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is in.alfred hitchcock's direction is always sublime, and it is very much so in this film. there is one shot in particular, that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses. this is an absolutely brilliant shot, and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene. hitchcock's direction is moody throughout, and very much complies with the film noir style. the climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting, and i don't think that anyone but hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film. it's truly overblown, and out of turn from the rest of the movie; but it works. there is a reason that hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time, and the reason for that is that he doesn't only use the script to tell the film's story, but he also uses to camera to do so as well. strangers on a train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made. its story is both intriguing and thought provoking, and is sure to delight any fan of cinema. a masterpiece.

one would have expected hitchcock's return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution. surely few expected his most riotous, unrestrained film, a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy, exciting suspense, mocking manipulation, and astonishing flights of fancy. but that is precisely what they got: strangers on a train.what is remarkable is how much bruno's transgression disrupts the world of the film. much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif, but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress guy is making of his life, and hence the society he represents or is eager to join. guy is the archetypal american, the working-class boy made good, moving in influential circles, athletic, successful, handsome. bruno is his destructive opposite, gay, decadent, 'european' (he lives off his father, in a big house, and just lounges about dreaming of murder). bruno's life is one of repetition, circularity, whereas guy moves straight ahead. it is bruno's achievement to move guy into his realm (represented by the merry-go-round) and force him to transgress (break the law, hope for murder (bruno's)).bruno is quite literally fighting patriarchy. all the authority figures in the film are criticised - bruno's father, a man whose brutality we get a glimpse of, but the true horror of which is constantly alluded to in the film (especially in aunt clara's paintings - that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere); anna's incredibly machiavellian, self-serving father; the insensitive judge who thinks nothing of lunching after an execution; the tennis commentator whose smugly authorative comments are always mistaken. far from being the mother-hater of legend, hitch, as robin wood perceived, is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchy.bruno's transgression turns the world topsy-turvy. this is hitch's most surreal film. whenever guy is in his plot, he is filmed straight, with conventionally romantic music. but whenever bruno intrudes, the atmosphere becomes carnivalesque, bizarre, much more fun. this is hitch's first truly american film, revelling in the primitive detritus of americana. grown men puncture little boys' balloons, or try to throw them off merry-go-rounds. distinguished professors of mathematics sing about goats on trains. elderly society matrons are strangled at elegant soirees. washington is filmed like a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky, like a haunting dali painting. there is one of the greatest, and funniest, scenes in all cinema when we see a motionless, smiling bruno in a sea of turning heads at a tennis match, an image worthy of magritte. just look at any scene with bruno in it, and watch it derail into the bizarre.phalluses abound in the most ridiculous permutations - check all those balloons (hitch had obviously just seen the third man) - as well as in more staid environs: washington will never look the same again. strangers is also, vertigo notwithstanding, hitch's most overtly sexual film - as well as the phalluses, there is the sustained homoeroticism, the remarkable play with 'riding' horses; the gobsmacking fellatio joke when hitch's daughter spills powder over the policeman.and yet hitch doesn't stint on good old suspense. in the very proper endeavour to show what a great artist he was, critics tend to overlook what made him famous in the first place. much has been made of bruno as a prototype of norman bates, and hitch plays merry havoc on audience identification, willing bruno into murder. there is a hilariously painful sequence where bruno loses the lighter with which he intends to frame guy down a drain. the gasps of tension and sighs of relief on the part of the audience i was a part of in support of an insane murderer is inherently funny, slightly disturbing, and highly revealing about our true reactions to conformity and success. and hitch milks it with callous glee - listen to the mocking music and exagerrated compositions, and kick yourself for taking it all so seriously.strangers is one of hitch's five best films, and therefore one of the greatest things in cinema. the dialogue is so strange and brilliant, i can't believe it wasn't written by chandler. patricia hitchcock is a wonderful imp, standing in for her cheeky father as she taunts guy. the fairground finale is a remarkable, dizzying fusion of exciting, tense set-piece, black comedy and symbolic site. if bruno's final words condemn him to hell (according to the catholic precepts hitch is supposed to embody: compare with a similar ending in the killers), we applaud his integrity, infinitely preferable to guy's debased serving of self.

cam archer's lyrical bobbycrush boldly captures the disorienting kaleidoscope that is adolescent desire with a lush rendering (beautifully photographed by aaron platt) that is more vibe than narrative. caught somewhere between documentary and dream, bobbycrush recalls the inventiveness of early todd haynes and the vivid hyperrealism of gus van sant. with grit, glamour and heartbreak, it's kinda like the movie equivalent of sonic youth playing bubblegum pop.

beautiful....that one word pretty much sums up this whole film. everything from the cinematography, the directing, the acting.....brilliant. at any point of the film, you can pause it, and you will no doubt be looking at something mosaic or "artsy fartsy" as some people would say. i assure you, that after one viewing, "bobbycrush" will be stuck in your head. i know this from first hand experience. even the soundtrack is great. it goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film. be thankful that cam archer exists in this world. we need more people like him to make films that show love and shame in totally real (and surreal) imagery.

dylan and bobby are boyhood friends and they are in love the way that young boys sometimes are. but dylan has met a girl and is starting to put those boyhood things aside. bobby knows that he's not interested in girls and misses what he had with dylan. told as part cheesy 80's pop video, part home movie, part video recollection this film tells a confusing and sad, but all too often true, story that will hit home with many that see it. this film brings back a lot of memories and struck a very true chord with me but i wish the film maker had gone a bit further and left it on a happier note. yes, we all love and lose, even when we are young, but there's always tomorrow, especially when we are young.

very enjoyable 50's western. i have it in my collection and recommend it to western fans.mostly victor mature's movie and quite well done in my estimation.he's a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout. red cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions. they all joined as scouts after their loss.victor has set his eye's on the colonel's wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulations.action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other characters.50's westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction. a western of this kind is in the pages of the past and perhaps never to be made much again. one to enjoy. gave it a 7 rating. likely 6.8 worthy but films like these become more precious over time.for film-noir fans..."the big steal" "they live by night" "side street" are most wonderful movies to be enjoyed. bought and viewed. noir seems to resemble westerns in a way. some long ago and never forever.

i enjoyed this film, which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex love-hate relations, along with interspersed action scenes and some lighthearted moments in which the mountain men counter harsh army discipline. all the main characters are well cast. true, john wayne or robert mitchum could probably have done the starring role just as well, but victor mature certainly comes across as a headstrong brawling tarzan of sorts. reminds me of his film role as samson, another difficult, but not impossible, man to tame.the mountain men in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism, as the era of pure trapper mountain men pretty much ended 20 years before, with the collapse of western beaver populations as well as the fashion market for beaver pelts. this story supposedly takes place in oregon just before the end of the civil war. judging by the volcano in the background of the opening scene(probably mt. lassen), the fictional fort was located somewhere in a remote section of the cascades, as we never see any other civilians. however, there is plenty of conflicting evidence that it actually takes place in the mountains of wyoming or montana! red cloud, the war chief who threatens the trappers and soldiers in the fort, is the namesake of a very famous sioux war chief who led a very successful campaign in 1865-66 to exterminate the newly built army forts in wyoming and montana. fort laramie(eastern wyoming)is mentioned as being not too far removed from the fictional fort. the plains tribe of assiniboines is mentioning as joining red cloud. this aspect of the story, then, bears a general resemblance to historical fact.it may be of interest to note certain resemblances between the plot of this story and that of john ford's "fort apache". in both cases, we have a fort commander who was recently assigned to his first frontier post with native american problems. he underestimates the military prowess of his adversaries, regarding them as little more than cannon fodder to promote his career. in both films, he pays dearly for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy.. also in common, the greenhorn commander resents a subordinate who has long experience with the local native americans and wants to tell him what is wise to do and not to do. in both films, we have a budding romantic relaionship between a woman very close to the commander's heart and a subordinate, which the commander does everything to squelch. clearly, the commander must be eliminated to allow these romances to proceed to completion.i also see certain resemblances with "the misfits". the soldiers, as a whole, including the commander, are misfits of a sort((as one of them admits): mostly they have "problems" or are raw recruits with no experience fighting native americans. the commander's wife apparently is the only woman in or anywhere near this fort, thus is inherently a misfit, with a husband who is very uncertain of his future in the army. the trappers, in turn, are also misfits, not really wanting to accept army or civilian discipline, yet cut off from their previous free spirit lives by the recent army-generated antagonism by red cloud. finally, we can also compare this story with anthony mann's later film "the far country", starring jimmy stewart. in stewart's case, he can choose to return to being a loner cowboy, at the end. but mature's character doesn't come up with an appetizing new way of being his own boss. red cloud has made life outside of the army in this region too dangerous to contemplate. besides, he has an obsession with the commander's wife.

victor mature, as a barely civilized and mostly out of control mountain man and trapper, may be on the poster, but robert preston as a failed union colonel who led his men to get "cut to ribbons" by confederate artillery at shiloh, and is sent to a fort in oregon for his incompetence, has the most interesting part, married to a young and hard to recognize at first anne bancroft. the uncivilized mature lusts for the colonel's wife, giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference coveting another man's wife at one point by james whitmore who plays mature's older and wiser mountain man father figure. directed by anthony mann, this film is lost among his more famous westerns with james stewart, but even so you really don't need the indian menace to make this a film worth seeing, although preston gets to prove his bad judgement as a commanding officer again in a failed expedition to finally bring the indians under submission, in a well staged attack among the forest that quickly turns into a rout.

    film auteur stephan woloszczuk explores the depths of love, passion, and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest film blindspot.blindspot's diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a twisting  journey to the core of the human soul.  as a director, he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors.   with superb editing, especially in the flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography, blindspot is a thought provoking suspense from beginning to end.  a thriller which leaves much to the minds' eye.what an  astounding accomplishment for stephan woloszczuk.  cheers stephan! angela sander

this is another good western,which i enjoyed.it's not an epic or anything,but it is good for what it is.it' about 3 fur trappers,led by a men named jed,who is crude and uncivilized.jed and his two friends find themselves as scouts for a fort that is the only thing standing between them and and indian band,who resent the americans on their land,and want to take it back.that's the gist of the story.what follows is action,excitement,even a bit of humour,and forbidden romance.one of jed's friends,gus,reminded me a lot of the character quint(played by robert shaw)in the movie jaws.they both have that crusty,gruff demeanor.anyway,if you're a western fan,you should find lots to like about this particular entry.i think it deserves a 7/10

let me clarify that. this is not a "good movie", but i am so glad it is out there, i am so glad i saw it, and for the role that it plays in my dvd collection, it is sublime. it is the ultimate pg-13 romp, it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on mars. it is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable. watching it requires so little sophistication, (in fact, thinking too hard about what's happening will get in the way of your appreciation of this work), it makes me feel like i'm 12 again. and that kind of experience is worth more than $9.99.

this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall the movie is effective very effective it makes you question and leaves you thinking the story is kinda far fetched but is believable and makes you feel good in sequences, its not like its the usual done and tried path. the characters are pretty well defined and are convincing. justin long stands out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end he will convince anyone with that speech he is simply brilliant in that speech. he needs to take on some more serious roles, he is worth more than just teen movies. etch this movie and get liberated

one of the more obscure of anthony mann's westerns, the last frontier was also his only cavalry western (aside from one brief episode in winchester '73), though naturally he focuses on the outsiders and internal conflicts rather than offering a fordian celebration of comradeship and shared ideals. set not in his beloved high country but in the foothills and forests, it's a much more cynical view of life of the frontier, in many ways his fort apache without the need to preserve the legend: this outpost is made up of misfits, failures, cowards and the odd competent officer ignored by his superiors, badly led while the civil war takes priority and all the best the army has to offer.victor mature and james whitmore are the free trappers who find civilisation creeping up on them when they are relieved of their pelts and packhorses by a local tribe aggrieved by the incursion of the cavalry into their territory. rather than blame the indians for their losses they decide it's the army's fault for building the fort and decide to demand compensation from them, ending up joining their ranks as scouts instead. but despite the best efforts of guy madison's amiable and competent acting commander to bring mature into the 19th century and make him fit to wear the uniform, the arrival of robert preston's humiliated colonel eager to revenge himself on the tribe that drove him out of his own outpost  and mature's clumsy infatuation with the colonel's wife (anne bancroft, too much of a blank slate here to do much with the role of a woman who's tired of being saved by men who think they know what's best for her)  soon drive matters into much darker territory. it's not long before some of the soldiers are busily planning on killing each other, both sides trying to goad their subordinates into doing the deed for them: little wonder that at one point mature throws away the bluecoat he has long coveted in disgust, screaming "i would have died for this, but it's nothing but a dirty filthy blue rag!" the stallone of his day, mature was one of those actors who could surprise you with the odd excellent performance here and there when matched with the right part and the right director. this is not one of his better days despite having his most complex part, perversely enough as a simple man  well-meaning but drunk, violent, uneducated and with a unsubtle, almost childlike lust for life, the part seems designed with burt lancaster in mind, with some striking similarities to his character in the kentuckian. but robert preston's ahab-like colonel is clearly the best role, determined to resurrect the career he destroyed in a single disastrously suicidal civil war engagement by launching another pointless suicidal campaign against the tribe that added another humiliation to the list that keeps him out of sight and out of mind of the promotion board. in his obsession to redeem his career he moves further away from any hope of moral redemption, driven as much by his sense of shame at his wife's sympathy as by the promotion of former comrades he regards as his inferiors. he's beyond salvation, but there's still a recognisable human being in there and one not entirely without a sense of integrity  he genuinely admires madison's courage in making a futile attempt to get preston's orders countermanded by their superiors  fatally skewed though it is.like its hero, the film is a little rough around the edges (and boasts one of the most surreal and jaunty title songs of any western), but that only tends to make it more interesting, and there are plenty of mann's typically elegant camera moves and plays on perspective, while the frontier setting is convincingly harsh and primitive. unfortunately the deficiencies of the early cinemascope lenses are very apparent in columbia's dvd, with the image often dark (2.55:1 cinemascope required a huge amount of additional lighting and early scope films show a lot of trial-and-error) and grainy.

`the last frontier' is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers jed (victor mature), gus (james whitmore) and mongo (pat hogan) and their relationships with the army, particularly captain riordon (guy madison), colonel marston(robert preston) and corrina marston, colonel's wife (anne bancroft). hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the indians, jed, gus and mungo adjust to living the `civilized' life within a fort on the edge of the `last frontier.' jed, who has been raised by gus, both inspires and looks up to the `older' gus and mungo, and has an especially difficult time dealing with `civilization.' his real problems start after he becomes strongly attracted to the colonel's wife, corrina. colonel marstonis a reckless man, who endangers every one around him with his dreams of ruthless victory over any opponent. corrina, a woman repressed by her station and sense of responsibility, loves her husband for what he could be and jed for what he is. caught in the middle is captain riordon, a brave and likeable man torn among his duty to the army, his strong friendship with jed and his fear of the likely disastrous consequences of the colonel's recklessness. what makes this movie so interesting (as well as entertaining) is that, in most cases the weaknesses and the strengths of `the last frontier' are exactly the same elements (forget the insipid title and dated music)first, the screenplay. almost all of the subplots (particularly, the reckless colonel) have been done better elsewhere, but have rarely been assembled with such eccentricity. just when you think you know what is going to happen next, this one takes off in a different direction. possible spoiler: `the last frontier' being a `production code' movie (back in the day the word `virgin' was taboo), it's very surprising that the adultery factor was handled in such a mature, tolerant manner. i expected either jed or the colonel's wife to reap some retribution for their sin. i was surprised and a little disappointed the movie didn't exploit that expectation to create a less predictable ending.second, the casting. mature is at least ten years too old to play the part of jed, the wild-eyed innocent raised in the woods'. james whitmore, who plays gus, `the man who raised jed' is actually five years younger than mature. nevertheless, mature is very endearing, playing a character who is innocent of civilization but is in no way stupid. although there were several actors who could have played the role at the time (most notably, burt lancaster and kirk douglas), none could have played jed better. preston (also mature's junior) plays colonel marston, missing the tics and affectations one would expect from such a driven man. however, preston perfectly captures the sense of honor someone must have seen in marston to promote such a reckless fool to colonel's rank. bancroft is an especially shrewd choice as corrina. bancroft's dark hair has been died blonde, and this achieves the same effect as it did for winona ryder (`edward scissorhands') and christina ricci (`sleepy hollow'). that is, i felt conflicted about the character without knowing exactly why; i believe the answer is that blondes and brunettes have considerably different skin tones and eye shades. further, bancroft has always projected a toughness that borders on hardness (here the blonde hair softens her up a bit, though). this enables the 24 year old bancroft to stand toe to toe with both the 40 year old mature and the 37 year old preston; yep, she could be a colonel's wife. madison walks a careful balancing act as riordan, handling a complex role and sometimes ackward dialogue.playing a role similar to that of john wayne in `fort apache' madison does a more skillful job at it.this movie has a `silverado' type camaraderie. that alone makes it worth seeing. it also has memorable performances, beautiful scenerary and great action and direction. i just hope a letterbox version is available (many have been lost), because this movie takes full advantage of that format.

ordinarily, anthony mann made westerns with 'the big guys' - james stewart, gary cooper, henry fonda . . . the a list cowboy stars. but in this b+ film, he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western. the main character, played by victor mature, is a trapper/ mountain man, and ordinarily they are romanticized in films - robert redford in jeremiah johnson, that sort of thing, where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men. not here. for once, a true mountain man - vulgar, crude, animalistic - is the central figure, and it's something to see, giving mature one of his better later roles. the real acting chops are provided by robert preston, excellent as a self-absorbed custer type cavalry commander, and james whitmore, the poor man's spencer tracy, as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other. even more impressive is a very young anne bancroft as the officer's wife, who is initially repulsed by the very sight of mature's grisly character, then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize, to her own shock, that she's attracted to him. rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen, without the romantic allure that john ford gave such a place in his masterful fort apache. the battle sequences are big scale and notably violent, and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format. good show, and underrated movie, all around.

a very delightful bit of filmwork that should have had wider distribution. ian mcshane is right at home playing the soul loving dj who gets canned because he won't " go along with the program " and sets out to let the world know what they're missing. the supporting cast is great as well, and the music is the "soul" of the film. i just wish that the film would be released so that i could get a copy of this for my film library.

the sort of "little" film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore. sort of a "soul" version of the more well-known "the last of the blonde bombshells". ian mcshane is excellent as a dj and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re-uniting the members of a classic soul group, and the film follows his exploits as well as those of the group members; a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as isaac hayes, as well as acting stalwarts taurean blacque, derrick o'connor and antonio fargas. not meant to be an epic by any means, this is nonetheless a chunk of solid gold.

my favorite show of all time! yeah, i thought this was so cool, and larisa oleynik was the first crush i ever had (aaaawwwwww). it was well written, funny-except when it it wanted to be serious, and just a great show overall. but since we couldn't afford to keep nick, i couldn't see any episodes after feb. 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than i should. to me it's more the epidemy (now that doesn't look spelled right!) of having to say "goodbye" to someone that you love, and know you'll never see them again. and i still think that, because as far as i know, there are no plans to release this on dvd any time soon...yeah, life is mean! i've found that out for sure (though you can find an odd episode every here or there...but i never liked the bootleg copies of things much either).so enough of my sad life:(....most kids in 7th grade don't need powers like alex gets to get them through life (unrealistic--for sure) but then again, how many towns have a super-evil chemical plants that is willing to do anything for "progress at any cost"? gee this show was fun to watch! though i'd agree the diaglouge is a bit over developed (and even a little politically correct sometimes). my favorite parts were when the kids would have some reason to break into the plant (a video tape or something like that) like a kid's version of "tom clancy's rainbow six" (which years later i got hooked on that game series for probably the same reason) almost! then you've got the plant's "security" team who are trying desperately to find the "kid from the accident"...very mean dudes (at least when i first watched the show...they seem more sympathetic to me now). i feel rather sad for larisa oleynik, not sure if she minds this role type-casting her.....but it's what i'll always remember her by.oh and btw, the actor that plays aaron peirce from "24" is on here too as a school coach or something....too cool! maybe he can get the producers of that show to get larisa in next season of "24". i only bring it up 'cuz jack bauer is my other tv hero and i'd just love to see cross-over things, lol:). both are set in california, so i'll just keep on dream'n...i can see it now, "let me alone with that suspect for a few minutes....no, i don't need a car battery!"

i used to watch this show when i was growing up. when i think about it, i remember it pretty well. if you ask me, it was a pretty good show. anytime i think about it, i don't remember the opening sequence and theme song very well. in addition to that, everyone was ideally cast. also, the writing was very strong. the performances were top-grade, too. i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though i'm not sure if i've seen every episode. now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.

this is probably my favourite tv show ever. i love all the characters, especially alex, who is the perfect woman! always makes me laugh and feel good when i watch this show. there is just something about it that is amazing, hard to describe.it seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well. here are a few examples. (the episodes start again when they end - but don't play end credits until the very end, but always play the opening credits. with most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some go on further.)radiohead, pink floyd, bob dylan.2.02 'double bogey' kid a / ok computer (episode plays at least 4 times)2.14 'saturn' kid a / meddle / shot of love2.19 'world without alex' kid a / wish you were here / pablo honey(episode plays at least 4 times)there are clues in the episodes which tell you which albums synchronise. kid a may synchronise with every episode!

oh i remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days. it was not a pleasant experience because i remember watching it when i made my homework.still, the show caught my attention when alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems.but the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall.the lead actress (can't remember her name and i'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance. she made the show watchable.they just don't make shows like this one anymore...

these days, you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1) a preteen/teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2) involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy/girl every time 3) revolves around erratic yelling and unintelligible humor. about 95% of shows on disney, nickelodeon, and cartoon network fit the listed criteria. to put in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality, and good story telling. it as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail. they couldn't be more unaware. sure kids enjoy a good laugh and erratic behavior (if it's done to a conservative level and done right), but as they also want to enjoy a story, see drama, and see people being challenged. they don't want to see people living in a flawless world where they get everything they want. they know this world isn't all fun and games, they know it's not perfect. everyone has problems, and we all must learn to work around them. this show revolves around that kind of stuff. alex mack is an average teenage girl who seems to have everything going for her genius sister, annie. her mom works at some office but is sometimes a stay at home parent. her dad, george, is a top scientist at the plant, a chemical corporation that employs most of the town they live in, paradise valley. alex is unpopular and picked on by most of her peers. her only friend is ray (but she gets more friends as the series goes). on her first day of jr. high, alex walks home not too happy about school, but a truck delivering chemicals from the plant crashes into a fire hydrant trying to avoid running her over, dumping a strange chemical known as gc-161, where the chemical mixes with the water, covering alex in it. soon after, she starts to develop strange powers such as morphing into a puddle, shooting lasers out of her hand, and moving things with her mind. she also glows constantly when nervous (though we never see much of that later on). aside from her sister annie and friend ray, alex decides to keep these powers a secret from everyone, even her parents for fear of being kidnapped by the plant, whose corrupt owner, danielle atron has her head of security, vince, search for the mysterious gc161 kid. every episode then deals with alex trying to live a normal life as kid at the same time learning to live with her strange powers. the series may seem like a girls show, but it's not. as a boy, i liked watching this show because of its awesome effects and drama. the producers successfully add some elements of science fiction with the elements of teen drama. in fact, some episodes were quiet violent and a little eerie. the unfounded plant manager atron and vince make good antagonists for the series, for the writers really do establish them as a threat and give you that dreadful feeling every time they come on screen. also, smart move adding david, driver of the truck that spilled the gc-161, as vince's bumbling assistant in the hunt for comedic effect but also you get to love him towards the end. it was interesting to watch little alex try to live as a normal kid but struggles to perfect her powers. at times, you forget that these are kids who are battling a giant adult run institution, because you are drawn in to the story. the show does a good job of relating to kids by showing alex that she may have super powers, but she still is a kid, and must be careful. even some episode you'll find yourself distraught at alex's calamities. my favorite episode where alex wishes she was never born truly demonstrates most of these elements. as i said, the producers never hesitated to add in some laughs whether they come from ray's one liner or george's strange habits or david trying to be a nice guy. of course you come across corny moments and an entire episode that really has nothing to do with the series plot, but what good series doesn't? all in all great show. 9/10

***spoilers ahead*** my late childhood had two cinematographic icons: star wars and this film by czech genius karel zeman. a jules verne encyclopedia where xix century illustrations come to life in exquisite black and white photography, combined with stop motion and conventional animation. verne's spirit of adventure is fully present throughout the film, as well as a very modern questioning on the moral limits of power and advanced technology. in fact, it brings atomic energy into verne's universe in a very elliptic and elegant way. also elliptic and elegant is the demise of the villain, with a (probably nuclear) explosion sending his hat flying over the sea. the resolution of the film is symbolic and very satisfactory, something very rare today, when a lot of films don't seem to know how to end themselves.i was fortunate to catch this gem in reruns on local tv in the late 70s: it enhanced my enjoyment of verne's fiction and of cinema.10 out of 10 for karel zeman, under-appreciated master of imagination.

truly unique and stunning film of jules verne's "for the flag" by the czech master director karel zeman.although the story is enacted in a rather understated late victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of verne that the reader associates in his mind. the style resembles the steel engravings of dore and bennet and riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of georges melies added.photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a saturday morning variety. there are underwater sequences where the fishes swimming about are so accurately drawn they can be used in a field guide.there are images of ships ,submarines, flying craft, castles,and machinery that are drawn in such accurate detail that one must have a freeze frame on his vcr or dvd to pause the scene and study the remarkable detail that went into this production.the late victorian atmosphere is designed to look like this world that never was and delight us in the magic of science that made verne the great father of the genre. if this is not enough, there also is the film score that probably is one of the best ever created for a fantasy or sci-fi film.truly a forgotten classic, this one is worth hunting down and buying. always one of my favorite films of all times, it is sure to be one of yours too. and remember- this was done decades before cgi or computer animation. kudos to the great artists who obviously put their heart into it. it shows. jules verne himself would be proud of this movie.a film that deserves to be better known, but those who have seen it love it-and treasure it. an outstanding achievement , this remarkable film just gets better every time you watch it. a true cinematic work of art from a visionary director.

the movie is based on a jules verne book i actually have read once, about ten years ago. i remember i liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job in telling the story. the most important thing in this movie isn't the story, however, but the highly original visual look it has.the visuals are absolutely beautiful, and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie. combined by jules verne's own unique versions of airplanes and submarines and karel zeman's good directing results in a very well done and convincing visual style that manages to effectively hold one's attention until the end of the movie.there are some problems as well, one of the underwater scenes at the end takes maybe needlessly lot of time for example, as the story in the first part of the movie is rushed through quite quickly. none of this matters much though since the movie is always highly enjoyable. a gem that deserves to be more well known for today's audiences as well. a recommended movie for the whole family.

better than average world war ii-era "who-dun-it" featuring warner baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist now known as robert ordway who helps both the police and criminals who want to go straight. crime doctor's courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problems. the link to "courage" is not particularly clear.this entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter gordon carson whose two previous wives have under mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide but dr. ordway labels murder. hillary brooke plays the part of widow kathleen carson who is involved with anthony caruso - a mysterious spanish dancer whose act includes his sister that disappears on stage. as a mystery novelist, jerome cowan is a good supporting actor as is lloyd corrigan as an aficionado in crime.spooky houses with creaking doors, caskets in the cellar, and suspects that are never seen in daylight add to the air of suspense. the set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music very good. direction, production design, and photography stand out. the exterior shots and costumes suggest more affluence rather than normally found in the average "b" detective thriller.strongly recommended.

another nice entry in the crime doctor series [#4/10], with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some splendid spanish american backdrops and sets. and a more off-the-wall storyline too!a man who looks like the insane murderer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party. the crime doctor is on the scene (ostensibly as a guest) to immediately and resignedly proclaim it murder, and so we are presented with a quite weird set of people to mull over, for one of them did the deed. was it the frothing brother of the dead 1st wife, the 3rd wife and rich widow hilary brooke, the dancing brother and sister vampires, the intense young man, the eccentric cabinet maker lloyd corrigan on loan from boston blackie, the irreplaceable butler, or odds-on jerome cowan? police inspector emory parnell had his work cut out, but warner baxter as ordway was as unflappable as ever in working it all out. one of the goofs listed on the imdb is wrong: on breaking into the murder room ordway says "right through the centre of the forehead" and cowan replies "he didn't miss this time". favorite bits: baxter and cowan travelling through club sandwiches and beer at the nightclub to make amends for their interrupted dinner party; the scene where the braga's place of repose is seemingly rumbled. the plot does seem to meander a bit at times and the way it was all explained off was perhaps more worthy of monogram, but leaving it in the air as supernatural wouldn't do either!well worth a watch if you already like the genre, you won't be disappointed unless you really don't like the genre.

i really enjoyed this film. i'm not usually one for fairy tales or make believe storeys but this film captured my attention.i first saw this film on the uk channel hallmark...which usually shows afew tacky films...but then snow queen came along...and i was loving it! i really really admire bridget fonda in this movie...she plays the snow queen brilliantly and glamorously.i won't explain what the story is about as other people have already done so, so there is no point repeating.i would just suggest that if you want to watch a fun fairy tale journey...get this film...but if you want to purchase it and you live in the uk, you might have a hard time. i've bought it from south korea brand new (english edition of course).

i saw this on tcm recently and, through the imdb i found that there were seven "crime doctor" movies with warner baxter as the psychiatrist-detective. baxter is a bit long in the tooth compared to his stolid performance in 42nd street a decade earlier. not noir, and a bit campy today, the movie also has a touch of the possible supernatural. the plot, black and white cinematography and characters are far more complex than those of the mr. moto and charlie chan series. there are subplots, unexpected twists and appearances by a number of b movie stalwartly we all should recognize immediately (none ever made it to the a status). it is a wonderfully unpredictable 70 minutes.i would love to see a boxed dvd series of these films.

this is a wonderful movie, and i still love it! it just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! i recommend it to people of all ages. i promise you will not be disappointed! the characters are always so engaging, so real, you will just love them! the story of gerda and kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life.i don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, i mean the movie was amazing! i haven't even read the book, and guess what? i don't care. in fact, if the movie and book are so different, then you can just call them two separate stories and be happy with it.i thought the acting was bloody brilliant! bridget fonda plays the snow queen, so evil, and so cold - you just have to hate her. chelsea hobbs plays gerda, a love-struck girl who is determined to find her love no matter what it takes, and goes on a wonderful adventure. and i just love all of the snow queen's sisters (the spring witch, the summer princess, and autumn robber)they are so fun and different in many ways.i haven't seen this movie in awhile, so forgive me if i make a minor mistake.... but there's no doubt that i will always love this movie.

i know the girl who did the figure skating for the lead girl. she once dated my brother and she was always really nice! i also live in cranbrook b.c, about 15 or so minutes from fort steele. haha i used to go there for field trips when i was in elementary school. it was kinda weird seeing it in the movie. i also had the chance when the movie was filming to be an extra because there was a casting call for them at the mall.but i didn't feel like going to it at the time because i wasn't interested in acting. now i totally wish i did. this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay. it never came out here, (which is kind of weird seeing it was partially filmed here) so i was excited when it came. i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.but if anyone has a question about fort steele, just ask away:)

first off, i can remember vaguely being told this story in primary school, about 6 or 7 years ago so i am sort of familiar with the story.a lot of that has changed however, and there are many differences and mistakes (sometimes unnecessary) in the film that die hard fans will not appreciate.however as a whole i really love this film. i first saw it near christmas about 2 years ago (well the 1st part) then caught the whole thing again last christmas probably on the same channel.i was very impressed, at times it may be a bit overdrawn and long, but with an engaging story, decent acting (especially from frosty fonda and hobbs) and beautiful scenery, costume and little touches of magic make this a really special film - which for me really reminds me of christmas.despite differences from the book, i think the film does well to incorporate new themes and ideas (the seasons with autumn, winter etc. with i think a new thief character to represent autumn) throughout the imagery once you notice is quite startling and brilliantly executed.i live in the uk so have waited a long time for the dvd, and luckily enough i saw an advert showing a series of free dvd's being offered in the daily mail newspaper which i don't normally get, so i got yesterdays issue and finally have my dvd. if you missed it and want this rare dvd for region 2 i suggest you collect the tokens from the daily mail and send them off as your dvd will then be delivered by christmas.so for a bit of escape into the christmas season this year, put on your fire, get cosy and watch this as you and kids probably will really enjoy this great film. if you don't have it, it will probably be repeated on channel 4 this christmas, so record it!

enchanting. the best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad. it's all just so cute, all, even the way that white bear loves the queen in secret and gets her in the end, also the achievement the two young actors of gerda and kai gave. it's music is also very nice. the two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once, he'll see the snow queen is not so bad. she only tries to surround herself with love in the wrong way. the evening this movie was on here (first part) i only watched it, because i was bored, but i loved it a lot more after and was very angry, when they didn't show the next part because of the pope's funeral... yeah, that was terribly sad for me. but when they said it will be on next week, i was so happy, that i recorded it and now i'm glad to have done so.

i thought the movie started out a bit slow and disjointed for the first hour. however, it became more absorbing, fascinating, and surprising in its last two hours. so, while it starts out like a cheap horror film, it evolves into a beautiful and wonderful fantasy film.bridget fonda stands out as the snow queen. this was her best performance and it is sad that this apparently was her last performance, as she has not acted in the last 7 years. she absolutely personifies both the beauty and coldness of winter.my daughter, age 14, found the film a bit frightening, so if you are showing it as family entertainment, please stay with your child and reassure her or him that it is just a fairy tale fantasy and not to take it too seriously.it is really one of the best fantasy films that i have seen in a long time, slightly better than "eragon" or any of the "lord of the rings." it is about as good as "the golden compass".

people comparing this movie to big blockbusters like lord of the rings or the matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. the acting talent, although not a-list, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an a-list cast. my particular favourite from this movie is bridget fonda, whose performance as the snow queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup. she injected humanity and a sense of pathos into the character of the fallen season corrupted by the devil's evil magic. fonda aside the acting was not what we have come to expect from hollywood, which i think is a good thing since hollywood seems to have run out of ideas on how to train its acting talent to portray roles and so they have become stale and reliant on cgi and other special effects to take us away from the actors who all use the same tricks on us. instead it shows new ideas some real thinking on the part of the actors about how they can find new variations on the the old themes of love and danger.

note: after writing this review i see that this listing is indeed about the tv series and not the original film. my mistake. i thought imdb for a database for movies, not tv shows. but since most people will look up this film under bagdad cafe and not out of rosenheim, which, strangely, is the name this film is listed under on imdb, i'll leave this comment here.maybe i missed something, but when i read that other review it seemed to be entirely a review of the cbs series -- which must have been loosely based on this film. i did not see the tv series and i might like it or not, but one thing i am sure is that it is very different than this film. this film is not like a tv show at all and whoopie goldberg is not in it or any other famous hollywood stars (other than jack palance, who was very charming in his role).this is a terribly sweet movie that totally thinks "outside the box." it is not at all like a hollywood formula movie, which is probably why the (what's a nice word for idiots?) who decide to market movies or not decided not to market this one.first of all, this movie captured my heart and imagination from the get-go. from the music (which is just part of the time so you can't really call it a musical) to the cinematography to the really cool story.a german or bavarian woman (very pretty and quite plump) gets in an argument with the other german or bavarian man with whom she is traveling through the california desert with and parts ways with him --he taking off in the car and she left to fend for herself on a deserted and desert-like highway out in the middle of nowhere.she finds the small and dilapidated but charming bagdad cafe, in bagdad, california and checks in. the rest of the story is magic. i don't want to try to describe this film because i want you to enjoy every surprise.warning: if you are a racist or have something against big women you will not like this movie, as the main romantic lead is a big woman and characters of brown and red skin have large roles and are included as "part of the mix" without any racism involved.i gave this film a 10 for orginality, entertainment and sheer delightfulness.

you have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one-liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder what all the fuss was about when whistling in the dark opened to such an enthusiastic greeting from audiences in the 1940s.on top of some weak one-liners and ordinary sight gags, the plot is as far-fetched as the tales the fox (red skelton) tells his radio audience. you have to wonder why anyone would think he could come up with a real-life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it. but then, that's how unrealistic the comedy is.but--if you're a true red skelton fan and enjoy a look back at how comedies were made in the '40s--you can at least enjoy the amiable cast supporting him. ann rutherford and virginia grey do nicely as his love interest and conrad veidt, as always, makes an interesting villain. one of his more amusing moments is his reaction to skelton explaining the mysteries of wearing turbans. "i never knew that," he muses, impressed by a minor point that is cleverly introduced.all in all, typical nonsense that requires you to accept the lack of credibility and just accept the gags as they are. not always easy for a discriminating viewer as many of them simply fall flat, the way many comedies of this era do because the novelty of the sight gags and one-liners has simply worn off.

red skelton plays a radio detective known as "the fox" in "whistling in the dark," also starring ann rutherford, conrad veidt, eve arden, virgina grey and rags ragland. wally benton, aka "the fox" finds his plans to marry his fiancé carol (rutherford) thwarted when he's kidnapped by a the leader of a sham cult (veidt). joseph jones (veidt) has just learned that his cult, the silver haven, is not getting a promised inheritance because of the existence of the old woman's nephew, who is going to be living off of the interest. he wants wally to devise a perfect murder plot so the man can be killed on the airplane en route to meet with his attorney. for backup, and because he's not sure which one is wally's fiancé, jones kidnaps carol and also the radio sponsor's daughter (grey).this, to me anyway, is a superior film to the second entry in this series, "whistling in dixie." the plot is better, the cast is better, there is less slapstick and fewer corny jokes. skelton, when he's not making faces and rolling his eyes, is quite amiable, and rutherford is very good. veidt always played these evil men to perfection. eve arden is wally's agent, who arranges a date for him and grey to make sure his contract is renewed. i had only seen grey in films from the 1950s onward. she was always a good-looking woman, but who knew she was such a knockout in the '30s and '40s? this is a fun film with a neat cast.

there are 3 of these movies, all similarly crafted and each extremely amusing. red plays radio sleuth wally benton, aka the fox who gets wrangled into solving real life crimes along with his fiance played by your typical wartime girl next door looker, ann rutherford. many of the one-liners and gags are dumb and probably were in the 1940s which i anticipated. but, just as many actually made me laugh out loud, which was unexpected to say the least. red skelton has a surprisingly strong screen presence, surprising i say because i grew up with a much older version of the man who's charm really didnt play well in my formidable years. i have to give these movies the go ahead though -if your in the mood for this type of nostalgic fare. i almost threw in light hearted, but in truth people get wasted and beaten up and dare i say it, the suspense at times is well above average. as with most movies from this era, it gets a pi (politically incorrect) rating for reasons you can well imagine. wartime is funny that way i guess, and so then again are these movies. watch one, watch them all.

red skelton (in his first starring role) plays wally benton who plays 'the fox' on a radio show. he writes the murder mysteries and as 'the fox' solves them. joseph jones (conrad veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone. he kidnaps benton, his girlfriend (ann rutherford) and another girlfriend (virginia grey). he tells benton to write out the perfect murder...or his girlfriends get it...very funny and enjoyable movie. fast-moving (it's only 77 minutes), a good script and perfect casting really puts this across. skelton is very good in his first starring role--very funny, fast, handsome and intelligent. veidt is excellent as the evil jones. rutherford and grey are lots of fun as skelton's girlfriends. all three of them play off each other perfectly--their verbal sparring is the highlight of this pic. also fun to see eve arden in a small role.well worth your time.

while many pass this off as a b movie it is, indeed, a first class comedy that is well-written and acted. red skelton is great as wally benton better known to radio fans as the fox. ann rutherford is perfect as wally's fiance carol lambert. conrad veidt leads a very well cast gang of criminals. i read one account of this movie which states that vincente minelli directed this film, not unless he changed his name to s. sylvan simon, who directed all three of the fox movies. this is a very entertaining film made when imagination was encouraged. so get over your black and white prejudice if you have one, sit back and enjoy a truly great comedy. this was also red's first starring role. take note during the climax of the reference to orson welles' war of the worlds broadcast.

is there any question that jeffrey combs is one of the true horror greats? this movie seriously doesn't suck and is sort of funny... watching a young combs at work is great but i wish he had had more lines. look out for beyond re-animator. it's going to kick some azz.

even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of black sabbath have not lost a thing. in this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including "n.i.b.", "war pigs", and "paranoid".also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. the comments of ozzy, tony iommi, geezer butler, and bill ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.a must-see for all sabbath and ozzy fans.

this film biography of early rock and roll star buddy holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for gary busey. the movie's highlights are busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings holly songs. he brings such energy to the performances that holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. busey's infectious toothy grin lights up the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved.the film follows holly's career from growing up in lubbock, texas, to stardom and new york and his untimely death in a plane crash. one thing i found interesting, if true, was buddy's driving ambition--he had great plans to go beyond recording and performance to producing. as young as he was he was already establishing himself as a shrewd businessman and definitely wanted to take things to a higher level. we will never know if he would have ultimately catapulted his early success into a business brand like the rolling stones.the lyrics of many of holly's songs are pretty adolescent; read the lyrics for "peggy sue" or "oh boy!" and you will see what i mean. maybe to a great extent this explains his popularity with adolescent audiences, but his instrumentation and stage performances surely account for his influence on groups to follow--both the rolling stones and the beatles have acknowledged his importance.clearly some liberties were taken for dramatic effect. for example, i doubt that holly ever punched out a producer in nashville or that the audience at new york's apollo theater was so immediately responsive as to be wildly dancing in the aisles. if you are interested in getting closer to the truth, see the documentary "the real buddy holly story" (1985) that is produced and hosted by a very relaxed and engaging paul mccartney. this contains interviews with holly's family, friends, and band-mates (holly's musical brothers are not even mentioned in "the buddy holly story"). members of other bands like keith richards and don everly also offer opinions and stories and there is footage of old holly performances. the mccartney production can stand on its own, but it makes an excellent companion piece to "the buddy holly story" and perhaps should be required viewing for anyone who watches the fictionalized story.

first, i'm a huge buddy holly fan. i grew up knowing who he was, and i knew all about that fateful plane ride that extinguished three incredibly bright flames just like that. but i had never truly listened to his music. i had heard much of it, yes, but not until i sat down with the intention of getting something out of it did i truly come to see the real buddy holly. and let me tell you that my world is a different one now because of him.because of this adoration for such an incredible man, i bought the buddy holly story without ever seeing it previously. i'm torn on my views of this film. perhaps it's because buddy feels so alive to me that i just couldn't bear seeing gary busey in this role. i'll admit that he did a nice job acting, but his singing sounded so forced. it seemed to me as if he knew he didn't sound a bit like buddy himself and therefore was using far too much energy to make an attempt at a similar sound. in some parts of the film, he succeeded. but others.. ouch.the movie spanned a period of several years, but i feel that portraying this time span could have been handled much better. i had a difficult time distinguishing at what point in buddy's life certain events were happening. i also had a serious problem with some of the historical inaccuracies. i think the worst one was the portrayal of the crickets. i understand how their real names couldn't be used, and how for simplification there were only two of them in the movie.. and maybe this was a good thing. because the film's background vocals were cringe-worthy, and i disliked the way they were portrayed as a hindrance to buddy's career. something else that really made no difference to the film but irked me was gary busey's teeth. they wore me out! buddy holly had much better teeth. i don't know why i noticed it.. but i did.i'll end this review on what i felt was the best part of the movie: buddy's last performance. his final phone call to maria, the big bopper's performance, bringing him and richie valens to the stage, followed by the still frame ending. it startled even me, and i feel that it effectively shows the audience how at one moment buddy holly was so alive and energetic, and that his flame was snuffed out in the blink of an eye. it was a beautiful way to portray this horrible tragedy i think.good movie, despite the obvious problems.. 7/10.some obvious flaws, could use some work... but not bad.

i saw this (video 2000) years ago and would love to see it on dvd. a good film, but i would have loved it even more if it had included the legacy of the beatles and the hollies etc.i also don't know exactly how true the story is - were some changes made to dramatize the story? i was only 3 when buddy crashed, and didn't wake up to his music until the late 70's. much later i found out our family moved into our new house on - yes, february 3rd, 1959.well ehelhell little things you say and do... his songs will always be remembered - always...

it occurred to me while the final scene of the movie froze to reveal the scant detail of buddy holly's death that there are still people alive today who were at that venue in clearlake, iowa who remember it vividly. that has to be a haunting memory, lent even more poignancy by the lyrics of "american pie", as it pays tribute to the day the music died. the world lost some tremendous talent that day, lives cut short way before their prime, and one can only wonder what might have been if the trio of musicians who perished that day had survived to create an even greater musical legacy.i watched the film today some thirty years after it's original theatrical release. thirty years, i have some trouble wrapping my mind around that. i had forgotten a lot of it, while remembering some of the little things, like the cricket in the wall who became immortalized with the band's name. but most of all, i remember the music. it's hard just to sit there and not begin tapping to the beat of "oh boy" or "that'll be the day", and one has to wonder just where the threat to our morals might have actually come from with those tunes. i'm with buddy on that score at least, how could they be jungle rhythms if he came up with them? funny how each successive decade brought it's own threat to the fabric of society - the beatles, motown, disco and a whole host of other musical forms. we're still listening and dancing to the beat, so i guess they couldn't have been all that bad.there was another takeaway from the film i had forgotten about. this is where i learned to bang a phone on the table when the person on the other end wasn't seeing things my way. i've done that a number of times over the years, but by now had forgotten the source. well, i should be good for another thirty years or so now.you certainly have to give gary busey credit for his portrayal of buddy holly. seeing him today, one could never imagine him as the slimmed down rocker with the horn rimmed glasses, but it was a tour de force characterization and performance that earned busey an oscar nod. don stroud and charles martin smith are competent as buddy's band members, though their characters take a back seat to much of the story. i enjoyed the subtle ways that other musical legends were segued into the picture, names like sam cooke and king curtis, without ever dwelling on their presence. i'll always be a fan and follower of music from the fifties and sixties - 'oldies' they call them now. i guess that makes me a bit of an oldie too, but you can't replace the experience of growing up with the music history that now makes it to the big screen. which only goes to reinforce the idea that i'll keep on enjoying the music until, well, the day i die.

i've commented once on this chucky great, but i had to do it again to say some things about the film, when i first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. the film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because i cherish chucky. the other horror villains are referenced with great coolness!!! and the gore was shockingly great! the scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful! that was a great gore scene!!!!! and the ending was so bizarre and shocking it made me s*%@ my pants. the idea of having the seed of chucky was very, very bizarre and shocking! when i left the theater i just loved it and i could'nt believe it was real. the bizarre and different qualities of this child's play installment for some reason made me mark it as the jason goes to hell of the child's play series. it just had that intensely shocking, bizarre and different quality that reminded me of jason goes to hell. a sure ***** out of *****. here's how i rank the series : 1,4,2,3. i loved it but not quite as much as tom holland's original child's play classic. i can't wait for seed of chucky! bring it on!

the movie doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)!this film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. it knows it sucks, and because of that, it's far and away the best of the "child's play" series. it plays up the "stoopid humor" angle so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing at it, but with it. and, trust me, the whole time you're laughing, it's laughing back atcha.

i would say 'bride of chucky' is a "return to greatness" but the series was never really great. very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and i think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. and it contains the best subtitle/tagline: "chucky gets lucky." so he does, in the role of jennifer tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as jeri ryan did for 'star trek: voyager.' tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for chucky. and as much as i liked her in the feature, she can't get all the credit: the props (watch the first 1-2 minutes for horror-homages), the writing, the inside jokes (again, the opening + pinhead) and chucky lines were great ("in fact, if (this) were a movie, it would take 3-4 sequels just to do it justice," among others.) mercifully, chucky and the series has given up on andy the "hide the soul" quest, and just settled for a new way out of his body. he teams up with his ex (tilly) whom he transfers into a "bride" doll and a couple of bonnie & clyde teens (really, heigl?) to regain this pendant buried with chucky's human corpse. this is for any chucky fan, 1980s slasher-horror fans or even to those who's never seen any of the previous 'child's play' films. it's funny, dark, harmless, gory  but not over the top and despite tilly's literal 20 minutes of screen time, it's always great to see her. after all, you barely see her play poker anymore. (side note: of course, i picked up on the superman reference  hackensack, nj.)

sexy murderess tiffany (jennifer tilly) still yearns for a life of wedded bliss with ex-boyfriend, crazed killer charles 'chucky' lee ray. after getting her hands on the mutilated good guy doll that last played host to his spirit, and doing a spot of repair work, she conducts a satanic ritual that returns his life to the toy.unfortunately for poor tiff, the reanimated maniac shows no interest in marriage, and so she traps him in a cage, with a bride doll for company. eventually, a rather angry chucky (voiced by brad dourif) escapes his confines, electrocutes tiffany in the bath, and traps her soul in his 'bride' as retribution.realising that they are now both in the same predicament, the plastic pair put their differences aside and decide to head for hackensack, new jersey, where they can lay their hands on the magical amulet that can relocate their spirits into human hosts. tricking trailer park hunk jesse (nick stabile) and his tasty girlfriend jade (katherine heigl) into taking them to their destination, the psycho dolls embark on a murderous rampage, with their unwitting companions copping the blame.although the idea of a kid's doll being possessed by the spirit of a mass murderer has always been rather comical, it wasn't until the fourth film in the child's play series that the makers fully embraced the sheer lunacy of the premise, opting to plays things much more for laughs than for scares (although there is still plenty of ott splatter for us gore-hounds to enjoy).talented hong kong director ronny yu oversees proceedings, deftly translating the witty tongue-in-cheek script into a slick and thoroughly enjoyable cinematic ride. similarly, the excellent cast handle the camp material perfectly, with stabile and heigl making a likable couple, but smoking hot tilly stealing the show as blonde, buxom, pouting, pvc-mini-skirted temptress tiffany. kevin yagher's impressively expressive doll effects also go a long way to making the film such a success.overall, this film is unlikely to find many fans amongst 'serious' horror aficionados, but those who enjoy the odd spot of mindless popcorn entertainment, full of twisted, black humour, crazy death scenes, and magnificent cleavages should have a blast.

chucky (the murderous doll from "child's play" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. but his ex-girlfriend tiffany (jennifer tilly) gets his remains and (using "voodoo for dummies") revives him. then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, she is killed and has her soul put into another doll! together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (nick stabile, katherine heigl) to take them to chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make chucky and tiffany real people again...a lot better than it sounds. after the last two sequels to "child's play" (both of which were horrible) i was expecting the worst, but this actually was lots of fun. the movie doesn't take itself seriously for a second (seriously--how could it?) and the lines and situations are actually quite funny. also there are a few very gory murders thrown in to satisfy us horror fans and the film never stops moving. the movie also has a few things usually not found in a horror movie--a gay best friend (gordon michael woolvett) who is intelligent and not played for laughs and a sequence in which stabile has his shirt off just to show his muscular body. john ritter has a nice cameo too as a sheriff.the acting is good--stabile is young, very handsome and likable; heigl doesn't have much to do but pulls it off and brad dourif (the voice of chucky) and tilly are hilarious as the murderous dolls. my favorite part is when the dolls have sex (don't ask) and she asks for a rubber and he responds, "but i'm made of rubber!" the special effects are good (no lousy cgi here) and this is one of the few horror films to mix humor and violence in an entertaining way. well worth seeing. i give it a 9.

bride of chucky starts late one night as officer bob bailey (vince corazza) sneaks into the evidence room at his police station & amongst all the horror film in joke props he steals the remains of the chucky doll that serial killer charles lee ray possessed way back in the original child's play (1988). he drives the remains to an isolated area where ray's ex girlfriend tiffany (jennifer tilly) slashes bailey's throat & takes the remains back to her trailer. there tiffany stitches & staples chucky (voiced by brad dourif) back together again & using a 'voodoo for dummies' book brings him back to murderous life. thing don't go as tiffany had hoped & chucky turns out not to be the man of her dreams after all so she locks him in a play pen at which chucky is less than happy. while tiffany takes a bath chucky escapes, electrocutes her & using that book brings her back to life in the shape of a female doll dressed as a bride. neither want to be stuck in plastic bodies & have to work together to get to a cemetery in new jersey where ray's natural body had been buried with the amulet needed to switch their spirits back into human bodies. the bodies of tiffany's neighbour jesse (nick stabile) & his girlfriend jade (katherine heigl), who are both on the run from jade's corrupt uncle chief of police warren kincaid (john ritter), will do nicely...directed by ronny yu i love bride of chucky. the script by don mancini is great fun, very fast moving, highly entertaining & references plenty of other horror film with good affection. from the opening sequence where we see jason voorhees hockey mask from the friday the 13th films, freddy krueger's razor blade glove from the a nightmare on elm street series & michael myers mask from the halloween franchise. to the clips used from bride of frankenstein (1935) when it virtually recreates the same scene. bride of chucky never takes itself seriously which is just as well, there are lots of one liners, self referential gags that scream (1996) made trendy a few years earlier & it doesn't seem afraid to poke fun at itself & the horror genre in general. i love the scene when jesse & jade are having a clichéd slushy romantic conversation that chucky hears & he makes funny derogatory comments & gestures throughout. that's not to say that there isn't a damn good film in there as well because there most certainly is. director yu manages to create good atmosphere & a real sense of fun, both human & plastic sets of characters are likable & shine as each pair suffer their own sets of domestic problems that the trail of corpses that they are leaving behind would obviously cause. technically bride of chucky is great for the most part & has that big budget polish about it & at about $25,000,000 i should hope so. the only thing that i will say is that some of the puppet effects by kevin yagher are a little stiff & unconvincing, i can't remember any cgi scenes in bride of chucky either. thankfully the film doesn't neglect the blood & gore with a cool slit throat, nails blasted into someone's face in presumably a hellraiser (1987) homage, people impaled on shards of glass, someone being bloodily obliterated by a huge truck, a ripped off lip piercing & various stabbings & gunshots. the acting is pretty good & dourif as chucky is very funny as he spouts the one liners out. i also like the scenes with tiffany at the beginning & find her very sexy when she's wearing all that fetish gear, i can't be the only one surely? i personally think bride of chucky is a fantastic film, total entertainment from start to finish, great humour & horror in equal measure & at only 85 minutes long it never becomes boring or dull. a personal favourite of mine, watch it as soon as you can!

"bride of chucky" is one of the better horror movies to come out in the past ten years and could be one of the best horror films of the 90's.**spoilers**chucky's girlfriend, tiffany (jennifer tilly) manages to find his battered remains after being sucked into the fan at the end of part 3 and brings him to life in her trailer park. her neighbor, jessie (nick stabile) and his girlfriend jade (katherine heigl) are being tormented by her uncle. (john ritter) tiffany upsets chucky when he refuses to marry her, so she buys a doll for him to play with. chucky kills tiffany, and then transfers her soul into the doll she got him. in order for them to be placed back into human bodies, they have to travel to new jersey to retrieve an amulet to do so. jessie sees this as an opportunity to escape from ritter, and they set out on the journey, but not before ritter is killed by chucky and tiffany. along the way, several bizarre incidents force them to stop at a bed and breakfast. when several more people are killed, they call up their best friend (gordon woolvett) to straighten out the situation. they convince him neither one of them are the killers, as the police have began to solve the crimes. he finds ritter's body in a trunk in the back of the van. thinking he has been set up, he confronts them about it. chucky and tiffany then turn real to prove they did it, which gets woolvett killed. the group steals a motor home and arrives at the cemetery. jessie and jade get chucky and tiffany to turn on each other, giving them enough to escape. chucky recaptures jade and forces her to get his amulet. chucky and tiffany restart their feud, which gives jessie and jade enough time to kill the both of them as the police arrive and clears them of the crimes.the good news: i have to give the most amount of props to the fx department, as chucky and tiffany as dolls look completely convincing. the scenes with them together are the movies main highlights, including a hilarious conversation where tiffany advises chucky on how serial killers in the 90's work. that being said, the amount of one-liners in this movie that are actually funny is incredible. chucky gets the most of them, but tiffany cracks a few gems as well. it is actually funnier than what hollywood calls comedies these days. the gore is plentiful and shockingly realistic. several deaths in this movie are actually original and creative. turning ritter into a new form of pinhead was a totally brilliant scene. the honeymooning couple was a nice death scene, as well. for teenage love, the pairing of stabile and heigl works great. they have a great chemistry together and actually behave like a normal couple. i also have to admit that the first time i saw this movie, i did jump during certain scenes, and that shows what an incredible job director yu did. he learned enough, apparently, to do the same thing with "freddy vs. jason." he knows how to stage set-ups and pay-offs, and here he shows some great skills that have a hong kong influenced look and style. he could be the next great horror director if he keeps filling up his resume with films like those two. nice soundtrack, too, like "freddy vs. jason."the bad news: for fans of cheesy movies, this will be a great find. however, this film has a high cheese factor that may prevent the serious horror movie fan from having a good time enjoying this film. the film knows it is a cheesy movie and revels in it, making a serious fan turned off because of things like the one-liners. it isn't all that bad of a movie, but it has to be watched in the mind frame that it is a cheesy movie, and that the cheesiness of certain scenes add to the movie, not to take it away. remove yourself from that state of mind and you may find yourself enjoying this movie.the final verdict: fans of cheesy movies and the other "child's play" movies will find a lot to like about this movie. for serious horror fans, take a look at it, but keep in mind that it isn't a serious movie and that the cheesiness is supposed to be there and you might find yourself liking it.rated r: graphic violence, graphic language, brief nudity on a doll, a shadowy puppet sex scene, some drug use, and numerous drug references.

now this is the sort of film we used to get weekly . now-a-days it is rare to see a drama that depends on the cast talking to each other.there are no explosions, car chases or any chases,there are implied sexual situations.this is not film for the younger crowd, it is for those that appreciate people talking to each other,they do argue a lot as we have married couple having mid life problems.emily watson & tom wilkinson are seemingly a very happy middle aged loving man & wife. now living in this same small london suburb, handsome, rupert everett returns home to visit his wealthy father.he of course meets emily watson, it would be easy for anyone to be smitten by emily. i say no more, except that as the credits begin there is a fatal accident,the rest of the film is about the repercussions of this accident & all the lies the various characters tell..the acting by this trio & the others is excellent.julien fellows wrote the screenplay based on a novel by nigel balchin. he also directed, this was his first directorial attempt & he did very well. the entire production is first rate.the film had a few month theatrical run in late 2005, is under 80 theatres. this to me is a shame, stupid comedies open on at least 2000 screens but real good drams as this & many others open in only a few.by the way there are some very funny lines regarding certain situations.ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) imdb 9 (out of 10)

loved today's show!!! it was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. she is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too. i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things, but she did it and by golly i'll be writing those recipes down. saving time in the kitchen means more time with family. those who haven't tuned in yet, find out what channel and the time, i assure you that you won't be disappointed.

ok, so i loved rachael ray before, but now, i adore her! how innovative. i love that she has a cooking section- i admit that occasionally i skip that part, only because it makes me waaay too hungry! but i also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website. i love that she has regular helpers and that she's made some of her viewers become her regulars. i love how personable she is and how creative she is. i also like how she does her mystery guests. she just seems so much more genuine than so many other talk show hosts. she still gets a little starstruck occasionally and i love that. i love that she talks about her personal life on there and reminds people how happy she is. she's even mentioned tabloids before and it's so funny! she also has the funniest stories! anyway, i'm a fan for life. even my 2 year old knows who rachael ray is and he loves her too!

rachael ray appeals to viewers of all ages and backgrounds, beginner cooks or "seasoned" veterans. you'll be dazzled with a variegated presentation of delectable yet time-efficient dishes, jazzed up with her unique brand of spunk and candor. most importantly, this hip chic keeps her audience drawn in by stimulating all five senses. let me explain. her program provides enlightenment to your visual sense, auditory sense, and sense of feeling through a rich, luminous ambient backdrop, light-hearted, casual, yet engaging topics, eye-pleasing, appetite wrenching meals, and her hearty smile and laugh, which will simmer down anyone's nerves.(sense of smell and taste are rewarded when you test out the recipes in your own kitchen and among your own family and friends). check out her show guys.

i've been a fan of rachael's since the beginning of 30mm on the food network, so i have seen her grow over the years. the minute i saw her interact with oprah, i predicted that this show would happen, because i saw how taken oprah is with her, and with good reason: she comes across as very natural, and willing to laugh at herself, which is very engaging. the set is appealing, and there are some fresh ideas (i love the lazy susan that the audience sits on). there's just enough of a celebrity segment, and she stays away from controversy and debate (there's enough of that on daytime tv). the show is a lighthearted escape, and she hasn't moved away from her strength (cooking), which is very good planning. i know there are people who hate her and hate her show; that's ok, you can't please everybody. and somehow, i think rachael knows and accepts that. so just turn the channel; i don't think she'd mind.

then again, i like rachael ray. she is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch. i have to alter just about everything she makes as i am a vegetarian...but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. after all, she is a television personality. i think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down-to-earth. the studio audience appears to be rather small, but that just makes for a cozier environment. some people have posted that the show sucks. i guess it depends on your own interpretation of it and of her. if you notice the early episodes of 30 minute meals you will see a completely different personality than in those of the past few years. i'm sure she will find her comfort zone with this show as well. good luck rachael!

i just returned from viewing this academy award-nominated doc, and i was thoroughly touched and interested in exploring the works of this fellow i'd never heard of before. of course i'm someone who's captivated with beautiful architecture, so i realize others won't care.we can only imagine if there had been a couple more visionaries in philadelphia back in the late 60's when kahn's plans were a possibility, what a wonderful city center there would be. if you wonder whether you'll see more about the bangladesh building at the beginning of the movie, be patient, for there it will provide the climax of the film at the end. his son's personal discoveries in the process of making this film are quite interesting, sometimes touching, and even funny at times. there is one of the most comical anti-visionary rants ever captured on camera.rounding out the good points of this doc is a touching musical score with some excellent expressive string music. and expressiveness is a major point to be found in kahn's architecture. the points made by other architects about the spiritual nature of matter, and how kahn's buildings brought that out tie together the overall experience of this movie.

video vault by shawn k. inlowmy architect: a son's journey 2003 - nathaniel kahn not rated: 116minutes vault rating: 7what a thing to be fatherless. "my architect: a son's journey" follows philadelphia filmmaker, nathaniel kahn, as he desperately seeks answers from his father, the renowned architect, louis i. kahn, dead these 30 years.louis kahn died in a train station in 1974 and left behind more than one family. the funeral service, when the filmmaker was just a boy, was, shall we say, an unpleasant surprise.we find that nathaniel only knew his father en passant, from his sporadic visits with his mother, whom, we are told, he loved deeply. this movie is about a boy seeking his father and perhaps himself by visiting his work, as if the magnificent structures hold some secret. to be sure, louis kahn was a gifted architect, but "architect" is a cold word. the man was a sculptor on a grand scale who spoke of his craft in airy terms of silence and art.among his notable works, explored lovingly in the film, are the salk institute (1965), the kimball art museum (1972) and the monumental capitol complex in bangladesh (1983). the portion of the film where nathaniel first visits dhaka, bangladesh, finds the work, but not the man.the film benefits greatly from having much footage of the very public man as he worked in new york city and as a professor at yale and the university of pennsylvania. many of khan's contemporaries and collaborators also help flesh out the filmmaker's ghost- father.even so, the viewer seems not to come to a particularly satisfying place. the answers nathaniel khan is looking for seem hollow. not good enough.in scenes where the director meets with his half sisters, both from different mothers, one can feel the tensions of the years, the slights and hurts. one might expect them to burst into anger, but only the camera saves them from hostilities. each of these children has visibly lost something.it might be pointed out that khan, who seemed a driven perfectionist, never became rich. instead, he became noteworthy. it was as if he sacrificed his family for his art. this is a crushingly sad and great thing.april 28, 2005

an absoloutely wonderful film that works on several levels. it's a story about a great architect, a son seeking his father, about very loving relationships, and about loss. it's also a great flm about architecture.very intelligent and very moving. a real treat.

i think the title of the movie describes it well. if you are looking for a documentary on louis kahn and his work, you'll have to look somewhere else. although some of that is covered in this film.of course, i eat up pretty much anything i'm fed, and i don't know much of the family history revolving around this case. so i believed what i was told about nathaniel and his father, etc.for what this movie was, i thought it was pretty good. a little slow and grabbing for attention at time, i wish that nathaniel would have focused a little more on his father's work than his family drama (although much of the history was interesting, louis was a bit of a player).this really is a journey through someone's life, and i was happy to tag along for the experience. a learning experience for me, and so it seems, for the filmmaker as well. oh, and the footage of some of kahn's work is *stunning*

i rented this film because it was a documentary and highly rated. it's more a study of a bastard son trying to find out who his biological father was, than anything about architecture.more than anything else, the underlying theme of the movie is that we have an eccentric, highly praised, possibly genius architect who had little regard for anything or anyone outside is profession.the tragedy of the film is the broken families he left. his baby-mothers came across more as scorned fans than irresponsible women, which can only have negative results on the children.that said, nathaniel, the producer of the film and son of louis khan, came across as fairly stable and curious, if not bitter. the people he interviewed were of course more interested in talking about louis khan's buildings than his personal problems, but i find the mix of themes made the film interesting.as for his buildings, i found them like abstract art - strange, non-practical, and usually only appreciated by so-called critics.

louis khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. his son's desire to find out who, and more importantly what he was is moving, and emotional.this film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about, what good design is, and the emotional price that is paid for it. equally haunting is the sound track. if you see the film, and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening. as a practicing architect of over 30 years, my heart ached and rejoiced over the film and its very straight forward, albeit emotional honesty and sincerity.i had the honor of seeing this film previewed in chicago at the national convention of the american institute of architects. the film was introduced by daniel, and he was kind enough to do a question and answer session afterward. during the entire presentation of the film, not a sound, not a cough, not one distraction took place. the entire audience sat mesmerized, and the real treat, was daniel's mother was present during the showing of the film.i will always remember the film, and play it over constantly in my mind every time i listen to the soundtrack...

i never heard of architect, louis kahn, until this documentary. in this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, nathaniel kahn, explores his father's life from estonia to the slums of north philadelphia to the university of pennsylvania in west philadelphia where he studied and taught. he travels to bangladesh, israel, connecticut, trenton, and la jolla, california as well as new york city to explore his father's creative genius. personally, louis kahn had three families including his wife, esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter sue ann. nathaniel includes his family members. louis also has another half-sister alexandra tynge from his father's previous relationship with anne tyne, a fellow architect. louis' passion was his art.

i have no read the novel on which "the kite runner" is based. my wife and daughter, who did, thought the movie fell a long way short of the book, and i'm prepared to take their word for it. but, on its own, the movie is good -- not great but good. how accurately does it portray the havoc created by the soviet invasion of afghanistan? how convincingly does it show the intolerant taliban regime that followed? i'd rate it c+ on the first and b+ on the second. the human story, the afghan-american who returned to the country to rescue the son of his childhood playmate, is well done but it is on this count particularly that i'm told the book was far more convincing than the movie. the most exciting part of the film, however -- the kite contests in kabul and, later, a mini-contest in california -- cannot have been equaled by the book. i'd wager money on that.

i just saw it at an advance screening i haven't read the book, but heard many good things about it.the movie was absolutely fantastic, very moving. with a roller coaster of emotions you totally connect with the characters. shaun toub was great, it was a complete departure from his usual roles, and his acting for those who understand persian/dari was incredible.one thing to notes it that khaled hosseini actually loved the film which is unusual for book adaptation movies. even after seeing the movie several times "he was sobbing".also the animation from the intro was exquisite, with names displayed as if it were persian calligraphy, very unique! at times the translation was not clearly conveying the message efficiently, but all in all this was a great movie.

the kite runner was beautiful, poignant and very moving. i particularly loved the two child actors in the film as well as the actor portraying the father. it really made me want to go back and read the book again.the music was a wonderful part of the fabric of the movie. if there is a soundtrack coming out for the film, i will buy it to accompany my second reading of the book. it is also a visually stunning film. the cinematography was gorgeous and really added to experience.the brazilian word 'saudades' is very descriptive of how i felt at the end of the film..."it is a deep feeling of longing for someone or someplace, which is very sweet but also tinged with an inescapable sadness" (definition provided years ago by antonio carlos jobim).saw it at a small cinema here for an advance screening. i would love to see it again on a really large screen with a tricked out sound system.can't wait for the formal release. i will definitely recommend the film to friends.

this is one of my most favorite movies of all time. pretty pathetic you say? well, yeah it is. but chris is incredibly, incredibly funny. his innocent brilliance comes out in this film more than in any of his other films. look at both motel scenes, when spade gets caught with his zipper down, and the other: "just go away for the love of god!!!"

one of the funniest movies made in recent years. good characterization, plot and exceptional chemistry make this one a classic

the one-liners fly so fast in this movie that you can watch it over and over and still catch new ones. by far one of the best of this genre.

farley and spade's best work ever. it's one of the all-around funniest movies i've ever seen. watch it once and you'll be hooked and soon have all the lines memorized. no sleepy for tommy boy!

for fans of chris farley, this is probably his best film. david spade plays the perfect cynical, sarcastic yin to farley's "baby huey" yang. farley achieves strokes of comic genius in his monologues, like the "let's say you're driving along the road with your family..." bit, the "jo-jo the idiot circus boy with a pretty new pet, (his possible sale)" speech, or the "glue-sniffing guarantee fairy" brake pad sale. the sappy moments in the film contrast sharply with farley and spade's shenanigans. even after many viewings, it's still fun to see farley pour everything he had into the role. "richard, what's happening to me?!?!"

this movie probably isn't the funniest i've ever seen, and it certainly doesn't have much redeeming value. in fact, it is really nothing more than a collection of vignettes tied together by a loose plot. however, this "make-it-up-as-i-go-along" attitude actually works to the film's advantage. "tommy boy" succeeds as a comedy for the same reasons that the snl skits farley and spade starred in succeeded: their well-timed extemporaneous silliness and mayhem makes them humorous despite their immaturity.

well, of course the critics hated it. this isn't a movie that's going for the big-time critical acclaim. but the fact is that it's really very good.sure, if you don't like that chris farley brand of physical comedy, or the exceedingly dry wit of david spade, you're not going to like it. but for the rest of us, the movie has many hilarious, and for that matter quotable, sequences, and the plot isn't half as dumb as that of "black sheep." the parts that aren't meant to be humorous are actually done well, not what you'd expect from a movie of this ilk, and the acting is really pretty good."tommy boy" is without question chris farley's best movie. i give it an a and suggest you give it a view.

out of the many films i've seen, tommy boy is a rare film where i can watch it over and over and it's still funny. david spade and the late chris farley do their best in this film and is a must-see by anyone who's a fan of the spade-farley duo.

i was one of the few who went out of my way to see this in the theater. i've thought about it frequently ever since. after two dvd viewings i'm glad to say it held up perfectly. like any great comedy, i laughed more on each viewing, both in anticipation of gags, but also after catching things missed before. mike judge does very well with creating insanely comedic characters and fitting them into their world so they make sense. in office space, the environment make the characters believable. idiocracy's future gives him liberty to write unbelievably dumb characters and make them work. i'll be waiting to see if they release a better dvd with some actual features before buying it. but this movie deserves the support on dvd not offered to it at the theater.

i recommend idiocracy to everyone. luke wilson is very funny, the movie is insightful and made me laugh so hard i had tears running down my face several times. until the end, when i took a breath and realized just how close we are to mr. judge's vision of tomorrow.keep an eye out for a cameo by the guy from the mac commercials (justin long)as dr. lexus. i found his performance oscar-worthy, especially considering what oscars have been handed out for in the recent past...besides, he's cute.in short, idiocracy is a fatally funny glimpse into a possible future where people are named after product brand names (the president's middle name is mountain dew), hospital visits cost $5 billion dollars, there are mountains of garbage because no one is smart enough to figure out what to do with it all, and nobody cares about anything but money. all because only stupid people are breeding. sounds familiar to me, somehow. oh, yeah; it's what i think of when i see professional wrestling...seriously, watch this movie. it's a good laugh and it will make you think.

this movie deserved better. mike judge's satirical wit brought to light something too many in this country are trying to deny... we're getting dumber as a society.could the 24-hour-a-day anna nicole coverage be any more proof? mike judge paints a frightening future, where the dumb survive and thrive. makes you stop and think, and laugh. can you look at the world and not ask are we getting dumber? are we being overtaking by the human trash as well as our own trash? (beware of landslides).the movie is really funny. i'd tell you more of the plot but i don't want to spoil it.so why release this film with zero promotion? could it be that the stupid are already taking over?

i like money! i stumbled on this brilliant film in a local video store last week. wasn't sure what to expect. brought it home, set up the player and then my journey in to stupidity began. the first viewing i did a lot of chuckling, no laughing out loud really. it wasn't until the second viewing the movie really started to take a hold on me and the humor was that much funnier. it reminded me of austin powers, first viewing it was all right, then the real fun began telling people about it, just talking about each scene and the set up. i'm making all my friends watch this movie, everyone i know. this movie may very well be one of the most accurate "future" movies ever made. this movie is more then just 84 minutes of entertainment, it's a warning to the future of our civilization. mike judge, the fantastic mind who brought us office space has brought us a vision of life in the automated future. luke wilson's dead pan humor as "average" joe enhanced the movie that much more. watch this movie then once you're done, read more! write more! think more! for the futures sake if not for your own!

this movie is funny and sad enough i think that it is kinda true. if you love office space then you will love this movie because it is another mike judge hit, but it is nothing like office space. i told every one to see this movie. i only wish that it would have been in more theaters so it would have gotten the recognition it deserved. i love this movie and would love to see more from mike judge. luke wilson is also what makes this movie what it is. i am so glad that i will not be alive in the year 2505, because if this movie turns out to be true we are all in for a lot of trouble. i just hope more people see this movie because i know that they will fall in love with it too.

yes, i know that this movie is meant as a comedy! and the humor is over the top! but the theme about people getting less intelligent in future time might not be so far fetched! i cannot say that it will happen,but if we don't take proper care of our educational system than this could be a possibility! i have noticed that some schools aren't teaching facts anymore! (like history,geography,basic stuff). the focus is more on learning practical abilities! the theory behind most subjects may be boring but is essential in understanding how things work! in the movie there is this ridiculous example of people growing crops with gatorade in stead of water! well,we can laugh about it! but if you never been taught that water contains minerals necessary for plants to grow so how would you know! to me this is a scary notion! so now you understand why this subject isn't funny anymore! it could be that mike judge is making fun but at the same time is warning people for a real disaster if education doesn't improve fast! am i taking this movie too seriously! yes of course! to each his own fun! i loved mike judge's work (beavis and butthead and office space)! in these he was able to be critical and funny at the same time! in "idiocracy" i missed this! most of the events are too absurd and as i said earlier very scary! i do think if you are in the mood you will like this movie!

this must be the dumbest movie i've ever seen and therefor it deserves a special award. ok, so it begins pretty good, logical, humor and then rapidly changes to complete and utter uh f@rt,@ss, föck stupidity that makes total sense. the strange thing is that i hardly laughed at it, though i guess it is supposed to be funny, with a very serious message. after a moment of thought why i didn't laugh, the answer was pretty clear... this movie is a lot more realistic then i would like it to be. so it is extremely dumb, yet very wise if the object was to reach people which aren't 'blessed' with a whole lot of neurons and synapses and electrolytes (huh, electrolytes?). this movie might actually be understood at some level by a big audience!although they probably just laugh.ah well, nice try...i am now editing (well adding to) my comment, cause i read some of the other comments. first i noticed some people see racism in this movie. well, that did not at all cross my mind when watching it. however, i can imagine if you are looking from that perspective, you will see some. we could of course debate the link between intelligence and race, but i think this is not the place to do so. i wonder, if we were to rate the huxtable family here, would you complain about them all being black? i don't think so, but i guess you could... (aside from that, from the 2 wisest people in the world, half, the woman, doesn't seem totally caucasian to me, so 'what the problem is?')secondly the movie gets very mixed ratings; from 1's to 10's and everything in between, but a lot of polarisation there, which means the movie does its job very well! it stirrs people up, makes them want to speak about it and judge it. that means it is a good movie, whether you like it or hate it. after 5 minutes it becomes very predictive and boring even, yet you keep watching this utter crap. i guess you keep hoping that it isn't so. or maybe it's our sick way to look at terrible accidents. well, this is one for sure.

i had never heard of this film when a good friend recommended it. i trust this friend's taste, so i purchased the dvd. my wife and i sat down to watch it with no knowledge of what it was about. i thought it was the funniest film i have seen in a long time, mainly because i saw the truth in the satire. i strongly recommend this film to all my friends.this is not a film for everyone. some people will see the crass humor and aura of stupidity, and find idiocracy to be one of the stupidest movies they have seen. what these people don't seem to understand is that the crass humor is there, not to amuse the audience, but to show what appeals to the morons in the future.luke wilson is well cast as an "average joe." he is mainly there to be a foible for the biting commentary about society that is spread throughout this film. many of the funnier bits are in the background, so it is easily worth seeing several times. what makes the movie even funnier, and more scary, is that i see elements of it in every day life, in people i meet or on the media. then, i go back and re-watch idiocracy, and realize how good it is.the few people who have seen and enjoyed this film are able to be part of an elite club. i'll see an advertisement for some product with some breakthrough new ingredient, and turn to my wife and say, "it's got electrolytes!" she knows exactly what i am saying.

i am rating this an 8 because of the premise of the film. the acting was fine, there wasn't anyone that stood out as amazing or appalling. it is disturbingly true that intelligent people are having less and less children, or choose to have none at all...whereas dumb ass "w in '04" supporters are procreating like rabbits. and, though i don't believe the earth will actually exist in 500 years, i can see mike judge's parodied prophet coming to be, as life imitating art. the world is being run by idiots, and it will get worse as the intelligent free-thinking people become the minority and the "git 'er done" fans outnumber them. the proof is our farce of an election.but i digress. if you are fortunate enough to have this playing in your city, go see it. i have paid my $7.50 plus popcorn to see far worse rubbish than this (date movie or napoleon dynamite anyone?). there are laughs, there are cringes, but overall this is entertaining. if you have half a brain, you will think to yourself how this movie, though funny, is spot on (accurate) and a *tiny* bit uncanny. i'm not surprised at all that this movie is almost completely unknown, as fox was the one distributing this, and they wouldn't want any of their sheep to see this and think "maybe i will read a book, and not watch 'next', or 'cheaters', or 'ow my balls'." if our society doesn't stop the dumbing down of everything,and the bastardisation of the english language (ahem, mr. bush), then this really is where we are going.

this movie is brilliant.i don't remember this movie even being in theaters, so thinking it was a "straight to dvd" i have fairly low expectations, even though i am a big fan of mike judge. it has some of the same kind of comic future satire as "brazil" and "demolition man", but taken to the next level.then i saw the cast; luke wilson, maya rudolph and dax shepard, who were all brilliant in their roles.needless to say, this movie won me over in the first 5 minutes, where it shows above-average people having fewer children and the poorest, stupidest, trashiest people having lots of ignorant children, and how this is leading to a kind of reverse evolution. it takes that concept, and then shows where we are headed with this pollution of the gene pool.sadly, i don't think it will take the 500 years as depicted, but probably only about 50. i already see the shocking rise of "mild retardation" in the general populace, media and culture. people who like classical music and art are ridiculed instead of respected. the lowest common denominator seems to rule, especially in hollywood and on tv (eg, "jackass the movie" and any reality show where they make you eat something disgusting or humiliate yourself for money).all of the political/social satire aside, this movie is also just laugh out loud funny! and i don't say that lightly; few movies make me actually "lol", but this one did.a lot of the best jokes are word/sight gags in the background, so you really have to pay attention to get some of them. i even had to pause and zoom in for a few of them (like when joe got his government id and for "hair" it said "yes" and for "eyes" it also said "yes"). also, the prison has engraved on the front "house for particular individuals", since the cops in the movie (much like real life cops) call everyone "individuals" instead of people, etc. again, this was on the screen for just a moment...this is one of those movies you can watch again and again and dissect it to get through the layers of funny.also, i normally watch movies with the subtitles on, and that clued me in to some jokes that might pass by your ears in the dialog mix, for instance, the police constantly talk about people "excaping" instead of "escaping", and there are many other mis-pronunciations that just cracked me up. but again, i might not have picked up on them just by the dialog mixed with music/sound effects; it is very subtle but still hilarious.additionally, the special effects were really good for a sci-fi/social satire.i could go on and on, but overall, i think this is one of those movies that if you don't think it's funny, it's probably making fun of you! i plan on recommending this to many, many people!

you can read all kinds of references into the world of idiocracy. a futuristic world populated by pampered, self-indulgent morons spoon-fed by the technology of a bygone era: this idea has its precedent in h.g. wells' "the time machine" and aldous huxley's "brave new world" amongst other satires.early in the film, a narrator explains the quick degradation of humanity over five hundred years, but does not fill in the gaps of where all the futuristic technology came from in the meanwhile. most of the criticism of this very fun (and funny) film seems to surround this omission, and the resulting complaint that the world isn't "realistic". as if "realism" has ever been a necessary quality of satire. is "brazil" realistic? how about "futurama" or "transmetropolitan"? hell, how about "gulliver's travels"? i thought not. "idiocracy", while maybe not as pointed as the best of the genre, hits the same notes and generally does so successfully.besides, i didn't find the futuristic technology to be a problem. it is pretty easy to figure out that mike judge is satirizing the current trend toward automation and simple product interfaces, so that even total idiots can use them. as in "brave new world", the society in the film seems to have reached a point of automated self-sufficiency at some point in the past (apparently created by the now-extinct 'smart people' in order to placate an increasingly stupid populace), leaving the remainder of humanity free to indulge all the worst, most selfish impulses they can come up with, and grow even stupider. the film just happens to take place during the last gasp of humanity, as everything begins to fall apart for good. it may still be "unrealistic", but if so, it's a remarkably well-presented brand of unrealism.the stupid people take up most of the screen time, of course, but they're just the victims -- they don't know any better. mike judge saves his real hate for the intelligent people in power who are dead by the time the film begins, but who are very much alive right now, in the 21st century. people like scientists who chase "hair growth and prolonged erections" for no other reason than the possibility that they'll turn a profit on their snake-oil treatments. people like politicians who let corporations simply purchase the fda and fcc. people like media executives and their yuppie stooges who promote stupidity -- who enable the destruction of all culture, morality and health to make a quick buck.after all, who is really to blame, the morlocks or the eloi? the paris hiltons of the world, or the brilliant executives and advertisers that put her on tv and lowered our cultural standards enough to leave her there? this is all implicit in "idiocracy", though. a line here, a hint there (witness the hilarious auto-doctor which literally does all the work in the health care system). it's one of the few aspects of the movie that's not pounded into the ground by the unnecessary narrator. it's just there for the viewer to pick up, or not, but it is one of the most interesting themes in a movie that's much smarter than any other comedy of the year.pity that so many people will leave the film thinking it's just an excuse to show rear ends farting and people being hit in the groin. not that that stuff isn't funny too, and maybe it is a little pandering. but in "idiocracy", it's just not as simple as it seems.

mike judge's idiocracy is an interesting film, and one that his fans will undoubtedly track down and see.before i start the review, i would preface it by saying that if you get a chance to see it, definitely do, as it is worth watching, and isn't the easiest film in the world to track down.let's start with the premise - luke wilson is private joe bauers, an army librarian who is deemed to have absolutely no outstanding attributes or glaring flaws, making him totally average in every way. this, along with the fact that he has no living relatives, makes him a standout candidate for an experimental cryogenics procedure. also frozen with joe is a prostitute named rita who was pimped to the project by upgrayedd, her abusive pimp. unfortunately, a few days after they are frozen, the top secret project is abandoned, and they are forgotten about.they wake up in 2505, and find that with the dumbing down of society following the trends of recent times, everyone on earth is only slightly more intelligent than a chimp. the way that "everyman" joe bauers talks is seen as being "faggy", much as someone speaking like shakespeare would ridiculed now, and a former professional wrestler is the president of the united states (actually, this one probably isn't that outrageous really). the best show on tv is called "ow! my balls!", which admittedly sounds pretty good, and not only is everything spelled wrong, but signs seem to have run out of space for the wording, leaving them to be bunched up at the end.it's a funny premise for film, but this is the problem - aside from the initial premise, not that much in the movie is truly funny. what i mean by that is that the ideas that come to mind from having read the premise of the film are probably about as funny as the film itself. obviously, it's not terrible, but it probably could have been funnier.there are some winners in the script, such as starbucks now offering "happy endings", and people placing their blind faith in the universally misunderstood "electrolytes", but they are just too few and far between, so unless you are going to laugh hysterically every time one of the idiots of the future slurs out a slack-jawed, profanity laden sentence with little to no logic and/or intelligence, then the laughs might be pretty well spaced.it's unfair for everyone to be comparing it to office space, because it's a very different film, but as a film, regardless of what came before it, idiocracy is a funny concept that will probably have you laughing a lot more in the opening 15-20 minutes than in the rest of the film.i give it 5 out of 10 because it is enjoyable, but doesn't do enough to raise it above middle of the road.

most people are totally unaware that this movie exists. fox, which paid judge to make it, has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it. i guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer. well, i am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe. basically, judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin. then these stupid are getting more stupid, by basically spending all of their time watching tv and having sex, which produces more stupid people. by 2500, a person of average intelligence today, will appear to be a genius, that talks "all faggy." seriously, is this really that hard to believe. oh sure, this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. luke wilson is great as the time traveling army guy, hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time. where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny one-liners, like "can we family style her" and "hey man, i'm 'bating here!" this is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an american society that seems to be fatuated with self pleasure, comfort and stupidity, and i guarantee you that i will be buying this on dvd the first day it comes out and watching it over and over.

we just saw this movie in austin texas at the alamo south lamar yesterday afternoon. it had me laughing out loud many times! the scene about albert einstein's thoughts on humanity hit me over and over and i couldn't stop laughing. it's too bad it's not in more theaters, i know a lot of friends that are dieing to see this movie! "welcome to costco, i love you." ... great work to all involved! also, if you see it, make sure to stay until the end of the credits as well! i'm going to take my family to see it again this weekend for sure! if you're a fan of office space and beavis and butthead then you have to go see this movie. it's a classic and no one knows that it's out! so if you're in the mood to see something funny this weekend, definitely check it out.

there is a lot wrong with this film. i will not lie. i will say that most of the problems feel like they stem from a budget that was chopped out from underneath the flick, and some bad hack job editing.this is not office space. do not go in expecting office space levels of comedy. it is very funny though. it is a mess, but very funny at the same time. a funny mess of a film. in the way that caddyshack is funny. a mess of unrelated funny scenes filled with some very annoying unfunny scenes.it works as a whole though, and it certainly deserves a wide release. this is the best commentary on the wal mart/ starbucks/ mtv nation you could hope for. the very fact that a film is exploring the idea that dumb people are breeding at an alarming rate while the intelligent people are not, is great in my book. not very politically correct but worth at least some debate.

this movie is "the" stupid comedy of the year, and quite possibly the best thing from mike judge since "office space". if you are a mike judge fan, or enjoy shows like futurama, then you are doing yourself a grave disservice by skipping over this little known, limited release. although the dvd touts very few "bonus features", this film is certainly funny enough to make up for it's perceived "lack of value".this movie is about an army grunt by the name of joe bowers (played by luke wilson) who is part of a top secret army experiment designed to preserve army personnel in peace time so that they can be thawed in war time to fight for our country. however, things take an interesting turn as the general in charge of the operation is busted in a prostitution ring and the experiment is all but forgotten. bowers, and his sidekick rita (played by maya rudolph) both find themselves awake in the year 2505, where through the course of natural selection, the population of america has grown increasingly stupid. now joe and rita have to find their way to a time machine to get back to the year 2005 with the help of frito (played by dax shepard).what i really enjoyed about this movie was mike judge's comedic satire on the course of us history over the last 50 years, and how mankind progresses over the subsequent 500 years. this is most evidenced by the advertising in the movie, which has become a staple of the american culture. with shows like south park in the mainstream media, it's easy to see how conclusions could be drawn that in the future, profanity has become a marketing tool. this is portrayed in the film humorously with subtle things such as "fudd-ruckers" changing their name to "butt-f###ers", and a billboard which displays the advertisement "if you don't smoke tarryltons... f### you!". i also cannot stop laughing at carls jr.'s role in this future, with their slogan "f### you... i'm eating", and their automated kiosks self-advertising their "extra big-a## tacos". (with more molecules)! this film contained everything i go to the movies for. excellent, sharp, witty comedy, as well as an engrossing plot make this dvd one for the ages. be warned, however. if you are not a fan of mike judge, did not care for "beavis and butthead", or do not have a sense of humor, then this movie probably isn't a good match for you. otherwise, i would say this is probably the funniest movie to come out of 2506... i mean 2006.

first, let me say that although i generally appreciate mike judge's work, i've been merely tepid in my response to office space, king of the hill, and beavis and butthead. i generally prefer more intelligent comedy, and therein lies the irony with respect to idiocracy.in a future world where the embodiment of beavis and butthead's views, basest instincts, and intellectual capacities are the framework of a chaotic, messy, semi-mad max semi-blade runner society, where every trailer-trash guy's fantasy becomes reality, a man with even average intelligence is threatening and accused of talking gay, and the mob mentality takes over. and this world is also incredibly funny.yes, it's obvious that carl's jr., starbucks, costco and fuddruckers executives will be horrified at the twisted values given their products in the year 2505.there were some missed opportunities with the film, and the relationship between the time travelers - the other being an average intelligence woman who's worried about her boyfriend's (pimp's) retribution - could have been stronger; the chemistry is there. and there don't seem to be too many women in the future.i did leave with a grin on my face, but the experience is a bit better than the memories. thus, it's my kind of popcorn film, and it will be fun to revisit on video. recommended! fyi stay through the credits for an extra scene.

"idiocracy" is the latest film to come from mike "office space" judge, and it certainly follows a similar theme of that film in the fact that it is an observation of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome adversity... relatively speaking. it is a story about joe bauer (luke wilson), who is, quite literally, the most average guy in existence. joe, and a prostitute named rita (maya rudolph), become the test subjects for a military project of a hibernation chamber. they were to remain suspended for only one year, but due to lack of oversight, joe and rita are forgotten about and accidentally wake up 500 years in the future.here's the scary part: this film explains, in a very realistic and plausible way, how the entire population of 2505 became absolutely retarded. with no natural predators, the evolution of the human species does not necessarily favor the quickest, smartest, and strongest people for progression of genes... just the people who breed the most. unfortunately, those people happen to be welfare-sucking, trailer trash idiots who breed like rabbits. this abundant reproduction of the stupid people has caused an adverse effect on societal growth and now joe and rita are the two smartest human beings on the face of the planet. if it helps, imagine the entire population as just a hybrid of rednecks, jocks, cholos and hoochies. seeing this nightmarish dystopia, joe learns of and attempts to track down a time machine to see if he and rita can get back to when they came from, and that's basically the whole plot.but despite how one-dimensional i may make it sound, this movie is higher brow than you can fathom. nuances are everywhere and anyone can see glimpses (warning signs, if you will) of modern day dumb-ciety permeating facets of everyday life and turning it into the train wreck on display in "idiocracy." the film has some truly awesome showcases of realistic retardedness put on a pedestal. i don't want to give anything away and ruin jokes for you, but let's just say that it is pretty thorough. i can see how some would say that it is just a lot of toilet humor, but it, odd as it may seem, has a purpose; to show how dumb and crass these people are.this film, unfortunately, is destined to see the same fate as its predecessor, "office space"; no one will see it in theaters, but everyone will brag about discovering this awesome/funny movie when it comes out on video. my only complaint for the film would be that the flow of the narrative sometimes gets broken so they can do a hitchhiker's-guide-to-the-galaxy type exposition on how things got to be where they are, but it is a necessary evil and is implemented better here. other than that, good characters, funny jokes, and better-than-average social commentary wrapped up in a funny bow.final note: if seeing our youth becoming gang-banger wanna-be's, acting like redneck/ ghetto trash and being proud of it... if you are educated and cultured in anyway and can see how our country is spiraling out of control into an abyss of stupidity, for god sakes, watch this movie.

i've never seen a movie get a worse release then this. and that's a shame, as this is the funniest film of the year! you would think an ad with the line "from the director of "office space"" would be enough to warrant a big release! but there are no ads, no posters, no website , i doubt the stars even knew it came out this weekend. what is 20th century fox thinking? mike judge's sci-fi comedy is set in 2505 but it could come true in about 10 years (if things continue as they are.) luke wilson and maya rudolph get frozen in a top secret army experiment and wake up in a future full of consumer zombie inbred retards. the film reminds me of woody allen's "sleeper" ,"robocop", "planet of the apes", "blade runner" and "network" and the late great "futurama". try to see it before fox burns all the prints!

a lot of things in this futuristic satire are more theoretically funny than actually funny (though it does have some laugh-out-loud moments) but a lot of that is because it seems to have been cut by the studio to better appeal to exactly the idiots it's mocking. many situations aren't allowed to develop, there's obvious overdubbing of expository material, and worst of all a narrator explains everything (most of which needs no explanation), probably because some preview audience didn't understand what was going on. in other words, a movie about dumbing down has been... you guessed it.one hopes that a longer, better version of this comedy will eventually surface on dvd, and it will become the cult fave it deserves to be, but even in this mutilated and somewhat comic- spirit-diminished form it's one of the more memorable films of the year-- a screech of disgust against our culture and all the ways it's become trashified, stupidified and uglified in the name of appealing to the yahoos. i watched it right after land of the dead, george romero's latest milking of the single idea that consumers = zombies, which is basically the same point judge is making; yet where romero's counterculture viewpoint (now zombies = underclass that needs to revolt against the rich) seems hopelessly out of date, judge's take is fresh, dead-on and far more disturbing. just listen to the yahoos in your movie audience whooping it up for president camacho's state of the union just like their counterparts on screen, and you'll know that we're all doomed.

as social satire, idiocracy is just as good as office space, but with a wider scope. to criticize this film as too puerile due to potty humor is to kind of miss the point, i think. there are certainly fart jokes etc., but they're not really intended to be funny to the audience - they exist to define the state of "culture" in the world of 2500 ad visited by joe, as a background to the bizarre state of affairs in which he awakes. the real humor of the film lies in the many sight gags and attitudes present in this future society that are just a shade off of what we encounter in our daily lives, and which should serve as a warning. my personal favorite is the depiction of fox news. the subtle brilliance in the film lies in the fact that it also digs at "smart" people, and average joes like the protagonists. note the times in the film when joe and rita almost subconsciously conform to the idiots around them, and you realize that idiocracy is not created to pick on any group of people in particular, but on the culture of idiocy in general. i don't know what to say about the "made for conspiracy theory" behavior of fox in releasing this film, but if it's not playing in your local theater, demand it. we all need to see this film, if not for the social commentary, at least for the fart jokes...

i'm not sure why there are no articles or posters or anything about this film because i just saw it and thought it was awesome. i guess it's not for everyone because it's basically kafka's "the trial" meets "beevis and butt-head", which is a pretty tough combination to swallow. still, i thought it was great. if you're going to see it because you want a sequel to office space you're probably going to be disappointed. but if you want to see one of the most brutal, acid-tongued, and hilariously honest looks at where our society is headed you're in for a treat. i just saw the 8pm show opening night in los angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater, which means the film will probably be gone in a week. that's really a shame because, in its own way, idiocracy is one of the best satires to come along in quite a while. but then again it's basically making fun of the people who make up about 99% of the movie-going audience so i guess it's no wonder the studio panicked and tried to dump it.

shame on fox for dumping this movie. it was a total riot and i only hope that it will find a second life on dvd and cable.this is a hilarious satire. it takes the "what if" situation to an extreme and it doesn't pull any punches (or kicks to the groin). it makes you think... what is to become of this empire once we've gotten totally to lazy and stupid? everyone gets hit in this one esp. a number of major corporations, and even fox news takes a punch(which is probably why the movie never had a proper release - other than the marketing department over thinking the campaign and not knowing how to market it "so we'll just give up!") some may find the movie sophomoric, due to the groin kicking, and farting, but the movie is much more than that. you either get what mike judge is saying, or you don't. most of the negative reviews i've read seem to come from people who just don't get it or are film snobs.it'll probably play for one week in the selected markets so if you miss it, keep an eye out for the dvd, it'll be worth the rental and i will eventually have it in my collection.good job mike judge, it's a shame that you got screwed, but you made me laugh out loud and i look forward to the next movie you do.

let me start by saying that if you're expecting subtle humour, you're in the wrong theatre. it's low-brow and heavy-hitting. but he's not out to tickle your funny bone. he's got the sledgehammer out and he's drawn a bead on the side of your head. but fear not. as movies go, this is a fairly gentle education. oh, also, heavy on the swearing, but once again, mike judge, not fred rogers.was this movie called 'intelliocracy'? f*** no. the gem, the essence that is mike judge is that he has the ability to make people laugh at themselves. beavis and butthead was most popular with teen-aged boys, the very people at which it incessantly poked fun.with that in mind, i don't think the humour in this movie is aimed at the super intelligent. maybe you are all too smart to get it. but he's not aiming at you. he's aiming at your average joe. and he's got a message: get your act together and for god's sake, study botany! it is a little disjointed and the narrator gets to be a little irritating after a while, but once again, this movie is meant for people who need a lot of narration ;-) it's funny. it has a message that it wants to make sure that we all understand.i question the casting of luke wilson in the role of a man with a 100 iq. sometimes, he's not able to play down (what's he got, like, a 104?) to the level of his character. slightly forced at times.kudos on dax shepard in this one. i remember seeing him in zathura and thinking, "this guys looks like an idiot." in this movie, he makes a great idiot. maybe i'm psychic.it took a while to warm up to maya rudolph, but i gave her a little leeway. after all, she did have to play straight man to an entire planet. but once she got a little screen time, she made a solid contribution.terry crews played the same psychotic, aggressive character he's played many times before, but he makes a first-rate president none the less.another bonus is that the place was practically empty. counting my girlfriend and i, there were literally six people in the theatre. we could've had a barbecue pit and a mariachi band. so, no annoying people talking, as appears to be the norm in the 'talking-to-the-tv' age.all in all, a good premise and a competent delivery, given the intended goal. lots of laughs sprinkled throughout.what made this movie scary was the fact that when we walked out of the theatre, it was sort of like the movie was still playing. we saw a lot of idiocy in the people immediately around us, maybe made more apparent by the dose we got in the theatre....they're all pods, all of them!

this movie was quite a pleasant surprise. i had anticipated it for a long time, and was afraid going in that it couldn't possibly live up to my expectations.it exceeded them.i adored this movie.hilarious from start to finish (stay until after the end credits!), it is absolutely remarkable how a movie about dumb and annoying characters can be so intelligent, witty, and engaging.with it's obvious matte paintings, the movie's future earth recalls the planet of the apes series and other sci-fi movies of that era.in fact, this movie is essentially planet of the apes, but with people who are the mental equivalent of apes.it moves at a fairly brisk pace, and luke wilson carries the movie quite well, with a character that recalls the one he played in "bottle rocket." (there's even a not-so-subtle nod to "bottle rocket" in an early scene).maya rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former "painter" who was frozen as well.despite all its strengths, "idiocracy" has the distinct feel of a movie that was taken away from the director/editor before it could be fine-tuned.i cannot for the life of me understand why a movie this funny would just be dumped into a few theaters with no advanced screenings, no trailers, no marketing whatsoever.it's as if the studio decided they were not going to spend any more on it and just walked away.or maybe they thought the movie had the makings of a cult classic, and the only way for it to become a true cult classic was to set it up to fail? whatever the case, it is a shame, because mike judge and this film in particular deserve better.i predict this movie will have real legs on dvd, and word of mouth will propel it to the success it deserves.perhaps the fox executives saw themselves in the characters, were confused, and thought it was a documentary?

there's no other word for it...fox dumped this out, with no marketing of any kind. nobody in the country, other than those who have been looking forward to this film, know anything about it. all the red flags have flown. it has to be a mess, it can't be anywhere near as good as office space, right? wrong. though office space it ain't, this film definitely has satirical bite and wit. it's a misfire on certain levels, but who's to blame is left to mystery.based on what is currently showing in theatres, i can say idiocracy is a good movie. it's funny, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. it's effective, sometimes ingenious. what it isn't as far as i can tell, is finished. we will see something come of this film again, whether it's an extended cut or reshoots. alone it can be hilarious. it's ballsy at times.leaving the theatre, looking around at the mall, i was surrounded by advertisements and billboards, commercialism and stupidity. it's not quite as damning a dystopia as 1984, but this movie paints an ugly future for our culture. and there doesn't seem to be much anybody can do about it. anyway, go see this if you can and try to find out what happened that it was so specifically buried.

a good x evil film with tastes of "james bond", "romeo and juliet", and, maybe, even "star wars".the evil count von bruno receives an english gentleman as a guest for a very dangerous hunt. elga, the beautiful simple and well intentioned lady that was forced to marry the count provides the love triangle. the count missing eye points to a terrible past. the englishman is not what the count thinks and is a terrible treat to him. there is also the terrible hunchback, crocodiles and even the side appearance of some torture instruments.boris karlloff, here in a support role, makes an strong, but somewhat stiff, presence. the other actors (and direction) are the symbol of an era the strong representations of black and white movies. since the beginning there is no doubt of who is the evil guy, who is the good one. even traitors and stiffs can be identified somewhat easily.

the black castle is one of those film's that has found its way into a boris karloff collection and is mistakenly expected to be an outright horror movie. whilst some horror elements exist within nathan juran's movie, this really is a multi genre piece that's tightly produced and effectively portrayed. joining karloff, in what is a small but critical role, are richard greene, stephen mcnally, lon chaney jr, rita corday, john hoyt & michael pate. it's produced, unsurprisingly, out of universal international pictures. the plot sees greene's english gentleman travel to the castle home of the sinister count von bruno {mcnally}. he's following an investigation into the disappearance of two friends, an investigation that is fraught with danger and surprise at every turn.this has everything that fans of the old dark house/castle sub-genre could wish for. genuine good and bad guys, a fair maiden, dark corners for doing dark deeds, devilish traps, ticking clock finale and we even get a good old fashioned bit of swashbuckling into the bargain. the cast are all turning in effective performances, particularly greene and the wonderfully sneering mcnally. whilst jerry sackheim's writing is lean and devoid of the pointless filler that has so often bogged down similar film's of this ilk. a very recommended film on proviso that karloff fans understand it's not really a karloff movie, and perhaps more importantly, that horror fans don't expect blood letting to be the order of the day. a fine atmospheric story with a sense of dread throughout, the black castle is a fine viewing experience. 7/10

when i saw lon chaney, jr. and boris karloff in the cast, i was expecting to find a typically "schlocky" 1950's style horror movie. the opening scene (a graveyard with a wolf howling in the background) seemed to confirm this. once i began watching it, though, what i discovered was a nifty little mystery about an englishman (richard green) seeking to discover what had happened to two of his friends who had disappeared in the black forest and, if necessary, to take revenge against the evil count (stephen mcnally) who ruled the territory. chaney, as the voiceless gargon, had a rather limited role (one which reminded me of the hunchback of notre dame, actually) while karloff had a somewhat more substantial role as dr. meissen. in fact, meissen was one of the more interesting characters in the movie, and it was difficult to know until the very end whether he would be established to be a good guy or a bad guy! the castle set was magnificent, and even the limited depiction of the black forest was real enough. it certainly didn't come across as low-budget, compared to other movies i've seen anyway. the only disappointment, i thought, was rita corday's performance as the countess. she seemed somewhat dry and didn't seem to put much passion into the role.that aside, i found that this movie held my attention throughout, and there was enough suspense about how this was all going to turn out to make it well worth the watching. definitely recommended, with a 7/10 rating.

this is the ultimate, and i mean the ultimate, adventure classic! the plot is good versus evil. there have always been an abundance of films that depict gray areas, and not enough on the basic good against evil to account for the real cases of good against evil in the real world. only recently have film makers tried to even the odds. in real life well over half of situations are black and white, but only a fraction of movies make it seem that way. this movie is the best example of a back and white look. it is best seen in black and white. the hero is in the worst situation. he is in the territory of a man who wants to murder him, and among various enemies. the movie gives the feel that he is hopelessly outnumbered, and can't count on help. his enemy (the count), has numerous resources. the count's wife was forced into marriage with him, and she knows from his past history that sooner or later he will kill her as he does all his wives. she and the hero become allies and fall in love in away that could win over anyone watching (unless that person just wants to be a contrary brat). anyone who helps them is killed. they have no escape. the situation is hopeless. so will they survive in the end? you won't guess unless you've read spoilers. the movie also has a lot of great atmosphere, adventure, and intrigue, along with lon chaney as a bad guy, and boris karloff in his best role ever, as a decent guy. usually cast as a bad guy, karloff was at his best when presented with more complex roles such as this one. chaney was rarely given a complex role, although he strutted his stuff in a few movies such as "of mice and men." this is little more than a cameo for him. still, the tension never stops. there is suspense and danger throughout. perfectly written, perfectly cast, and perfectly directed. this is what a movie should be-pure escape, pure adventure.

the best thing -- and that's pretty good -- about the black castle is that it's a black-and- white forties' gothic grabber featuring a murderous mad count which was somehow made in 1952. the star ostensibly is the british actor richard greene, a capable leading man who reminds me of an earlier version of roger moore. the villain is a mad count played by stephen mcnally, who does a credible job except when he's called on to laugh maniacally. skulking around in the shadows is a long-gowned boris karloff in a decidedly secondary role of an aged doctor who may or may not be the salvation of our hero. it's the middle of the 18th century in austria and sir ronald burton (greene) is determined to find out what happened to two close friends. they disappeared in the vicinity of the castle belonging to count karl von bruno (mcnally), deep in the black forest. it seems that sir ronald and his friends had been instrumental in defeating a brutal plan of von bruno's in africa three years previously involving slavery and ivory. the count was left not only with failure, but with a scar on his face and a black patch he now wears to cover a ruined eye. von bruno vowed revenge, and it seems he might have been partially successful. so under a false name, sir ronald arranges for a hunting invitation from the count, and off we go by carriage through a dark journey of storm and howling wolves to the count's castle. it's a hulking mass of stone turrets and corridors, shadowy stairways, huge fireplaces...and creepy passages that lead to dank dungeon cells, a torture chamber and a great pit filled with snapping, thrashing crocodiles. it also is filled by the count's lovely, blond, sensitive wife, elga (paula corday, who sometimes is billed as rita corday), and by the count's two close friends played by those two actors we know from the fifties who specialized in being slime in costume, john hoyt and michael ansara. there is a dangerous leopard hunt, forbidden kisses, knuckling servants, wooden signs creaking and swaying in the cold wind and poison in a cup. not the least, doctor meissen (karloff) has a special vial filled with a drug which will so slow the bodily functions that death will seem to have occurred. the risk is that...well, when the person awakes ten hours later, he'd better hope he's not already nailed shut in his coffin. surprisingly, for all the clichés, the black castle keeps moving merrily along. the movie takes itself seriously, but it's competently enough made to keep our interest, even if we wind up sitting back with a smile while we watch. it's even reassuring in a way to realize there are strong echoes of the most dangerous game. when burton realizes just how crazy von bruno is, he becomes even more determined to bring von bruno to accounts. and, naturally, he has fallen for elga. von bruno, crazed by vengeance yet crafty and capable, is a man who loves the hunt and is engorged by the kill. hollywood's second creative rule has always been, "if you're going to steal, steal from the best." it's first creative rule, of course, is "if you're going to steal, steal from the best and then turn it into liverwurst." the black castle is a nice bite of austrian braunschweiger.

universal studios. the name conjures up so many memories to horror fans of beautiful matte paintings...er...landscapes, fog-enshrouded countrysides, full moons, howling wolves, taverns and torch wielding mobs. yet, it is quite strange looking back on those films, how little the era which produced the true classics lasted. the '30's had it's masterpieces, but those were mostly from the same directors and many of their films are mostly of historical interest today. the '40's produced more mindlessly fun matinée films than it did high art, and most fans agree that the classic era of the gothic horror films ended in 1945 with 'house of dracula', bumped around with the abbott & costello comedies, and was officially dead by the 50's and the coming of the atomic age.so it's strange that perhaps one of universal's finest gothics was made in the '50s! that alone makes the film an oddity, since costume dramas were on their way out everywhere. it may not be comparable to the all time classics like the james whale films and 'the wolfman', but damn does it condense all the fun elements of those films into one delicious treat! get ready for nothing but pure entertainment! since various social mores had changed, the film also indulges in violence that would not have been allowed in earlier eras; there's no blood, but we see characters shot and stabbed directly, and there's even a burning torch to the face!the film may not really be a horror film, but it sure has the atmosphere, look and feel of one! it begins in the dead of night with howling winds(and wolves) as two men seal the tombs of two apparently dead young lovers, but wait! one of them is not dead, but he can't move! he's trapped, but talking silently in his own mind, unable to communicate! what is his story? now that is how you start a horror film....english businessman sir ronald burton(richard greene, giving one of his best performances)sets out under the alias of richard beckett to investigate the disappearance of two friends of his who disappeared at the castle of one-eyed austrian count von bruno(did sacha baron cohen see this?). it seems many years ago von bruno posed as a god to the natives in africa to steal ivory, he was exposed by burton's men, and the natives disfigured him. now he is lusting for revenge.the film has all the clichés, a jonathan harker-style ride to the castle, an inn full of wary villagers, death traps, and a hulking manservant(lon chaney jr.). the torture chamber scenes are genuinely suspenseful, including a panel in the floor that activates a dungeon door(which makes for an ingenious getaway scene later on), a hunting expedition involving an imported panther(!!!??)and even an alligator pit! and then there's the romeo & juliet-style fake death that leads to the film's prologue....the plot is cliché and the world-view is black and white. but it's still incredibly entertaining, with director nathan juran making every scene pile on the atmosphere and seem fresh and new. there are several plot-holes, too. why does ronald attempt to leave the castle so early? and he never does solve the mystery of what happened to his friends even though it's obvious, but he doesn't know that when he gives up, and he seemed so sure earlier. weird.all of the actors are great. despite being a rude upperclassman, richard greene makes burton one of the most likable protagonists i've ever seen in a horror film. rita corday is excellent as the count's 'peasant wife' who becomes burton's love interest, she may have the stereotypical 'falling in love with just a glance' problem of all film heroines of this era, but her portrayal of a long-suffering woman in a loveless marriage to a sadistic monster is very convincing, she also shows a suspicion and wit few film heroines of this era do, even seeing a forced attempt by burton to quiet her(and to paw at her necklace, although it is simply to analyze it as it has an important clue) as a rape attempt, yet she never seems nasty in her paranoia, the audience sympathizes with her. even though he fails to make von bruno seem truly foreign and otherworldly(he is a villain in a horror film after all), stephen mcnally gives a truly chilling performance as the sadistic nobleman. when he reveals his burnt eye, and laughs maniacally, it is truly scary. lon chaney jr. is also great as his mute henchman gargon.but the best performance is undeniably by boris karloff as the mysterious physician dr. meissen. he has little screen time at first, but steals every scene he is in. it is a performance that is both creepy, sad, mysterious and ultimately, heroic. as he leers evilly as he applies leeches to one of bruno's henchman, spies on our hero and speaks in that famous 'you know i'm up to no good' voice only karloff could make, you wonder whether if he is a hero or villain, always skulking about. and although he does function as the main agent of our hero's escape, he still shows human frailties such as greed and fearfulness for his own life, even cold-bloodedly poisoning a man for burton's benefit before he even gets burton to agree. his plan to help our hero & heroine escape also puts them directly in the clutches of von bruno as he arranges an amazingly sadistic(if unbelievably flawed)death for them that had to have inspired similar scenes in corman's poe series. he may not have much screen time, but this is easily one of boris's best performances.while the ending may seem abrupt and anti-climatic for some, half the fun is getting there, and there's much excitement to be had. kick back and relive the days when heroes were heroes and villains were villains. it's no masterpiece, but it's escapist fun at it's best.

all boris karloff fans will love this classic film, where karloff is the castle physician and gives his patients excellent attention. sir ronald burton,(richard greene), an eighteenth-century english adventurer, believes his two friends have been murdered by count von bruno,(stephen mcnally) on his black forest estate. arriving at von bruno's castle to accumulate evidence, burton learns von bruno's unhappy wife elga (paula corday),. and dr. meissen(boris karloff), the castle physician, are virtual prisoners. suspecting burton's motives, von bruno and gargon (lon chaney jr., ) a giant, mute scarred henchman, discover the englishman was responsible for their being captured and tortured. you will definitely have to view this great classic karloff film to enjoy the ending.

the british noble sir ronald burton (richard greene) decides to search his two best friends that have disappeared after visiting count karl von bruno (stephen manally), an evil and powerful man who lives in the black castle. sir burton travels undercover with another identity, since he fought against count von bruno in afrika with his two missing friends and the count lost one eye in a battle. when he arrives in the castle, he is invited to hunt in the black forest around the castle with the count,.while he looks for evidences that the count has killed his friends. later, he and the count's wife, countess elga von bruno (rita corday), fall in love for each other and with the support of dr. meissen (boris karloff), sir burton and the countess try to escape from the claws of count von bruno. "the black castle" is an excellent movie from a romantic time, with action, romance, mystery and even horror. the story is gripping, and is a great entertainment for any audience. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "o castelo do pavor" ("the castle of the fear")

this is a prime example of uninhibited filmmaking at its best. richard greene (who does good in the role) search for his two missing friends takes him to the black forest domain and castle of one-eyed count bruno (stephen mcnally), a past enemy of his whom he has never seen face to face. incredible film has so many awesome elements combined (for once) into a single film--a crocodile pit; a hulking mute (played by lon chaney, jr.); a crafty doctor (played by boris karloff); a leopard hunt (very well done and very atmospheric); a love story; a castle; a swordfight; a sadistic, one-eyed count and his two evil accomplices (played by john hoyt and michael pate!!!); an intriguing background story which makes the film even more interesting; and more!. jerry sackheim's script doesn't allow itself to be bound in--making a film that comes extremely recommendable to anyone who is into unlimited filmmaking with a touch of horror and atmosphere to it.

hilarious, clean, light-hearted, and quote-worthy. what else can you ask for in a film? this is my all-time, number one favorite movie. ever since i was a little girl, i've dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble.the cliché characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun. the wonderful comedic chemistry between stephen furst (harold) and andy tennant (melio) make up most of my favorite parts of the movie. and who didn't love the hopeless awkwardness of flynch? don't forget the airport antics of leon's cronies, dressed up as hari krishnas: dancing, chanting and playing the tambourine--unbeatable! the clues are genius, the locations are classic, and the plot is timeless.a word to the wise, if you didn't watch this film when you were little, it probably won't win a place in your heart today. but nevertheless give it a chance, you may find that "it doesn't matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do, you've gotta play."

it was high time a movie about the situation in a largely ignored asian country like myanmar had to be made and beyond rangoon is hollywood's answer. initially i thought hollywood would dramatize the events of the 8888 uprising and add in the traditionally hollywood spice of titanic-type love between the lead heroine and the burmese male lead who happens to be an old man. thankfully, nothing of that sort was in place - which may also explain why the film was not financially successful.anyway, the film was honest-to-god and i was glad at the accuracy of events portrayed. apart from the fact that filming was done outside of myanmar in malaysia & thailand and that i missed the exotic burmese locales, i could not find much fault in the film.you cannot blame the film for the desperation of the people and the resulting overwhelming actions. it is after all, real events of a civil war. the music by hans zimmer is definitely the usp of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection to it.i was only a year old in rangoon (now yangon) during this tumultuous time. when i heard a movie was made on my real-life experience which i was too young to absorb, i had to get the dvd and needless to say, i could hardly have any complaints about it as it is an eye-opening wonder for me.

"beyond rangoon" is simply marvelous. from the traumatic opening to the uplifting ending, you will be amazed at how well put together this film is. patricia arquette amazingly portrays laura bowman, who we meet as a shut-down and quit despondent young doctor, unable to deal with her grief over the loss of her husband and son. throughout the course of the film, as she is trapped in burma, witnesses the democratic uprise and massacres in the capital city of rangoon, flees for her life, and saves her tour-guide's (u aung ko's) life, she is regaining her will to live. this may seen contrived or heavy handed: it is not. john boorman, a master at spiritual and emotional conflict, paints the film with broad strokes, and often uses symbolism to capture laura's emotional state, and physical predicament. patricia arquette, as usual, gives a wonderfully convincingly and believable performance as the emotionally wounded laura. what arquette does amazingly, in any role that she plays, is give us a window into her character's heart without words. every time she is given a close up in the film, the audience is given insight into her character. she does not need to speak to convey emotions, or be over the top. some critics were harsh on arquette's performance in the film when it opened on august 25, 1995, deeming that she was "flat" or "dull" in the role. i found her characterization dead-on, staying well away from the melodramatics that typically are part of an actor's performance when having a personally tragedy take place. she is on shock and is reserved about her feelings: that is just as normal as screaming lashing out at those around you. i am hoping that warner brothers releases this title on dvd very soon. with arquette's hugely successful nbc drama" medium" bringing her to household name status, not to mention an emmy win and now 2007 nomination, it would be in the studio's best interest to do so. hopefully there will be extras, with the alternate ending. do not by pass by this film. it is one that you will certainly not forget after seeing.

beyond rangoon is one of the most emotional and intense films ever made. superbly directed by john boorman, and intensly acted by patricia arquette, this film can easily be called one of the best films of the 90's. the story and vivid characters just grab the audience from the very opening, and never lets go. after seeing the film, the viewer will never be able to forget "beyond rangoon". the film made little money at the box office, and is little known, but should be high profile. watching it, you can tell that it was meant to be seen by a large audience. it is a very important and moving film, and should be seen by everyone.

this film should be seen by as many people as possible as it concentrates on the human rights problems in burma. when i first watched this film in the mid 1990's it totally changed my life. i knew very little about aung san suu kyi or her democracy movement. it effected me so i wanted to understand more about the situation. any film that has the power to make you want to learn more has done its job properly. patricia arquette is superb as the american lady who due to personal tragedy has become reckless with her own life decisions and gets caught up in the ensuing conflict. it is a powerful film about a subject matter which deserves more publicity. as the film itself says the 1988 massacre of pro democracy activists was not televised and therefore largely went unnoticed to the world. i implore everyone reading these comments to take the time to find out more about the current plight of the burmese people.it is about time this film was released on dvd. can anything be done?

while the movie has its flaws, it brings to light some of the problems that come with living in a country that has no democracy. it makes you empathize with the people under such a government and makes you want to learn more about their lives, their struggles and a potential leader aung san suu kyi. it makes one wonder why our government will interfere places we are not wanted yet ignore those who ask our help.

this movie was working toward two goals: to make a political point and to tell a scary adventure story. it's often difficult to do make a political point and still tell a good story (consider the highly political but rarely-entertaining final season of ellen). beyond rangoon finds a good balance between politics and storytelling.i already knew that aung san suu kyi had won the 1991 nobel peace prize, and knew something about the oppressive political situation in burma, so the political message of the movie was mostly a dramatization of what i already knew. but i thought the movie did a good job of telling about aung san suu kyi and the mostly-faceless dictators who have for years tried to silence her. the device of presenting an unfamiliar setting through the eyes of a character that viewers can identify with is fairly common, but it's quite well done in this movie.of course, the real measure of the movie was its entertainment value. arquette was excellent as a young woman whose sister took her to a distant, unfamiliar place to shake her out of her depression over the violent deaths of her husband and son. she is convincingly detached and depressed. her grieving condition gives her a clear reason for her distracted wanderings into the thick of a dangerous situation she does not understand, something she'd otherwise be much too intelligent to stumble into.once the dangers become so obvious that she can see through them even through the cloud of grief, she's trapped, with no easy escape. that sets her on a path of adventure where she needs her intelligence to survive. the writers deserve much credit for making her intelligent and resourceful enough to deal with numerous dangerous situations, while still finding a plausible reason for her to be foolish enough to get into trouble in the first place. the directing is strong also, keeping up the tension throughout the race to escape the forces of the dictatorship.this movie had additional impact on me and my wife because of other events of the same time period. we were preparing for a trip to india, and heard news reports of western tourists who had been taken hostage by a terrorist group in india. avoiding isolated terrorists in a peaceful democratic country is quite a different matter from escaping an oppressive dictatorship. but the movie and the news shared the element of avoiding danger in an unfamiliar country. that common characteristic gave the movie meaning beyond the strength of its own skillful storytelling. the movie illustrates the international tourist's worst nightmare.

never had i seen such a powerful true story movie. i discovered a city, a country, a lost revolution and even a nobel prize winner thanks to this masterpiece of cinema.if you haven't seen this movie, you can't say you've seen anything .a great lesson of courage, humility and life.i haven't seen anything as good since.t.e. saturday, january 9th, 1999

after reading about this documentary, i rented it and watched it with my teenage children. it was amazingly well-balanced, showing each side's perspective and leaving many questions unanswered. this is as it should be. i don't watch a documentary to be told what to think. i watch it to learn and to draw my own conclusions.afterward, we took a trip to waco and visited the branch davidians at the site of the conflagration. this was a potent lesson in seeing for yourself. and it drove home the basic underlying honesty behind "waco: the rules of engagement." if you just open your eyes and look, the facts can speak for themselves.

many people remember the waco standoff that occurred a long time ago. what most people probably have ingrained in their minds is the "cult leader" david koresh and the images of the compound burning to the ground after a long standoff. a lot of people have the belief that koresh was some kind of madman who thought he was god. he was accused of being a child molester and was credited for the breakdown and deaths of his followers. furthermore, many people feel the cult committed mass suicide when the fbi stormed mount carmel center and when the building was burning. most people feel the cult was at fault for not agreeing with the fbi on reasonable terms. most people feel the cult was brainwashed by koresh and followed along with everything that he said. nothing could be farther from the truth, because of strong evidence after the nightmare was over, and this one-of -a- kind documentary pretty much proves it!! this documentary is one of the most balanced examinations at the situation that occurred. it is much more thorough and highly detailed than anything most people have received in the mainstream media. to the shock of many people, this documentary will reveal that is was the atf, the fbi, and the higher levels of the united states government who were the ones who were unjust, cruel, and deceptive, and not david koresh and his followers. what korseh and davidians were doing was just protecting their constitutional rights, and the higher powers completely violated and raped those rights. the aft had no grounds to storm the compound; it was the aft that shot first and they shot from the helicopters from above at unarmed men, women, and children!! what is even more shocking is the actions of the fbi when they entered the mount carmel. watch it for yourselves and you will develop and new perspective on the u.s. government. there is infrared footage that clearly shows the fbi was shooting with machine guns at the men, women, and children in the burning compound. it will make your blood boil. it will make you really angry. it will make you wonder as to what kind of people run this country. finally, it will make you wonder as to what you are being told on the news every night is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. this video is frightening and i highly recommend it if one can find it. this documentary does not need to be purchased; it can be watched for free on google video!

if you value your freedom!i first got seriously interested in the branch davidian debacle after reading an article in uk journal "the fortean times." wanting to learn more, i rented this documentary and after watching it, i was stunned at what i saw. this film peaked my interest in the subject and i have read several books on the subject since then. this film is a must see for people who only know the facts as reported in the so called "mainstream" media. the baldfaced lies, double talk, and contradictory statements made by officials and politicians shown in this film will make you think twice about calling people who question the governments actions in this fiasco "nuts" "loonies" and "kooks." whats scary is that i know some people who consider themselves open minded "intellectuals" and freedom loving "liberals" who are still convinced that the government did the right thing at waco and refuse to watch this film or read any of the books on the subject. they continue to insist its not worth their time because its all propaganda from gun loving, clinton hating, religious fanatic,right wing anarchist nuts. one publication from an organization comprised of many so called "great minds" that claims to be dedicated to promoting "reason","common sense" and "rationalism" condemned the film claiming it would poison peoples minds and strongly suggested this film should be suppressed. they even hinted the davidians had it coming. i won't mention its name since i'm a coward. if you are one of those reading this (of course you probably would not be reading this anyway), i can only say its a shame you won't open your mind.

excellent documentary that still manages to shock and enlighten. unfortunately, times haven't changed much since this was made and it is thus an important piece for all freedom-conscious americans to see.

i watched a made for television film about the destruction at waco, texas. it was obviously heavily slanted toward the claim that david koresh was a murderous, child raping cult leader hell-bent on killing as many cops as he wanted and taking his people to the heavens on a blood stained stairway.the film was little more than propaganda further detailing what we had already read in the newspapers. i am more and more sure of that since i watched the great documentary waco: the rules of engagment. not that every assertion made in this film should be taken as god's truth, but it tells the whole story rather than regurgitating only what law enforcement decided to tell.for those who have forgot, koresh was the spiritual leader of the religious movement named the branch davidians. charges of drug use, kidnapping, illegal weapon ownership, and statutory rape (among others i'm sure) raised the suspicions of the local police, then later federal law enforcement. while attempting to serve a search warrant, the atf (bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms) and the clan participated in a shoot out that left deceased and wounded on both sides.it was then that the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) got involved. communications between the two were spirited but eventually broke down. the fbi prepared for an invasion by assaulting the building with flash-bang grenades and gas. when the building burnt to the ground killing many within, including koresh, the fbi refused to admit responsibility saying the "cult" inside must have set it on fire themselves. this hearkened images of jim jones and other violent religious organizations.the picture puts on many masks to tell its story. it begins with a sampling of the congressional hearings, perhaps the "truth," as far as the record is concerned anyway. what is eye-opening is how partisan the politicians remained even in a difficult and serious situation as this. the democrats were concerned in nothing more than defending every single action taken by law enforcement. it was the republicans that seemed open to the other side.it is impossible to relate all of the new information and analysis provided by this documentary. additionally, a list would take away from the film opening up as it goes along. one example would be the heart-breaking fact that children died within the compound. the filmmakers probably side more with the davidians in general but stay relatively open to either side. in this instance the feds seem at fault for mishandling a situation that involves innocent children. but on the other hand the parents also need to shoulder some of the blame for leaving their kids in this harmful situation when they could have released them to any number of local authorities.probably the most damning new information comes late in the film and involves the fbi's claim they did not fire upon the building. this is left up to interpretation, and i will not reveal any more than to say it is disturbing and shocking what can and cannot be told.the federal officers are not held in a critical or corrupt light any more than koresh. the largest condemnation seems to be leveled on the media, unwilling to tell both sides of a story. this element seems prevalent in recent documentaries, duly so i believe. it is time for the media to return to telling news stories and leave this relentless pursuit of what will draw the biggest audience and ratings.it is hard to mess up a documentary. in most cases switching on a camera and editing together interesting pieces of life is common and tells a terrific story. what few can do is shed such new light on a subject that the way you think about it is forever altered. waco is that kind of film. ***.5 out of ****

when i began watching i thought i was watching some pro-koresh amateur documentary. however, i had never seen 3/4 of the footage they used. they interviewed people saying that the fbi/atf instigated all these things, which sounded so far fetched, but then followed in up with fbi video and testimony. i was amazed. the documentary followed up with the senate investigation after the fire, and after seeing the interview and video footage you will be shocked at how the senate and attorney general turn their backs on davidians basically to cover up the aggression by the fbi/atf. if you start watching this you must finish it. otherwise you will think it is propaganda of something like that.

the film someone had to make.waco: the rules of engagement dissects the evidence behind the standoff in waco, texas that led to the destruction of the branch davidian homestead and the alleged government cover-up.the first thing you need to know about this film: you will see brief but disturbing photos of the victims bodies. this is not done for shock value, but to illustrate points about the way they died, as if you were present at the coroner's inquest.the second thing you should know about this film: at two and a quarter hours, it's pretty ponderous - especially if you already followed the events closely at the time. if you are unaware of any of the events other than what was reported in the mass media, or if the only side of the story you are familiar with is the official government report, this may be essential viewing. if, on the other hand you want a more concise (albeit unapologetically one sided) version of events, you should see "waco: the big lie".in summary, this is pretty much the definitive documentary about this tragic event, and is very sobering, but as a work of film-making, could test your patience, especially if you have a short attention span. and it's at times superfluous for those who watched the cspan hearings and the 60 minutes reports.perhaps someday someone will make a documentary that covers some of the stranger aspects of this story, such as the bizarre chain of events that led up to the atf raid or the psychological warfare tactics the fbi used blasting rock music at the sect, and their charismatic leaders (all rock musicians themselves) picking up their instruments and turning their massive amplifiers outward to blast their own music right back at them.

waco: rules of engagement does a very good job of not drawing conclusions for its viewers. it simply presents interviews, footage from the standoff, footage of the congressional hearings, phone conversations, expert testimony, etc. and allows you to draw your own conclusion.i hardly intend to imply that the data presented here was done with 100% objectivity but it is very convincing. you won't like koresh any more after you see this than you did before, but i tend to think that you will come to believe, as i now do, there is much that we were not told about what happened before and during the standoff.

absolute must see documentary for anyone interested in getting to the bottom of this story. told with unflinching eye and with gripping style. if you think conspiracy theories are for paranoid disturbed people, this could change your mind. something for you feds too: a good model for government coverups! if you like your news all tidy and easy to consume this is not for you.

if you want to see real evidence of what a misguided and unchecked government can do to "un-popular" people, this movie provides it. read what some people are saying about the "patriot act" passed after 9/11 and then watch this movie. is it worth it? do we really want to give away our freedoms to these people? regardless of what you saw on tv, you are not fully informed until you watch this movie. i apologize for quoting another reviewer, but it needs repeating: roger ebert of siskel & ebert said, "what's interesting is if you're looking for people who are unbalanced zealots... you don't find them among the branch davidians, you find them among the fbi and the alcohol, tobacco, and firearms; those are the people in this movie who deserve to be feared, i think." i think every person responsible for 9/11 needs to be brought to justice, but i think the government has not shown a history of honoring it's duty to protect people's rights, and this movie proves it in dramatic fashion.

there have been many documentaries that i have seen in which it appeared that the law was on the wrong side of the fence - the thin blue line and paradise lost come to mind first and foremost. but this is the first film that had me seething with anger after i saw it. it seems blatantly clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at waco was at the very least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the fbi and afi, and at the very worst an act of murder. like most people, when the siege at waco was occurring i assumed that david koresh was a completely evil madman who was leading a violent cult. after seeing this, i think that koresh was more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the u.s. government through his eccentric actions. sure, there were lots of weapons at the branch davidian compound. but none of it was illegal. it was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound, all of them seeming to be very nice and harmless. and it was angering to see the callous testimony of the men in charge of the government forces on the waco site, the clueless testimony of janet reno, and the partisan defense of the attack on waco, a defense led by a few of the committee democrats. standing out most in my mind was ny representative and current u.s. senator from ny charles schumer. i voted for the man when i lived in ny state - i'm a democrat, pretty left-leaning too. after seeing his actions on this committee, i wish i could go back in time and vote for d'amato instead! for anyone remotely interested in the government, this is a very crucial film, a must see. i even think this should be shown in classes - it's that important.

after watching "waco: the rules of engagement" i was just sitting in disbelief of what i was witness to. a big cover up by the fbi, a massacre by gung-ho/trigger happy government agents? i clearly remember the waco standoff, i was 17 years old at the time and watched it all on cnn. i remembered reflecting about all the children as i watched the mount camel compound burn in april 1993. i remember feeling sorry for the children, but clearly felt that it was the fault of their evil leader david koresh and the other davidians. gazecki's film shows clearly and beyond doubt, even though it is biased, that the fbi lied over and over again. i think that this film was a big contributor to the reopening of a new investigation of the incident in 1999. the outcome of this new investigation was in some sense predictable, the judgement relied on fact that was just as grey as the facts that the davidians presented. i was very disappointed about the verdict, because as far as i know it didn't take into account all the lying, misinformation and evidence cover-up by the fbi and other officials. why have no one be prosecuted for hampering the work of the texas rangers investigators? why were they allowed to contaminate the crime scene and bulldoze the compound shortly after the incident? these are questions that i haven't been given answers to by the government. most importantly, what about the children? in this new investigation i haven't been informed about who was responsible for spraying the cs flammable tear-gas into a compound with many hazards for igniting this gas and i haven't found any answer to whether the children's muscles contracted due to the effects of the gas, while they were alive. if they did, i would surely think that the janet reno or who ever was in charge of the raid should be indicted for mass-homicide or manslaughter. the question that was raised by gazecki, but not mentioned is; was is a direct plan for the people in charge and their tanks to cut holes and burn the building down with intent? (a plan that would have been accomplished with 112% efficacy) or were the officials in charge so incompetent, that their were unaware of the consequence of their actions? both are equally frightening. even if the davidians set fire to the compound, the officials in charge surely provided them with the opportunity to do the job. if the officials in charge knew, as they claimed, that the davidians would set fire to the compound, why the f did the tanks cut all the holes in the building making it into a furnace and why didn't they have plans to deal with the fire that they knew would occur? dark questions that still won't go away the final and most relevant issue of this film, is the way that the davidians are demonized by the government through the media, who just feeds it in to the public. i clearly remember the resentment i felt for the evil davidians that i saw on cnn in 1993. now that i'm older i can see a clear line of communication coming out of the government every time they are gearing up for a massacre of civilians along with the intended targets. demonizing people with words like; "they have different unlawful values then us" "they don't enjoy freedom" and "they are a threat to our freedoms and way of life" makes them so much easier to kill

rules of engagement is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen. it is well constructed, superbly pieced together, and provides excellent footage to back up the assertions that it takes on. the movie's best quality is that it is not based on being sympathetic to the dividians as much as it enlightens the audience to the blatant governmental mistakes and lies that surrounded the entire situation. i'm left with feelings of disturbing anxiety and extreme anger over the way that the government handled and then covered up a tragedy of this magnitude. the cover up is what left me really fuming. it is one thing to make a mistake in an operation and admit guilt, but another to look the american people squarely in the eye and lie to them. i guess it shouldn't surprise me with the history of our beloved country that has seen the jfk assassination, the vietnam war, and other significant events that smell so bad of a cover up that you have to hold your nose every time you drive through washington d.c. the footage from an airplane with special heat sensing technology and the autopsies on some of the bodies clearly show that the fbi is lying to the public. one of the things that i try to stay aware of when watching a documentary such as this is that i am usually only receiving testimony from one point of view. but again, that is without a doubt one of the brilliant successes of rules of engagement. it presents its evidence in such a concluding fashion that even if you were presented with statements from the fbi how could you really believe them. i remember clearly when the standoff was taking place the way the media presented the dividians as this crazed group of cult rebels with david koresh, the self professed reborn jesus christ, as their leader. none of this was truly factual but rather story spun from bits and pieces of facts. they were simply standing up for there rights to bear arms and practice their religion as american citizens. if you were the atf and you wanted to search the compound is attacking the building with a unit of men who are armed with rifles and bullet proof suits the way to go about doing it? if you are the fbi why engage in psychological warfare and offer little in actual negotiation to help solve the situation? why pour gallons of harmful gas if you want to save children? why open large holes within the compound structure when you know the possibility of starting a fire? why lie about not firing weapons when it can be clearly shown on video? unless. unless you wanted to see the situation end up the way it did. the scene at the end when the dividians star of david flag blew off the flagpole into the fire and the atf's was shortly thereafter raised up was an emotional climatic scene that made my head shake in disgust and my stomach turn uncontrollably. the filmmaker william gazecki deserves one my highest congratulations. it takes a lot of guts to make a movie like this and i am sure there have been many repercussions from the government for it as well. because of people like him the public can be shown real truth rather than crap that gets filtered through a media that presents information that can hardly be considered genuine. when i think back to how i felt at the time toward the dividians because of the media's representation of david koresh and how i felt after seeing this movie it is truly amazing. it reminds me of the line from the bible of a man who was healed by jesus and asked by the elders how it happened "before i was blind but now i can see" he kept telling them. do yourself a favor and watch this movie. you may have to look for it but it is truly something special.

things that are only just now "news" were taken as a given in this shocking documentary. i fear that as the investigation proceeds, the producers of this film will be vindicated in spades.the producers show us the davidians, the government agents, the investigators, with all their faults and all their humanity. nothing any reviewer can say could approach the impact of watching and listening for yourself. pieces of evidence -- congressional testimony, 911 tapes, news footage, expert commentary, interviews, photos and home videos -- are seamlessly woven together and tell a disturbing tale. do not wait. see this film and tell your friends.

seven ups has been compared to bullitt for the chase scene, but does not come anywhere near matching bullitt. bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds. when mcqueen leaves the seedy hotel, gets into his mustang, which is parked under the embarcadero freeway (now torn down) and notices the charger sitting nearbye, you know you are about to see something spectacular. from that moment on, when mcqueen starts that car, begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed. adding to it is a terrific lalo schriffin if i remember correctly sound track. this goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing. that shot of mcqueen's mustang suddenly appearing in bill hickman's rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact. hickman's look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect. then of course, san francisco is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends. also, bullitt being filmed in the 60s when cars were still "hot" (mustang gt and dodge charger) made for a better set of wheels then two boring, smog device laden pontiacs in the 1970s seven ups. bill hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies. i saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the univeral lot when i was doing movie reviews for a paper. they gave it a good try in seven ups though with the chase scene. seven ups had a few "jumps" over little hills, (yawn) but of course they were not san francisco hills. the seven ups chase, where they are actually going fast, is longer than the go fast sequence in bullitt. but the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood off of roy schieders pontiac is the height of absurdity. strictly hollywood, i would say, except that it was filmed in new york.

a compact crime drama with a good amount of action. the unique nyc location shots adds to this tough little film.technically well done with good direction and acting. needless to say,the wild car chase that seems to begin in downtown, extends through the upper west side, washington heights, across the george washington bridge and into nj has to be one of the best ever on film.all around a fine flick that for me gets better with time.8 out of 10...easy

roy scheider is not steve mcqueen or clint eastwood but then who is? the seven-ups is one of the better cop movies, even today, and is second only to mcqueen's bullitt and the dirty harry series, which isn't bad company. there are three things that seem to make a good cop movie: believable script with great acting, great car chase scenes, and some heavy action. this movie has all three and the car chase scene is better than that in dirty harry. scheider plays the head of a group of cops out to get ny's bad guys sentenced to seven years or more; hence the name seven-ups. overall, not quite up to dirty harry or bullitt but far better than all of the cop movies made since the dirty harry series. 9/10.

this is a good enough movie and you probably won't be disappointed, but it again has roy scheider, right after he did "french connection", playing a cop with the name 'buddy'. they also use the same too-memorable wheelman from "bullitt". at first you'll think you've seen the car chase before if you have his face still in your memory. the car chase is a great one, but as in many car movie scenes, it has some technical and editing errors. check "puppet on a chain" and "french connection ii" for some other good, long, intense chases.

i recently got the seven-ups on video and i must say it was a very enjoyable movie. roy scheider and tony lo bianco are great as the cop and crook respectively and a young richard lynch is great as psycho henchman moon. the late bill hickman is pretty good as his associate bo and sets up a brilliant car chase sequence which will have you on the edge of your seats. the other three members of the seven-ups team are pretty bland but that's only to be expected.i'm glad that a lot of people on this site have supported this movie. i think it should be a film that should be released on dvd and not just forgotten. i certainly enjoyed every minute of it. the final scene between the two leads is excellent as the bad guy must face the consequences of his actions. the seven-ups does not disappoint.

how did they get that cinematic shot of the car colliding with the back end of the semi? and then roy sits up -- great! looks like the dvd is scheduled for may of 2006 - about time!! watch this on a large screen or film revival in a theater if possible in order to fully appreciate the full aspect ratio. my other favorites in this category are: original italian job with michael caine; bullit with steve mcqueen; to live and die in la with the csi guy when he was young; french connection with gene hackman; ronin with robert deniro; vanishing point with barry newman; enemy of the state with hackman again -- what are your favorites?

this film is a classic seventies cop flick that for some reason has been sadly overlooked. it is basically french connection meets bullit.roy scheider plays the head of an elite group of detectives, known as the "seven ups" one of their men is discovered during an undercover op and is killed.scheider and his team must find his killers. they become involved in a battle with the mob.the highlight of the film has to be the car chase, obviously included to cash in on the success of bullit. however, this car chase outshines bullitt due to its length, speed and sheer excitement.it's a breathtaking roller-coaster ride that ends rather unexpectedly and spectacularly. don't miss this little gem !!

the seven-ups is a good and engrossing film. it's packed with credible performances by scheider, labianco and an effective scary performance by richard lynch - although most of the characters are card-board cut-out tough guys. character development does not evolve at all on the screen. the only thing we know is the good guys are the good guys and the bad guys are bad. deviating from the crime story norm, the seven-ups manage to throw scheider and crew into the middle of a building plot in a unique writing twist. onsite locations of new york city and an excellent choreographed car chase highlight the film. the only downside of the film is the slightly confusing plot line in the beginning. they give the viewer little evidence that the men being kidnapped are mob related (until later in the film). had someone blindly started watching the film may be slightly confused on the story. otherwise, the seven-ups is a gritty, testosterone-filled enjoyable time.

he plays straight but with a quiet intensity that makes him one of the top cops in movie history. roy scheider stars in a poor man's french connection that has a little of the same gritty appeal. fc is a better movie, but i prefer watching this one because 1) i think scheider is great and this is his best movie, and 2) this has the best car chase ever, one that makes bullitt look like a cable production (thanks again to bill hickman, who actually plays the driver). it doesn't hurt that tony lobianco stops by (again) to play a baddie. please enjoy.

****spoilers**** buried under a mountain of medical bills and his funeral business not being able to dig him out from under them undertaker vito lucia, tony lo bianco, came up with a plan to make a load of cash with the help of his two crooked pals moon & bo, richard lynch & bill hickman. vito getting close with his boyhood friend buddy manucci, roy scheider, as a mob informer to win over buddy's trust and have him tell vito what's coming down on the streets of new york in regard to mob activities. buddy is a cop who works in a sub rosa unite of the nypd, the seven ups, that does things "their way" to clean up the streets of new york of criminals. vito gets information from buddy and makes it look to buddy that he's really giving him tips about the mob and what it's up too and uses that information to tip off his hoodlum associates, moon & bo, to rip the mobsters off of their weekly take as well as kidnap top mob loan sharks and hold them for ransom.everything is going well for vito & co. until the mob decides to retaliate and mistakenly grabs beats and kidnaps a member of the seven ups ansel, ken kercheval,who was working undercover thinking he was one of the hoods who was kidnapping and ripping them off. later ansel was accidentally killed by moon when he blasted out the trunk of the car that ansel was locked in thinking that there was a suitcase full or cash, ransom, in it.fast pace and exciting movie with that gritty and grimy photography of new york city that was so effective in the movie "the french connection" which also stars both roy scheider & tony lo bianco who are in this movie too. incredible car chase that started in downtown brooklyn and ended up in the wilds of new jersey some 15 to 20 miles away with buddy almost ending up decapitated for his heroic efforts. roy scheider who is not a big man is as tough and effective as any big action actor i can think off like clint eastwood would have been in the same movie. scheider reminds me a lot of, he even looks a bit like him, former welterweight and middleweight champion gene fullmer who beat the great sugar ray robinson for the middleweight championship back in 1957 and acts like him too in the movie : tough durable and destructive. tony lo bianco is very good as vito the undertaker the lowlife heel who plays off buddy and the mob to the point that leads to buddy's partner ansel getting killed. even though he's trash you can't in a way not help feeling sorry for vito since he only wants the money he gets from the ripped offed mobsters to pay his sick wife's rose's hospital and medical bills. even the fact that ansel was killed due to his actions vito never wanted anybody to get hurt but like they say when you play with fire you end up getting burned. in the end vito have a lot of explaining to do to the not so sympathetic and caring mobsters. the movie "the seven ups" has the late bill hickman doing the dangerous stunts with the car chases as well as act in the film. hickman was also the stunt man in both great movies that had him doing the driving on the roads streets and highways of new york city and san francisco "the french connection" and "bullitt".

i love the other reviews of this movie. they mirror my attitude. i am a 70's sort of guy, minus disco and "star wars" childishness. there was nothing great about this movie, except for a chase scene. that is why it was good, because it was tough, basic and economical. roy scheider carried the movie, which was based on the crew, the 7 ups, that backed up gene hackman in the "french connection". the people in it were believable and average, who burned themselves pouring coffee, showed fear in chase scene and almost lost it after a close call crash.maybe it would be easier to tell you what it lacked. there was no fancy weapons, just basic revolvers and crude sawed off shotguns. there was no tough guy philosophizing, ala tarantino. there was no kung fu or samurai nonsense and no fancy trick shooting either. there was no clever guy who carries out some complicated scheme based on hundreds of things going just the way he planned including everyone else's reactions. the criminals were bad guys but they didn't shoot people for the hell of it. as a matter of fact, there was a body count of just three. something that the average movie these days would pass in the opening credits. it could be a g movie today! no bus load of orphan school children were kidnapped nor were terrorists threatening to kill half of the city. there were no high tech hijinks, nor were the crimes themselves very moving or ingenious, the highest tech thing i saw was a touch tone att wall phone. it had no subplots or amusing character developments. also, no sex or women, except for one mobster's wife who did some screaming as the buddy our hero had her menaced.it was some little undertaker who exploited his connections with the local mob and the police to kidnap local mobsters for some easy payoffs. the undertakers. vito, was played by tony lo bianco who did a great job, as good as roy schneider, buddy the head of 7 ups cop, whom he informed and exploited. what ever happened to tony lo bianco, he seemed like a pacino shoe in, good looking and talented? what it did have was a great nyc backdrop to a simple crime story. locations that were bleak and dehumanizing without being a sociological study. it had a simple plot that involved this kidnapping scheme where one of buddy's cop got accidentally involved, literally accidentally dragged in then accidentally shot dead. since buddy and his 7 ups are a hot dogs unit, both the nypd brass and mobsters thought he was involved, since the kidnappers masqueraded as plain clothes cops to lure the mobsters into compliance. obviously the mobsters figured they had lawyers and rights to protect them from normal police. even the mobsters were plain, old and ugly, no godfather royalty or soprano hipness here.it is a good basic movie with a standout chase scene between two 70's d pontiacs. even the cars were plain and economical, not even a gto or a trans am, like the acting and the story. in the days of batman uber-hype or "24" levels of intensity doomsday scenarios, this movie reminds us that less is better. it should be shown to movie screen writers and directors as a caveat not to dazzle, amuse then ultimately insult us with stunts, gadgets and clown psychotic behavior galore.

it's got action and fantasy mixed all together what more do you want in an action movie? and it also has one of the best martial artists in the movie industry today, wesley snipes.so all in all this movie hasn't left anything out. and that's my comment of what i think is a classic beat em up movie.

not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series, i expected this film to merely accomplish the basic: introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics, present a plot, and end with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel. and that's exactly what this movie happens to deliver.however, unlike with most other comic book movies, i felt that this one did it with a bit of class. risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fight scenes, "blade" presents a very modern, believable and dismal world whose little nuances effectively managed to elicit a sense of dread--as minor as it may have been--from a viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in a story unless an emotional (i.e., sappy) aspect is concerned.yes, the movie has innumerable plotholes, and preposterously unrealistic situations such as a standard female doctor being astute enough to contrive what no one else has been able to for several thousand years. but when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie, and fight scenes with involving and exciting camera cuts and special effects such as this, what else matters? it may run a little long, but for what it sets out to do, "blade" stands out in sharp relief among most other movies in this genre.

in this film i prefer deacon frost. he's so sexy! i love his glacial eyes! i like stephen dorff and the vampires, so i went to see it. i hope to see a gothic film with him. "blade" it was very "about the future". if vampires had been real, i would be turned by frost!

blade is probably one of the best vampire/action movies ever made.it has it all:action,horror,blood.this movie is for action fans.it's either you like it a lot either you hate it and if you hate it ,it means you don't like action or vampires movies.wesley snipes takes his role seriously and he his the perfect guy for blade

great underrated movie great action good actors and a wonderful story line. wesley is verry good and the villain the bad guy is wonderful the girl plays a nice role and the comedy mixed with blakness!

i loved it. in fact, i watched it over and over and over, and i could watch it again. this movie doesn't get boring.the vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie. it's a job well done, great for today's generation.wesley snipes was born for this role. stephen dorff was an ideal vampire. arly jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has. donal logue provides great comical relief.this vampire movie is like no other. i can't wait for blade 2.

this film was brilliant! i absolutely loved it! wesley snipes was great for this role - and i'm sure blade 2 would be just as good.blade is by far one of my favorite action/horror movies out there! and if you havent seen it yet, and like vampires and blood (all that stuff) you should really rent it, because i assure you that you'll love it!

i remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out, having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that i vowed to buy the video when it came out. while i won't go too far into dissecting this film, i will say that i gave it an 8/10, for all the reasons you can read in the other user's reviews.what i will say is this: the first 10 minutes of this film are incredible. it's as close to a textbook audience grabber as i've ever seen. i once put this movie on at a party, where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave. i just wanted to see what would happen if i showed them the first ten minutes.everyone, who watched the opening, stayed to the end.

i think the consensus is pretty unanimous about this recent tv miniseries: it's okay but it's a far cry from "lonesome dove." it gets compared to the latter simply because this a prequel to that famous story. "commanche moon" is definitely worth a watch for any fan of westerns. just don't expect it to be as intense as "lonesome dove." steve zahn and karl urban are not robert duvall and tommy lee jones, and the characters they play aren't as strong as how duvall and jones portrayed the same two guys. some say it's unfair to criticize this movie because of the comparison but you have to compare it - it's the story of the same two leading texas ranger characters: "woodrow call" and "gus mccrae."the main difference, i found, was that this prequel is a lot of slower and more relational (the two rangers and their women) at times. yet, i didn't mind that because the two main women were pretty ladies and generally likable and agreeable people. they were played nicely by linda cardelini ("clara forsythe") and elizabeth banks ("maggie.").. they helped make this long movie palatable. if you've seen pictures of women in the old west, none of them looked half as pretty as cardelini and banks, though. they were a joy for these male eyes to ogle. maggie's son "newt" was a wonderful kid, too - the kind of boy every parent would want..the most interesting character, i thought, turned out to be "inish scull," played by val kilmer. as in the western film, "tombstone," kilmer almost steals the show from the leads. "scull" is really an original, if i ever saw one: a strange dude, indeed. actually, all of the supporting actors in here did a fine job, from keith robinson's "deets" to wes studi as "buffalo hump." i always find studi to be fascinating, no matter what role he plays. i wish he had had a bigger role in this miniseries.one thing this film has in common with "lonesome dove" and other good westerns: the scenery and photography. it's just beautiful at times and is a joy to watch. we also have an excellent director of this film: simon wincer, who directed "lonesome dove" and an another outstanding tv western, "crossfire trail." he also did two of my other favorite feature films, both based in his home country of australia: "phar lap" and "quigley down under."unfortunately, although i enjoyed this, "commanche moon" is nothing as good as the above-mentioned films.yet, i still watched all of it and was sorry it ended, if that makes any sense. it made me want to watch woodrow and gus again, this time with tommy lee and robert.note: the title page says this is 360 minutes. that must have included the tv commercials. the two-disc dvd version i saw was about 4 hours and 40 minutes.

what has hurt this film is everyone and their aunt matilda is comparing it to its illustrious predecessor, which is always going to hurt any show. if you take it as a western, it's a darned good show. we discover how our characters in 'lonesome dove' wind up in the situations they start up in (such as: why do two texas rangers, who live on adventure, wind up in a dead town? and how did gus manage to lose the love of his life?) the performances are very good, and we see the exact same mannerisms the characters will have down the road. the actors did a very good job. the cinematography was superb, and while the music didn't live up to the legendary score of nearly two decades past, that was an impossible task, and it was still fine.it also helped that we had three episodes, which you just don't see in a miniseries anymore. heck, it's downright impossible to see a two part telefilm these days.fans of the western, rejoice!

there have been some harsh criticisms of comanche moon on imdb. i think this is for three reasons. first, purists are disappointed that the mini-series is not exactly like the book. second, it's not as good as the original lonesome dove. finally, people like to complain on imdb and the greatest films in the world will have bad comments.i would like to say that no movie is going to be as good as the book. that's just the way it is. lonesome dove wasn't as good as the novel it was based on. additionally, the movie of lonesome dove had some things left out ans switched around. that's just they way its going to be with a film adaptation of anything. so its a futile argument when looking at comanche moon.i do agree it's not as good as the original dove. but hey, nothing is. i know people that guide their lives by the lessons they learned from the dove. if i was going to compare every book i read, movie i watched, and tv i viewed by lonesome dove; i would be perpetually unhappy.this is a made for tv miniseries based on a prequel to lonesome dave (the novel) and sequel to dead man's walk, and that's what you get. it's the best tv i've seen in years. it's a fun set up for lonesome dove. we get to learn about the history of the rangers we came to know and love in dove. zahn does an amazing job in recreating gus mccrae. elizabeth banks and linda forenelli (sp?) also do great jobs as creating characters that help fill in the past of the rangers and newt.if/when it comes on again, i promise you'll enjoy it more than some crumby reality show.

i must have seen a different version than the first person on the user comments section.it's really, really good...steve zahn and karl urban are great together. val kilmer's character is much like he was in the novel, although the emphasis is on gus and call and the comanches. we get to see what happened with call and newt's mother as well. i won't spoil it, but it gives a lot of insight into call's character.all the actors did a really convincing job. steve zahn had the biggest challenge, i thought, to follow robert duvall! there's a lot of action, humor, tragedy. it's got something for everyone. i can't wait until it airs, my family are all jealous i got to see it early!

this is one of those movies that i can watch again and again and not get tired of it. it is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever. i liked this one even more than x-men. in fact, this movie is sort of a cross between x-men and the matrix and it came out before either. wesley snipes does a great job with the character of blade. he is just not an emotionless super hero. also, this movie isn't sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating. sure comic books are for kids mainly, but i like a little more in my movies. let's face it, if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic. this comic book adaptation also has something that many don't. a good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy. let's face it, none of the batman movies had a very good ending fight.

this film is superb! wesley snipes plays blade the vampire hunter with pure class, he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make bruce lee proud. the movie is a fast paced, thrill ride of action and superb stunts. the first action scene and last are outstanding and wesley looks like a terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads. the script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too. wesley should have done more action films than he has, i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not streched as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all, only bruce willis, stallone and perhaps tom cruise (if he counts as an action star) come close. also aswell as wesley being quality, steven dorff is also very good as the bad guy. it was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to snipes should come across as menacing, but he does. overall the film is sharp, stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace.

interesting twist on the vampire yarn - fast, loud and moody. despite my initial fears kris k carries his part reasonably well and snipes aka blade provides a formidable physical presence. lots of blood, steel, silver, burning and exploding bodies provide an enjoyable :) 110 minute distraction. if you like the black look of the matrix then blade will appeal to you, blade even has a 'dodge the bullets' sequence.

for a brief moment. the opening scene with traci lords and thetechno bar is incredible. i'd probably follow her to my ultimate death too! best vampire movie of all time but with a twist. the fight scenes are awesome. wesley snipes displays an athleticism you dont get to see every day. and stephen dorff is impressive and very believable as an ambitious new recruit moving himself up the hierarchy by any means necessary. great flick 9/10. where's blade ii?

however closely the movie is to the comics, it doesn't matter. this movie radically moves away from the boredom of "interview with the vampire" (although it's acting was good) and slides in the wonderful action scenes. very convincing tale and interesting with surprisingly good acting from all. disadvantage - poor graphics. does it matter? nope.

in the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations, blade is by far one of the best realised, and most faithful (overall) to the source material.... given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in marvel's tomb of dracula, the writer took almost all of the characters and plot elements from the comic's history. while changes were inevitably made, the finer points of the film steamroll right over any criticisms. don't let any of you friends tell you different: blade is one fine film. if it feels too "comic booky" for you stanley kubrick snobs out there, it's because it's supposed to. deal with it, but don't dis it for it.

blade is a dark, gloomy, but significent vampire movie and is one of the best ones. a bit of gore, but nothing really that bad. wesley snipes played a strong role as he eliminates the vampires. not really like buffy, because thats too tame but blade delivers a decent plot and it's the kind of movie that you would probably like to watch on a dark stormy night....thats at best viewing!87%

overall, i give this film a decent 7.6. to start i'll say i love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen. if you read comics occasionally or simply watch dvd extras you'll see the blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film. among the changes, blade is now most importantly half vampire, therefore acquiring "all of their strengths, but none of their weaknesses." the credit for this goes obviously to david goyer, a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books. thanks to him blade has become a much more interesting character and i find him one of my favorite anti-heroes really. wesley snipes is born to play this role, although some would've probably pererred dezenel washington or will smith (lol). his acting here doesn't need to be exactly oscar winning per say considering the character but i'm glad he decids to play the daywalker in the two sequels. also starring is stephen dorff as our main villain and kris kristofferson as blade's alfred so to speak. the acting is good actually and the action keeps the plot going for sure. the opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts i've got to say. as much as like this movie there are few things that bother me which take away from this film ranking with something like "spider-man" or "x-men". stephen norrington had the villains portrayed in a way i didn't like so much honestly. their lines were so full of foul mouthed comedy it didn't really feel like a comic book film to me. plus "la magra" a bit disappointing as the final villain but the intense sword fight makes up for it i guess. not to mention a sense of extra non-realism: a black man in a leather coat with a sword beaing the #$%^ out of a cop in broad day light some how going unnoticed by the crowds walking by seemed kinda..well...dumb. moving away from a few of its flaws, the music by mark isham was great and fitted the film nicely. luckily all these problems are fixed and improved on in the stunning sequel, "blade 2".

most of this political thriller presented as a mostly run of the mill movie with a somewhat better development of many of the major characters, that was much appreciated, until the big twist and powerful climax that recalled twists experienced in "silence of the lambs," or "the sixth sense." reese witherspoon as the distraught wife of the missing egyptian husband and yigal naor as the strong-armed interrogator offer strong performances. jake gyllenhaal unfortunately is handed a more two-dimensional character and has to struggled with a stereotypical presentation of the emotionally torn cia analyst that has been presented many times before in other movies. early on there is the nice scene with an explosion that resembles a scene at the end of "saving private ryan," the silent scene that was used so effectively in reflecting one consequence of violence. the script also provides a little more glimpse into the mind-set of the "enemy" but still doesn't allow the audience really much understanding, again permitting the audience to wallow in stereotypical characterization. the cinematography and photography also is somewhat of a letdown because unlike "jarhead," or "blackhawk down," the crisp, raw visceral presentation is missing not allowing the audience to really be there in the movie, there is some distance that keeps the audience from realizing the intensity of the emotions occurring on the screen. however, overall, the movie redeems itself by the end, offering the audience a measured look into the complexity of the united states' use of rendition and the possible complications and consequences that may occur through its use. eight out of ten stars.

the film tackles the here and now horror of "rendition" with a multi-cast trans-global account of all involved. no-one gets off lightly because we see the blindness of the players as they carve out their own slice of the worldwide game piling hatred and misery on their "enemies" and themselves in equal measure.the interplay between the sympathetic senator's aide (played in scintillating style by peter sarsgaard) and the real washington power-mongers is electrifying. meanwhile out in the field, new cia man (jake gyllenhaal) goes through a sea change in his attitude to the usa's new found cosiness with torture. sudden though his rejection of what he initially tacitly condoned is, one has to ask why on earth would anyone who calls him or herself civilized stand and watch anyone be humiliated and abused in this way? the film has few heroes - perhaps gyllenhaal's flawed and vacillating cia man is the exception and a necessary indulgence to make the film offer a sliver of hope.the sad fact of course is that this film isn't fiction at all, but a wake up call to those with a shred of decency left in them. the awful truth is that we in the uk and usa have lost the moral plot and this film shows how low we are prepared to go. all this in the name of freedom! there's a wonderful line in the script that says that torture is a sure way to swell the numbers of our enemies. this is already happening in real life and we should listen to the message that this film delivers and start using our might and money much more intelligently!! the message seems to be that any of us who claim that rendition, torture and the abuse of basic human rights are necessary to protect our way of life are as wrong-headed and stultifyingly stupid as the jihadists and suicide bombers.all praise to the sensibilities of a talented south african director with a eye on the gross unfairness of how power is exercised, and a cast of principled mainstream actors from the us and beyond. oh, and by the way, the film has a sting in its tail with the ending a clever and thought provoking surprise (which i won't give away).i saw the film in an early london preview so it has not yet been widely written up but i'm glad to say that the tide of less than glowing reviews seems to be turning. the bbc review has been very strongly in support and they (and i) suspect that much of the negative comments come from those who see the world through the simple specs of hollywood - where the good guys and the bad guys are cardboard cut-outs. hence the reason that many of the truly great films of the year are increasingly indie and/or non-us pix.

"i fear you speak upon the rack, where men enforced do speak anything." this shakespearean line from the merchant of venice is echoed again in the new film rendition which introduces the viewer to the "enhanced methods of interrogation", renditions, which began in the clinton administration and have become more commonplace since the terror attacks of september 11, 2001.the film features an all-star cast, with oscar winners meryl streep, alan arkin, and reese witherspoon, as well as peter sarsgaard, jake gyllenhaal, and omar metwally. supporting roles filled by unfamiliar actors deliver as well, sucking the audience into the plot, and showing how many people can be affected by overseas terror attacks, and our means of investigating them.rendition follows an egyptian born terrorism suspect (metwally) who is taken by u.s. officials following his flight from south africa to washington dc to an undisclosed prison overseas. his pregnant wife (witherspoon) ventures to washington dc to find out about his disappearance through a family friend and senator's employee (sarsgaard). gyllenhaal plays a young cia analyst at the overseas detention facility who monitors the violent interrogation.this film follows the emotional plights of the torture victim (metwally), and those involved in obtaining the supposed information from him. some, like the cia analyst (gyllenhaal), are visibly shaken and horrified by the methods exercised, while others, the stern senator (streep) and foreign interrogator (yigal naor), see it as necessary and effective.the film may be described by some as a political piece, but is ultimately an emotional one. metwally's performance as the tortured prisoner is oscar-worthy. the film does not intend to preach, but rather to question and inform the audience on a topic that does not often have a human face put on it. renditions have been known to work, but have also been known to produce false information from innocent prisoners. the film simply depicts the emotional struggles of those involved in such grave business, and does so in a way that will affect every viewer differently. the film will keep your interest, and have you engaged in each of the character's plights.

in this day and age in which just about every other news story involves discussions of waterboarding, images of abu ghraib, or tales of forced detentions at guantanamo bay, gavin hood's "rendition" is about as up-to-the-minute and timely a movie as is ever likely to come out of the entertainment mills of mainstream hollywood. it's not, by any stretch of the imagination, a perfect film, but neither does it merit the caterwauling opprobrium it has received at the hands of critics from all across the ideological and political spectrum.the term "rendition" refers to the ability of the cia to arrest any individuals it suspects of terrorist dealings, then to whisk them away in secret to a foreign country to interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time, all without due process of law. anwar el-ibrahimi is an egyptian man who has been living for twenty years in the united states. he has an american wife, a young son and a new baby on the way. he seems a very unlikely candidate for a terrorist, yet one day, without warning or explanation, anwar is seized and taken to an undisclosed location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement with a terrorist organization that anwar claims to know nothing about.on the negative side, "rendition" falters occasionally in its storytelling abilities, often biting off a little more than it can chew in terms of both plot and character. the ostensible focal point is douglas freeman, a rookie cia agent who is brought in to observe anwar's "interrogation" at the hands of egyptian officials. the problem is that, as conceived by writer kelley sane and enacted by jake gyllenhaal, freeman seems too much of a naïve "boy scout" to make for a very plausible agent, and he isn't given the screen time he needs to develop fully as a character. we know little about him at the beginning and even less, it seems, at the end. he "goes through the motions," but we learn precious little about the man within. thus, without a strong center of gravity to hold it all together, the film occasionally feels as if it is coming apart at the seams, with story elements flying off in all directions. a similar problem occurs with anwar's distraught wife, played by reese witherspoon, a woman we never get to know much about apart from what we can see on the surface. gyllenhaal and witherspoon have both proved themselves to be fine actors under other circumstances, but here they are hemmed in by a restrictive screenplay that rarely lets them go beyond a single recurring note in their performances.what makes "rendition" an ultimately powerful film, however, is the extreme seriousness of the subject matter and the way in which two concurrently running plot lines elegantly dovetail into one another in the movie's closing stretches. it may make for a slightly more contrived story than perhaps we might have liked on this subject, but, hey, this is hollywood after all, and the film has to pay some deference to mass audience expectations if it is to get itself green lighted, let alone see the light of day as a completed project.two of the supporting performances are particularly compelling in the film: omar metwally who makes palpable the terror of a man caught in a real life kafkaesque nightmare from which he cannot awaken, and yigal naor who makes a surprisingly complex character out of the chief interrogator/torturer. meryl streep, alan arkin and peter sarsgaard also make their marks in smaller roles. special mention should also be made of the warm and richly hued cinematography of dion beebe.does the movie oversimplify the issues? probably. does it stack the deck in favor of the torture victim and against the evil government forces? most definitely. (one wonders how the movie would have played if anwar really were a terrorist). yet, the movie has the guts to tread on controversial ground. it isn't afraid to raise dicey questions or risk the disapproval of some for the political stances it takes. it openly ponders the issue of just how does a nation hold fast to its hard-won principle of "civil liberties for all" in the face of terrorism and fear. and just how much courage does it take for people of good will to finally stand up and say "enough is enough," even at the risk of being branded terrorist-appeasing and unpatriotic by those in power? (the movie also does not, in any way, deny the reality of extreme islamic terrorism).thus, to reject "rendition" out of hand would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. "rendition" may not be perfect, but it is good, and it has something of importance to say about the world in which we now live. and that alone makes it very much worth seeing.

i liked this movie. i saw it to a packed house at the toronto international film festival the day after the gala opener which must have gone over well. the director, gavin hood was supposed to be present for today's screening, but alas his twins were born just hours before, so he had to jet on a flight back. '2 birthings in 24 hours' was how he joked about it.rendition refers to 'extraordinary rendition' -- a term whereby suspected terrorists in the us can be sent, without the legal consent of their parents nations, to prisons abroad to be questioned and detained.it's fairly predictable -- innocent egyptian-american man wrongly accused of being a terrorist 'goes missing' while en route from south africa to washingon dc. he is sent abroad, while wife at home (reese witherspoon) fights to find him and free him. but what makes this movie special are some nice choices in story-telling: 1) a human-touch story of what is going on in the locale where a suicide bomb-detonated; 2) the humanity of a cia agent trying to understand and be honest with what is really going on; and 3) the chronology of story-telling which makes it a tight, taut tale that moves and jerks at the right moments. ah -- relief! and a mix of emotions that swirl around as the story fights for an ending.all-around strong acting with meryl streep as a standout vixen.

'blade' would be an extremely above-average comic-book, vampire-hunter action/horror if it weren't for two minor flaws. #1 i loved seeing the all-but invincible blade/snipes do his slicing and dicing, but the whole "yes!" fist/punch was literally a letdown. #2 bad, no make that horrible, cgi  even for 1998 standards. this is mainly in the last third, but some sprinkled throughout. okay, despite those minor infractions, i really enjoyed this movie. all actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'matrix' rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior. so maybe 'the matrix' copied 'blade.' at any rate, it's a very movie for multiple genre-loving audiences: comic book geeks, action fanatics and horror/vampire lovers. so, we have blade, half-man/half-vampire, or "day-walker" and his accomplish, whisler (a la "batman and alfred") battling the undead who, apparently almost out number humans. who knew? in a rare act of humanity (blade's more of an antihero) our sword ninja/vamp rescues a newly infected (coincidentally) blood specialist/doctor. meanwhile, trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants (you guessed it) supreme power and needs blade somehow to obtain it. it's not the most original concept, if you read what i just wrote, but still highly enjoyable. you will want to see blade succeed, you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms. and you will know what's coming as this is the typical act 1-2-3 of a comic book introduction movie. still, watch this without trying to go too deep. such as vampire spf-1000 "suntan lotion"? really? what about the scalp? wouldn't that still burn? just like the money they burn for weapons? uh, okay, i am going too deep. once again, sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun ride.

when i was a kid i remembered this show but thought that now as an adult the show might be a bit dated. well yes it is but for me that makes the show more retro (and the musics very funky). this show is mostly well written. i do think its a travesty that this show was cancelled after one season especially when this show was more popular than the incredible hulk. i think fans should overlook the poor special effects and enjoy the stories. this next sentence contains spoilers: my favourite episode as a kid was when there were two spiderman that battle against each other interestingly a similar idea is concocted in spiderman 3 the movie. i liked the ideas in this tv show some will hate it. i believe stan lee wasn't a fan.

though, short lived "the amazing spider-man" was one of the best made for tv versions of a famed comic book hero. only "wonder woman" (lynda carter) (the best of the genre and "the incredible hulk" (bill bixby, lou ferrigno) were better."the amazing spider-man" outclasses the 1966-1968 "batman", because the high camp elements of the latter often ruin the adventure. "spider-man" outclasses all three television interpretations of "superman"- "lois and clark", "smallville", and of course the george reeves "superman" which brings up the rear."the amazing spider-man" was an action drama, during the late 1970's, the pre-cgi era, when stunts had to be performed by stunt men, not in the database of a computer. "spider-man" had its own very talented stuntman to perform the death defying daredevil acrobatics. his name was fred waugh, who donned the spidy suit for the action sequences. nicholas hammond, better known as one of julie andrew's children on the all-time movie classic "the sound of music" was spider-man during the dialogue scenes. hammond's spider-man also had his own secret identity as peter parker, similar to christopher reeve- superman/ clark kent, adam west-batman/bruce wayne, and of course lynda carter as wonder woman/ diana prince.it's unfortunate that the series only had thirteen episodes. because when the first episode hit the airwaves in november of 1977, the entire country was watching it on cbs that wednesday night. in all fairness, cbs should release this pilot episode as well as "the deadly dust", the "captive tower" etc. on dvd shortly. "spider-man" was short lived, but did have a cult following, and in my opinion was a heck of a lot better than the movie interpretation of the famed comic book hero starring toby mcguire.cbs might be hesitant to release these episodes for two reasons. (a) there might not be a broad market for them based on the lack of longevity of the series and a generation of children and young people who weren't born when the series originally aired in the 1970's. (b) one of the early "spider-man" episodes dealt with a terrorist with designs on the world trade center, which was attacked twice many years after this show went off the air, in 1993, and of course the devastating attack against this country on 9/11/01 in which the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost.however i don't think that it would be in bad taste to release this "spider-man" episode even if the show was adventure, derived from a comic book, and camp in nature. the live action "amazing spider-man" doesn't have a large following but it has a cult following. if and when cbs releases it out on dvd this cult following could be explained along with the episode in which spiderman saved the towers in 1978, but how in september of 2001 real life proved to be different from the movies. i like to follow the news, but i also like science fiction/fantasy. therefore i am eagerly awaiting the release of "the amazing spider-man on dvd".

continuing with the exclusive film programme about complicated relationships in some european courts, last night in the schloss theatre was shown "anna boleyn", a film directed by the great teutonic film director herr ernst lubitsch. the film depicts the terrible story of the queen consort of the british king henry viii. she was executed by her husband ( well, not exactly, the king ordered the executioners to do his dirty work) not to mention that this marriage caused an important political and religious historical event, the english reformation.the film stars dame henny porten, germany's first screen superstar during those early years and herr emil jannings, germany's fattest actor in that silent era. both play their characters in a suitable way; dame porten as an innocent aristocrat who becomes progressively interested in the power that the court offers her and herr jannings as the unscrupulous, whimsical and womanizing british monarch, a character very suitable for this german actor who overacts appropriately, given the extravagance and excessive personality of the character himself.in the early film period herr lubitsch was known for his outstanding costume films, colossal productions with big budgets ( "anna boleyn" cost about 8 million marks, a fortune even for this german count ) taking great care in magnificent decors as can be seen during the coronation procession in westminster abbey scene which employed 4.000 extras ( idle germans of that time were used, causing revolutionary workers to create a fuss when german president friedrich ebert visited the set during filming).besides the spectacle, one of the most important aspect of this and every film of herr lubitsch, even during his epic period, is the complex relationship between the main characters. we experience a game of different interests, double meanings, and the complicated art of flirting but what is treated lightly at first ends in tragedy. the importance of those historical facts is brought to bear in an effective way but lubitsch is really more interested in the changing relationship between henry viii and anna boleyn.and now, if you'll allow me, i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must take care that one of his fat and rich heiress doesn't lose her head for this teutonic aristocrat.herr graf ferdinand von galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/

nothing dull about this movie, which is held together by fully realized characters with some depth to them. even the hooded torturers have body language. jannings' performance is brilliant, all will, want and need. a henry viii as he must have been. henny porten is, maybe, nobler and purer than anne boleyn, but she plays the part as written: a victim caught in the jaws of a big (huge) baby.sparkuhl's cinematography is gorgeous in the restoration, the tints sensuous. lubitsch lets these characters breathe and reveal their corruption down to the tiniest of meannesses. he takes his time, which can try the patience of an audience accustomed to being carried away by action, but the time is worth spending. slow your heartbeat and watch this minor miracle of german silent film.

hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the chappelle show/charlie murphy, but also to the character daywalker). but i'll try to put all the things i liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything i didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read! let's start with the good things! the quote "strong bloody violence" (which is used by rating boards, to describe the content of a movie, does fit here very well. this is not a movie for kids! or for the faint of hearted! it has blade as a central character (wesley snipes is phenomenal) and a crazy enough story thread to hold/justify the action scenes! the original idea is also very engaging and intelligent. the action scenes are great here too.ok over to the things i didn't like. the overall story is too thin. it's enough as i've written above to hold the action scenes together, but there could be more. and a character like blade deserves more (imo). the drama therefor isn't the best ... also it's use of clichés doesn't help. some characters are underwritten ... that's that! :o)

silent historical drama based on the story of anne boleyn, newly arrived lady-in-waiting to the queen who catches the lustful eye of henry viii, bad-tempered king of england who loves to feast, drink, hunt, be entertained by his court jester, watch jousts, and chase around after young beauties who jump out of cakes and assorted attractive females around the castle. well, he's soon annulled his marriage, married anne, and telling her it is her holy duty to produce a male heir. she fails on that score and he soon has his eye on yet another lady-in-waiting. meanwhile, anne spends pretty much the entire film looking hesitant, perturbed, or downright ready to burst into tears. she just doesn't come across as a happy camper (or is it just bad acting?!).this film is a solid piece of entertainment, with an absorbing story that held my interest for two hours - plus i enjoyed seeing the very lavish medieval costuming featured here on a gorgeous sepia tinted print. emil jannings is quite striking and memorable in his well-done portrayal of king henry the eighth - he really seemed like he was henry the eighth. i am not so sure about the performance given by the actress who plays anne, seemed a bit over the top. the dvd of this film features an appropriate, nicely done piano score that perfectly suits this story. quite a good film.

this is a truly wonderful love story. i liked the songs, however even if you do not, you have to love the story. peter o'toole is at his best and petula clark is doing fine as well. i first saw this when i was about 13 and loved it then. now in my forties, i still enjoy it, probably even more. still makes me cry and laugh and feel good. it is a movie to watch only with a new age guy or by yourself as it is a chick flick. but whats wrong with that. need a little romance and maybe a little cry, try this movie.

30 years after the original film, "goodbye, mr. chips" was made over as a musical. peter o'toole and petula clarke starred in this wonderful remake of the beloved schoolteacher, chippington, who is referred to as chips by his beloved wife.o'toole was excellent here and received another oscar nomination. you have to wonder what peter o'toole has to do to win an oscar. he has lost the coveted award 8 times now. you also have to wonder that he lost in 1969 to john wayne for "true grit," which was really a testament to mr. wayne's long career and popularity. this year was also marked by great performances by richard burton, "anne of the thousand days," as well as dustin hoffman and jon voight for "midnight cowboy."surprised to see petula clarke cast as mrs. chippington. however, as this was a musical, a beautiful voice came well through and she did a nice piece of acting as well.who can forget the scene when chips carries on in the class despite the news that his beloved has been killed in a bombing. he never got to tell her the wonderful news of his pending promotion.the beautiful cinematography and music only enhanced a truly memorable experience.

peter o'toole gives a brilliant performance in this movie. i have seen the original version with robert donat and i much prefer peter o'toole's performance and the movie in general even though it is a musical. i've really never seen anything that mr. o'toole is in that i don't like. he is a brilliant actor, multi-talented, giving performances full of passion and depth. petula clark also gave a surprisingly good performance and was perfect for the part. it is an all-around heartwarming movie, full of tenderness and bittersweet fun. i will always remember (in para-phrase) the line where mr. chips regrets he has never given her children, and she replies, "of course you have, hundreds of them -- all boys." thank you for the opportunity to vote for this movie and to voice my opinion.

great story, great music. a heartwarming love story that's beautiful to watch and delightful to listen to. too bad there is no soundtrack cd.

great acting is best rewarded by pairing with a melodramatic script which truly elevates the human spirit. to all those minions who toil each and every day, take heart! your patience is virtuous. your forbearance and decency will evidence, in ways you will never anticipate. this is your great story. i do not believe you can watch through to the end without a wisp of moisture in that hardened eye. or, can you? for me, it would not be so... the story is relentless! the idealist, denied his due. will anyone speak up? ah! but you will need to see the show yourselves! observe the schoolmaster in his prime, without the notice and peerage the observer would certainly expect. and why does he continue so? yes! you must watch o'toole's performance for yourselves! i can only wish it were still 'in print' to purchase, then present to my friends as my evidence of respect for their faithful lives.

"chips" is an excellent blend of music, light comedy and drama with a picture perfect performance by peter o' toole and and effortless romantic supporting performance by petula clark. o' toole is able to show the shy, uncommunicative teacher that wishes so much to be loved by his students and is only able to express his love when he married katherine (clark). she brings him the world "what a lot of flowers" and he is forever changed. he becomes the beloved headmaster of brookfield through tragedy but knows he could only have achieved his goal through katherine's love. the songs (with the exception of the music hall number) are all "thought-songs" coming from character's emotions and thoughts and, the more you listen to them, the more beautiful they become - "walk through the world with me" and "you and i". o'toole's finest moment is the final speech he gives to the students (it was the reason for the oscar nomination). as a teacher, we question what "book" learning ever gets through - but, as chips says, we did teach them how to behave with each other and that is what really counts. beautifully filmed, perfectly orchestrated by john williams and one of the most moving films about love and how it can change you. "did i fill the world with love?" the boys sing their school song. by the end, chips realizes he was able to do it - but only cause catherine was there.

minor spoilers will follow.this movie is even more odd and unconventional than "songs from the second floor". there is no main character we follow around. there is no "plot" in the conventional way. there is no emphasis on an happy end. there is no crowdpleasing. in other words roy andersson is back with a vengeance. instead of falling back on convention and fixed formula roy andersson concentrates his film around an idea. i will not go into what that idea is, but even if you don't "get it" i promise that you will see the greatest visual depth ever put to film. the majestic scenes from "songs" pale in comparison here. a work of visual splendor.so be kind to your fellow man, because after all "we are the living", and only you and i have the power to change our lives. that is at least what i thought when i saw the final scene in the movie, with the inhumane bomber planes sweeping in over the city in the film to take our lives away. and of course don't forget to see this movie when it gets a limited release near you. this is one of those movies that actually have the power to make you a better person, like de sica's "bicycle thieves". a very warm and humanistic film.

roy anderson's film 'you, the living' comprises a series of fifty-odd sketches, snapshots and vignettes set in a swedish city. some characters are on screen for just a few second, whilst others appear in numerous scenes and are sometimes seen loitering in the background while another story unfolds. many scenes are drawn from the dreams, nightmares and fantasies of the strange but believable characters inhabiting this world. it is a fascinating approach: each of the scenes could be enjoyed in isolation, but together they contain a powerful portrait of what it is to be human.for the first half hour or so, 'you, the living' is gloriously funny. much of the humour centres on the members of a brass band, whose music practice infuriates the neighbours in their apartment block. the comic highlight, however, is provided by a dinner-party track gone horribly awry. after this hilarious introduction, however, the mood of the film darkens considerably. the dinner-party dream turns grim when the hapless protagonist is put on trial for his life, setting a mixed tone of absurdity and despair for the rest of the film.in the subsequent scenes, the unhappiness of the cast of characters becomes increasingly apparent. theirs is a world where people are unable to connect with one another, where talk of dreams, nightmares and fantasies is widespread, but where no person can be comforted, even when others reach out to help them. the despondent woman with the 'nobody loves me' refrain and the young girl with unrequited love for the rock guitarist, micke, are archetypal characters.the world of 'you, the living' is also blighted by selfishness. an elderly professor is called away the warmth of a vast banquet to answer a phone call from his impetuous money-grubbing son; a thief steals the wallet of a ruthless executive; an arrogant and impatient businessman insults a muslim barber and receives his comeuppance. in the film's bleakest moment, a woman in church recounts the long list of human sins as her fellow parishioners shuffle out at closing time.and yet, for all dark moments in this film, the shared refrain of 'tomorrow is another day' points to the ability of people to go on living in spite of many miseries. the soundtrack provided by benny anderson (of abba fame) seems inappropriately jovial at first but makes more and more sense as the film realises this human capacity to persevere.'you, the living' has an extraordinary visual style. the same washed-out, pale-green colours recur throughout, and there is nary a shadow in sight; this makes the characters appear exceptionally pallid and creates the sensation that human life is being laid bare for examination. almost every scene is captured in a static camera frame, as if these are photographs being brought to life. the few occasions where the camera does move are all the more extraordinary; the contrast between the life and movement of the great banquet form a startling contrast with the deadness of the cloakroom scene. in the most intense moments of longing and despair, the characters transfix the viewer by directly facing the camera  they know that they are being examined and have a few moments to pour out their hearts to us, the viewers.this is a wonderful, human film.

this film isn't supposed to be funny, but it made me laugh.it isn't designed to be sad, but my heart felt heavy through a number of the vignettes.it isn't written as action adventure, but my pulse raced more than once.just like life, this movie doesn't manipulate your emotions and tell you how to feel. it simply is, and you react.if you don't find it funny or sad or moving, i suspect that says more about you than the film.it amazing and refreshing to see a director so wholeheartedly celebrate that we are all human, and embrace that we are all trapped here, doing this "life" thing, over and over for as long as we must.tomorrow is another day.

i really didn't see this one coming. roy andersson had me pegged out, i am the perfect sucker for a static camera (long live king borowczyk!) and i was laughing hysterically for the first fifteen minutes of the film, he hit me straight between the eyes. you have to be a brilliant man to make self-pity hilarious. andersson reminds me of the third mate on the pequod in moby dick, flask, a man who took the whole of life to be a practical joke that the good lord himself is playing on us. and the web of egotism in this movie is truly hilarious.the level of satire is at fever pitch, you have one deluded self-pitying dreamer harp on about the cruelty of the world and then totally ignore a spiritual self-reflection crying out in agony. the very depths of egotism are plumbed. i really never thought it possible to go further than bergman's "the silence" in this respect. however the grotesqueness of the self-love and self-regard, by every single character in this film, is staggering. we are shown an existence where the talentless and the idle rail against a world they believe has been unjust towards them, they truly are legends in their own living rooms. the human beings in this film make self-deception and self-delusion a great artform! only one woman in the film appears to have any sort of understanding of what is going on. an old woman who refuses to leave a chapel, knelt down praying for the forgiveness of all mankind, her speech is the most electrifying condemnation of the modern world i have ever heard. she reveals through her prayers that what is wrong with the world is not to be fixed by mere tinkering, there are not a just a few faults, there is an abyss of corruption that can only be mended by immolation, and judgement day. watching this movie puts me in the mind of a naked monk, stood waist deep in a cold river at midnight screaming out a thousand kyrie eleisons for the sins of humanity. another grand jape is that it is clear that her prayers are futile, and in fact she is stopping everyone going home at closing time.this is not a film for the smug, no-one is spared, no idols are left on the altar, no one group of humans is harangued to the glory of another group. never has there been a greater more transcendent more astonishingly beautiful summation of our sins. it is a film for the end of the world, it is the grand jest, the great hideous practical joke of human life! from the catalogue of images it is too difficult to pick a favourite, i slapped my thigh and almost fell off my chair in the cinema, screaming with laughter as a man attempted to pull the tablecloth from under a set service. i won't spoil what happens, but the suspense builds up, and something truly unexpected occurs. it is probably the funniest thing i have ever seen in a cinema. i am quite reserved and i just couldn't control myself: that is the measure of the greatness of this film.the shooting of "you, the living" is impeccably formalist. we are shown the palette of an artist, dingy browns, yellows, greys, and sky blues set alive by the shock of luminous brass textures. there is never a tone out of place, it's like an hour and a half of symphonic whistlerian colour-meld. the obsession that must have gone into putting that colour scheme in place is extraordinary. and no shot is wasted, as with all great movies, there is not a spare inch of celluloid.perhaps the best film i've ever seen.

there is no plot. there are no central characters. there are no moving cameras or close-ups. in fact, this film does not follow any of the conventional storytelling techniques used by mainstream film. however, roy andersson's du levande is a remarkable piece of cinematic storytelling. it is a touching look at the human psyche.comprised of a series of vignettes, roy andersson gives us an intimate insight into what makes us all human. in perfectly framed static shots, added with the perfectly in tune, yet quirky, music, roy introduces us to a host of characters as they undertake their daily existence. some bordering on tragic, others hilarious, we are taken on a nordic journey like no other.it is a journey into the little things that make us human. instead of over-the-top storytelling or visual techniques, everything is stripped down to the bare minimum so that our sole focus is on the characters themselves. it focuses on the insignificant points of our lives that make us who we are; our dreams, our desperation. it's through this simple observation of others that we can accept who we are as individuals.the washed out colours and deathly-pale makeup of the characters only seems to emphasize their individual stories and remind us that unlike them, we are all alive. there is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel in this film, yet you walk out of the cinema with a sense of life. much more accessible than his earlier film, songs from the second floor, du levande, is a truly inspiring piece of cinema.

"with all the misery in the world, how can we not get drunk?"  miaa lovely aerial view of a major city turns ominous with the approach of a fleet of airplane bombers; an irate hairdresser reacting to a perceived racial slur cuts a road through a businessman's bushy hair; a man dreams of being dragged to an electric chair after a failed magic trick and a teacher breaks down in front of her grade school class because her husband called her a hag. these and about fifty other vignettes that run the gamut from the outright depressing to the wildly humorous to the joyously uplifting populate roy andersson's you, the living, his first feature since his critically acclaimed if commercially unsuccessful songs from the second floor.you, the living is filled with the same kind of imaginative set-pieces as songs, replete with black humor, surreal situations, and strange looking characters. though a bit overlong and less focused than his earlier work, what remains constant is andersson's unmistakable style with its stationary camera, sterile-looking backgrounds, and precise attention to detail. if there is a theme that ties the sketches together, it is that our time on earth is limited and "tomorrow's another day', so let's treat each other with kindness. along the way, we are entertained by tuba and drum music from the louisiana brass band, dinner guests at a banquet hall standing on their chairs singing a rousing song, and a house that turns into a moving train.the emotions range from the gloom of a daughter attempting to communicate with an alzheimer's patient to a young woman's ecstatic dream about marrying a handsome guitar-player named micke to the cheers of a crowd of onlookers. while there is no continuous narrative thread, the theme of greed and desperation appears in several sketches. the first of these threads features two corpulent individuals and their tiny dog sitting on a park bench, the woman bewailing the fact that no one understands or loves her, yet she blithely ignores the man's comforting and reassuring words.there is also a hefty admixture of irony. during what seems to be an executive luncheon, one man tells another on the phone that workers don't appreciate quality and how nice it is to appreciate money and the things that it can buy such as fine wine. when he is not looking, however, a man at an adjacent table calmly lifts his wallet from his jacket on the back of his chair. though andersson's cynicism is at times not very well hidden, you the living has an underlying humanism that shows compassion for the human condition. it is a cautionary tale that looks at the mess we humans have gotten ourselves into but suggests there is still time to turn it around, if we heed the warning of the poet goethe that opens the film, "be pleased then, you the living, in your delightfully warmed bed, before lethe's ice-cold wave will lick your escaping foot."

a short review without any spoilers follows.i saw this movie yesterday at the cannes film festival. my initial reaction is one of wonder and happiness. i'm so happy films like this are being made in our age of blockbusters. roy andersson's new movie "you, the living" is nothing less than a complete masterpiece. you, the living is composed by some 50 vignettes filmed with a static camera. i will not give away the content of the scenes here, because i hate when people spoil even the smallest details. but, yes, most of the scenes made the 1000 people in the claude debussy theatre absolutely baffled and amazed. when the film was over we applauded for several minutes, we had no other choice.so what's the score with "you, the living". hm, andersson isn't afraid to take on the heavy questions; history, guilt, gand the holocaust during ww2 are big subjects (and these themes work very well together).the images created are brilliant, the depth sometimes surpasses "songs from the second floor". well, sorry for this ranting, praising review. look out for the flying house in the beginning folks!10/10 stars - a masterpiece (i never throw this grade out).

this showtime cable film features a talented cast and weaves together several storylines involving the darker side of new york... from the naive and innocent tourists' nightmarish adventure to a pair of undercover cops on the streets... to an old friend's betrayal, it has it all.well worth a look, as is its sequel.

naked city: jwab does a pretty good job of balancing its two a - b stories, eventhough i'm not all that fond of multiple plot movies. and scott glen and courtney b. vance make a great on screen dual. however, i'm not sure what kind of message a movie sends when two flat-foot country girls can get off scott free with murder, grand theft, and to top it off, win a free flight home (in first class no less--at least from the looks of their attire anyway). gee, i guess that blue wall of silence is still rather think!rating: 8

the magnitude of the stalingrad tragedy is concisely presented in the end note of the movie: "in the battle of stalingrad, more than one million people were killed in action, froze to death or died of starvation: russians, romanians, italians, hungarians, germans, austrians. of the 260,000 surrounded men of the sixth army, 91,00o were taken prisoners, of whom only 6,000 returned to their homeland, years later.what the story does not tell was that fieldmarshall paulus, who surrendered, did not share all the hardship of the captivity of his men. he had a special treatment as the highest ranking prisonner taken by the soviet army. when, during his presence at the nuremberg trials he was asked about the fate of the 91,000 prisoners, he declared that they were fine. he was freed after the war and died in the east germany.the film only presents the first part of the tragedy, the actual battle of stalingrad. however, for an entire picture, the fate of the 91,000 prisonners should also not be forgotten.

i found the movie very real just as much as saving private ryan and gave an upfront account from the german perspective. the graphic action and individual characters gave this movie much to keep me interested through the whole movie. stalingrad was very brutal battle and the scenes gave this movie that stark reality of this battle. i recommend this for anyone who is interested in military history. this was my second viewing of this movie in a few years and was captivated by it's realism again. the weapons, uniforms, and hearing it german while reading the subtitles gave it much credit for a good military movie. in fact, this being a german perspective of the battle, i was rooting for the germans, even though they were the agressor and ultimate loser of the war.

having majored in western history when i was a student in college seeing the views on world war ii are quite discomforting and in a whole completely wrong. world war ii was the most graphic and bloody affairs to ever occur in world history. while the axis powers conducted many crimes against humanity which is still the view today and the correct many people forget that not every german soldier was out to exterminate the jewish population, not every japanese soldier swung a samurai sword around and flew kamikaze missions, and not every italian soldier was a fascist. most of these soldiers for the axis powers were normal people like you and i caught in a terrible conflict and just happened to be fighting for a country they loved.the battle of stalingrad was arguably the most lethal battles in world history with over 1,500,000 casualties sustained over the course of the battle. the film stalingrad follows a german platoon and its leader lieutenant von witzland as they are reassigned to the eastern front to battle the soviets at stalingrad. von witzland acts as sort of the main character with two other men, rollo and fritzi. they all are normal men and seem to be completely unaware to what is happening back in germany and poland.the film follows the course of the battle. the film is overall very bleak when it comes to its portrayal of combat and a soldiers life during the battle. we are shown numerous gruesome battles and intense violence outside of the battles (including a firing squad sequence). overall the battles are the earliest examples that i know of that portray the loss of limbs and overall in your face death sequences and violence. much of the inspiration for saving private ryan's battle sequences seem to have come from this film.the film does not aim to make the german's completely innocent of everything in the film. several of the higher ranking officers of the army are portrayed in the usual view most people are use to, evil. most of the soldiers are just normal people who often speak of home. the film makes it clear quite quickly that not all germans were responsible for what happened during the holocaust, most of the country and army was entirely oblivious to the fact that genocide was taking place. the film makes it clear that the soldiers in the germany army was simply fighting for a cause they really didn't understand and most wished just to return home rather than freezing in negative degree temperatures in russia.the film really shows how hellish war is, especially world war ii. the battle scenes will shock you with its gritty realism and the story is quite easy to follow as you are simply following a platoon during the battle. as with most war films do not expect much happiness after seeing it. it will leave you in a bit of a depressed mood just from seeing the life most of the soldiers on the eastern front faced. not recommended for children. 4/5 stars

describing stalingrad as a war film may be a bit inaccurate. sure it centers on the longest and bloodiest battle in world history, in the most expansive theater of the most costly war in terms of lives, money, and matériel that has ever occurred. yes it contains action scenes depicting bitter battles and terrible destruction. the visceral storytelling and harsh images though make it something more than a war film, even more than an anti-war film. stalingrad is instead a film about absolute and undeniable hell.the film is fraught with visual descriptions of the worst kind of war, one that is intensely personal and close, where days are spent in taking one city block, only to have it re-taken in a surprise assault. the early form of modern urban warfare that the germans came to call rattenkrieg (rat warfare) is depicted in brutal and uncompromising terms. the characters war in sewer tunnels, rail yards, and from building to building in the hellish bomb-scape of ruined stalingrad, only to be defeated by the unforgiving russian winter.the film deals with the issue of nazism and the vilification of germans in that period in the way that many other films from both germany and the rest of the world do. its characters are a group of soldiers swept along by the winds of war and simply attempting to make it out with themselves and as many of their comrades as possible alive. the characters do not fight the soviets out of any ideological hatred between national socialism and soviet communism, not for any grand dream of grossdeutschland or racial superiority. they fight only because if they do not the enemy will kill them, and if the enemy does not then their own officers certainly will for refusing to fight. this portrayal adds another layer to the suffocating envelope of trapped hopelessness that pervades the film.a sort of ground based companion to das boot, stalingrad frames the epic struggle of world war two in a personal light and from the unexpected perspective of the ordinary german soldier as a sort of hero made tragic by circumstance and a brutal government that would pervert his sacrifice.

one of the best war films i have ever seen, if not the best. it is very hard to talk about such films as it is very difficult to point at any film mistake made. the "problem" is as it looks too real and by that drags you in to the ruins of stalingrad and make you suffer for both sides. this is for the reason that this film unlike the most of hollywood films doesn't glorify the war or the heroism of the main characters. instead of that, the film makes them heroes only for being human and by that is anti-war as much as the reason can offer. extremely convincing war scenes and so impressive acting, most of the scenes look like isolated theater pieces. also, german army is played by germans which is so convincing as well. the film is produced and realized by germans where you can see their love for details to perfection. this is the reason why "stalingrad" is one of the films i can watch million times and never feel dull. i watched the film with my father who fought in wwii and the first thing he said was: "this is like real, this is how the war against germans looked like". this is the place you can see how did it look to be a soldier in the worst nightmare of warfare in human history and turning point of wwii: stalingrad.

this movie basically is a very well made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved. it's always interesting to see the story from the 'other' side for a change. this movie concentrates on a group of german soldiers who after fighting in the north africa campaign are send to stalingrad, russia, where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of ww ii is being fought.it's interesting to see the other side of this battle, since we mainly just always see the germans simply as the 'villains'. in this movie those 'villains' are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who you're fighting against. at first it's kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the german's are the evil villains. but of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care -and be interested in them.the way this story is told isn't however the best. it's hard to keep track of the story at times, as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other. the movie isn't always logic in its storytelling and features a bit too many sequences that remain too vague. it also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who. it doesn't always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand, there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one, just not the most coherent one around. in that regard hollywood movies are always better than european movies.the production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations, though the movie wasn't even shot in russia itself. it helps to create a good war time situation atmosphere.the character are mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic. but i don't know, for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism. it also helps that they're being played by well cast actors. all of the actors aren't the best known actors around (thomas kretschmann was also at the time still a fairly unknown actor) but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personality.all in all not the best or most consistent ww ii drama around but definitely worth a look, due to its original approach of the german side of the battle of stalingrad and its good production values.7/10

from a military historian's standpoint, nearly everything in this movie is historically accurate. beyond that, it is an enthralling story that leaves you depressed at the end but quite glad you took the time to watch.

stalingrad is a terrific movie, well acted and directed, and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and it's politics. this is, together with "das boot" one of the best war movies (together with the finnish "vinterkriget" ("the winter war", in english, i believe)). it depicts the ordeals of some of the german soldiers that fought --- and died --- in and around stalingrad during world war 2. no big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war. the mood of the movie is similar to the one in "das boot", and that should give you some hints on what to expect, i guess. so, if you enjoy realistic, non-hollywoodish, war movies: rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it! finally, a film buff's note: for some of the previous reviewers information, i only want to add that "stalingrad" isn't directed by wolfgang petersen (who made "das boot")!

this film does for infantry what das boot did for submariners. if you appreciated das boot then that is all you really need to know.this is a well done piece of cinema. on a par with das boot. basically it follows a company of elite german "stormtrooper" infantry who leave garrison duty in an idyllic italian seaside town and are immediately thrust into the chaos of the disintegrating russian front. a good war movie illuminates both the senselessness and brutality of war and at the same time gives us insight into the experiences and essential humanity of those who fight. this movie does that. the film is full of drama and action and so is entertaining on that level as well.

bloody marvelous. recommended by a friend who knew i liked thomas kretschmann in the pianist and downfall. i loved the flow of the narrative - how the characters moved from hope and ideals of valour through shock, fear, disintegration, desperation and utter annihilation. a first rate anti-war movie that must have created quite the stir in germany. not a proud moment for anyone and the study of a generation lost. this movie was excellent at conveying the remove of the command from the ground troops and in pounding the utter futility of trying to control untamed nature and the russian psyche. if i didn't know i would have thought it was a russian movie it was so fatalistic. what an uncompromising ending. a pieta.

this movie tries to run away to the typical 'i'm fighting because i'm obliged to defend the fatherland. the nazi's are all bad guys, i'm against them' (typical of german war movies). how? by not talking too much about it, and just referring the war and the pow's. nevertheless i would like to see a german movie which would be something between the extremity of come and see and the "bad nazi's" das boot. i say this because, excluding this factor, the german movies are the best depicting 2nd world war and the german side. you easily see some of the german hierarchical relations, very different from the ones in us army.this is a movie which tries to get a real sight of what was stalingrad, and i was not there, and i doubt most people were there now, but if i would choose one movie depicting this battle, for sure would not be the all american enemy at the gates. why do i say this? because even the best soldiers are not hero's, and given the conditions they may regard their own lives instead of the fatherland. this goes for all the ranks, and in the end you see von paulus giving the example.

i was looking at the external reviews (ebert, etc.) for this film and they were all pretty much negative. however, after reading many of them, i noticed that they all made the same point. critics were upset that the film centers around what appears to be a senseless murder of an autistic child. certainly, this is a disturbing image. critics like ebert want a traditional detective story that uncovers why the killing happened and squarely places blame on the guilty. they want blame to be cast and resolved. well, that status-quo theme is kind of what the movie is parodying. just like society, the critics wanted a very quick resolution so they could move on to their next tragic opera. perhaps there is no simple question to be answered here? there is a whole lot more to what happened then what is on the surface. the film does not seek to rationalize what happens, but rather understand the why. what also steams me so much about these inane reviews is that all they look at in the way of performances is spacey and cheadle, who were both great (and generally are). but there are other great performances at work here other than just the two current icons of hollywood. gosling gives an incredible performance that really only somebody of his extreme talent could deliver. somehow, gosling is able to make the killer of an autistic child sympathetic. this irritates many, i am sure. however, if one watches the film, they see what leeland's motivation is, it is wrong, but it is not evil. malone is also on top of her game as yet another confused young character. basically, the killing of the child in this film is not the main theme of the movie. the main theme is life itself and how people go about dealing with it, the highs and lows, and how they attempt to sometimes help others deal with their lives (which does not seem to work out very well). there is a lot of good and bad in this world and how we handle each has direct impact on how much more good and bad will take place, and sometimes a confused attempt at doing good, can lead to a whole bunch more of bad. i think this is one of the more memorable films in sometime and has an ending that is as touching as anything in recent movie history. i strongly believe people should view this film, with an open mind.

leland p. fitzgerald (ryan gosling) has committed an unspeakable crime, the stabbing of the retarded younger brother of his ex-girlfriend becky (jena malone). no one, least of all leland himself, can explain why he's done what he's done, whether the act was premeditated or spontaneous, done out of hatred or love.in the detention center, leland meets pearl madison (don cheadle), a onetime novel writer who sees in leland's case a second opportunity. but pearl also wants to understand leland's motivation and takes him under his wing as a confidante in the prison.the film jumps from the past to the present several times, often allowing the past to act as a context to the present, and vice versa. writer/director matthew ryan hodge shows how leland's crime - and the events leading up to it - affect the people in his life, from becky to her family to leland's mother (lena olin) and estranged father (kevin spacey) to allen (chris klein), a young man who is staying with becky's family after the death of his own mother.the chief asset in the movie is gosling, who is perfectly cast as the 15-year-old pseudopsychopath. like bartleby the scrivener, gosling's leland just exists; he shows little emotion during the film, but instead his expressions belie an ocean of guilt, sadness, love, and rage.each of the main actors offered perhaps their best work to date, save spacey (who's not exactly a novice). special praise is due to malone and klein, two young performers who are better known for lighthearted comedy fare than the heavy drama of this movie.another huge benefit in terms of the story is that none of the characters is flawless; none are heroes out to save the day. this is simply not a black-and-white movie.

don't let any reviews (critics, imdb users or mine) influence you seeing this movie. i read only the plot premise and became intrigued. after watching, this movie, in my opinion, is definitely worth seeing. it gives a perspective on life that many have probably not contemplated. its is not however, as leland himself says, a movie that "can be wrapped up in a neat package with a bow and everything." other user reviews on this website claim to have a psychological background and imply that the story is not feasible. quite obviously they missed the entire point of the movie, which is disappointing. to say the least.in short, it is a well acted, well directed movie. the story is not a feel good one, but i feel if you don't come away from the movie feeling good, you may just have missed something. to characterize it as "art house" is unfair, in my opinion, but as our society likes labels, this is probably the one that fits. if you find you know everything there is to know about the world... i'd suggest skipping this one. if you feel movies should be a form of escape "from the world"... you won't find it here. but if you do watch it... you just might find something in yourself.

leland fitzgerald (ryan gosling) is sent to jail for the murder of an autistic kid. when pressured with the question 'why?' he doesn't have an answer. while in jail he meets pearl (don cheadle), his teacher, who decides to take matters into his own hands and helps leland figure out why he did it. throughout this film we learn all about leland's troubled life, including his ex-girlfriend becky(jena malone), his famous father albert(kevin spacey)and his whole sad life. this film is matthew ryan hoge's second movie, and it is spectacular in nearly everyway. this is one movie which will leave you thinking in the end, and wondering about how it all works. the movie is quite dark, but if you can handle that then you will realize just how good a film it is.in this movie, there is no bad guy. there is no one you can blame for anything that happens. there's no stereotyping, and the audience does not try to prove leland guilty. instead, we sit back, relax, and watch this boy's life unfold throughout the corse of the movie. all the problems depicted in the story are very real. drug addiction, parental expectations, overwhelming sadness; they all exist in our world.ryan gosling gives one of the greatest performances of his career in this movie, as the depressed teenager leland. his father lives in europe and doesn't really care much about his son. the only person he loves is becky, but she has problems of her own. he knows exactly what he did, but as he says in the film, 'you want a why, but maybe there isn't one. maybe this is something that just happened.' there is a why, but we don't find out about it until the end. as you watch the movie, the audience finds themselves amazed that such a young person could know so much about the world. leland notices things that people tend to ignore. a particular thought-provoking scene which really affected me was during one of leland's conversations with pearl. pearl just cheated on his wife and when leland asks why, pearl replies that he's only human. then leland says something which never really occurs to anyone: "why do people only say that when they've done something wrong?"another fantastic acting job was provided by chris klein. in the film he plays allen harris, the boyfriend of becky's sister julie (michelle williams). although he is not one of the main characters, i found myself amazed at how deep his character was. you can relate to allen a lot. you know how much he cares for the pollard family. it's as if they were his own flesh and blood. by the end of the movie, you realize just how far he would go to help them. overall, this movie is a masterpiece which has been overlooked by quite a few people. if, however, you take the time to watch it, you will most likely see that everything i've mentioned above is true. and once you're finished watching it, you'll never look at the world the same way again.9.5/10

simply delightful claymation feature from nick park and company spoofing such film-greats as "king kong" and "the wolf man" has wallace and gromit as rabbit security finding it difficult to solve a major problem in their village..a giant were-rabbit is feasting lavishly on the vegetable crops of the citizens! what makes this even worse is that the great vegetable festival is about to commence and the citizens have all prepared dutifully to win the top of prize. what makes the situation even worse is wallace is the reason behind the whole vegetable-eating rampage..he was testing out a new invention regarding taking his brain waves in an attempt to brain wash captured rabbits into disliking vegetable crops. what occurs is catastrophic as some sort of hybrid were-rabbit is created in the process..and it has more to do with wallace than he could ever imagine. it'll be up to his loyal(..and startlingly intelligent)and fast-thinking dog gromit to save the day.this is a clever and imaginative effort from the crew behind other oscar winning claymation features starring wallace and gromit. seeing good ole-fashioned claymation is refreshing considering the cgi boom that has featured rather lackluster fare here recently as the industry spits out more and more mediocre product. here, we get a full feature with witty humor and some wild stunts featuring marvelous animation, not to mention gut-busting sight gags.

following on from the huge success of nick park and the aardman team with the wallace and gromit short animations we now have the first (hopefully of many) feature with the plasticine characters that so many love. the dvd of the movie has proved to be the most durable and best used of my two children's many christmas presents by a long way. the plot of the movie is straightforward enough but the beauty of the w & g films for me is the background gags. there are plenty of up front gags and slapstick for kids and adults to enjoy but the background is the killer for me. all in a classy addition to an already classy filmography for nick park etal and i would recommend fans and new watchers to see this film....often.

the first full-length film featuring the aardman characters wallace and gromit manages to bring in elements of all the previous half-hour show which aired on television.wallace runs a company to humanely capture rogue rabbits from people's vegetable gardens, and has the bright idea to try out his invention on the hapless bunnies once they're caught. of course, as in other wallace and gromit films, things don't quite work out as planned.similarly to a close shave, there's a love interest for wallace, in this case the village lady posh, and a big mean villain with a bullish dog. gromit is beautifully animated with a wide range of expressions making the character laugh out loud funny. and of course peter sallis provides the voice of wallace again and is a perfect fit.and as in a grand day out, cheese features heavily to great comedic effect as the film moves along.on the negative side this film is a little on the long side. there are great effects, and some pieces which make you sit up and watch, but perhaps this story would have worked better as another short subject rather than pushing it to feature-length.

''wallace & gromit in the curse of the were-rabbit'' is the same type of animation and from the same creators of ''chicken run'', but the story now is other: wallace, a inventor who loves cheese and his smart dog gromit who is always helping wallace in his problems,are trying to keep the rabbits away from everybody's vegetables,since there is in their town, an annual giant vegetable competition. but when wallace tries an invention he did, to make the rabbits avoids vegetable, the one who is going to be cursed is him. before watching this movie i didn't knew that these two characters already existed and were famous.i loved gromit, and i think he is one of the coolest dogs i already saw.aka "wallace & gromit-a batalha dos vegetais" - brazil

my only problem with the curse of the were-rabbit is that the movie does not take the time to properly introduce wallace and gromit to those not familiar with park's short films. strangely, "a close shave" manages to do this with a lot less time to spare. still, i loved seeing the boys back in action and loved all the new characters, human and otherwise. i especially loved ralph fiennes voice as the scheming victor quartermaine. it is also interesting to see the series on the large screen. the workmanship with the clay characters really stands out. it's a hoot, and great for the whole family! i buy very few dvds but i have every wallace and gromit and will happily add this one.

in 1989, aardman animations introduced the two heros in the grand day out. in 1993, they fought an evil penguin in the wrong trousers. and in 1995, they had to rescue sheep from an evil robot dog in a close shave. in 2005, they're back and they are going to fight something that used to be cute and cuddlely in the curse of the were-rabbit. in this full feature film, wallace and gromit work in anit-pesto, a pest-control business. there's going to be a giant vegetable competition, but rabbits keep eating the neighbors vegies. wallace and gromit takes care with that problem. but wallace had an idea. he will brainwash the bunnies with his machine. after doing that, something suddenly eats all of the vegies in the neighborhood and it's big. it's up to wallace and gromit to save the day. as a fan of these two characters, i was impressed. it kept what the 3 previous chapters had and instead adding a lot of hollywood actors for voice-overs, they put a no name cast to the job and boy, they did a fantastic job. wallace and gromit has not changed. wallace is still the cheese-loving freak like he always was and gromit is the silent newspaper reading dog. also, the script was not too shabby like other family movies were. there is a twist of who the were-rabbit really is. the direction from nick park (the director of the 3 previous chapters) does a really good job with the storyline. instead of adding the hollywood formula in it, he just took the style of the previous chapters and adds a bit of a dark fantasy twist in it. well done, nick. the rabbits are also funny and adorable, but the funniest rabbit in the movie is one who has the mix of wallace in him. the characters were not bad and they weren't annoying, but they'll never top wallace and gromit. the animation is indeed fantastic and wonderful. i've never seen a clay-animated movie that is so amazing since chicken run. overall, fans of the two knuckleheads (including the teens) will love this fantastic film. it is a well done film that should get an oscar next year. hooray, wallace and gromit. 10/10

this was very good, except for two things which i'll mention at the end. the animation is great, highlighted by nick park and company's trademark of exaggerated teeth and mouths of the characters, which make you laugh almost every time you see someone. the color was magnificent, too.the best part of the film, however, is the clever comedy woven throughout. this is another of these animated films in which there is so much to see and hear each frame that it would require many viewings to catch all the gags. it's just a funny exaggerated look at the oddball "wallace" and his silent-and-smart dog "gromit." along the way, it pokes fun people who get carried away with their vegetable gardens, something akin to how the obsessive dog lovers were pictured in "best of show."my only complaints were two typical traits of today's films, animated or not: 1 - let's make the cleric in the film look like a total idiot; 2 - let's overdo the final action scene with the predictable result but way overdone. those aside, this is still a very amusing film that should provide a lot of laughs to many people and a movie to enjoy multiple times.

having just come home from my third viewing of the curse of the were-rabbit, i decided to jump on imdb and see what others thought. i noticed a lot of brits loved it, while those in america just didn't get it. that really doesn't come as any shock, as america doesn't get what "english" is.wallace and gromit are very english. middle class english, in fact, with a hint of eccentricity throw in for good measure. the film is a lot like our two heroes; simple and unassuming. it has a nice and gentle plot so the children don't get lost, yet there's enough beef there to keep the adults amused too. there's some light innuendo (which seems have to have offended the evangelic - oh noes, drama!) but there is nothing more rude than a bottom for a brief moment. when people get offended by a plasticine anus, you know the world's messed up...one quick note to those (all american so far that i have seen) who think chicken run is a better film: chicken run was made to pander to your sense of humour, and i think it suffered because of it. curse of the were rabbit is witty, english, and intelligent. thomas the tank engine's film was ruined because it was made to please the americans and i'm glad nick park did not let that happen to another great british institution.to sum up: you can keep your chicken runs, your shreks, your madagasga's - that kind of crude, crass, slapstick comedy just doesn't compare to the wit and grace that is wallace and gromit in curse of the were-rabbit. english to the core, and long may wallace and gromit stay that way.

wallace & gromit: the curse of the were-rabbit (2005) **** (voices: peter salis, ralph fiennes helena bonham carter)fantastic feats of clay: wallace & gromit save the day! crackin' good entertainment!nick park, the creator of the animated team of wallace & gromit, is a genius. his painstaking art in the form of plasitcine claymation is a unique process involving literally thousands of hours (it takes roughly an 8 hour work day to contribute 3 minutes of action to a film; this foray into feature length storytelling took 5 years!) in making his lovable master & loyal dog team take form is finally on the big screen in the duo's first full-length motion picture and it's cracklin' good (to coin a phrase from wallace's usual reply to all things good!) park, who co-directed with steve box and co-wrote with mark burton and bob baker, sends up the horror genre in this rollickingly funny and swift paced action comedy with the geeky inventive wallace (voiced by british vet thespian salis) and his mute yet loyal (and sharper-minded) mutt gromit (all furrowing eyebrows and mouth-less insouciance) have devised a service to their community: pest control ("anti-pesto" as they are known) for the upcoming giant vegetable festival that has the entire town in the mood for all things vegetative a gigante and the biggest pesk are troublesome rabbits eating the crunchy goods. wallace's inventive mind has created a vacuum container that is quick, efficient, and more importantly harmless to the cute vermin that plague the estate of lady campanula tottington (voiced by bonham carter, making a fast-break to be the first lady of stop-motion animation what with her earlier turn in "corpse bride" a few weeks ago), who is housing the competition and is a love interest for the nerdy wallace.the only fly-in-the-ointment is vainglorious, bombastic loud-mouth and jerk victor quartermaine (voiced by fiennes, his first attempt in the animated arts coming across as a patrick stewart lunged braggard with hilarious results), a badly toupeed wearing macho moron who is plotting to marry lady tottington for her riches while he is a chief competitor to w&g's humane attempts by resorting to his trusty guns and nasty bulldog.to add insult to injury the duo are facing a terrible plight in the form of a huge were-rabbit (the titular monster a nice nod to both universal and hammer horror flicks) that is terrorizing the village and devouring every veggie in sight. the two set out to trap and dispose of the creature but there is more than meets the eye as things progress.relentlessly funny and with such amazing elastic, and kinetic energy to his wonderful clay counterparts, park and box have created a truly magical and highly entertaining film with so much amazingly detailed production design to their little world that it may take more than one screening to absorb just how much effort in their blood, sweat and tears have gone into making this instant classic for children of all ages. wallace, the cheese loving balding inventor, could easily be homer simpson's uk cousin with his rotund body and constant knack for getting things wrong while attempting to do the right thing; his heart is in the right place but his head is in the clouds. his sweet crush for lady tottington (resembling a pre-plastic surgery carol burnett) who is a head taller than our hero will perhaps remind those of their first unrequited love with a smile of awkward admission. his rube goldberg-like gift for making the complicated into ease is inspired lunacy that fans will recall from the earlier shorter films "the wrong trousers", "a close shave" and "a grand day out".but it is in my opinion the wise, silent and long-suffering gromit, his poached egg eyes of slow-burns and disbelief at what is transpiring, is one of the best animated characters ever created with such an amazing arsenal of exasperated, mouthless expressions and subtle nuances that most live-action actors would kill to accomplish in the attempt of conveying dismay, concern, grief, genuine surprise and relief. his final chase  a signature of the immensely popular comic team  is ingeniously set and quickly improvised especially his literal dog-fight with the equally soundless bulldog with tenacity, wit and a chuck jones fueled smartness that would have bruce willis and arnold schwarzenegger green with envy.wallace and gromit match the best of laurel & hardy, abbott & costello and any other classic comedy team that comes to mind; here's hoping their longevity continues on screen for just as long as their predecessors. the waiting is most eager.

there are a few aspects to park's movies, and in particular wallace & gromit, that i would say make them so great. the first is subtlety and observation, the flagship of which is the character of gromit. he doesn't speak, he doesn't make any noise, all he has are his eyes, brow, and body posture, and with these he commands the film. park manages to give us everything we need from this silent character through his expression. the comedy and the emotion is conveyed through the subtlest of movements and it works superbly well.watching the movie you have to be aware of the entire screen. normally you'll be guided to things in the movies, the screen won't be cluttered too much, there won't be many things to take your eyes away from the main clue or action. park seems to need to look the other way with his movies. he throws extra content at his audience, there's action in the background, to the side of the screen, even off screen, and there's just about always something in the foreground to catch your eye. his movies are about multiple viewing and discovery, they're layered with jokes and ancillary action.throughout this film there are layers of things happening on screen, jokes in the foreground maybe on a jar label and background shadows that give away action. you can imagine that for park the movies has always been an event, and the movies he loves are ones which he wants to watch again and again. this is what shows in his movies, and in through his most beloved characters.then there are the bizarre and wacky inventions which wallace make, something which is reflected in the storyline and the twists and turns of the plot, everything is bizarre and off the wall, yet it seems so perfectly normal in this world. you can imagine that inside park is the mind of wallace.there's also one more thing that make these movies so unique, and that's the modelling and precise hand animation. i must admit i was concerned when i knew dreamworks was involved in the making of this movie, and i thought that they would bring their computer animation experience to the forefront. what i was scared of was wallace & gromit becoming cgi entities, or at the smallest, cgi being used to clean up the feel that the modelling brought to the movie.not so. you can still see thumbprints and toolmarks on the characters, and far from distracting from the movie, this just adds so much real feeling to it and a feeling of physical depth to the characters and the scene on screen.so what of the movie? well i must say that the plot twist was something i had thought about well before the film was in the cinema and it came as no surprise, but that did not affect my enjoyment one little bit. actually watching the twist unfold and the comic timing of the discovery and reactions was everything, and it had me just as sucked in as if it was a thriller, yet all the time i was laughing.watching the movie was fascinating in various ways. to see the animation completed, how wild the inventions are, how wallace is going to get into trouble and gromit get him out, where all the cross references are in the movie, and where all the jokes are! i must admit afterwards talking with my friends i couldn't believe how much i had missed.there's something different in this movie than with the others, there's a new level of adult humour in here, and i don't mean rude jokes (although there are a couple that are just so british you can't help laughing), i mean jokes that simply fly over kids heads but slap adults in the face. the kind you are used to seeing come out of somewhere like pixar. this just adds even more appeal to the movie.okay though, let me try and be a bit negative here. i didn't notice the voices in this movie, you know how you usually listen to the actors and see if you can recognise them? well i was just too wrapped up in the movie to care or to notice who they were...okay, that's not negative. let me try again. the main plot wasn't as strong and gripping as i'd expected, and i found myself being caught up in the side stories and the characters themselves...again...that's not a bad thing, the film was just so much rich entertainment.i honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about this movie, probably the worst thing i could say is that the title sequence at the end is quite repetitive...until the final title! really, that's the worst i can say.the story is a lot of fun, well set-up, well written, well executed. there's lot's of fantastic characters in here, not just wallace & gromit. there's so much happening on screen, so many references and jokes (check out the dresses of lady tottingham), cheese jokes everywhere, jokes for all the family. the characters are superbly absorbing and you'll find that you've taken to them before you realise. there's just so much in this movie for everyone.there's so much i could say and write about, but i know it will quickly turn into a backslapping exercise for park and aardman, it would also just turn into a series of "this bit was really funny" and "there's a bit when...", and what i would rather do is tell you that this is a superb movie, to go see it, and to experience the whole thing for yourselves. i will say though that the bunnies are excellent!

i really refused to see this movie. i refused to go with the school and i refused to go with my parents. just by looking at the trailer it looked stupid, to me anyway. one of my friends wanted to take me to the movies that day and he offered me 2 choices, "the dukes of hazzard" or "wallace and gromit: the curse of the were-rabbit." it took me 17 minutes to decide. time was running out. i had to choose. it came up on the screen "few" as in a few tickets left. by the time we had to line up and get our ticket, only one of us could go in. i desperately wanted nicholas to go in to see it. but he forced me. i crossed my arms and was very moody and disappointed that i was going in to see this childishness. i walked in, sat in the only seat that was available and prepared for the movie! must say i was very surprised that i sat through that masterpiece! it was amazing. i don't know what i was complaining about. the clay animation was by far the most best i've ever seen in my life. the story was brilliant. about a rabbit disrupting and crashing a carnival that had been planned for over 500 years. basically anti pest control are protecting the people who are competing in the vegetable competition. anti pesto known as wallace and gromit (who are in charge of this business) try to keep all the rabbits away from the vegetable carnival. i wont say anymore. it's just too good to tell. i'll admit that the whole idea of a were-rabbit is ab-it unbelievable and ab-it childish, but nick park adds substance to it which what makes everyone love it. i mean, there wont be a 10 foot rabbit on the loose and there definitely wont be 8 foot werewolves as said in " dog soldiers." then again, were-rabbits and werewolves aren't actual creatures. but either way, it worked out very well. the jokes also were more grown up. the kids wont get some of the jokes. it goes way above their heads. it had a lot of british jokes in there. if you love british humor, this is the movie for you.i also loved the cast and the voices. everything about the movie is so incredibly well done. the direction and pacing was absolutely...fantastic! i recommend this to fans of the old wallace and gromit shorts (and no, i haven't seen them yet), and i recommend it to fans who liked "shrek" and "shrek 2 and most importantly, i recommend it to the people who love clay animation. cracking good movie! 10/10

what-ho! this one is jolly good. i say jolly good, ol' chap. or should i say "ol' bean"? my mastery of british terminology is a little dusty. anyway, my biker boots and i walked into this screening with no prior viewing experience of wallace and gromit. i'm happy to say that my boots and i walked out pleased to have made their acquaintance.while not as adult-accessible as toy story, w & g still manages to be clever enough to provide the grown ups with a little humor that will most definitely soar over the heads of the young 'uns who are too busy guffawing at the were-rabbit's belches to have any clue that something is amiss. i highly suggest that you pay close attention any time you see books or words on the screen because there are quick glimpses of puns that you'll miss if you aren't paying attention. my favorite is a book of monsters that refers to the loch ness monster as "tourist trappus." if you've ever been known to say, "i can really relate to kevin federline," or if you're just illiterate then not only will you miss out on these jokes, but you probably should be spending your time learning to read instead of going to movies. consider this a public service announcement.the most impressive aspect about w & g is its clay animation. thanks to the tedious process, it took five years to finish the film! according to the press notes, there were some days when the optimum goal was to merely accomplish 10 seconds of completed film. folks, i sometimes have trouble finding the motivation to finish responding to a handful of emails or adding captions to pictures for my reviews (a point that is proved by a lack of pictures in this review); so i can't even imagine having the required patience for that.i really like the rough, hands-on quality of the claymation figures. the fact that you can see fingerprints in the clay is a nice, personal touch. how can you not be impressed with clay characters that show more expression and emotion than paul walker and keanu reeves combined? the curse of the were-rabbit is, as director nick park calls it, the world's first vegetarian horror movie that should entertain both kids and adults alike. relying on (and as a male who prides himself in his shaggy-haired, cool-bearded masculinity i hesitate to use this word) cute and (oh man, i probably shouldn't use this word either) lovable characters rather than outdated m.c. hammer references, w & g is proof that dreamworks can create entertaining animation when it chooses cleverness over the cheap joke.

when wallace and gromit burst onto the scene in their academy award winning short, "a grand day out," they created a fresh new look at claymation. after two more shorts, aardman's dynamic duo returned for this thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie. it has an excellent voice cast, humorous jokes and good animation as only aardman could do! in this movie, wallace and gromit run "anti-pesto," a rabbit removal company. when word gets out about a "were-rabbit" eating all the vegetables in town, a frenzy ensues. of course, victor quartermaine, the town's handsome, toupee-brandishing huntsman, wants to get his hands on the rabbit to impress the lovely lady tottington...but can our favorite aardman duo save the day before chaos ensues?the jokes, i should say, were hilarious. one point, the villain, victor quartermaine's, booty-crack was showing, prompting a character to cry out: "beware...the moon!!!" vintage aardman!the characters are crisp and hilarious. our favorite aardman team of man and dog entertains us as only they could do, earning them their second oscar (remember "a grand day out?"). helena bonham carter was terrific as the lovely lady tottington, wallace's love interest. ralph fiennes was especially funny and foreboding as the cunning, toupee wearing hunter victor quartermaine. but the one who really stole the show was the priest, whose antics proved to be some hilarious comic relief. hats off to aardman for creating another wallace and gromit masterpiece!

wallace and gromit are the main characters in some of the best cartoons ever crafted. the excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes "a grand day out," "the wrong trousers," and also "a close shave" some of the best animated footage ever put on television. winning several oscars and also countless other awards, nick park became quite the popular man in the u.k., yet his impact on the united states has not been big. after the third wallace and gromit short, there was all this speculation about a full-length wallace and gromit movie, yet for years nothing had happened. then in 2000 instead of a full-length wallace and gromit film, we get another brilliant claymation film from nick park, which was chicken run, which almost got nominated for best picture in the academy awards. perhaps it was the success of this film that ultimately drove park to finally work on a wallace and gromit project.5 years later (these kinds of films do take long you know) and a lot of anticipation, wallace and gromit finally hits the big screen. despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign, this movie delivers in so many ways. this film will be a delight for both kids and parents. with tons of adult humor hidden beneath the brilliant animation, wallace and gromit: curse of the were-rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly manages to equally appeal to both kids and adults. this rather difficult technique is one that only pixar has already perfected and dreamworks has had a lot of trouble doing lately. despite the dreamworks logo slapped onto the poster, this film is mainly from the very creative staff of aardman animations.wallace and gromit are first seen running a business that protects the townspeople's crops from being ruined by rabbits, which apparently had been running around wild and in great numbers lately. their business has gotten them plenty of respect from the others living in the town because a gigantic vegetable contest was rapidly approaching and the crops needed protection. complications arise when wallace attempts to manipulate the rabbits into not liking vegetables and then a great eating machine is unleashed on the area. it is up to wallace and gromit to find the gigantic animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also their approval from the townspeople. to add to that, wallace wants to impress lady tottington, which also captured the attention of a snobby suitor by the name of victor. simple plot yes, but there is more than meets the eye, be prepared for a few fun surprises along the way, kind of like in the other wallace and gromit cartoons.in animated films with little dialogue, it is the animation that has to set the pacing and the mood of the film. despite requiring 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage, the payoff is fantastic. there is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one viewing to truly notice. even more incredible than the detailed and nearly flawless animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor put into the film. whether it is a creatively placed shot or normal labels put into the funniest position possible, or it is the oh-so-adorable rabbits that is constantly shown in the film, most curse of the were-rabbit's humor comes strictly from just watching the movie itself and catching all the references before it is too late. just picture the movie madagascar, except funnier much fewer pop culture references, and better animation.casting was great, even though in a film with not much dialogue, it was not that important. peter sallis yet again does a wonderful job as wallace, even though in this movie there was no stand-out quote that can be used anytime (the wrong trousers: "it's the wrong trousers gromit, and they've gone wrong!"). ralph fiennes does a superb job as the lead villain victor and also helena bonham carter (known as the crazy female lead in the cult hit "fight club") lends her lovely voice as she plays wallace's love interest. even though nothing could top the final chase in "the wrong trousers," curse of the ware-rabbit did have plenty of action scenes, including one fantastically done chase scene between gromit and victor's evil dog. last but not least, the rabbits really steal the show at some moments. whether it is their cute expressions, their funny movements, or their howling, the rabbits in the film even take some of the glory from the main stars. the funniest rabbit in the movie is the "cursed" rabbit himself, to the very end of the movie he had the audience rolling in laughter.bottom line: despite not being as memorable as "the wrong trousers", this film is just as good and entertaining as chicken run. unlike almost every movie to come out this year, the movie does not drag at all, clocking in at a short 85 minutes yet containing so much joy and fun, it will leave everyone watching it asking for more. there is very little wrong with the film; it was a pure delight to watch. this film is a total contrast of the decent yet vulgar, uncut, raw movies that have made a surprising amount of money earlier this year (40-year-old virgin, wedding crashers, and sin city) and for families and those who want harmless entertainment; that is a good thing. highly recommend, this is the top animated movie to come out this year and among the best we have seen this decade. wallace and gromit: curse of the were-rabbit: totally harmless fun from second 1 to second 5,100.

this first (and hopefully not last) wallace & gromit feature lives up to expectations. there are plenty of jokes (some a bit cheeky) as well as some great tributes to past science fiction movies. with the barrage of awful and formulaic movies being spewed forth from hollywood it's great to see such a great film like this that's enjoyable for almost everyone. if there is any justice it will be top of the box-office and be at least nominated for best animation at the next oscars. the animation is wonderful; the characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are great fun. this is one of those films that the whole family can enjoy. charming, clever, fun and well made, what's not to enjoy?

being a "wallace and gromit-fan", i was looking forward for this full-length movie. surprisingly i saw it at the world-premiere in vlissingen (nl), at the film by the sea festival. a wonderful feeling to be one of the first to see this very amusing and merry movie. it's about wallace and gromit (whom i believe don't need an introduction) having their own pest-control company in the city which is hosting a giant-vegetable contest in a few days. everyone, including an eccentric baroness, is hoping his or her giant carrot or melon will win the golden carrot. unfortunately the town is plagued by lots of hungry rabbits. this is where w&g come in. the have their own cracking contraptions to control these cute creatures in a human way.it's a very funny and colorful story. anyone who liked the three proceeding short movies of w&g (which are more than great!), will love this full-length movie. nick park really delivered a wonderful and original result with a great sense for humor. like in chicken run, it truly amazes me how he can capture so much story and emotions in just a few frames. "job well done, lad" ;-) oh yeah: the music was fantastic! it really completes the ride. enjoy!

i saw it at a german press screening. without giving too much away: most critics really seemed to like it very much. there was even applause afterwards, which is quite unusual for that species. from my point of view and until now, it was the funniest movie of the year. it keeps the charm and wit of the three w+g shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies. of course, there are obvious allusions to monster- and werewolf-movies, especially to "an american werewolf in london", "jaws", "king kong" and even to peter jackson's "braindead"/"dead alive", but also to other genres.characterization was better done in "chicken run", but that movie had a complete new "cast" where introduction was necessary. here, you are already able to know the two main characters. so, the new "wallace and gromit"-movie is enjoyed best if you watched (and liked) the shorts already, yet it also works on its own. "chicken run" had the more convenient, but also more "storytelling" plot. instead, this new aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more "isolated" feeling of the w+g shorts. children should also enjoy it very much, especially because of the sweet rabbits (if you love cute bunnies, this is a must-see for you!!!) and because gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show (children also love dogs... :-) ). but many jokes are thought for a more adult audience (there are even soft sexual allusions in it). the movie manages, like "shrek 1+2" and "the incredibles", to fulfil high level entertainment for the whole family, with adding a british and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of american animated movies.the animation is  as expected  superb, and they kept true to the aardman style because they didn't put in too many digital effects - i realized just a few when it came to wallace's inventions.finally, the score works fine in the movie, although one of the main themes definitely is "borrowed" by randy edelman's "dragonheart" score.the bad thing is: it will probably take another six years from now until we can see a new animated gem from nick park & co.

this is the kind of film they used to make, amusing, heart-warming, troubling, authentic, with convincing performances by people without nose jobs, boob jobs, eye jobs, in other words real people. shauna macdonald plays the female love interest, and she is so real you want to give her a cuddle at the very least. imagine that, a real girl in a movie, whatever next? hollywood would hate her, because her freshness is a sharp rebuke to every false starlet in tinseltown. this story has the same hilarious feel as sandy mackendrick's classic 'whisky galore', with the gnomic humour of remote scottish islanders puncturing the pretensions of intruders from outside and enjoying a wee dram from time to time (the actual intervals between those times often being rather short). director stephen whittaker displays a rare skill in pulling this off just right, and it is shocking to discover that he died before his film's release, aged only 56, which was clearly a substantial loss to the screen. ulrich thomsen does very well at playing a german rocket scientist who in the late 1930s goes to scarp in the isle of harris to build a small rocket to carry postal packets between the islands. there he falls in love with the alluring macdonald lass, and she reciprocates the affection. some wonderfully colourful local characters decorate the tale, and the film is pure delight. there is of course the threat of imminent war with hitler, and we learn that hitler executed 1000 rocket scientists who refused to build weapons of war, which is a shocking statistic. tragic love is never far from view, but lips must remain sealed in a review as to what happens in the end. this film is a magnificent example of just the kind of films which people in britain should be making. but are they being properly released? in a nation whose tastes have been so corrupted by reality tv shows, where repulsive nonentities have become the national heroes, is there even a market anymore for a film like this? after all, there is no grunting sex, there are no close-ups of suppurating wounds or of anyone's genitals, there are no drugs taken, there are no mindless celebrities prancing around wanting to be looked at, and so one wonders whether there is anything to interest a public which has become so decadent and jaded that only the most extreme sensations can briefly alleviate the tedium of their pointless existence. anyone who is looking for an antidote to the vacuity of contemporary britain can take refuge in this refreshing and honest film.

set just before the second world war, this is a touching and understated romantic story that is loosely based on a real event.it concerns a german rocket scientist gerhart zucher (ulrich thomsen) working in britain in the advent of the second world war. fearing hitler may recall him to germany to assist him preparing for war, zucher and his slippery assistant heinz (eddie marsan) are evacuated by the british authorities to a remote scottish island. they are given the task of building a rocket post box that will enable the islanders to communicate with the mainland.mocked and bullied by the islanders, they set up home with local girl catherine mackay (the stunning shauna macdonald), with whom thomsen begins an affair but complications arise when germany comes calling...the central romance between zucher and catherine is subtle and sincerely played and the supporting cast is a colourful bunch with an array of respected scottish character actors including gary lewis and clive russell.fine cinematography and a brilliant central theme song sung in the local dialect round out this movie.intelligent but undemanding, it is good for a quiet evening in.

an excellent film for those who simply need to switch off and enjoy the beautiful scenery of scotland. based on fact, the film takes you on a journey of love amidst spectacular scenery. the cast are 'dressed down' for the parts they play, so no glamorous costumes or coiffured hair in this film where acting is superb, gritty and down to earth.each character is believable giving a convincing portrayal of island life, beliefs and culture of the time a definite for those who have even the tiniest drop of scottish blood..... as it will tug at the heart strings and stir the soul. something that can be shared with the family and watched time and time again..................a real classic, one that i am sure will walk alongside some of the great films that never die.

i saw this at the 2004 stony brook film festival in ny and it was very warmly received. in this pre-ww2 film, a pair of german rocket scientists are working on the scottish isle of scarp as war looms on the horizon. the characters encountered on the island are priceless in their creation and their portrayal. shauna macdonald is particularly memorableafter getting up to speed on the "scootish" accents, the viewer feel right at home with these folk who watch with amusement as the germans work to link their isle with the mainland via a rocket-based mail delivery. as implausible as it seems, this film was based on an actual story.all in all, a memorable film that will stay with you for some time thanks to its casting, its story or its scenery.

a wonderfully thoughtful and involving movie that leaves an imprint well beyond it's initial liftoff. based on a true story , one of the many "small" stories prior to ww ii , that lend an understanding to the mindsets of the majority of common man cultures, impacted by others perceived as former enemies and perhaps future foes, with the darkening of war clouds on the horizon. viewed at the stony brook film festival, the film was enthusiastically received . well written and expertly cast. the characters were most believable and drew one in to experience their trials and tribulations.

the first time i saw brotherhood of satan i was 12 yrs old i saw it in a little town in central washington state it played before tales from the crypt which we left early because my sisters were already scared from the brotherhood of satan. all in all i thought it was a pretty good movie. the beginning was good we had just sat down and that tank did a number on that station wagon.what struck me about the movie was the scenery around the town in which it was filmed it looked almost like the area around chelan wa where i saw the movie especially when they were driving towards the town of hillsboro which is the location of the movie a small town in sw new mexico. i have always liked lq jones and strother martin and also charles bateman who was on get smart another show i like. i gave the movie a 7 and later on when i did get to see tales from the crypt i thought brotherhood of satan was better.

a young couple -- father ben (solid charles bateman), wife nicky (the lovely ahna capri) and their daughter kt (the cute geri reischl of "i dismember mama" fame) -- find themselves trapped in a small california desert town populated by hysterical lunatics. worse yet, there's a pernicious satanic cult that's been abducting little children for their own diabolical purposes. director bernard mceveety, working from an offbeat and inspired script by william welch and l.q. jones ("devil times five" director sean macgregor came up with the bizarre story), relates the compellingly oddball plot at a slow, yet steady pace and ably creates a creepy, edgy, mysterious ooga-booga atmosphere. strother martin delivers a wonderfully wicked and robust performance as doc duncan, who's the gleefully sinister leader of the evil sect. the top-rate cast of excellent character actors qualifies as a substantial asset: jones as gruff, no-nonsense sheriff hillsboro, alvy moore as friendly local toby, and charles robinson as a shrewd, fiercely devout priest jack. john arthur morrill's bright, polished widescreen cinematography, jamie mendoza-nava's spooky score, and the wild, rousing climactic black mass ritual are all likewise up to speed. the idea of having toys come to murderous life is simply ingenious (the opening scene with a toy tank coming real and crushing a family in their car is truly jolting). nice eerily ambiguous ending, too. a pleasingly idiosyncratic and under-appreciated winner.

i was 10 or eleven years old when this movie came out, and it has stayed with me for 35 years since. when the movie came out, all of the theaters in the st. louis area distributed, as a 'lure', a pack of flower seeds that had the movie name, etc. on the front. on the back of the pack it read, in so many words....plant these seeds at midnight. if a white flower grows, you are saved.....but if a red flower grows, you are doomed!!! suffice it to say, that for an eleven year old kid, i did not plant the seeds for fear of what may pop up. here is the spoiler: as the movie starts out, you see a small toy tank moving about in the dirt. on a small road a family is leaving town, and suddenly the camera turns to the tank again, and it is full size. it rolls over the car, and you see bloody limbs protruding from the wreckage, then, just as sudden, the tank is small again.the reason this movie stuck with me for that long, was because i had a exact toy tank as the one in the movie!!!! unfortunately i don't know what happened to it, but i did keep a wary eye on that thing ever since!!!turn out the lights, put in the dvd, make a sandwich, and watch this movie. it is very good!!!

one of the best lesser known occult oriented horror movies of the seventies. it's gritty, exciting, scary, surrealistic here and there and at moments even very smart, which can't be said about many of the movies this kind. i can't help seeing some stinging symbolic and metaphoric points at the seventies society and generation stuff of the time this movie was done. the scriptwriter has obviously been cooking while delivering also some good old "from the crypt" kind of scenes. with a job well done from a creative director the result is entertaining and thought provoking. the simple, yet effective ending specially shows how these things are treated right by those who can.the excellent cast were mostly unknown to me, except l. q. jones as the moody but funny sheriff and strother martin as the town doctor. martin, not surprisingly, always ends up stealing the movie. with that voice and skill he is one of the greatest loonies in movies, for me anyway. what an actor!so, it is a little bit of mystery to me why this movie has not gathered far greater recognition. i think it would deserve almost equal place in the occult horror canon alongside rosemary's baby and the exorcist. one helluva movie!

not everyone likes this movie. it is still one of the best "you have to be thinking" movies about satanism ever made. the fact that it doesn't have mtv-era jump cuts or gore every seven minutes is irrelevant. also, speaking as someone who actually knows satanists, the (spoiler warning!) portion of the film where the brotherhood exchange their old bodies for those of preadolescent children, it has some genuinely scary scenes. the section where (second spoiler alert) strother martin orchestrates the changeover is almost hyper-real in that it uses very few special effects, a hallmark of this film. mceveety was seldom given a big budget but was often effective. it worked in this case, too.

"brotherhood of satan" is one of the most underrated horror films of all times.why it hasn't achieved a cult status is beyond me.this is a chilling tale of terror and witchcraft which contains one of the most powerful and disturbing climaxes in the annals of screen horror.in the small american town some children have disappeared and their parents been violently murdered.what is the cause of hysteria?the film is really eerie,some scenes are genuinely unnerving and definitely not easily forgotten.the suspense never lets up,the acting is really good,and the climax is bizarre and disturbing.check out this forgotten gem of satanic horror.absolutely recommended.

man! i remember this show with nostalgic... i really dug bravestarr because he wasn't the conventional hero. he was more than a futuristic texas cowboy. the man had the strenght of a bear, the vision of a walk, and the agility of a ... i can't remember that one.the action sequences were great! i remember that bravestarr would always use his bazooka named sarajuana (translated to spanish) anytime he was in big troubles.this was a quality action cartoon. i loved the characters, the dialogs, the music, and of course, the opening credits sequence! bravestarr! long live to him. a cult classic in my opinion and a must see.

bravestarr was released in 1987 by the now defunct american animation company, filmation on the back of he-man: masters of the universe and she-ra: princess of power, in 1983 and 87' respectively. the plot of the cartoon was about a native american cowboy named marshall bravestarr, who possesses the strength of the bear, ears of the wolf, speed of the puma and eyes of a hawk, and his trusty sidekick, a talking horse named thirty- thirty, who carried with him a gun aptly titled, 'sarah jane' and with the help of deputy fuzz and judge j.b serve to protect new texas from the evil tex hex and his band of outlaws.set in futuristic texas, this was and still is to this day, one of the very few cartoons set in a particular city, in the us- hence in the south- thousands of light years ahead in the future. considering this was made in the 80s, the creators did an impressive job trying to recreate the wild west look but from a sci-fi based outlook. bravestarr didn't just evoke morality and good verses bad, as well as teaching children lessons about life, but it also highlighted themes of culture and community and that we shouldn't take things and life for granted. and despite the fact that this was an action adventure cartoon, many of the story lines, themes and issues it addressed resonate with children and adults in a way that makes sense to them. in addition, marshall bravestarr was one of the very first major cartoon characters from a (ethnic)minority background, to make an impact on tv.the sound effects were amazing, the music was great, the theme song equally memorable and the animation was wonderful. the characters were well designed and the stories were diverse and taught kids morals and the importance of what is right and what is wrong. something of which the same cannot be said about today's cartoons, sadly.whilst bravestarr was overshadowed by the success of he-man, it is still a personal favourite for many 80s cartoon fanatics. suffice to say, i preferred bravestarr over he-man because of the diversity of the story lines, characters and that the depth of the situations and problems that the characters faced themselves, were more what i would say realistic and identifiable in contrast. for some reason, they resonated more with people because like for instance,in 'the pledge' where a kid dies from a drug overdose, the fact that there wasn't a happy ending was important- in the sense that when kids watch that episode, well, in fact anyone who watches that episode, will realise for themselves the devastating consequences of drug usage and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugs.bold, brave and at times thought-provoking, bravestarr is definitely that- bold, brave and thought provoking. a cult cartoon classic for many years to come, it dared to take some risks, but it had well and truly paid off in the end. it will be remembered by many cartoon fans as one of the most interesting as well as best 80s cartoons ever, and rightly so8 and a half out of ten

bwana devil is reputedly the first major studio, full length feature filmed entirely in the 3d process. supposedly producer oboler went to africa to shoot a different movie, but after hearing the tale of two man-eating lions, terrorizing railway builders, decided on this one. it's a good story too, almost hemmingway-like; fear, redemption, the great white hunter and all. it's the telling of the story that seems to drag, almost as though filming in the new process was too weighty for the crew. the action scenes are stiff, almost too staged. but these technical problems appear small in light of the film's dramatic conclusion.

i saw this film from 1918 recently at our local helsinkian film archive. it seems that the danish film institute has reconstructed it in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of nordisk filmcompany, which was one of the largest in the world in the early 20th century. i believe there are several copies with english translations circulating around europe at the moment. i found the film fascinating and the trip to mars well thought out. the plot line is certainly original, but i really don't want to reveal any more of it at the moment, as now the danger of spoiling things for you really exists ;-).the film is also available on dvd, query the danish film institute (det danske filminstitut) web pages at dfi.dk with 'himmelskibet' to get more info.

enjoyed this film which deals entirely about an average family, so it appears. ben travis, (jeff daniels) plays the role as a father who is only interested in one son who is excellent at swimming and wins many trophy's, however, he hates it very much and even his father. ben has very little to say to his other son, tim, (emile hirsh) and even his daughter, penny, (michelle williams) who is fortunate to be away in college. the mother, sandy, (sigourney weaver) tries to hold the family together and even she is completely ignored by her husband also. a very tragic event happens in the family which changes everyone's personality, young and old start using drugs, smoking pot and drinking all the time at parties. there is even a homosexual scene and at the same time there is even room for comedy and of course there is a very dark secret that sandy travis finally tells her son tim.

imaginary heroes is one fine little film! written and directed by dan harris this story is classic theater, weaving comedy and tragedy together so tightly that the climax of the film takes your breath away.the travis family is an odd bunch: no member is who each appears to be. beginning with a suicide of the reluctant 'hero' child swimming champion matt (kip pardue), the father ben (jeff daniels) falls apart and isolates himself from his family and himself while the mother sandy (sigourney weaver) turns to pot and rage and sarcasm, the daughter penny (michelle williams) returns from school repulsed by her family's behavior, and the remaining son tim (emile hirsch) takes the brunt of all of the above by avoiding his classmates, girlfriend, and teams with his neighbor kyle (ryan donowho) to leap into drugs and sexual experimentation. throughout the film tim tries to hide bruises on his body that have a secret all their own yet lead his girlfriend to feel rejection, his mother to rage against the trailer park trash bully she believes is the cause, and finally open the window to the deep scars this family has suffered for years. secrets and lies, here, and the resolution of them is painfully dramatic.this may be sigourney weaver's finest role, although emile hirsh, jeff daniels, ryan donowho, and kip pardue (despite the brevity of his role) all contribute top-notch performances. the story begins slowly and seems to meander and that fact may lose some viewers' attention, but stay with this little powerhouse film and the impact of the work will stun you. highly recommended. grady harp

imaginary heroes, the remarkable work of the then 24 year-old dan harris, is tag-lined "people are never who they seem to be". perhaps this is wisely chosen as a stratagem of marketing; yet, i rented this movie in spite of the tag-line, rather than because of it. and, i'm glad i did. i found the move an insightful examination of tragedy. i personally found it to be a movie about coping with dreams: particularly those which are lost. in the case of one son, "loss" requires deep examination of what he had, and didn't have, in his life. yet, the central tragedy of the movie, while posing enticing questions in its own right, acts primarily as the backdrop against which different coping styles are set into relief. i believe the film inquires into an important question: how do we cope with our dreams, particularly where heroes become imaginary?

before barton jumps all over my remarks, let's all just keep in mind that opinions are like asses, we all have them.....i loved sigourney weaver & jeff daniels, i loved the dialogue and thought the acting was sublime. downplayed just perfectly and understated. unlike some others, i did not find this @ all predictable.i found sigourney's role refreshingly humorous and realistic, especially her scene confronting the bully in the trailer.i found it enjoyable and wasn't anticipating recommending this to all and sundry. this is why there are different flavors of ice cream, something to please everyone...

the nyt review says that sigourney weaver's character is taut and frustrated, and, later, that she could be the sister of mtm's character in ordinary people. say, what? no way. this lady was quirky from the start. nothing like mtm in ordinary people. sorry.next, the nyt goes on to say that sigourney weaver's sandy travis and jeff daniel's ben travis are 40-something year olds, "children of the 60s." ms weaver must be dancing a jig. i believe at the time she made imaginary heroes she was in fact 55 years old. she was born in 1949.nyt perception corrections aside, this was a pretty good movie considering it was made by someone so young. obviously sigourney weaver thought so, and so did jeff daniels. the young man playing tim was outstanding.there are some critical comments i could make about the script. such as that i never really got a good sense of why sandy travis missed her son. her sort of blown apart behavior was perhaps triggered by his death, but that such behavior lasted ¾ of the way through the film i felt had more to do with her stagnation marriage, her relationship with tim, and where he really came from, and other unresolved issues, than from any mourning of her elder son. ben's mourning was much more clear.so matt travis was an asshole. did his mom think so too? still, a very watchable film. what is becoming clearer and clearer is not that there are no roles for women over a certain age, rather that what it takes is a director such as this one to be so clearly in love with an older woman (ms weaver) and to almost make his film an homage to her. sort of an anti-woody allen.

so. i was completely in love with this movie. gaga for it, even with all its plot twists...but the one thing i found really disturbing was the connection between the two best friends in tim and kyle. while the writer of the film gave us such a poignant moment between the two, and their sexual experimentation/confusion, he then gives us a plot twist that makes them half brothers?!?! (although the subject isn't brought up in the film....and left unexplained and unaccounted for) i just thought that it was in bad taste, and the fact that it wasn't even discussed is even worse. (oops we've created a taboo...now let's not address the situation, because that wouldn't really be p.c.) otherwise a spectacular film

have just seen this film, in australia on satellite. as i have been avoiding the news more so than usual over the last week coming from the us of a regarding gunmen, well to be absolutely blunt, this film is a prescient gem. a big bravo to all involved. i had only a small idea of what the film entailed as is most often the case for good effect and this certainly came up with cinematic goods. the setting of the scene is effective in the truest sense of the word, with all the hairy confronting subjects of today's world in relation to one's own faltering family, albeit suburb. the first forty minutes sets such a professional theater i was not ready for the out loud laughs when they came. although the cathartic moment built via comedy and character as the family and neighbors came together in an extraordinary way.all in all a foreseeing of who and what we are. a most meaningful film and a must see.please note the date of this review.

this film does not have the outstanding visuals that american beauty or the ice storm offered and because it was made after those films, it cannot be marked as very original either: the music, though subtly brilliant, sounds very much like that of american beauty. the story has some similarities with the ice storm in particular (as well as sigourney weaver). without intent perhaps, the film seems to try to recreate the success of the two aforementioned movies too much. at times, the story tends to stay a bit more shallow than it's bigger, more successful "brothers" by having too much going on, or by not delivering the most effective dialogs. here, the writing cannot measure with that of american beauty. but that can be said about most movies ever made, even the best and there is still a lot to like: said music score and (expectable, given the cast) effective performances. of note is emile hirsch who would shine a couple of years later in the outstanding "into the wild".overall i can recommend this film if you like suburban dramas though it's not the first one on a list of must-sees, which would be topped by: 1 american beauty 2 the ice storm 3 little children.after you've seen and liked those, check out this one.

"imaginary heroes" is a 2004 film starring sigourney weaver, jeff daniels, emile hirsch, michelle williams, and kip pardue.the story concerns a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the oldest child (pardue) commits suicide."ordinary people" has been mentioned often in relation to this film; it's sort of "ordinary people" with a role reversal. the mother in this case, sandy travis (weaver) is more accessible than the father, ben (daniels) who is clearly devastated and unable to cope. like "ordinary people," the younger son tim (hirsch) is the focus of the film.for me, the film was absorbing enough to keep watching but has a curious detachment about it. there were some wonderful interactions - mother and son, mother and neighbor, brother and sister (williams) and some good offbeat moments. what never clicked was ben being any part of that family or having any chemistry with sandy. this seems to have been the goal of director/writer dan harris. in one scene in a grocery store, the checkout kid assumes sandy is "about 30" and gives her his phone number. in almost the next scene, daniels asks sandy if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday. weaver was 55 when this film was made, actually probably 54, and looks phenomenal. so what is ben looking at? however, there's something askew about ben's complete detachment because the viewer doesn't really see how daniels ever was attached to that family.the end has a couple of twists and also some very touching scenes. everyone is very good, with weaver and hirsch being the standouts.there's not a tremendous amount of dialogue in this movie and lots of stares. the script could have been sharper. but "imaginary heroes" is a good effort.

another slice of darkness and denial hiding beneath the surface of american suburbia, imaginary heroes chronicles the lives of the travis family, all recovering following the suicide of their eldest son.the pair at the center of the film is mother and son sandy (sigourney weaver) and tim (emile hirsch), both acting out in different ways as a result of the death. while tim experiments with prescription medication and his own sexuality, sandy regresses to her former self, smoking marijuana and coming to terms with an old act of infidelity.the relationship between sandy and tim is explored well, especially when references are made to both of them being outcast from their own family: sandy due to her affair and tim, initially, due to always being in the shadow of his more successful older brother. considerably less time is allowed for sandy's husband ben (jeff daniels) who, in a devastating depiction of denial, orders sandy to make an additional plate of food for his dead son and place it in his old spot at the dinner table. michelle williams' older sister penny is underwritten and could easily be taken out of the film.despite its long runtime, imaginary heroes doesn't explore its many subplots as much as the individual stories deserve, while some of the movie's black comedy doesn't translate as well as writer/director dan harris may have liked. and the depiction of a disturbed family dynamic isn't depicted as strongly as the many other films out there with similar ideas. but despite some issues, the central performances from weaver and hirsch are stunning, and easily carry the film to its successfully subdued conclusion.rating: b-

as salinger's "a perfect day for bananafish" ends with the suicide of a prodigy, this movie opens with the death of the star high school swimmer legend, matt, who shoots himself in the head with a revolver after in the opening scene. but the death of matt travis serves as a key to unlock the door of another prodigy, his brother, tim who never in his life seriously bothered with the question, "what am i going to do?"when he finds his brother dead, his head broken like a dropped watermelon, the travis family starts vomiting out its secrets one by one. the film focuses on tim. he is a victim of bullying, domestic abuse, family alienation, heartbreak, issues of sexuality and friendship. tim reveals his wounds by physical bruises, but these are not the only injuries to his person, as we slowly come to realize, as the script painfully unveils the origins and outcome of tim scars. everyone who loves him hurts him. hirsch plays out the character quite well, revealing frame after frame in the visual expression of his body, a host of conflicting emotions inside the soul of a kid whom no one seems to listen to or know very well, unknowing and unaware of his depth of soul and prodigious talent. two siblings sharing a doobie, curled up on a red, spinnable playground saucer, tim asks penny, "what am i going to do with the rest of my life?" the scene is framed in a familiar, recurring image of the film: the comfortable playground where tim obviously feels at home, filmed from a bird's eye view, because with every character tim feels comfortable to share a part of himself, and we view these intimate moments he shares in the red, spinnable playground saucer, complete with childish graffiti carved in pencil, from above. after advising him curtly to pass the joint, penny tells him, "tim, well, the secret to the success of life is to find something you love. and you have to do that for the rest of your life  and you better hope to hell that you're good at it because if you're not then you'll probably fail." this simple line of advice from penny serves as the movie's central theme, the responsibility of talent and the possibility of failure. why does one person have a talent he cannot stand, like matt, who hated the attention his swimming fame brought, but no one notices tim's talent  no one  because no one bothers to ask him? not even us. the film makes us aware that we ourselves do not know tim as well as we thought we did when we first meet this handsome, sad, guy; in our intimate understanding of tim, as it progresses, we are reminded that not everyone is as they seem to be. this is the other side of the film, the failure of those who should  parents, friends, teachers  whoever  to notice and see the gifts of the people they claim to love. not even his mother sandy, played by sigourney weaver, sees tim's gift, despite her love for her son. weaver does a deft job of a middle-aged woman grappling with her own inner demons as she haphazardly tries to play the roles of domesticity and support. when tim is found to be bullied at school, she storms the boy's trailer, threatening his life, "you can tease, torture, punch, drive drunk with me, i can forgive you. hell i can understand it, i'm a good christian, you know, i can forgive and forget, but you mess with my kid and may god himself descend from heaven to protect you because as long as i live  and i will outlive you all  i will wake up and go to sleep at night just dreaming of ways to make your petty insignificant lives into hell on earth." after flicking a paper cup into the mother's face, she looks around the trailer, and looking at them both, the kid and his stunned mother, comments, "nice trailer" and leaves as quickly as she came. weaver scores in her ability to match gusto with visceral wit that is acid and witty. and tim's father, played by jeff daniels, is blind to who his son is, treating him like a stranger, not telling his family that he took time off from the office, spending his days in the city park, listless, a carved out soul, and sleeping in matt's bed, tucked in with his high school letter jacket. jeff daniels does a superb job of making us believe that he can be both a bastard and lovable because, we grow to see that even an inept father can show his love for his son. in an emotional scene, tim confronts his father. just when you think his dad is going to hit him, he grabs for him to embrace him. not letting him go, he tells tim, "i am your father and you're are my son and i'm here okay but you've gotta talk to me. i don't know how to do this by myself". it is here at this moment in the film that a father tells his son, you have to tell me what's going on inside of you, you have to tell me who you are; i want to know who you are. it is in this scene that the film reaches a cathartic moment, the visual movement from tim, angry and alone, to his father embracing him as he breaks downs and weeps, revealing the emotions hidden beneath his shell. tim experiences this moment of cleansing with his dad as a catharsis, especially when you consider the mistreatment, manipulation, disregard, violence and betrayal he has been dealt in the long year the film encompasses. i recommend this film.

it occurred to me while watching "imaginary heroes" that any screenwriter attempting to make a drama about family relationships should seriously consider killing off a kid or two in the opening reel as a way of getting his characters to open up and reveal themselves. there must be something to this storyline, for it seems as if every other family drama that comes down the pike uses this device in one form or another ("paradise" and "moonlight mile" are just two of the more recent examples that spring immediately to mind, although one could reach back to a golden oldie like "who's afraid of virginia woolf?" to make the point as well). it's not that the death of a child is an illegitimate subject for serious films to explore. far from it. it's just that, like any topic, it can be so overused that it becomes just another movie cliché, a convenient bit of narrative shorthand to get the ball rolling and to give the characters something to grapple with for the remainder of the time we get to spend with them.the latest such work is "imaginary heroes," a film that borrows heavily from what is one of the earliest and, perhaps, best known examples of the "family coping with the death of a child" genre, the academy award winning "ordinary people." like the characters in that earlier film, the travises seem, on the surface, to be the ideal suburban family, until, one fateful day, their oldest son, matt, who is the "golden boy" athlete and, thus, the apple of his father's eye, kills himself with no explanation (one minor difference is that the son in "ordinary people" dies as a result of an accident, not a suicide). it is matt's younger brother, tim, who winds up finding the body, and who assumes the role of protagonist in the film. each of the remaining family members copes with the tragedy in his or her own way. matt, who has always lived in the shadow of his older brother, becomes more and more estranged from the father who has virtually ignored him all his life and begins to turn to drugs for surcease. ben, the father, becomes swallowed up in feelings of remorse and guilt, turning away from both his job and his family. his wife, sandy, is the most complex character in the film, a free-spirited child of the '60's who feels oddly adrift in the role of mother and wife as she endures a basically loveless marriage in sterile suburbia. she spends most of her time after the tragedy trying to reconnect with her pot-smoking past.as written and directed by dan harris, "imaginary heroes" emerges as a wildly uneven film. for every scene that feels real and authentic, there is another that comes across as arbitrary and inauthentic. one sometimes has the sense that harris would like to cram every possible life situation he can think of into his screenplay, an admirable goal, perhaps, but one that makes the film unnecessarily melodramatic in the process. instead of identifying with the characters and being caught up in their plight, we often find ourselves thinking, "oh, come nowwhat next?" for teen suicide is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hot-button topics covered in this film; the screenplay also touches on drug and alcohol abuse, physical abuse, sexual identity conflict, life-threatening illness, even inadvertent gay incest. it is this "everything but the kitchen sink" mentality in the writing that robs the movie of much of the credibility it needs to really make us care.that is not to say that "imaginary heroes" is a bad or unrewarding film. much of what it has to say about familial relationships and values in the 21st century is insightful, original, pointed and profound. prime credit for its success goes to the actors, emile hirsch, sigourney weaver and jeff daniels, who deliver incisive, sensitive performances in their respective roles. it is they who triumph over the narrative excesses to stimulate our brains and touch our hearts. moreover, harris, in his direction, achieves an effectively melancholic tone throughout, but one that is frequently augmented by some badly-needed flashes of daring dark comedy."imaginary heroes" may appear unfocused and derivative at times, but its fine performances and subtle mood shifts make it a film worth watching.

the kinks warned about media heroes. outside the movies, most heroes are also "ordinary people." society demands some role playing, but what happens when that extends to the parent-child relationship? do some parents try to improve themselves through their children rather than vice versa? how do you provide a role-model but not a role? a brilliant swimmer who hates to swim; a brilliant musician who won't play. offbeat, funny (despite depiction of "serious" problems), very good multi-dimensional acting by everyone. lots of plot twists complement the emotional tension. celluloid heroes never feel any pain. i don't recall ever being disappointed in a sigourney weaver film (i even liked "the village"!).

it is hard to judge 'imaginary heroes' without referring to the fact that director and script writer dan harris is only 25. you can hardly believe seeing this film, which is not only a mature piece of work, professional and deep, but also with some of the defects of routine specific to older directors.the setting is the american suburb, too familiar from 'american beauty' or 'desperate housewives'. as in 'american beauty'the film turns around a suicide, but here it happens at the beginning of the movie, and we are left watching a mid-class family coping with the death of the gifted sportsman brother and son. emile hirsch plays the younger brother, sigourney weaver is the mother, both are excellent trying to cope with the loss, to find the reason and motivation to survive. harris drives his actors with a sure hand, and the first two sections of the film (there are four in total, as the seasons of the year) build a wonderful tension, with credible dilemmas and real questions. it is the second part of the film that disappoints slightly, it looks too tired and conventional, and i suspect that the producers may have interfered in the work of the young script-writer and director, trying to bring him closer to the hollywood convention. that's how this film fails to be a somber version of 'american beauty', with a different focus. i am sure however that we will hear a lot about dan harris in the coming years.

imaginary heroes is clearly the best film of the year. it was a complete and utter joy to watch. i was riveted. the whole audience up at the sunset five was riveted, when the film ended no one moved, spoke, nothing. i think this film is a perfect example of the of the power that drama has. especially in so much as it sets an example of the quality of drama/ work of this younger generation. there were moments in your film, many, like at least seven, where i was struck by such a great amount of beauty, emotional beauty, that i actually couldn't breathe for a while. and for a catharsis junkie like me, that's about the best censorial experience i could ask for. it is the result of powerful, masterful storytelling and direction. like heavyweight stuff, like burtolucci and those guys. each element of the film fit tightly together. there were no missteps at all. the cast was amazing. i have been a huge fan of emile's and ryan's for a long time, and i thought they have never been better. i was/am/will be continuously stunned by this film. and i promise i will drag every person i know to see it. it should be seen. it should win awards.

wow. when i went to this film at the toronto film festival i had no idea what i was in for. this movie takes you on an emotional roller-coaster in the best sense of the term. sigourney weaver was better than i've seen from her in years; emile hirsch was great and jeff daniels broke my heart. i can see how this won't be every person's cup of tea, as at times it deals with some pretty harsh things that can happen to a family. don't get me wrong -- it's really funny too -- at my screening the audience burst out in applause after laughing over and over again. i just think if you're open to examining your own life, imaginary heroes will sincerely touch you. i can't wait until it comes out in theaters.

a political satire of a comedian (williams) who after dissing the political campaigns and presidents is forced into the running. but shockingly we wins and makes a mockery of the office. "man of the year" is not the funniest movie nor the best but in small doses it does work. williams again teaming with levinson after a hit with "good morning, vietnam". the two seem to have a great chemistry and work off each other. i am not comparing them to scorsese and deniro but you can get the picture. although i wouldn't quite say to rush out there and see the movie in theaters i would recommend renting it. this movie is a comedy but also has a great satire, please if you like movies like "scary movie 4" this is not for you, take your brain with you to see it. - ***

this movie was advertised as a comedy but was far more serious than the trailers made it out to be. don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the movie, but was expecting more laughs. great performances from robin williams and laura linney. worth seeing, but don't go expecting to be rolling on the floor. the movie left me wondering what it would be like if robin williams character was a real person that was running for president. would we elect a comedian? i doubt it, unfortunately. that kind of stark honesty is something greatly lacking today. this is a movie that i will be adding to my dvd library as soon as it comes out on dvd. the movie has heart.

i liked this show from the first episode i saw, which was the "rhapsody in blue" episode (for those that don't know what that is, the zan going insane and becoming pau lvl 10 ep). best visuals and special effects i've seen on a television series, nothing like it anywhere.

i have watched farscape from first episode to now, and i will continue to watch it! the setting and the characters are amazing and the plots are great. the show really keeps me on the edge of my seat and when the show goes off after an hour i keep hoping it will be another hour!

i found this film rather brilliant. initially i wanted a "when animals attack" flick along the lines of "frankenfish" or even "rogue" but was delivered a truly horrific ordeal that was not devoid of humanity. having been to the areas this was made (including the croc farm at the start of the movie, even sharing the same guide!) it added to the fear factor. those crocs really are everywhere up there, though i don't think they had the "attitude" of this beastie. yes there were some melodramatic moments but they contributed rather distract from the whole atmosphere. i genuinely cared for the characters and shuddered contemplating "what would i do?" in their boat. not knowing where your enemy lurked or the sound of the croc chowing down at night was genuinely frightening. i would argue that this flick is one of the best horrors i have seen in years (coming close to the descent). i give it four alligator handbags.

this is a gem of a film, slapstick violence a-plenty, simon pegg and green spew.a suspicious looking power plant and an incontrollable motorbike add to this stonker. if you haven't seen this i can highly recommend it, maybe not quite as good as bottom but not far short.if you have never seen a man impaled by the nose on two hooks then what are you waiting for buy this film.i didn't even see the twist at the end coming when it turns out that ritchie and eddie are both ghosts.feeb - 1 boiled egg.

okay, this may not be the most sophisticated movie you'll ever see. actually, there isn't a bit of "sophisticatedlyness"* in it. it's puerile, adolescent, inoffensive, idiotic..and utterly hilarious. basically, richie and eddie run the worst hotel in britain. cue some ridiculous antics with the guests while they beat each other up, try to get the rent money out of the only resident who is daft enough to stay, have an all night drinking binge with the boys from the power plant next door...and fall in lust with the beautiful actress who comes to stay to avoid the press. give it a try if you're a fan of rik and ade and their work. if you're not...don't get the movie. simple as that.*i'm not being thick, this is a word from another one of rik's fab jaunts into the movie world ^_^

bottom has been my favourite sitcom ever since i saw it on t.v and the movie is even better if your a bottom fan i say this is a must buy!!! the plot is that eddie and ritchie run a hotel named guest house paradise but not all goes right for them as customers leave until a famous actress come to stay they try there best to impress her but not all well go right this is a upbringing to british cinema so buy this and you will wet yourself with laughter. also starring simon peggi (shaun of the dead) and also bill neigh (love actually) it might of not done good in the box office or by the looks of it on this website but don't listen to them buy this and i swear you will love it

i had been looking for this film for so long before i found it, i had seen it when i was younger and loved it, after my second viewing i still loved it and i still do.this is a love/hate film, if you like bottom, young ones, the comic strip, then you will find this funny. if you don't like that kind of humour then don't bother. i love this film and have grown up with these comedy programmes, for me this film is simply placing their comic genius on the big screen.. it is not an award winner by any means but if you just want good wholesome slapstick then this is it!the film lacks the quality of the tv series and this is usually the case with films but it still has enough material to keep you laughing even if a lot of the jokes are pretty similar to their previous work.yes, the humour is a little childish and not to everyone's taste but sometimes you just need that in a film.

this zany film rivals the ghost and mr. chicken as one of don knott's finest film performances. knotts is an accountant for a podunk city hall that is good for swindling the citizens. they fire the "three competent bookkeepers and keep the dumb one" (knotts of course is the dumb one). when his garbage collecting cohort accidentally empties the wrong trash can, knotts finds himself wrapped up in a bizarre trap set by the city council for him. funny moments in the movie include the bowling alley restroom scene, and the cemetery scene is absolutely hilarious. typical knotts, the nervous ninny act is well used, and as usual he is surrounded by lots of crazy character actors from the sixties. such actors as frank welker, and pitt herbert add to the mayhem. as one may expect knotts's armed with a big car, a pretty girl, and no real clue of what he's doing. fun for anyone, especially nostalgia buffs, but just about anyone will love it.

a good documentary reviewing the background behind our societies oil addiction, the problem concerning our present energy usage and finally discusses the effects of the coming energy deficit originating from the peak oil production problem.this movie should be educated to all students as part of their education. show it to your children, parents, relatives and friends. they will thank you eventually.after reviewing the contents of this documentary and comparing its mentioned sources i would say that the facts in this movie are well scientifically supported.

i'm giving this film 9 out of 10 only because there aren't enough specific scientific references to the amount of energy it takes to produce food to satisfy the science haters. mdixon seems to believe the admittedly biased commentators are making this stuff up, but even an elementary understanding of resources and the laws of thermodynamics will indicate that at the very least, they are on solid scientific ground when they state that we cannot continue to depend on oil, we must transition to different types of energy, and do not have a plan that will replace the amount of energy we get from oil. other civilizations have refused to face the facts of life, and have perished. read jared diamond's "collapse" which is a popular book, or any elementary ecology or earth science textbook and you can verify the basic premise of this movie. go ahead, fiddle while rome burns!

i have been most fortunate this year to have seen several films at my university's art museum. on occasion, well, more like half of the time, i am unable to watch the films there. i have systematically attempted to view each of the films that i have missed. so far plagues and pleasures on the salton sea and who killed the electric car? are the other films that i have had to watch this way. the film covers an intriguing subject matter and is well-theorized (emphasis on this later) but not as successful as plagues and pleasures, but far superior to electric car. the film's thesis concern's the future of the american concept of suburban living. it questions the feasibility of such a practice as oil prices rise. so, the film discusses the origin of the suburb, and it's evolution until the early 2000s. one theme the film discusses at length is the alienation the suburb creates among its inhabitants. while several people may live together, they do not "know" each other as we define the word. this, to me, represents the strength of the film: its appeal to actual human emotion. we are able to understand the filmmakers' argument so much easier because they do not have to convince us of their argument's legitimacy. this is also one of the reasons salton sea is such a wonderful documentary. unfortunately, suburbia loses its message in firebrand explanation in support of its central argument. as those interviewed speak, their arguments become progressively more akin to those made by militant environmentalists. we are told that oil production will hit its peak in this decade, but are given no scientific evidence (professional reports, statistics, graphs, etc) in support of this claim. we are given little information as to how this date was calculated. fortunately, this was the only significant flaw that i was able to detect in the film's argument yet it's a glaring one nevertheless. another less-important discrepancy i noticed was the liberal (political) bias which could polarize some viewers. however, this bias is revealed thorough clips of various events and not the filmmakers themselves. the clips, especially those from the 1950's, seemed a tad unnecessary to me. the film was no better with their presence, and would have been more concise in their absence. as i thought more of this film before composing this review, i thought about why i found its argument more convincing than other documentaries that i'd recently viewed. finally, i realized that the filmmakers actually offered analysis to the suburban problem. they propose a decentralized village-system where pockets of people would live together. they posit this practice would lower the necessity for fossil fuels and reduce wasted space. they define wasted space as the long stretches of parking lots between shopping areas, for instance. what is incredible about this supposition is that it's actually conceivable. most documentaries vaguely state that some problem should be ended but offer no method of doing so. thinking more about the film, i decided that this analysis is what saved the film for me and why i give it a favorable review. while neither perfectly convincing nor fluid in presentation, the end of suburbia is a worthwhile investment of one's time. it not only addresses the contemporary problem of sprawl, but it also provides realistic insight on how to amend it. the audience can also enjoy the high production value with various clips from the 1950's spliced with the modern arguers. people living in atlanta, georgia or the triad region of north carolina will particularly enjoy this documentary as sprawl is the most established there.

the end of suburbia (teos) is a very useful film. it's also important and provocative. there seems to be no middle ground with either the film or its main source of entertainment, the anti-sprawl meister, james howard kunstler. while i am not a big fan of the new urbanism, my criticism of it is because of its small vision. in the case of new urbanist peter calthorpe - another talking head - you finally hear what's somewhat obvious in and amongst the special added teos out-takes... calthorpe just doesn't understand peak oil. i've used this as a teaching tool in economics classes to get at the importance of land as a factor of production - a fact long diminished by neoclassical economics - and also as a vehicle for educating about: peak oil, our wastrel land use, global warming, our threatened food production, public transit our compromised futuremove over south park! .... made by canadians from toronto for $25,000 and released in may 2004, this video sold over 24,000 copies by october 2005. one major dvd rental vendor recently ordered almost 400 more copies.the end of suburbia sales were actually climbing 1 1/2 years after its release and it has also been available on one of the major online video services since september 2005.a sequel, escape from suburbia, is in the works with a possible release by august 2006.

this movie was groundbreaking in the former soviet union because it was the first movie released there that contained a real sex scene. however, the movie can be considered great for many reasons, not the least of which is its true, gritty portrayal of disillusionment and pain in the family of a working class soviet family. i would definitely recommend it.

there was a lot about little vera that was strange to me. all in all i did enjoy this movie, but a lot of the way the characters behaved was not what i was used to. for example the environment that vera's family lived in was very tense. almost every time the family was together they were either drinking, fighting or yelling and frequently it was a combination of the three. after i had viewed the film i felt tense because of all the confrontation that took place during it. i was however very interested in watching the story if this middle class russian family. throughout the entire film we are reminded of the industrialized state of russia because of the repeated shots of a train passing by the screen. it gave the viewer a sense of a mechanically lived life. the characters seemed to be focused on living their lives through work and drinking after work. there was not a feeling of happiness throughout the film. the only time a character was not yelling was when vera first fell in love with her fiancé sergei. this was very short lived because the viewer later discovers (after sergei locks vera's father in a bathroom and vera lets him out after which the father proceeds to stab sergei) that he is abusive. another time vera is told that the only reason she was born was so the family could get a larger apartment. it is very interesting watching how both vera and the family were able to cope with each other's behavior. the film was definitely worth watching because of its depiction of how life could be in areas of russia.

little vera is the story of a russian teenager, her family, and her attempts to find meaning and value in a life sliding increasingly into decay. in her search for meaning, she falls in love with a more intellectual and rebellious sergei, whose hatred for her deeply flawed parents quickly spirals out of control.little vera is shocking and disturbing in nearly every way. the drinking of the father, the enabling and lack of understanding of the mother, the casual lies and misdirection of the brother, and vera herself forgiving them all their flaws are all shocking and slightly disturbing to watch. however, the raw honesty of the film somehow manages to become even more shocking than the plot or characters. set in cramped spaces and vast urban decay, little vera presented a vastly different view of soviet life than had ever been seen before. in fact, little vera is a portrait of the collapse of soviet society painted in shades of pain, desperation, and rust. it is the implosion of a family set against the implosion of an entire social order.although painful and desperately unsatisfying, the film itself is definitely worth seeing, if only to understand the feelings and cultures still reshaping russia today.

a gritty presentation of the decay of family values and human dignity in the wake of soviet communism, vasili pichul's 1988 film little vera is a landmark film of modern russian cinema. pichul's brutal drama marks a strong departure from the images of sanitized idealism promoted in soviet times (as in aleksandrov's circus), brashly moving the social chaos of his time into the public spotlight. a contemporary ukrainian setting further intensifies the effect, first by the immediacy of the film to its time period, second by its utilization of a locale not only struggling for identity in lieu of a soviet system, but also as a nation distinct from the russian idiom that had dominated the u.s.s.r.vera, the film's title character and protagonist, is a rebellious adolescent girl with a "dysfunctional" family including a hard-drinking father and a mother care-worn. rejecting her would-be beau andrei, vera begins a destructive (and primarily sexual) relationship with a college student named sergei. despite her parents' dislike for the lazy sergei, and despite sergei's rude contempt for her parents, he moves into their cramped apartment. tensions escalate until vera's father drunkenly stabs sergei. vera must decide if she will stay loyal to her intolerable family by testifying her father acted in self-defense, or continue to support and defend the ever-detached sergei. unbearable in almost every imaginable way, little vera masterfully captures and communicates the inescapable void left in social life after the collapse of communism. the sexual aggressiveness of the film (it was the first film to show explicit sex) combined with the unrelenting presentation of social reality (a marked distinction from the socialist realism demanded by stalin) effectively confronted the conditions of former-soviet life. most interesting, however, was public reception. while many wrote hate mail to the director and star, the film was wildly popular. here the double-edged nature of "film as social criticism" emerges: if done correctly, the film will make the audience uncomfortable. because no easy solution presents itself, some viewers will hate the film and filmmakers for "bringing up" the issue. many films come to mind as somewhat comparable in this regard: larry clark's kids, harmony korine's gummo, even popular movie's such as john hughes' breakfast club. i recommend this film to those viewers for whom the prospect of nearly two hours excruciating domestic conflict and social miasma is not overly daunting. the film is absolutely beautiful, and incredibly challenging. despite the difficulties of watching the film, some moments within it are profoundly beautiful. of course, the socio-historic and cultural significance of the film cannot be overlooked, and in fact operate as an even more assertive reason for watching this film.

forget every spy movie you've ever seen - this is what life was like in the ussr, and still is in many places in russia and the ex-soviet countries. vera dreams of life of leisure, as she imagines the west to be; her reality is very different, with a bitter mother, a violent father, and the ever-present alcohol. and her prospects for the future are not much better. she finds a man and they try to patch up a life together, but he is afflicted by the same environment, both socially and physically - the scenery in this movie is brilliant, sitting comfortably in the company of post-apocalyptic movies but obviously done with no special effects; they have just walked in and shot whatever happened to be in front of the camera.forget your stereotyped, cold russians of spy movies. this is the real deal: people are passionate, vibrant, and present in a way you'll never see in a drama from the west.

in russia, the ordinary teenager vera (natalya negoda) lives a leisured life with her drunkard father and her simpleton mother, without working and waiting for the calling for a technical course of telephone operator. her brother victor (aleksandr negreba) lives in moscow with the family of his own and occasionally visits his dysfunctional family and vera, being always motive for arguing. when vera meets the student of university sergei (andrei sokolov), they fall in love for each other and decide to get married. sergei moves to vera's house, but lives in conflict with her father. this relationship leads the family to a tragedy.i have just seen "malenkaya vera", and i liked a lot this deep family drama. i am not familiarized with the life style in the former urss, but there are some unusual behaviors that i found very interesting. the first one, when victor tells vera that she was conceived not because her parents wanted to have her, but because they wanted to move to a larger apartment. another one, when the family goes to the beach in a truck. many difficulties of vera's family and their friends, the repression in the park and other situations pictured in the movie are common in third world countries. this low budget movie is very well-directed, and the story is very profound and real. the cast has great performances and the actress natalya negoda is very beautiful. in the cover of the brazilian vhs, released by sagres distributor, there is information that natalya negoda was the centerfold of playboy magazine. i am not sure how precise are the subtitles in portuguese, since many long sentences spoken in russian are limited to short translation in few words. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "a pequena vera" ("the little vera")

one of the major aspects of "malenkaya vera" (called "little vera" in english) is that it was the first movie from the soviet union that featured a sex scene, albeit a short one. the title is important: vera is the russian word for "faith", identifying that punk vera (natalya negoda) has little faith in the soviet system. and as the movie shows, there's not much faith to be had in it. the opening scene shows the bleak industrial town of zhdanov, nearly a hell on earth. when vera's lover sergei (andrey sokolov) moves in with her family, it leads to some unexpected events.like in many russian movies, people's names describe their characters. for example, there's viktor (remember that "victor" means winner). all in all, this is a good look at the soviet union while it was collapsing - and we can see why it was collapsing. really good.

it is difficult, today and in the us, to understand this movie. we have nothing, really, to compare it with. here is an attempt at comparison: it is as if during the last years of saddam's rule, a filmmaker in iraq were somehow able to make a film, which, for the first time ever, showed life as it really was lived in that country. the life of ordinary young girl, with all the terror and the repression full blown. then the film was exhibited freely in iraq. if you could imagine that unlikely event, then you might have an idea of what went on with this film in the last few years of the soviet union. prior to this film, soviet cinema was highly censored. soviet movies would only show an ideal life in the worker's paradise. then suddenly this. the alcoholism, the random sex, the ugly wasteland that was the soviet city, the choking pollution, the proletariat victimizing each other and themselves, the utter hopelessness - it is all there. people were stunned. soviet women would often weep during the showings. many would say that this is the story of their lives. it was a cultural earthquake the like of which filmmakers only dream of accomplishing. it undoubtedly hastened the breakup of the soviet union. reading the reviews here, i can see that few understand this film. one says it was groundbreaking because it contained real sex. to the soviet viewers at the time, the sex was a minor event compared to fact that it portrayed reality for the first time in soviet cinema. others compare it to current films such as "as good as it gets" might as well compare homer's illiad to the latest john grissam novel. they simply do not compare. this is not just a film, this is was a social document, and a transforming social force. it needs to be viewed that way or you will not understand the film. other reviewers see it as a film about a dysfunctional russian family. one even says that it is difficult to feel sorry for vera because she keeps coming back to her family. the point is that vera and her family are symbols for all of soviet life. there was nowhere else to go, because the family down the block and in the next town were the same. this was life in the soviet union for most people. this is a film that can be viewed on many levels: as a drama it traces the landscape of despair, as a social document it shows the living conditions of the time, as a political document it shows the attitude of the people and many of the reasons for the break-up of the soviet union, and as a moral document it shows the evils of a dictatorship that is out of control, and the cruelties that victims will practice on each other. little vera clearly shows the human toll that socialism eventually takes on its victims, despite any good intentions that system may have. in doing so it helped end the soviet regime thus contributing to one of the major changes in modern history. this film achieves what only a few films have ever accomplished. it is not only an stunning representation of history but it also become a force in that shaped history.

the captain and tennille have released a very good 3 dvd package with minimal editing. unlike most variety show releases these shows have not been hacked to bits. the musical and dance numbers are included with the skits just as they were when first broadcast. i suspect that some musical numbers on the dvd may have been edited into shows in which they did not originally appear but have been unable to verify that suspicion. i've noticed a few inconsistencies between what is on the dvd and program information i've found on the net. i've been unable to verify whether the net information is inaccurate or if the musical performances have been edited into the shows on the dvd. whatever the truth may be, i'm very appreciative of the efforts made by the production company. i wish every variety show released would show the same respect for the format. i would guess about half the shows broadcast are included. i believe they ran into rights problems on the shows which weren't included. hopefully those issues can be resolved and a volume 2 can be released sometime in the future. there are some individual music videos along with a dance rehearsal among the extras. i recommend this dvd to any c&t fan.

this was alright. it was one of those we gotcha but we don't have enough evidence yet storylines. in the couple handfulls of movies i've seen her in, i've never really though much of stephanie zimbalist. a professional tv actress she is but nothing really outstanding. here in this she was definitely above average as the former fed (or was it fed on loan?) profiler. her character got along well with the motley bunch of special investigation unit cops she was assigned with. there wasn't really a goofy character you'd roll your eyes at and just despise which was good. also good is it takes awhile to know who the murderer is... but when i found out i wasn't that surprised. oh well. one more thing that was good was the los angeles locations. quite possibly if this was made today they'd use toronto or vancouver but here they really shot in downtown l.a. like that a lot (even though i semi-despise l.a.) liked the movie, too. i don't know if i'd ever watch it again but it wasn't too bad. my grade: b-

i have to admit that when first saw madonna performing holiday on top of the pops many years ago i said to my wife "another american one hit wonder getting the whole thing wrong!!" well she was wearing a fright wig and was appallingly dressed. i have never grown to love her the way my daughter does but i have to eat my words. i do like some of her stuff and sometimes enjoy her filmed concerts. this confessions tour film is great,even if the music is not(and its not). i was impressed by the staging and concepts. madonna's own performance was enhanced by the incredible dancers she chose to support her. my daughter was at the london gigs and was crazy about it. the lady (madge) has proved my initial assessment of her so very wrong!!

this show was so exhausting to watch and there's only two numbers drowned world (substitute for love) and paradise (not for me) were you can sit down and just contemplate it all. the opening of this show will go down in history as the most visually thrilling, as madonna enters the stage via a gigantic swarovski crystal ball that comes down from the ceiling and the huge screens from behind it show images of horses galloping. horses play a role in this show due to madonna falling off one. the infamous scene of madonna on the crucifix is in this show as a huge screen counts to 12 million, the number of how many african children are orphaned due to aids. at the end a website address comes up for anyone interested in donating. we then go into the theme of the environment and again images of politics and religion are shown. there's an interlude and then the show starts again to the music of i love new york and ray of light this part of the show is one of my favorites with the dancers doing there funny hand movements. towards the end there's the music number with the song disco inferno mixed in with the song and the dancers make more of there presence known. the ending again is full of energy as the show wraps up to the tunes of lucky star and hung up and hundreds of golden balloons fall from the ceiling at the end the message "have you confessed?" comes up. the dvd is worth buying and when it came out the soundtrack for the show was added as a bonus. jonas akerlund did a great job with the footage for this show keeping it consistent with the style of the tour.

madonna has been rocking the boat for over 20 years, and with that comes a lot of experience -obviously- and a lot of knowledge. she was never the one to think about yesterday, au contraire, she seemed to know what is going to be popular tomorrow. she bravely takes all the new trends, technologies, and incorporates them into her own acts. her world tours have never been 'average'. when madonna performs, she gives 120% - everything is bigger, better, theatrical and meaningful. she takes inspirations from east, west, and makes then unique. everything is given a deeper meaning, and the confessions tour is not different. from the very beginning, you find yourself sitting on the edge of the chair. she starts with bang, then she does brave circus poses on a horse high up in the sky, she does everything she can to entertain you. she remakes her own songs, giving them a modern feel. she sings on a disco cross, she almost comes in the middle of the stage, and with her amazing dance crew that know no dimensions of fear, the show is absolutely more than you bargained for. it's a spectacle, an audio-visual orgasm that cannot be put in words. lucky are the ones who actually experienced seeing madonna on stage. pushing fifty, she is still in an incredible form. recent sticky and sweet tour is even more ground-breaking, which proves nothing else, that madonna was, is, and ever be the one and the only queen of pop.

the show was amazing and very professional. madonna is a non-stop, dancing and singing for 2 hours. the opening was pretty good when she came out of the disco ball and also jump was a really good performance. the entire show was full of energy so it's kind of hard to say which were the highlights because every song had something special and unique. i saw live couple of her previous tours (drowned world and reinvention tour)they were good but you can't compare with this one. the dancers were fantastic, the lights and the whole show were just perfect. madonna still looks very good. if you haven't seen it yet, i highly recommend you to see it. you'll enjoy the show from the beginning to the end. madonna is still the dancing queen.

this concert is the type of concert that only comes around every twenty years or so, madonna's confessions on a dance floor era will certainly be remembered as one of the high points of her career. she's 48 and she looks simply divine, she keeps up with the dancers that are almost twenty years her junior. i am also very glad to report that all the songs were sung live, which is good because she actually sounds better live. each song was so unique, the visuals where stunning. the performance of 'live to tell' was fantastic and had me awestruck, 'isaac' was exotic and gorgeous and was rich with political symbolism, the arabic horn, the american eagle set free. i particularly liked the rockin performance of 'i love new york', i almost stood up in my lounge room and cheered when she told her critics to suck george bushes ****. and then again i was impressed by the 70's inspired music (inferno remix). this spectacular decedent concert made a fan out of me.verdict: highly recommended with a capital h.

well i have to say i had the chance to see this show here in philadelphia,pa sometime in june of 06.and i really loved it.my all time favorite madonna look was the 1990 blond ambition tour era.this to me is "madonna".now that she is a mother of 3 she has to change some things to suit motherhood.and i totally agree.this is a classic madonna concert.i wish "live to tell" wasn't edited.we saw body's falling from buildings on 911,we can see a woman on a cross...any way i'm looking forward to the release of this tour on dvd and hope it is the entire show unedited and with a bunch of bonus footage.she is a artist of all time.the best out there...and still at the top and going strong.long live madonna !

this is a spectacular production! i have seen the show live twice in chicago and my only problem with the production was the fact that i was able to perceive only fragments of what was going on. the stage consisted of three giant catwalks and the platform and as the action moves from one part of the stage to the next sometime you loose track of what is going on no matter where you are located. as always, this is a thought-provoking sensory overload, skillfully captured in high definition with 15 cameras! the footage was masterfully edited, one of the best concert dvds of all times in my opinion! i only hope and wish that they will release this on blu-ray of hd-dvd so that we can re-live this extravaganza over and over again.

years ago, with "ray of light," madonna broke through to a truly amazing level of musical artistry, and since then she's occasionally transcended even her own standards. this concert production, with its hypnotic editing, amazing dancing, hallucinatory lighting effects, and trance-inducing arrangements, blows away all previous efforts. madonna's apparent ambition -- to single-handedly bring about world peace through music and dance -- may seem hubristic or absurd to some. but hell, somebody's got to do it! thanks to her assemblage of the remarkable talent of everyone involved in this production, "confessions tour live from london" places her once again among the top ten artists working anywhere in the world in any medium.

hammer house of horror: witching time is set in rural england on woodstock farm where stressed musician david winter (jon finch) lives with his actress wife mary (prunella gee) & is currently composing the music for a horror film. one night while looking for his dog billy david finds a mysterious woman in his barn, calling herself lucinda jessop (patricia quinn) she claims to be a witch who has transported herself from 300 years in the past to now. obviously rather sceptical david has a hard time believing her so he locks her in a room in his farmhouse & calls his doctor charles (ian mcculloch) to come examine her, however once he arrives & they enter the room lucinda has disappeared. charles puts it down to david drinking too much but over the next few day strange & disturbing things begin to happen to david & mary...witching time was episode 1 from the short lived british anthology horror series produced by hammer studios for tv & originally aired here in the uk during september 1980, the first of two hammer house of horror episodes to be directed by don leaver (episode 13 the mark of satan being the other) i actually rather liked this. as a series hammer house of horror dealt with various different themes & were all unconnected to each other except in name & unsurprisingly watching time is a sinister & effective little tale about a witch, the script by anthony read benefits from it's slight 50 odd minute duration & moves along at a nice pace. the character's are pretty good as is the dialogue, there are some nice scenes here & i liked the way it never quite reveals whether david & mary are going crazy or not. i think it's a well structured, entertaining & reasonably creepy horror themed tv show that i enjoyed more than i thought i would.being made for british tv meant the boys at hammer had a lower budget than usual, if that was even possible, & as such there is no gorgeous period settings here as in their most well know frankenstein & dracula films although the contemporary english setting does give it a certain atmosphere that you can relate to a bit more. another tv based restriction is that the exploitation levels are lower than you might hope for, there's some nudity & gore but not much although i didn't mind too much as the story here is pretty good. it's well made for what it is & hammer's experience on their feature films probably helped make these look pretty good, the acting is good as well with genre favourite ian mcculloch making a bit-part appearance.witching time is a good start to the hammer house of horror series, as a 50 minute piece of british tv it's pretty damned good, now why don't they make show's like this over here anymore?

as a great fan of the hammer studios and enthusiastic watcher of their gothic horror films, i wonder what took me so long to start watching their tv-series "hammer house of horror", which only ran for one season in 1980. now that i've seen the first four episodes of the show, i can say that it easily satisfies my expectations so far. while this first episode "witching time" is maybe not the most imaginative horror story ever told, and doesn't quite deliver the marvelous gothic atmosphere that i love hammer's films from the 50s to the 70s for, it doubtlessly does accomplish to tell a surprisingly spooky tale and create some genuine creepiness within fifty minutes. film score composer david winter (jon finch) is tormented by the 17th century witch lucinda (patricia quinn)... while he story may be simple, but for a running time of less than an hour, it is effective and delivers many creepy moments. northern irish actress patricia quinn, who is probably best known for her role in "the rocky horror picture show" (1975) as well as the fantastic monty python comedy "monty python's meaning of life" (1983), is wonderfully malicious in her role which fits her like a glove. jon finch is also quite good as david, and while prunella gee, who plays his adulterous actress wife, may not be the best actress ever, she is definitely nice to look at. the episode is accompanied by a nice score which plays along well with the atmosphere. overall, "witching time" is a very entertaining episode with several truly creepy moments, and decent opener to the series.

this was my first look at this short-lived british tv horror series, but i had seen a couple of hammer horror films (horror of dracula, captain kronos: vampire hunter) and thought highly-enough of them to give this a look.this first episode was a shocker - not for the horror but for all the nudity. was this "regular" tv in england in 1980? if so, it showed a lot more skin than what we see in north america. there were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts, one scene where a guy put his hand on one, and another scene with man a top of a woman faking intercourse. hey, i'm not complaining. the story is a simple one: a witch who had disappeared in the 17th century comes back to her old house and makes life tough for the married man. the latter, jon finch as "david winter," wasn't much of an actor, but his wife wasn't bad and was a really beauty. she was be prunella gee as "mary." the husband suspected her, rightly so, of having an affair and that plays a part in this story.patricia quinn was entertaining as the laughing witch "lucinda jessup," who comes back with a mean streak in her and has a good time tormenting the couple until things go wrong at the end. as a man, i'd say it was particular fun to see the two women going at it! this starts off slowly but once "lucinda" starts stirring up things, it gets very entertaining.

possibly john cassavetes best film to date, and definitely his funniest. seymour cassel plays the young moskowitz smitten with real-life wife of cassavetes, gena rowlands, excellent as usual. a must see gem of a film, if you can locate it.

i would recommend this for anyone who is an admirer of the late john cassavetes. and for those who have never known of cassavetes. it is an excellent film. i really don't have the time to go into the details of why this is my opinion, but if you're looking for something gutsy, with lots of scenes to mull over, then this one is for you. the cinematography is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film, as well as the story itself. this "review" does not do the film justice. it is an experience one must view for themselves. lots of character. very genuine.

although it may not be cassavetes' best work, minnie and moskowitz is almost perfect in all its endeavours. the plot is whimsical and charming, and surprisingly dramatic with an impressive range of emotion -- much more drama than comedy, contrary to imdb's profile. yes, the story is whimsical, but not arbitrary; it succeeds as believable, albeit a tad forced -- which i will come back to. all of the artistic aspects are of true cassavetes form: the cinematography and camera-work are delights, and the soundtrack -- albeit barely there -- is complimentary. plus i believe i noticed some nods to godard and such in the editing -- as i have in a few of cassavetes' other films -- (namely the abrupt cutting of a song in one scene), which are interesting.i feel the plot is built up nicely, with the first half being particularly enjoyable. seymour's conversation with morgan morgan (timothy carey) in the diner, for example, is wonderfully funny and fascinating, and sets the tone for the philosophical commentary made throughout the film. this philosophising -- a tradition in cassavetes' films -- is what made the film for me. seymour's amusing and profound monologues instantly eliminate the first impressions one may have of him as a hippie simp -- though his character is curiously similar to that of his in faces (1968). this tipped me, however, (on second viewing) into the opinion that it stands up against cassavetes' best work. i gained an affection for this film that i lacked on first viewing.there are, sadly, several aspects that make this film imperfect. i find the plot to be unbalanced. as i said before, it builds up nicely, but it wanes a bit here and there, particularly towards the end. because of the spontaneous style in which cassavetes worked, and particularly the freedom with which he allowed his actors to improvise, the quality of his product can easily go either way. in this case it's inconsistent. i assess that most of this film was improvised, and most of it beautifully. but one or two scenes, unfortunately, just don't work. in particular, the scene after seymour fights with minnie's work associate outside her house. during what is intended to be the most intense scene of the film, cassavetes allowed his actors to run free with the dialogue -- presuming some was planned beforehand. this, i believe, was a mistake. one gets the impression cassel doesn't quite know what to do, as he repeatedly fumbles in his speech, often not making sense, and overacts; all of this damaging the scene and the character development. i understand seymour is intended to be a bit of a brash fool, but cassel's attempts here are misapplied. why does he cut his moustache off? these flaws are resulting from: a lack of direction on cassavetes part; a lack of understanding and forethought on cassel's part; a lack of rehearsal and preparation; etc. evidently, cassavetes didn't learn from his mistakes, as he allowed this same thing to happen in his next film, a woman under the influence (1974) -- the committing scene, and ending.the flaws i mention are not minor, but they do not ruin the film. they simply make some scenes cringe-worthy and unrealistic, spoiling the flow of the film and compromising its potential. however, i am very, very fond of cassavetes and all of his actors, particularly cassel, in spite of the faults i mentioned. this is a very enjoyable film, although it proves the precariousness of cassavetes' style.

real love. true love. mad love. beautiful love. ugly love. dirty love. sad love. happy love. silly love. smart love. gorgeous love. dumb love. love love love. minnie moore understands that what she really needs is a man who trust her, trust her and love her madly. of course when this man comes along... she tries to run away but seymour, wonderful seymour, he trusts her, he believes in her so he is going to fight for her against her. i want to be like seymour moskowitz. i want to be that kind of man. a man willing to love without been afraid to fail but willing to fail. that's a kind of hero. that's my kind of hero... and minnie moore is my kind of woman. long live cassavetes and all his lovely bunch!

minnie and moskowitz is the most pathetic and ungraceful love story i've ever seen. between minnie, a disillusioned museum curator whose abusive married boyfriend dumps her and leaves her even more uptight and confused than she already was, and seymour moskowitz, a parking attendant so desperate for attention that he spends his nights going to bars and restaurants aggravating people, there is a chaotic and disenchanted match from the start. just like so many pairings that we see every day.in nearly every love story, there is a man and a woman, the man being confident, funny, either classically hot or attractive in his own way, whose shortcomings are charming, and the woman a wounded soul who could have any man she wants who chooses this guy because there's just something about him. these movies make everyone feel so good because the characters embody what every man and woman wants to be, not what they are. minnie and moskowitz, instead of indulging in any hint of fantasy in the realm of romance, depicts people who may just be more common than the attractive, confident people with so much experience playing the field. what's the story behind the love affairs of the ugly, alarmingly awkward man with no life and no job that we all run into, or the woman so crippled by insecurity that it's difficult to talk to her?this film is not as fascinating as cassavetes's faces or opening night, but it has that riveting quality that cassavetes always fought so hard to render, which is an unbridled depiction of people underneath the ego that hides behind itself in nearly all other films. gena rowlands and seymour cassel, delivering startlingly pitiable people, are hardly likable. moskowitz nearly drives us mad, let alone minnie. he imposes himself so forcefully in her life, the dates are an explosion of the inner voices of ours that respond to the screamingly inept uneasiness on dates we've all been on, rejections we've all swallowed, and arguments we've all had that we know were our own faults. i admire a film like minnie and moskowitz because, as the trademark is with the films cassavetes helmed himself, it identifies with us in 100% honesty. our egos play no part in company with his characters, thus a tremendous achievement per performance by actor.

life is crazy. you're crazy, i'm crazy, we're all crazy. we're all a little bit minnie, and a little bit moskowitz. sometimes it does seem best to be sensible...but then what might you be missing out on?you gotta be you. you don't have to park cars and semi-randomly yell at people, but you can't hide yourself behind a veil (or dark sunglasses) and pretend and act like everything is okay. and sometimes, you really do have to throw caution to the wind, because why else are you alive?i'm not going to 'rate' this love compared to cassavetes' other movies, because they are all absolutely 100% unique works and each their own individual act of expression and exploration of our lives. in that sense they are all great, and comparisons are odious. for sure, this movie has that one crazy, sometimes maddening, but ultimately wonderful and freeing quality that all his movies have- you never know what's going to happen next, and you never know what the characters are going to think, do, or feel next. neither do the characters themselves- and do we really want to live our lives any other way? unlike moskowitz, you can have a great job and judiciously sock away money into your ira, but still live the life of an adventurer inside- in your feelings, your spirit, and your very experience of life. yeah, we can have it both ways, that's what cassavetes shows us. thank god somebody did.

i feel as though i know these people and have known people similar to them. these days, though, people are discouraged from showing such passion about anything especially love and loneliness. it has a slow beginning, but then look out! if you love romantic comedies, but would like to see one that had some basis in reality for a change {or at least did have back in the 70's}, then you should see this movie!

this light-heated (for cassavetes)love story is pleasantly conveyed by two wonderful performances by gena rowlands and seymour cassell. rowlands was never more beautiful as a repressed, damaged mid-30's woman who meets her match in seymour. cassell is a powderkeg of energy and romantic notions (on his terms). there is a great supporting performance by val avery as zelmo swift and an unusual (as always) timothy carey that's worth the price of admission. made between husbands and a woman under the influence this is cass' most accessible film that should touch the heart of anyone (especially the cassavetes haters) who claim his films are too long and ponderously heavy at times. made my top ten that year and not seen by enough people. an 8 out of 10.

oz is by far the best show ever to grace television. better than the sopranos, yes, er, yes, csi, absolutely. uncompromising, daring, and utterly disturbing yet profoundly moving. oz took us past any image of prison that anyone had ever conjured up on television. tom fontana truly did a brilliant job with the writing. no topic is taboo. rape, drugs, murder. oz is evidence of just how good tv can be. it follows characters of all different backgrounds and all different races, but always comes back to your everyman tobias beecher, in jail for vehicular manslaughter. we see what we don't want to see, pain, death, mayhem. oz will disturb you, make you cringe, make you look away, but most of all it will make you think. to see oz is to see a truly magnificent television production

okay, so i've read most of the reviews on this movie, as well as comments left by visitors to this site, and the feeling i get is that most people who wrote reviews really didn't like this movie. that's why i'm writing now-i represent the minority because, i did. i admit, i went to see the movie because i am very impressed with ryan gosling's compelling abilities, and the projects he has been a part of lately have been nothing less than incredible. he is an amazing actor. that aside, i wanted to see this movie because it seemed intriguing to me... why? because it's a whodunit where you know `whodunit' from the start, and that's kind of unusual.as the plot goes, two teenage boys endeavour to commit the "perfect crime" because they believe in a twisted philosophy that only through committing acts of crime are human beings truly free-the uninhibited, and let's remember, guiltless, acting out of one's will. the relationship between richard and justin was complex, hinted at homosexuality, and was brilliantly acted by ryan gosling and michael pitt. gosling was the manipulating, controlling smooth-talker, and pitt was the extremely book-smart, socially awkward outcast. enter sandra bullock's character, who it seems most people didn't particularly appreciate. i think when people see she was the executive producer they automatically assume any role the actor has in it is a self-glorification thing. i didn't see that as the case here. without "cassie's" personal history about the ex-husband that nearly killed her, who, not surprisingly, shared similar traits with richard hayward, she never would have pursued her instincts about justin and richard. the case was seemingly airtight against ray, the unsuspecting school janitor and friend of the boys. even when the boys are questioned near the end of the movie neither bullock nor her partner have much solid evidence about them other than the fact that they lied about knowing each other, and the vomit justin left at the sight. therein lay the genius of the movie because the philosophy the boys were trying to prove through the act of killing, the guiltless acting out of will as `true freedom,' ended up working against justin, who ended up having a conscience after all (and ended up leaving part of his conscience at the body dump site). without that crucial piece of evidence, they almost had a "murder by numbers." and to readers out there who have puzzled over the title as much as i have, i looked in to it and found that something done "by numbers" (such as a painting) suggests careful and critical planning and exacting. there's also a song by sting called "murder by numbers", but that's beside the point. :)many readers questioned the necessity of the relationship between cassie and her partner, but i think it really meant to show how cynical and manipulative she had become because of her history. like it or not, her history does play an important role in this movie because without it, she would likely have never followed her instincts about justin and richard. yes, it was a bit of the cliche `women scorned, woman acting out vendetta in every facet of her life' plot, but i think without the depth of cassie's character you have just another movie about teenage killers, and they just may have gotten away with it. there's no movie there.and to the reader who commented that the teenagers obviously didn't commit the perfect crime because the police were on to them from the beginning, can i remind you that the reason was because of the purposely placed, and totally traceable shoe prints. the boys wanted to be involved-it was a game. they were so confident that they had committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see first hand the difficulty the investigators would have in uncovering what they think is the truth. what they didn't expect was that cassie mayweather had an overactive case of instinct working on her side. a little unbelievable? maybe. but many crimes have been solved by police officers who have followed their instincts. however, this is a movie!i saw this movie in theatres about three times, and each time it revealed a little more to me, and i liked it a little more. the more i watched it, the more i was captivated and frightened by the psychological depth richard hayward-there are people really like this. my main complaint about the movie would be that they should have had justin and richard's interactions a little more central (because, let's face it, there lays the intrigue in the entire film) and my main props go to characterization-each character was very distinct and interesting in his/her own way. it was very well acted, although i would have given ben chaplin's character a little more depth to work with (he's a good actor) and maybe pared down bullock's character a smidgen.i think everyone should keep in mind that for a hitchcock type thriller like this to basically tell you the "whodunit" at the beginning, it poses a very big challenge for the writers to keep the attention of the audience until the very end. i think they did so quite well by utilizing a few small plot twists throughout, slow revelation of the different character dynamics, and by lighting up the screen with some really emotionally charged performances by the young actors ryan gosling and michael pitt. i think if we remove our innate cynicism and attempt to see how psychologically complex the characters and their interactions are, we may be able to look beyond any apparent plot holes and see the real texture and quality of this movie, if only in the characters who were brilliantly portrayed. especially richard hayward. not that i'm biassed. :)

i liked this movie. unlike other thrillers you learn to know the killers very well. you also get to know the two detectives hunting them. the killers are two high school kids. they are very intelligent and want to prove they are smarter than the police so they plan the "perfect crime". we all know this crime will not turn out perfect. what we don't know is if they will be caught, or may be just one of them, or even none. in a way i kind of hoped they both would get away with it, although i don't know if this was the movies intention.the story is told in a nice way. you are starting to get to know the people involved. the character of sandra bullock is likable but has her own secret, which works against her. ben chaplin is pretty good as sam and the two kids are both great. the scenes between them are the better scenes in the movie.i think you can say the movie is pretty good and not as predictable you would think. for a nice evening with a movie, 'murder by numbers' is a good one.

not bad but could be loads better, also seems to follow a staple diet for crime drama. you've got sandra bullock as the cop who finds it difficult to work with others, you've got her placed with a new partner. there's a closed case but a cop who works on it anyway, and there's so many corney lines in the film it makes you want to scream.however, if you can look past the formulaic elements there is a good film hiding underneath. it's gripping and the subplots worked for me. well worth a rent but maybe not a purchase.

this thriller has so many twists and turns it had me on the edge of my seat. i saw it on video, some of the landscape at "the bluff" might have been a bit more spectacular on the big screen. cast has sandra bullock, ben chaplin (from "the truth about cats & dogs"), michael pitt (henry parker in "dawson's creek") and ryan gosling (???).

this multi-leveled thriller kept my attention throughout. it is disturbing and informative to see how perverse human behavior can be. it is also instructive as to what past wounds can motivate present behavior. no one, save sandra bullock's partner, is very likable. however, all are believable. sandra did an excellent job. her character, cassie, comes alive with all her pain and fear and defenses. she is a survivor and so her life experience finally brings her to a healing moment. i enjoyed this movie very much. tom landers

rating: 7 out of 10. directed by barbet schroeder. if you like hitchcock's `rope', then you will like this movie. `murder by numbers' stars sandra bullock as psychologically troubled yet brilliant police detective cassie mayweather. her partner is sam kennedy, a non-discriminatory detective played by ben chaplin. the teenage killers are high school students richard haywood (ryan gosling) and justin pendleton (michael pitt). these young psychotics are out to prove their superiority by committing the perfect murder and getting away with it, but the nearness of capture is exciting and thrilling to at least one of the killers.the supporting characters include a police chief, an assistant district attorney, and the high school janitor that the killers pin the murder on. the movie reminds me of various `hitchcock' movies crossed with the tv show `law and order'. we see a fair bit of police work and it is really interesting to see which clues the detectives follow and which ones they don't.the other plot in the movie relates to cassie mayweather's past and incarcerated ex-husband. most viewers found this aspect of the movie unnecessary and slow moving, but i found this to the most intriguing part of the story.`murder by numbers' is a nicely crafted movie if you are looking for safe, or should i say dangerous, murder mystery. for more thrills and suspense, try `se7en' or hitchcock's `dial m for murder'.

sandra bullock paints a believable picture as the troubled detective, though seeing her as a cynical man-eating victim-turned-persecutor requires a leap of faith (or two). the two creepy troubled kids are portrayed adequately by ryan gosling and michael pitt. i do have quite a bit of trouble getting ben chaplin into the equation (same problem arose when watching 'the truth about cats & dogs' (http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0117979/). i mean, when you put an englishman into an all-american movie, shouldn't there at least be a reason to put him there? shouldn't there be some story leading up to the fact that an englishman is serving as a detective on an american police force? shouldn't there be some dialog pointing out and explaining that rather obvious fact? or even some jokes about him being that english? he looks out of place here, as he looked out of place in 'the truth about cats & dogs'. producers really should take notice, it distracts and annoys the audience (at least me). nothing wrong with chaplin's acting, it's just a matter of making an actor who is 'out of place' believable and not putting him somewhere without a good reason or a storyline. the movie itself: well, thrillers, especially those dealing with solving a complicated crime, require some suspension of disbelief. this one's no different; actually, it requires quite a bit more effort than usual. in order to make bullock smart enough to crack the case despite of all the pressures requiring her to let go of it, some unrealistic assumptions are being made about the evidence, and i'm sure a lot of people who watched it had a few moments of 'come on, this is highly unlikely under the circumstances' or even 'hey, you can't brush evidence aside like that to wrap this movie up!'. like i said: reasonably entertaining and watchable. just don't use this as required viewing for detective exams. there are no shortcuts there.

i find it hard to believe this could happen at all. we do not know if justin and richard were troubled or had committed crimes in the past. the movie seems to imply that they were not in and out of trouble. so the first crime they commit is murder? just to play and jostle with the cops? how do they pick up any girl and just say you are it? also richard seems to strangle the woman with little or no effort nor does the women seem to struggle. hmmm. this whole concept is really hard to believe. that said let's move on. i found myself really hating these punks and would love to have been present with my shot gun with police tactical ammo and see what their plastic suits do then. as for cassie who was a victim of carl hudson has a horrible time trying to survive. the memory of having been stabbed 17 times by carl leaves her in an emotional mess. sandra does a superb acting job. she sure made me believe she was one angry cop. as for solving the crime, i thought it was great. this movie kept me planted in my chair. loved the acting of all but sam. he had no get-up and go. the one thing this movie did not need was the love scene or should i say the rape scene.

this is an excellent, suspenseful, murder-mystery movie. not only was the plot full of suspense and intrigue but you get to see gorgeous ryan gosling for a couple hours, what's not to love! also, sandra bullock is good in this movie - i've always been a fan of hers, (i just wish she hadn't decided to be in "the lake house" which was horrible, but that's another story altogether). obviously since there are thousands of other murder/horror movies out there, there are bound to be similarities between them, no need to bash this movie for having some similarities to at least a few that have already been made. anyway, this is a great movie for those of you that actually enjoy "scary" movies, it's a little dark and twisted but overall a great movie!!!

cassie (sandra bullock) is a hyper-serious police detective. as an ex-boyfriend once tried to kill her and, indeed, left her grievously wounded, she is determined to bring those who harm others to justice. as the result of her near-death experience, also, cassie favors one-night stands and trusts no one. one day, a woman is found dead in the woods near cassie's community. she has been murdered heinously, beaten severely and left to die alone. naturally, cassie will stop at nothing to find the murderers. assigned to help her is fellow officer, sam (ben chaplin). he soon discovers cassie's relentless attitude and all-consuming instincts when she asks him to pick up a sample of vomit that has been left at the scene for analysis, among other actions. the trail soon leads them to two high school students, richard (ryan gosling) and justin (michael pitt). could these teenagers really be responsible for the planning and execution of the perfect "joy" killing? this is an intriguing film, but viewers should be warned that the subject matter is grim indeed. killing for the "sport" of it is seldom the topic of films that are of the "all sweetness and light" variety and this one is no different. that said, the cast is great. bullock, without a hint of her talent for comedy, is terrific as the police officer whose own past compels her to lock up the evil folks of the world. chaplin, too, is quite nice as the detective who is both attracted and repelled by the forceful cassie. as for gosling, he gives a most memorable performance as a brilliant mind with a satanic soul. the production values for the movie are good, too, with appropriately fine costumes, settings and photography. if you are a fan of bullock's looking for a laugh, this is not the one for you. but, if you adore mysteries, even those with the grimmest of plots, you will find this tale enthralling.

now, i know that sandra bullock produced this film, but she needs to learn that sometimes you need to make certain sacrifices in order to advance the story...like not trying to make the whole movie about her character!the story is about two high school students (one rich and popular, the other smart and anti-social) who formulate a plan to commit murder and follow it by the number...just to see if they can get away with it. enter sandra bullock and ben chaplin as detectives trying to solve the case. the boys have planted evidence, created alibis, and cleaned up after themselves so well that the cops fall for the whole act. but sandra has a feeling that all is not as it appears to be.this movie could have been a great little hitchcock-style thriller, but the movie spends too much time on getting to know sandra's character rather than focusing on the actual crime itself. you see, something happened in her past that keeps haunting her throughout the film. and we get to know all about it...all about it. it just gets rather tedious after a while, especially when you are right in the middle of an intriguing murder investigation and then have to stop that investigation to hear about what happened to her in the past.ryan gosling and michael pitt are the real winners in this movie. they play their characters convincingly and with just the right amount of malice. if the script had spent more time focusing on these characters, and kept the detectives there to just do their jobs, this could have been an immensely entertaining thriller. with the way it is, most of the thrill is lost. they should have cut out all the stuff with sandra's character and made that a separate tv movie for the lifetime channel. but, i digress. it's still an entertaining movie, nonetheless. i do recommend this movie...but wait for the video/dvd.

i knew little of this movie when i entered the theatre for an advance screening. i gathered from the ads that it was a thriller.what we have is like "compulsion" meets "matlock". two teens decide to commit a perfect murder. a victim is selected at random and then carefully executed so that no traces of the actual murderers is found. then a bunch of false leads are planted that point to an innocent bystander. (innocent of the murder anyway)enter sondra bullock as the investigating officer. (imdb says that she's fbi, but i don't remember that. i thought that she was a regular cop) she's frustrated by the inconsistency of the killers profile ("the profile doesn't fit the profile!") and by the power and influence of the father of one of the boys.she's also has demons of her own which figure prominently in her decicision to become a cop. but this is the only character that is really more than one-dimensional. all others are pretty flat.for a thriller, there are really no big thrills. it's mostly a cat-and-mouse game like an episode of "matlock" (which she's watching at one point in the film). the twist is that there are two involved in the killing. just who is the real murderer, justin or richard? it'll cost you eight bucks to find out.

murder by numbers is a pretty good movie. even though the plot rolls along at a snail's pace, what with sandra bullock's character getting all mixed up with her partner and the movie flashing back to a previous trauma situation she had been in, it does succeed in keeping the viewer involved in the film.having said that, i do think that it does a good job in setting that eerie sort of "who done it" type atmosphere. it keeps you guessing at which one of the boys really was behind the murder, if not both of them. i think ryan gosling and that other kid (lol) do a good job of selling that bully versus dork relationship. not sure about gosling playing a bad-ass, but for a guy who would later star in a movie like the notebook, he did a pretty good job. once the movie gets rolling, though, i really found myself involved in the story, sort of asking myself, "oh my god, what would i do if i were in that situation?" like i said, a good csi type movie, maybe not for the extreme crime drama movie junkie, but a good all around flick.8 outta 10

i can get very tired of murder mysteries with the exception of a few really excellent tv series. otherwise, there are just too many of these murder plot themes. i don't like the theme of the two over-clever, selfish youths killing as an intellectual exercise, i've no interest whatsoever in hitchcock who appears to have been associated with this in some way i don't intend to find out about. but don't misunderstand me, the theme is in itself excellent, the whole movie is so well done, and of course sandra bullock is superlative as always. sandra's character is (as in miss congeniality) not rated by the male team she works with in spite of her obvious skills, and the boss mostly ignores her ideas, eventually forcing her aside and giving the case to her male partner. of course sandra works out what's going on and nearly gets killed in a very dramatic denouement. it's intriguing how the boy who worked out the murder plot can't allow her to be killed by his colleague - he has a conscience of some sort and perhaps could be "saved, while the other is a true psychopath.sandra's hard shell is caused by misery in her past that's tied in poignantly with the murder case. her colleague, realising that sandra's solving this case in spite of being balked by the dense superior, finally discovers what happened to sandra herself in her teens, that she must now face up to and exorcise and the last scene shows her starting - we hope anyway - to do just that. i can see from the few other reviews i've had time to read that this movie would attract a broadish group - those interested in the two spoilt boys whiling away their time with their grisly philosophical determination to trick the police and get away with the perfect murder, the relationship between them that's so cleverly depicted, the ghastly links to the heroine's past, a police theme, and some smokes and mirrors - as well as for hitchcock fans.for those who've queried why bullock's character has to have a problematic past, really i think this would be a far less interesting movie if she had been just a detective trying to fathom what was going on, with a willing sidekick helping out and a male-chauvinist boss. the link between the murder victim and the detective is necessary to show the detective becoming too involved or otherwise how would she lose her arrogant boss's confidence and thereby nearly lose her life? that's hardly an original theme, in fact it's usually an extremely irritating theme as this male chauvinist boss brutally tells his frustrated but obviously inspired operative to get off the case and leave it to someone who clearly doesn't have quite the skills to solve it nice though the sidekick is. i was getting very worried towards the end re what might happen to sandra's character as her emotional involvement in the case and special sympathy for the unfortunate victim of the crime dangerously drove her on with this case by herself.i wasn't disappointed re the relationship between bullock's character and her sidekick. that goes along interestingly and at times very poignantly.the relationship between the two boys is definitely intriguing, if that's what you were interested in watching. i felt it was kept low key in some ways either because the movie-makers didn't want to get into boy-boy friendships too much, or because we weren't supposed to think emotion ruled their relationship. the movie cleverly makes you wonder which boy's in charge of the situation and there are some twists and turns and the boys show their underlying immaturity at various stages.there one thing i wish had been clarified and that's what happens "after the movie ends" when sandra's character arrives at the court.... you need to see to movie to know why she's there.very well acted by all. i certainly can't agree with those who complained against bullock's acting - she was superb. the part suited her very well indeed. the story is gripping even if murder mysteries aren't your thing and they aren't that often mine.

this one is about a homicide detective who battles a couple of young rich kids who have nothing better to do than plan an intricate murder and cover it up, they seem to outwit the police force seemingly at will. they taunt the detective by planting clues and leading them off on a wild goose chase. this one has a decent plot with a few good twists at the end of the movie, sandra bullock does a fine job in this one as a woman on the edge, not sure of herself and battling her inner demons, she can't seem to keep a man in her life, especially partners, they seem to keep leaving her for some reason. altogether this isn't a bad film, it keeps you guessing all the way the very shocking ending.

billy wilder created a somewhat conventional biopic about the charles lindberg flight. he structures the film using flashbacks extensively to tell the lindberg story leading up to the famous flight across the atlantic, which happens in present time in the film. flying an airplane for hour after hour is not the stuff of excitement, and wilder is not going to deviate from his theme of lindberg as hero of the common man, so things are predictable. however, james stewart is well cast and quite believable as lindberg, and the many obstacles he has to overcome just to get his plane in the air keep one watching. the film comes through most successfully as wilder weaves the parts of the story together in a way that create tension, then relief, then tension again. the cinematography is quite good, score by franz waxman enhances the scenes, and stewart really seems to make lindberg come alive, makes one believe he could be lindberg. there is a bit of 1950's religious schmaltz at the end, but overall the direction, acting, and high production values overcome the predictability of the story (would anybody really see this picture and not know that lindberg made it across the atlantic?) to make an enjoyable film that has aged better than most films from that time. billy wilder made films of a wide variety of types, and this is one that is representative of his craftsman-like best.

everyone knows that lindburgh succeeded in the first transatlantic flight. so how can there be any suspense or intrigue in this film? well, there is. don't ask me how, but there is. partly due to the director's expert telling of the tale but mostly due to jimmy stewart's thoroughly engaging performance, we are drawn into the story as if it were unfolding for the first time right before our eyes. despite the fact that half the movie is filmed in a cramped cockpit, it is as dynamic as any action flick out there. so if you are apprehensive about seeing this movie because you think you know the story already, give it a shot. i think you'll be impressed.

stewart's age didn't bother me at all in this movie, although he was portraying a much younger person. i still recall my fascination with lindbergh's story and while i was thoroughly adult by the time this biopic was made, i had to see it.not only does this boast a great performance by stewart,it also gives a lot of fascinating technical data,making it understandable to those technically challenged such as myself. and the look of the plane itself was great.i quite loved this depiction of a period before my birth and reawakens the childhood love i had for airplanes and for the idea of air travel.

others have harped here about james stewart's age when playing lindburg (he was 47 linburg was twenty five.) but stewart does not look his age and the film, for him was a dream come true. an actual pilot and a retired air force reserve general at the end of his life, stewart had the feel for the character and understanding of his passion, which other actors could not bring to the role. added to the cast was co-star murray hamilton, who was also to be featured in "the f.b.i. story with stewart) and such other well known character actors as richard deacon, of the later "dick van dike show" and robert cornthwaite of "the thing from another world" the 1951 sci-fi classic.billy wilder captures the flavor of the lindburg autobiography and the telling of what was to become a major event in the history of aviation. this story and film are a testament to the soul of determination and perseverance to realize a dream. a box office failure at the time of it's release, it has since become one of the great classics of american film and another in a long line of outstanding performances by an actor that has been called america's everyman. no student of film history should miss seeing this one. there have been over 500,000 films since the beginning of motion pictures, and this one belongs among the top 500.

this is one of those movies that showcases a great actor's talent and also conveys a great story. it is one of stewart's greatest movies. barring a few historic errors it also does an excellent job of telling the story of the "spirit of st. louis".

jimmy stewart was a real life pilot, wwii flier and a one-star general in the air force and therefore a natural for how real pilots react when they fly. when you see the faithful recreation of the actual plane, you begin to understand the real-life bravery and courage of lucky lindy when he flew the atlantic solo in 1927!

what you bring to the movie influences your view of it. i brought 30 years in the air force to this, and every time i see it i am moved by the ending. would a youngster of 15 who's spent their life flying in jets feel the same way? yet, i can only just its impact on me. jimmy stewart gives a wonderful turn as--jimmy stewart. considering he was a pilot, and an air force reserve general, he probably comes as close to being an expert on how a pilot would act as any man alive. one can't fault his delivery, or his acting. he is a pilot being a pilot, that's enough.---spoilers---it's the final minutes of the film that continue to grip my heart. lindbergh has been flying without radio communication and has no idea if anyone is even expecting him. when he flies into the paris airport, the uncertainty of the landing field draws you in. what is it below? those shifting circles that look like cobblestones or a field of corn, must make you wonder, is he in the right place? they go on and on, streaming past his vision until he gets low enough and see that in the paris night, what he was seeing was the light of the city reflecting off the upturned faces of the thousands of people waiting for him to land.

from director billy wilder (double indemnity, the seven year itch, some like it hot), i can see that this is a bit of an under-shown and underrated film, one to be seen. this is the biographical story of charles augustus 'slim' lindbergh (james stewart), who in 1927 wanted to be the first man to cross travel solo flight from new york, crossing the atlantic ocean, to reach paris, in a small cockpit. the first half hour or whatever is seeing lindbergh getting permission to do it, and the construction of the plane, named "the spirit of st. louis", and making all necessary preparations. then of course the rest sees his perilous journey crossing the journey, overcoming tiredness, near fuel loss, and moments of losing sense of direction, but he was successful. also starring murray hamilton as bud gurney, patricia smith as mirror girl, bartlett robinson as benjamin frank mahoney, robert cornthwaite as harry knight, sheila bond as model/dancer, marc connelly as father hussman, arthur space as donald hall, harlan warde as boedecker and dabbs greer as goldsborough. apparently lindbergh was a bit younger, so stewart was a shade too old to play him, but then again, you can't think of anyone else that could do better. it is a witty and emotional drama, with stewart (as always) being fantastic, great music score by frank waxman, and good direction from wilder, a good little known gem. it was nominated the oscar for best special effects (the only award it was ever nominated). james stewart was number 12 on the 100 greatest movie stars, he was number 3 on 100 years, 100 stars - men, and he was number 13 on the world's greatest actor. very good!

it's a thoroughly successful example of a 1950s biopic. it has the stalwart and handsome young hero -- well, not so young anymore on screen; superb, if unlikely, direction by billy wilder; a stirring fully orchestrated musical score of uplifting scales and, when required, heavenly strings by franz waxman; strong supporting players; a gripping story; stunning photography by hitchcock favorite robert burks; and a narrative about a singular historical event.the film begins with jimmy stewart as charles lindbergh trying to get some sleep in a long island hotel before his epic solo flight across the atlantic, from new york to paris. and he can't sleep.the flight itself is filled with flashbacks to lindbergh's personal history and the purchase and construction of his unique high-wing monoplane, the spirit of st. louis. st. louis, missouri, is the home of the partnership that sponsored the flight. (even in 1927, money talked.) anyway, the movie had to have multiple flashbacks and stewart's narration. what's the alternative. observing the unities? thirty-three hours of watching jimmy stewart sitting silently at the controls of his noisy airplane while days and nights come and go? i found the script and the direction impressive for their time. unpleasant things are of course left out, so as not to introduce more ambiguity than the contemporary audience might manage.my bet is that the howling mob that surrounds lindbergh at le bourget ripped the airplane to pieces for souvenirs. and of course nothing about the pilot's relief tube, though it would have added more opportunities for humor. some of today's viewers will find some incidents corny if they think too much about them. aloft, stewart chats with a friendly hitch-hiking fly that, in its own quietly concerned way, wakes him up by landing on his cheek at a critical moment. later, the st. christopher's medal that father hussman gave him taps gently against the glass crystal of one of the instruments just as stewart is desperately trying to land. the atheist stewart is saved twice -- once by a fly and once by god.but never mind that. it's an impressive film. that landing at le bourget, with an exhausted stewart behind the joy stick, confused by searchlights, sweaty with fear and collapsing with fatigue, is really convincing. "i'm going to tear this airplane up," he tells himself, and we can believe him.flying a light plane is not at all like driving a car. there is no smoothly curving highway to tell you where to go, no lanes to provide guidance. you're busy every second. you must watch the instruments, check each wingtip to see that they touch the horizon, ditto the airplane's nose, and constantly watch up, down, and sideways for other traffic, although that last wouldn't have been much of a problem for lindbergh. he was all alone over the ocean.why? in one of the movie's folksier moment, stewart and murray hamilton, two gypsy barnstormers of the 1920s, are lounging near their airplanes in a midwestern field. "what is it? what makes us love flying so much?", asks hamilton. (no answer.) later, his financial backers try to talk him out of the flight. five other aviators have already died trying it. "but don't you understand? it has to be done," says an impassioned stewart.well, that's not much of an answer either. why does it have to be done now, and why by lindbergh? why not wait ten years and stop wasting lives in the meantime? the answer, dear socrates, lies partly in our glands. pilots are a placid and confident lot, given to occasional arousal jags. their chief problem may be an addiction to an internal rush of adrenalin. just kidding. some of my best friends are pilots. still, lindbergh must have been quite a guy. he deserved to be treated as a hero. not just because of the flight itself but because of his later demeanor -- quiet, modest, a family man. we can easily forget his admiration for hitler, since he more than made up for it by testing corsair fighters in the pacific and advising the navy on how to tweak the airplanes and get the best performance out of them.see it if you have the chance. if nothing else, it's a history lesson told with visual splendor.

biographical tale of the life of charles lindbergh, the first man to fly solo non-stop across the atlantic in 1927, aboard his plane the spirit of st louis.while not amongst director billy wilder's best films it does boast some very impressive production values especially for a film made 50 years ago. the story is well told and the performances are also good though not outstanding.one definite limiting factor upon the storytelling is that lindbergh flew alone and without a radio, which meant he has no one to speak with. this necessitated a few different story telling techniques such as internal monologues, speaking with a housefly, and the occasional bouts of talking to himself especially once the exhaustion sets in. also in order to avoid an extended sequence of the famous flight, it is interspersed with flashbacks from his life and the methodical preparations for the flight.charles lindbergh was a huge hero of his era but his controversial beliefs would taint his legacy somewhat. despite this he would continue to contribute to the aviation field and assisted as a civilian aircraft consultant to the us effort in wwii.jimmy stewart certainly had the flying background to back his portrayal of lindbergh. he rose to the rank of colonel in us air force during wwii and while in the reserves following the war would reach the rank of brigadier general.

this film recreates lindbergh's historic flight across the atlantic while touching on episodes in his aviation career through flashbacks. stewart was about 20 years too old to be playing the young flier, but his fine performance, particularly in the solo flight sequences, makes this a minor quibble. waxman's rousing score is a big plus. despite the long running time, wilder manages to make it quite exciting and is able to sustain the drama even though the outcome is known. what a year 1957 was for wilder: besides this, he also wrote and directed "love in the afternoon" and "witness for the prosecution." and his next two were "some like it hot" and "the apartment." what a run!

billy wilder continues his strong run of films during the 1950s with a biopic of charles lindbergh, the young american pilot who became the first man to fly solo across the atlantic in 1927. jimmy stewart plays lindbergh, and while he might be a bit too old for the part, he still brings the sincere warmth and confidence needed as well as his trademark down-to-earth goodness that makes him an iconic film star. wilder directs solidly, balancing the background story with humor and drama to give us a clear description of what lindbergh was up against when he decided to take this challenge. it certainly isn't his nor stewart's best work, but it is a gem of a movie. it lifts your spirits with the plane and makes you proud to be an american. overall, it is just plain good.

shawn michaels vs. edge-8- kind of hard to believe shawn michaels is in the opening match but still a great match by both men, edge, whether you like or not is a great performer in the ring, and shawn michaels is just ageless when it comes to his performance the undertaker vs. heidenreich. casket match-2- ok, after a good opening match, now this, what a crappy match. undertaker has given some great matches at the royal rumble, and 1998's royal rumble against shawn michaels was the same type of match, but this is way worse then that match.kurt angle vs. big show vs. bradshaw. triple threat wwe championship-6- it's alright, i feel all three men could of given a better performance, this just really didn't show them at their best.randy orton vs. triple h. world heavyweight championship-9- triple h gets a clean win, can you believe it, sure he takes out the sledgehammer but doesn't use it. randy orton did great when acting like he got a concussion, but how he got the concussion is really ridiculous. i really liked this match, this was the best performance i've seen from hhh in forever.the royal rumble match-7- this was highly entertaining and i usually don't score the royal rumble match this high. the winner is again, very predictable, but just this had a lot of moments that were very entertaining to watch the segments with flair and guerrero are hilarious the best segments i've seen in a while.overall, this is a great ppv and a must own for wrestling fans.

a respectable royal rumble event1. edge vs shawn michaels7.5/10 a very strong opener...edge's heel performance was sublime as it was during the rumble event ..overall id say edges night....2. undertaker vs heidenreich casket match7/10 a lot of people hated this rivalry though i liked it, i thought heidenreich really played his character well. the match wasn't amazing in excitement that was until kane and snitcky get involved .it gets better as it goes on.3. kurt angle vs big show vs jbl(wwe champ) wwe title match7.5/10 a surprisingly good match , as there was only 1 really exciting in ringer in it ..angle of course......very good title match ..good pace.. though a predictable end .but aren't all royal rumble title matches predictable.4. triple h (world title) vs randy orton world title match6.5/10 actually not that good for the guys involved, went on too many dry patches, orton sold his concussion amazingly, ending though was some what of an anti climax.5. royal rumble event... btw during the other matches there were a few segments...two which were really cool ...cena rapping on christian and guerrero stealing flairs number 30 entry ticket. the event was good 7/10 would have got a 9 if cena won but unfortunately my biggest enemy batista wins(though i understood why) ..vince comes down and takes a drop and the whole arena crack up in laughter.

the 2005 edition of the royal rumble came live from the save mart centre in fresno, california. the two top championships of the wwe were being defended, the undertaker was battling heidenreich in a casket match, shawn michaels was taking on edge in a grudge match that had been building up since last october and of course the every man for himself over the top rope royal rumble match itself. who was going to take the price this year? chris benoit? edge? eddie guerrero? edge? john cena? batista? edge? shawn michaels? there was no shortage of contenders.it was batista that picked up the popular victory in the main event battle but not without controversy, or should i say, a botched finish. batista and john cena were the final two men in the ring. batista was supposed to dump the young smackdown! star over the top rope but it all went wrong and they both went toppling to the floor. the referees acted on their feet as we had an arm-raising contest similar to that of bret hart and lex luger back in 1994. this brought out the chairman of the board. vinnie mac walked down to the ring the way only he can but injured himself badly getting into the ring. it was unusual to see vince mcmahon sitting, legs out, telling the two men to restart the match. batista then did was he was supposed to do first time round and dumped cena to the floor sealing his own future with a championship match at wrestlemania 21.the undercard for this years royal rumble had a very solid line up, with many of wwe's biggest stars competing in matches. each brand had two big matches each.raw opened the night with the match between shawn michaels and edge. this was a good technical contest. back and fourth all the way until edge got the pinfall. this was a smart booking decision and kept edge as a contender to the world heavyweight championship.the second match of the night was the feud ending casket match between the undertaker and heidenreich. the match was not a classic, but then again have their been any classic casket matches? it was entertaining. especially when snitsky got involved and then kane popped out the casket to a great pop. the undertaker surprised no one when he got the win, slamming the lid on heidenreich and this mediocre feud.the first of the two championship matches of the night was john bradshaw layfields defence of the wwe championship in a triple threat match against both kurt angle and the big show. this match was very good. again, not a classic but entertaining none the less. jbl took the win after pinning kurt angle. his celebration was short lived however when backstage teddy long informed him at no way out he would defend the wwe championship in a barbed wire steel cage match against big show. not a very nice way to spend a sunday night.and of course there is no show without punch. punch of course being reigning world heavyweight champion triple h. his rematch from unforgiven 2004 with randy orton was lot better than the original encounter. it's a pity because they just don't seem to click to well in the ring and this would be an excellent feud if they did. orton played the concussion role very well and went down in defeat to the game.so the first big one of 2005 was a good one. it achieved its goals. feuds ended and new ones began. we were now officially on the road to wrestlemania 21.

i have enjoyed both of the van dykes over the years and was glad to watch them again.just as cute and funny and easy to watch and enjoy.dick was good when he was younger but i enjoyed him more as he got older.son berry has been a great one to follow in his fathers footsteps.together they make a great team and work well together.i am disappointed that i have not found another murder 101 listed anywhere.i have seen both of the ones that have been shown. i am hoping for more as it is really an enjoyable duo to watch.you can sure tell berry follows in his dad footsteps, they talk alike and have the same mannerisms.would enjoy anything they do separately.will be sure to watch anything they do alone and together.

if you enjoyed the tv series, diagnosis murder, you'll love murder 101. it's great to see dick van dyke in a murder mystery again. if we're lucky, this one will be a start of a tv series or at least series of movies.this movie definitely had some great and notable actors filling the roles. but, it didn't feel like a "face" movie. it was really a story that drew you in making you forget about the fame of those on the screen.i made a guess as to the ending and was so pleasantly surprised at the end that i had to watch it again! this is a must see for any mystery buff or dick van dyke lover!

this was essentially a remake of "diagnosis murder" minus victoria rowell, scott baio & charlie schlatter. dick is playing a college professor who teaches criminology 101 and can't even find his own classroom. barry is now a private eye, not related to dick. this lets barry shoot at guys speeding away from him, which a cop can not do. barry still gets the girl in the end. tracey needham portrays the girl. she is the prime suspect and dick and barry believe she's innocent and prove it. that's all the spoiler you get. the ending is sufficiently unexpected that you don't already know it half way through the movie.don't take it seriously. don't critique it. just sit back and enjoy dick and barry van dyke.

a bunch of full-length movies featuring the muppets, created by jim henson & co, have been made, but "the muppet movie" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features "the great muppet caper" and "the muppets take manhattan". it was released seven years before i was born, so i obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did i get to see its two successors when they were first released). however, i saw a lot of the muppets during my childhood, mostly after henson's premature death in 1990. i finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack. unsurprisingly, i liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.one day, while kermit the frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing "rainbow connection", a hollywood agent named bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in tinseltown. kermit takes his advice and goes west. he soon meets fozzie bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along. the frog is also noticed by doc hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants kermit to be his mascot. as a frog, kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with fozzie. on their road trip across the country, kermit and fozzie meet other muppets who join them, including miss piggy (who soon becomes kermit's love interest) and gonzo. unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to hollywood, doc hopper, assisted by max, is willing to do anything to force kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so kermit finds himself in increasing danger! one thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and i can understand why. there is, of course, the oscar-nominated "rainbow connection" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as kermit and fozzie's catchy road song, "movin' right along", and "i'm going to go back there someday", a poignant ballad sung by gonzo. "never before, never again", the song miss piggy sings when she first sees kermit, is the only one i would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden. the muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on tv, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them. some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as dom deluise as bernie the agent and steve martin as the "insolent waiter." also, it's not 100% comedy. there are serious parts of the film which they also did well.watching this original muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing "muppets from space" (one of the muppet movies made after henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year. i was very disappointed when i saw that film, which had never happened before when i watched any film or tv show featuring the popular puppet characters! not only is that movie not very funny, i also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the muppets, as i stated in my review of it! however, i can't say i think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier. "the muppet movie" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable. i highly doubt there's much left to say about "the muppet movie" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment.

psycho criminal pure by carl schenkel, who is active in hollywood, like mrs soutendijk. goetz george and hannes jaenicke are stealing the spectator's last peace of snugness. they are too able, how can i get calm into a lift next time ?

admittedly, there are some scenes in this movie that seem a little unrealistic. the ravishing woman first panics and then, only a few minutes later, she starts kissing the young lad while the old guy is right next to her. but as the film goes along we learn that she is a little volatile girl (or slut) and that partly explains her behavior. the cinematography of this movie is well done. we get to see the elevator from almost every angle and perspective, and some of those images and scenes really raise the tension. götz george plays his character well, a wannabe hot-shot getting old and being overpowered by young men like the jaennicke character. wolfgang kieling who i admired in hitchcock's the torn curtain delivers a great performance that, although he doesn't say much, he is by far the best actor in this play. one critic complained about how unrealistic the film was and that in a real case of emergency nothing would really happen. but then again, how realistic are films such as mission impossible or phone booth. given the fact that we are talking about a movie here, and that in a movie you always have to deal with some scenes that aren't very likely to occur in real life, you can still enjoy this movie. it's a lot better than many things that i see on german tv these days and i think that the vintage 80's style added something to this film.

i must i was a little skeptical when i entered the cinema to watch oss117 : french comedies tend to be so self-satisfied nowadays that only the most stupid ones score high at the national box-office. but i was surprised that though the humor does not always reach the level of the monthy pythons, the many references to the french's vision of the world in the 1950, which oss117 represents, are hilarious et the director managed to recreate film-making style of that time with an astonishing fidelity. to put it short, a bit of a good surprise, not to mention the excellent performances from various secondary actors. and at least for once, jean dujardin's style (which can get on many people's nerves) complies perfectly with the character he plays.

what a pleasure. this is really a parody. only french people can do that kind of thing without being coarse. and as a result, you spend a really good time watching jean dujardin playing the dumb. most of the movie stands on his shoulders, and he has them wide enough to make this movie a good one. he has the perfect way of overdoing the james bond kind of guy that he is no match for mike meyers in austin powers for example. the dialogs are also good enough to keep up the attention of the spectator, with a lot of stupid jokes, that's really perfect. both of the women having the main parts in the movie bear the comparison with the main character, and that was a challenge. there is no really plot in this movie, but that's not what is expected in this kind of movie. you just wish to laugh one hour 40 minutes, and that's precisely what the movie manage to do. it deserves the success it has in france

if you're going to spoof james bond it's a brilliant idea to find a leading man who resembles both sean connery and leonard rossiter so step forward jean dujardin who captures perfectly the connery sneer that masquerades as a smile plus the self-delusion of rossiter thinking he is suave. dujardin plays it like a clouseau who can hold his own at karate. the plot has him looking for our man in schtook who has disappeared mysteriously and includes such improbabilities as a nazi cell concealed inside a pyramid. if there is a jarring note it is the leading lady, berenice bejo who has all the sensuality of a suet pudding and is eclipsed - but only just - by aure atika. it's good for one viewing but that's about it.

it's a deeply stupid humor... but i loved it. jean dujardin is a great actor in this movie. bérénice béjo is cute. it makes fun of all the secret agents like james bond: refreshing!!! it's probably the most hilarious movie i've ever seen. i already saw it three times and i still want to see it again. buy the dvd as soon as you can. you won't regret it. it's the kind of movie in which you don't need to have a great scenario because it's a parody. the only defect is that oss 117 is too short. it's a jewel. it's not really frequent to see a french movie get success in the usa but i think that this one has everything to succeed. trust me!!!

pretty amusing spoof with great attention to detail re: the look of the 1960s spy films and the way the action was staged back then. the fight sequence in the hotel room was a hoot and the casting was perfect with a peter lorre lookalike added to the mix of villains. a big plus: jean dujardin is hot and the scene in which he is tied up without a shirt was a highlight. plus his eyebrows deserve some sort of recognition for doing a great job. funny aside: the people behind me in the theater kept gasping after every plot twist as if they were watching a 'real' spy thriller.before the movie started, a trailer for "get smart" was screened. the preview made the movie look embarrassingly bad with lame attempts to incorporate the jokes and gags from the tv series. looks like a bomb and quite a contrast to the comparatively sublime jokes and gags of oss 117, though, of course, oss had its share of misfires. the overall tone of oss, however, was not an insult to the audience's intelligence, and the material didn't feel as it had been 'dumbed down.' i did get the distinct impression that if i understood the language, i would have caught more of the jokes, and one in particular (the pistol gag) was mishandled in the interpretation for the subtitles.

i have always loved the muppets. though most children's entertainment then wasn't that likable, the muppet's was. the muppet's are very, very funny. they are probably the most likable children's characters ever. not only did the muppets have their own show. they also have starred in many films. from the muppet's christmas carol to the muppet's treasure island. the first muppet's movie, the muppet movie, was also, like the show and the other films, excellent.the muppet movie is about how they all got started. kermit the frog used to live in a swamp. until one day a movie executive tells him that there are auditions for frogs in hollywood. so kermit takes off for hollywood. along the way he runs into lots of people such as fozzie bear, gonzo the great, and miss piggy. also, an evil man is trying to capture kermit.all of the muppet films are highly enjoyable. i mean they are all very funny. this film has many film appearances. such as steve martin, mel brooks, elliot gould, carol kane, richard pryor, and orson welles. the muppet films are all very enjoyable. i hear that jason segel is going to star in one soon. i can't wait to see it.

i have not seen this movie since 1979 when i was a teenager. i grew up with the sesame street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing these characters to life. jim hensen was a genius and master muppeteer. when i watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when i was younger and things seemed so much simpler. for this bit of time travel i rate this movie a 10.the plot line explores how kermit goes from the swamp to hollywood. the laughs and gags are classic muppetism. i am glad these films are still around for the next generation. i hope i never out grow the magic of the muppets.

this film is one of my fondest childhood memories. seeing the muppets (at the height of their popularity) heading hollywood, singing and dancing, with miss piggy googely-eying her beloved kermit, fozzie bear doing his best as everyone's manager, and a generous cast of "extras" delivering a film that turned out to be "okey dokey".kermit's melancholy ukulele number "rainbow connection" was nominated for an oscar that year, but was beat out by norma rae's "it goes like it goes". i'll pick kermit's song any day! get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasy...someday they'll find it, the rainbow connections, the lovers, the dreamers and me!

the first feature length muppet movie, and excepting maybe the muppet christmas carol, the movie puppeteers the world over are still looking for as a guide. disney has done the muppets a dis-service and this movie proves it over and over again. featuring classic comedians and guest star cameos, keeps to a simple but original plot, classic muppet lame jokes, paul williams genius in song writing, and electric mayhem madness, and comes off with an amazing movie especially when you realize that the major cast are puppets. only croft has come close to hensen's genius with puppets. half of the fun today is playing is that cameo actor/actress still alive???? i can only hope frank oz and dave goelz and the rest of the surviving muppeteers can somehow rescue and revive kermit and company from the deadly grasp of disney.

who doesn't love the muppets?! impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm, fuzzy feeling inside. so, i guess what's important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special. i don't remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film i recall quite fondly. in fact, there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self-conscious in any bad way. refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique; the "magic" transcends all that other stuff. 'tis indeed what movies are made of.so, how does the film achieve these things? hmmm, nice question! stumped am i? let's see. really, i feel like it's quite simple. the filmmakers believe in their material and don't take themselves too seriously in the process. i probably wouldn't say the film has many truly inspired moments, but it does have a certain life to it (that funnily enough a great many "real people" movies lack). a zest. you really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures. they also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearing.generally i get the impression that the people that made the movie just weren't afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel. kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session. lots of talent, little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through. the cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance. maybe i don't feel i have much to say about it because i was half-asleep when i saw it (and/or as i write this review). anyway, i'm sort of semi-repeating myself here but i really liked the sense of family the movie had. full of love i suppose you might say. again, a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly.and to repeat myself once more, one of the film's best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. like the nathaniel hawthorne quote about happiness being (like) a butterfly, so the muppet movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so. same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that. anyway, if that sounds sappy, i also reckon it was pretty hilarious.so, all in all, this movie was very funny, touching and difficult not to smile along to. plus it features lots of great music! highly recommended to all humans, both the young and the young at heart.

well as you can see, i got to this party quite late but, have the advantage of reading all the previous entries before making my comments. i found this site by happen chance, when i was looking for other marine corps films. so, let me start by telling you that i played a marine boot in the movie, pvt. labarsky, and was stationed at mcrdep, san diego at the time. jack webb and his crew selected 15 permanent personnel, of which some of us had the speaking parts, and another 15 marines that had just completed boot camp. that made up the platoon and the marines who portrayed the various "dis". to the best of my recollection, the capt. and pvt. owens (don dubbins) were not in the marines. we spent about three weeks up in hollywood (studio city film lot), ca shooting the section of the movie that we were involved with, and then they completed the other shots after we left.so as i ramble along here, let me clarify some of what has been questioned in previous entries as best i can. "cuff daddy" was commenting about the ability of our platoon to yell "yes sir" without moving and etc,, yes we did the yelling for the sound guys, and it was while shooting the scene. as you fellow marines remember, when the di or who ever started to ask a question and before they completed it, you had already taken your breath of air enabling you to yell at the top of your lungs the proper response. that is how it was done."74sooner" commented about walking through the same building at paris island, however, as i mentioned earlier all the scenes were shot in studio city, ca . they were built from photos taken at paris island and from on site trips and marine advisers from paris island. sorry, you were in the real buildings, not the sets."schappe1" brought up many good points, but, about the incident with the platoon at paris island at the time all that jack webb said to us was, "the movie came about because of the accident, and the marine corps didn't want to put out anything that would impact any of the family members of the marines that died that night. although, the marine corps would provide any marines and assistance needed for a movie answering to the public why a marine di does what he does".as mentioned by a few of you, i also at the time we were shooting the scenes caught my self thinking this dialog has been cleaned up to much and obviously isn't how it goes down in real life. back in the 50's,that is how it had to be done.one story i would like to pass on is about the interaction that occurred between us marines and the movie crew, and between the movie crew and jack webb. from the start by custom the marines replied "yes sir" to anybody that moved. going into the second week it was getting more common to hear "yes sir" coming from all directions. on stage someone would bark out a request for something to be done with the lighting and from out of nowhere up on a catwalk above the set a reply of "yes sir" would sound out. to all of this at one of our informal gatherings, jack webb stated. "if i had known that i would have gotten this much respect from this crew, i would have brought you guys up here years ago." there was a lt. brought up from san diego to play the role of the di from the other platoon and the one jack webb fights with, but during one shooting secessions he was up to take number 32, and still webb kept trying to work him through how he wanted it done and didn't show any lack of patience with him. the next day they used the paris island adviser who was a di sgt. from paris island and he worked out fine.at the time i was somewhat of a camera buff and got to know the still camera man to get some pointer from him and as it turned out he would give me still shots and some of the 35mm film of the daily shooting that were not going to be used. those film strips i cut up and made slides out of them. after the movie came out in vhs tape (the di, 11706 b&w/106 min.) my kids and the grand kids have a blast when they try to se who can find me the most times on the screen.

i was a marine at camp pendleton when the d.i. came out (1st marine division, 11th marine regiment, 3rd battalion, i-battery). i still remember standing in line with a bunch of other marines to see the movie at the "star" theater in oceanside, california.we did not remotely expect the movie to portray everything we experienced in boot camp but we were all pleasantly surprised at how well done the movie was. the idea of using real marines in the movie was a great idea (i believe they were all real drill instructors too). as good an actor as jack webb was, he just couldn't "call cadence" like a real marine drill instructor.all of us got a laugh when the "problem" recruit's mother came to boot camp to talk to the captain. never in a million years would this have happened, but that's hollywood, and we didn't let that episode keep us from enjoying the movie.i went through boot camp at mcrd in san diego during the summer of 1956, and at that time there was virtually no limits as to what the d.i.'s could do to you. the "ribbon creek" event at parris island had not yet affected boot camp, at least not at mcrd - san diego.i agree with what a lot of the other reviewers have commented on concerning sgt. moore's "stiffness" around his girl friend. i believe this was just webb's acting style, and although they could have deleted this part of the movie, it didn't really hurt the production that much.one minor note, the character (uncredited) of "pvt. rodriguez" was played by one of my drill instructors, sgt. peter j. o'neill. sgt. o'neill used to tell us that some day he wanted to be an actor. we secretly laughed at this, but he surprised us all. he was a great drill instructor, and i thought he did well in his bit part. also, he really did enjoy throwing knives. he often demonstrated his skill to us that summer in boot camp. i have often wondered if he is still alive.

the d.i. (4 outta 5 stars) wow, i certainly did not expect to be enjoying this movie as much as i did. i had never even heard of it until i saw it sitting in the discount video bin one day. i figured jack webb playing an army drill instructor might be good for a chuckle but figured the drama would pale in comparison to such recent movie d.i.s as portrayed in "full metal jacket" or "an officer and a gentleman". boy, was i wrong. this is probably the best work webb has ever done... far and away better than his one-note "dragnet" performances. the delivery of his tough guy dialogue is just brilliant... done in his patented deadpan monotone and yet you *know* that the guy means every word of it. the story might seem a little hokey compared to the grittier military movies that have followed but i still found the movie fascinating and compelling. even a completely unnecessarily musical interlude in an army nightclub had me hooked. anyone know where i can get a copy of that terrific ray coniff song "if'n you don't, somebody else will"? webb plays the toughest dang drill instructor ever... and he's under pressure to kick out the deadbeat private owen but, by golly, he sees a man buried somewhere in that sissyboy and he's gonna drag him out kicking and screaming! great stuff!

i had the good fortune to be at perris island in the fall of 1959. the di showed one evening at the outdoor theater directly in front of our barracks, plt 162, b co, 1st bn, 1st itr.although we hadn't been there long enough to even think about seeing a movie, we could hear those that were laughing. it's one of the many indelible memories of my thirteen weeks at pi.at some later date, i got to actually see it in a theater. i'm still convinced that, to date, it remains the most realistic portrayal of the experience in the late 1950's ever done. no one has done it better than jack webb...

jack webb is riveting as a marine corp drill instructor in the d.i.. webb play sgt.jim moore, a tough but fair marine whose job it is to prepare young teens for possible combat. no one could have played this role any better that jack webb. as a former marine,i can assure that this is the most accurate film dealing with basic training in the corp. extremely entertaining!

of course i'm a bit prejudiced but for the time it was the most accurate portrayal of marines ever shown on the big screen.i was at camp pendleton undergoing infantry training when webb brought his crew down to film some outdoor scenes and our company was asked to participate. it took about two or three days as best i can recall.webb and don dubbins were serious and businesslike.during the filming of our short scene--which seemed to take forever to an 18 year old--webb was very conscientious about getting things (marine things) right and he did a good job with one exception--that scene where a recruit was wearing sunglasses. never happen for a host of reasons.i have a video of the movie and will bore my grandkids anytime i can make them sit still for a few seconds as i show them their papaw when he was a young stud and part of the world's greatest fighting force (no brag, just fact).what amazed me then was how well the real marines carried out their acting roles. that was before i realized that dis have to have some acting genes to get their job done. the only film i've seen since that is the equal of the di is the first half of full metal jacket and that part is superior only because of the foul language. when the di was made, cursing wasn't allowed on screen. despite the lack of profanity, it's still a great movie to rent.ooooo-rahhhhhh!!!!!semper fi, do or die

'rejseholdet' is one of the best new danish tv-series that i have watched.the series is about the danish police force's unit 1 - a kinda fbi-style team that help solve murder cases all over the country, and the cases they work on, plus the influence that their jobs have on their personal lives, and the price they sometimes has to pay to be a part of a top police team.i didn't expect much when i started watching this series - i was pleasantly surprised, the series is exciting, sometimes fun, it's got both drama and suspense, i love it.

this production, build on real danish crime stories, is a experience through excellent directing, acting on all levels and has a nerve not often seen in crime series. every episode is a thrill because it's seems like the hole team believe that "this is my life right now - this murder or murders are my responsibility to solve" and the output is brilliant.as a viewer, you just have this wonderfully filling of being entertained cause it feels like their focus, on purpose or not, lie on that they wont you to have a good time...:o) don't miss this one, it's just right under 'band of brothers' quality and is a "must have seen" experience - what a wonderful crime time !

this is one of the best non-english series i have seen. it weaves interesting single and double episodes of crime-solving together with a personal aspect that you just don't get in csi. the individual characters all have personal lives that combine well with their day job and occasionally interfere. additionally the characters all manage to naturally evolve throughout the episodes.the casting is superb and it was taped all over denmark, giving a good example of the highlights that majestic country has to offer. unfortunately only 32 episodes were made, however they are top-notch television. here's hoping they consider making some more episodes of the same caliber.

first off, i'm an american -- i haven't seen any comments on imdb about this series yet from a u.s. viewer. secondly, i work in the television business in development. so i wallow in much of the sludge that comes out of american broadcast programming. "unit one" is an example of television that's a throwback to what i would attribute as '70s-style scripting, feature-wise. namely, those films made by young autueurs who had free rein to make the dramas feel more realistic and to allow for organic character development. it tacks more along the lines of stellar british dramas like "cracker" and "prime suspect" as well as australia's brilliant "underbelly." "unit one" features stand-alone cases that are committed, then solved, each week. the mysteries aren't extraordinary or particularly byzantine. they usually center around one single twist, clocking in generally at the 40 minute mark, and resolution is neatly wrapped up in the 15 minutes thereafter. what makes this series a breath of fresh air is that it features main characters that you are hooked on and find relatable by episode 2. these are real, breathing, alive characters that have personal baggage, yet it's not a talky, batty type of baggage that american flotsam such as "grey's anatomy" or "desperate housewives" spoons out. these are realistic individuals whose backstories unfold leisurely over the course of the series, as if you work with them on a daily basis. after the mindless decade of "csi's," "ncis's," and "criminal minds," along with their subsequent spawns, it's refreshing to actually sit down to watch friends you want to spend time with, as is the case with "unit one." the quippy banter, the unemotional wooden dialogue, and the over-the-top jeopardy that those american series i mentioned bludgeon us with each week are absurd compared to the nuance and the quiet resonance you get with this remarkable danish series. i'm on episode 7 of the first season, but i've already bought all four seasons and am in for the long haul. if you need explosions and farcically-hopped up testosterone, along with music by the who and fast-cutting, neon-lit, jittery palsy-cam action with cipher-like main characters as your main diet of television drama viewing, i suggest you stay away from this series. if you are an adult with a hunger for subtle, poignant, thoughtful and, yes, sometimes straight-forward procedural crime dramas, i urge you to check this show out.

we've just watched the last of the series shown on the sbs network and will miss our weekly dose of danish delight. my wife and i picked up the show after the swedish show "the eagle" finished and it seemed by comparison to be a very poor substitute for our then favourite show on tv. week by week, however, the show grew on me, and whilst not as glossy as the swedish show and definitely grittier in terms of their investigations of everyday crimes, it certainly provided a very satisfying weekly viewing meal indeed.prior to these 2 shows i had not really been a fan of the cop genre and can't say i am now but the 2 scandinavian shows really provided us with an insight into life in those northern euopean countries through the eyes of their special policing units.

have just seen the last episode, no 32, (though the site says only 30 episodes were made) and i must comment on the fact that this series was really very good and i would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys crime/cop stories. supposedly all 32 were based on fact with information at the end of each episode of the court sentences imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes, this has at times been a gritty, well acted, believable and dare i say, entertaining series. the fact that the powers in denmark decided to disband the unit was almost unbelievable as they did their work so well and in the series at least, never failed to "get their man"! it's a definite 10/10 for me.

i watched this movie when it was released and being really young and not too much into cinema it was one of the most fascinating cinematic experiences i ever had and it really left a mark inside me.at first i didn't quite understand the story and probably failed to make the necessary correlations between past and present as the movie presents them to the viewer.years after i first watched i managed to watch it again and this was the time that i fell in love with 'the english patient', it touched me so deeply and for me it became the best film ever made.anthony minghella made an absolutely stunning film, all the locations are amazing and through his camera he manages to create unbelievable emotions inside you.of course, the music of the film is such a big part of the whole emotional journey of the characters and the film would not be the same without it.but personally the best thing was the fragile performance that ralph fiennes gave in this masterpiece. he plays so well the man that falls in love slowly but so deeply with katherine clifton,opens up his heart and dives into this prohibited affair.the most heart-breaking scene for me will always be the one where hurt katherine is carried by almasy towards the cave of swimmers and she wears the thimble that he bought her.she says 'i always wore it.i always loved you' and at that moment he starts crying with such pain flowing from inside him.juliette binoche is also amazing in her performance and really deserved the oscar she won.overall, this is a film that anybody who proclaims himself a cinema lover should watch in their lives.

i won't go to a generalization, and say it's the best love story of all time, as some have said. that's fine, people feel very deeply about this film, you either love it i believe...or you simply hate it. i don't want to say, the best of all,because that is simply too 'broad' for me to make a statement like that. however, i feel very passionately about the english patient, as well as millions of other people do. the awards say it all. i don't agree with critics, on many levels, however, the ones that picked this one, i couldn't agree more.9-oscars. 41-wins.37-other nominations, makes this love story,on the top of the bunch. from the director, anthony minghella, the story that bursts onto the screen and as mr. peterman (from t.v.s seinfeld) said, "elaine, i simply can't take my eyes off of it!" in this instance, i don't agree with elaine's response. but the story builds and takes the right time, needed to make it's case beautifully. the cinematography,(john seale) won multiple awards as well, as it ought too. i have not really paid much attention to juliette binoche, until now. well, not entirely true i loved her performance in "sabrina" lovely story of a somewhat complicated relationship, next to harrison ford. but this was simply an incredibly differing character for her, and as deeply talented as she is, she simply shined in her own subtle and graceful way, she was just what this film was looking for, i'm truly glad that it was her performance and not another actress. ralph fiennes, was also spectacular in portraying count laszlo de almasy. i had a new respect for his ability, after seeing this one! what can you say except, see this picture again. (*****)

i was "turned on" to this movie by my flight instructor and now i wonder how the heck it was out there for nearly five years before i finally discovered it. if you have any love of flying at all, especially an attachment to the planes of wwii, this is an absolute must see, vastly superior to the pathetic "pearl harbor" and up there in rivalry with the famed "battle of britain" filmed more than thirty years ago. there are moments when you feel as if you are flying wingman, literally dodging the shell casings of your leader as you roll in on a me 109 or he 111. as an historian this film deeply touched me as well for it is about the plight endured by tens of thousands of gallant poles, hungarians, slovaks and czechs who in 1939-1940 fled their homelands, made it to england, fought with utmost bravery for the survival of western civilization, and then were so callously abandoned by "us" after the war when they were arrested by the communists upon their return to their native lands. i have stood atop monte cassino in italy and was moved to tears by the cemetery for the polish troops that stormed that mountain that british and americans could not take. i have traveled as well to prague (the most beautiful of cities) and studied their history. their story of abandonment, i believe, should be a lesson to us even today about obligations to gallant allies. but back to the film. if you love flying, see this. if you are interested in the aircraft of wwii most definitely see it. without doubt the most brutal, direct, and frightfully swift air combat scenes ever replicated for film. and yes, if you even are seeking a touching romance, there is that as well in heartbreaking detail.bill forstchen professor of history co-owner of a wwii replica "warbird" p-51 mustang "gloria ann"

this is a brilliant, lavish czech film from the sverak father and son team, all about two czech pilots who flee to england to help the raf in the battle of britain but who also fall out over a woman (the beautiful tara fitzgerald). features some excellent and incredibly realistic aerial combat scenes  probably the best ever and much better than pearl harbour or even the film battle of britain - and a number of interesting general themes such as love, war, romance, comradeship, loss and servitude. also, the trials and tribulations of moving abroad and learning a foreign language (though made easier here with the great stalwart anna massey).the film has some great little motifs such as the world famous raf bullseye device, shown throughout and at one point nicely reflected in the black vinyl record, spinning around cutely (music is another theme of the film, of course). plus, all of the traditional icons of english life: dimpled beer glasses (unlike the post-war straight glasses used in pearl harbour), tea in a nice china tea set in an english country garden (though shot in the czech republic?), the mascot dog, a vintage bottle of hp sauce, even a darts board!of course, the airfield and surrounding countryside is ridiculously unlike anywhere in the south of england, though the virtuouso aerial sequences make up for this, showing eastbourne and the seven sisters, always synonomous with southern england and the battle of britain. but best of all is the sensational musical score from ondrej soukup, as good as anything from hans zimmer yet all in the tradition of the late, excellent ron goodwin who scored the original battle of britain film amongst other classic english war films. there's even a nice little cameo role for the  apparently  famous czech musician and actor (and kevin kline lookalike) oldrich kaiser, who plays on the piano the title theme song, dark blue sky. excellent!it's got a few smutty yet funny little freudian devices too, such as always showing an inflated condom floating by the ceiling whenever karel (the callow but brilliant krystof hadek) is stuck at the airfield while his love rival and fellow pilot frantisek (ondrej vetchy) is with susan.another great english actor in this film! charles dance is of course fine as wing commander bentley.highly recommended and well worth watching/hiring  get the dvd with special features (stuff like how they created the dog fights and stuff). probably the only film ever to combine subtitles with characters speaking english, german, french and czech all at once.

i'm czech and soldiers (not only pilots) who escaped czechoslovakia after nazi's invasion in 1939 and fought against them abroad are true heroes and bravest men in our history for me. this movie from director of academy award winner "kolya" (1996) is a tribute to these men. it's first big-screen movie about czechoslovak wwii soldiers since "nebesti jezdci" (1968). i think "dark blue world" is a good movie - good acting, good special effects, nice music etc. movie is half in english and some actors are britons. but greatest thing about this movie is it's pure existence. it's great chance to show people all around the world (and to many people in czech republic too...) that czechoslovak role in wwii was not only as occupied country but as an active member of allied campaign.leading characters are older and wiser frantisek and young karel. they escaped together from czechoslovakia, they are flying in the same squadron and they fell in love with the same woman... maybe it's a cliché but fortunately this storyline is not so aggressive and is in good balance with other scenes (including great dogfights). i don't want to compare "dark blue world" with "pearl harbor", someone will like ph more and someone will like dbw. but if you like happy ends, dbw is not for you. so, i think it's very good movie for everyone who likes this type of stories and very good movie who wants to get to know something about this chapter of czechoslovak history.btw, main theme "dark blue world" is from czech 30's and 40's composer jaroslav jezek. he wrote this theme when he lost his eyes...

sleeper cell attempts to swim both sides of the pool (terrorism/patriotic muslim americans), and it does neither very well.i had put off watching this show for a very long time, because i had a feeling it would be too predictable, but after a year in my netflix queue, i finally moved it up to the front.the show is about an undercover muslim man working for the fbi in an attempt to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the united states. the undercover agent in the show actually is a muslim, so we see his conflict/resolution between his patriotism and his religious beliefs. personally i would have rather watched a drama about a muslin american family living in the united states, but it is doubtful that an america tv channel (cable or network) will ever produce anything that shows muslims in a flattering light.i am not a muslim, but i have a lot of muslim american friends, and i can honestly say that none of them are terrorists and they all love america.sleeper cell comes close to busting stereotypes of muslims, but it also focuses on the worse muslim stereotypes. in the first episode we see an "honor killing," which is a very poor portrayal of islam, but in the 3rd episode we see a very respected moderate muslim scholar teaching the viewer that the real jihad is actually a personal struggle that is not meant to incite violence towards others.if only the moderate muslim scholar had been the main character of the show.americans need to learn a lot more about islam, sleeper cell helps a little bit, but it comes up far short of giving the america audience what it really needs to knows.that said, the acting in this show is superb, and the drama is extremely engrossing. if only they had made this show about islam in america without the terrorism, it would have been first rate.

to be completely honest, i completely intrigued by the original concept of 'sleeper cell.' having watched the best part of the series on fx channel (uk), my sky got broke meaning i missed the crucial finale. but what i did see of it, i assumed it to be a great story line, good acting and as i don't watch '24' i thought it was great, and it's been confirmed for a second season...one of the best tv programs i have seen. much more realistic and believable than "24." excellent character development and plot line. does not bash islam, but gives a thoughtful and considered approach, showing the difference between radical terrorist islam and true islam. everybody should see this show!stringy xx

nice description of the situation in the us, it explains different kinds of islam, not just show terrorist and extremist. islam can be other thing that killing, they show why some people become terrorist and how to be muslim without being extremist. it is a great series that muslims and no-muslims should see. now we hope that other series or films will be done to change the idea of all muslims are terrorist and all americans want to destroy islam. it gave me the interest to discover what islam is exactly and what the us and also european government do to help cohabitation between people of different religion.

the problem with this series is that it is too real. i am watching it on amazon "unbox" and having just finished episode 2 i hate, absolutely hate, fark, the leader of the cell. i cannot recall any television series ever having this emotional impact. remember the old tag line for horror movies "just keep telling yourself its only a movie"? well i find myself repeatedly reminding myself that its "only tv". but of course it isn't only tv is it? the possibility of a cell such as the one portrayed here actually operating in the united states is certainly within the range of plausibility. that's what gives this program its vicious authenticity. and that's why i hate it so much.

a scarily real drama, there isn't another drama out there that has scared the crap out of me like this has, the characters are not your typical islamic terrorist, you have a blonde haired, blue eyed guy who is as dumb as he looks, he is a converted muslim. a well respected business man, who pretends to be jewish and a frenchman who has converted to islam, but has clearly taken the word of the koran to a whole new level. the hero of the plot is darwyn, who is an undercover fbi agent who has infiltrated the terrorist cell, and has to do all sorts of god awful things to prevent himself from being detected. the first episode is a small taste of what's to follow. although it is about islamic terrorists the drama has a unique way of pointing out that not all muslims are extremists, which is comforting to those concerned with racism, considering half the terrorist cell are islam converts, it makes you think that maybe they are the ones to be afraid of. the most chilling drama i've ever seen. the reason its so chilling is cause you never know who your friends, your husband or your neighbours really are. terrorists can be anyone, anywhere, anytime.

i have found this show by accident and was surprised to find out that nobody i know has ever heard of it. this was by far one of the best shows i have seen in months if not years and i cannot wait for more episodes to come out. sleeper cell portrays a psychological struggle of an undercover agent inside of a terrorist cell who has to constantly make difficult decisions in order to maintain his cover while staying true to his real cause. this is an extremely well done show. it keeps you intrigued from the first episode till the end and though progressing slowly, is fast enough for you to feel on the edge. quite realistic and humane, it touches on important topics and every episode presents an interesting question to ponder about. this show is not 24 or any of the cop shows on tv and is not trying to be anything either. it is genuine and unique. it is a show about a human being, his difficult choices and his life of struggle where a simple mistake can cost him everything.i gave this show a 10 for great storyline, good progression, excellent cinematography, excellent music and realistic characters each with a story to tell.

imagine "24" completely uncensored, given free license to explain the situation in any detail needed and showing how and why both protagonists do what they do to kill/prevent and you have an idea of how good this tv series is. people in the us have known for a long time that showtime is the new hbo, they are making far better cutting edge, powerful shows and this is no exception. the show takes the viewer all the way through the creation of a sleeper cell to when an attack is attempted, taking in important facets such as faith, religion, funding, means and needs. to the uninitiated, there is much to be learnt about the muslim faith here. unlike on mainstream shows like "24" where the terrorists are merely nutcases who the good guys shoot, their purpose and reasonings here are fully examined. what gives the show more credence is the latest technology the cell/fbi uses and the authentic shots in europe, the us and the middle east, no expense is spared to tell the story accurately the cast are relatively unknowns but the acting is superb with the aid of a tautly-written script that constantly keeps the viewer on edge with many unexpected twists and turns. this show has not got the credit it deserves and ironically is a bit of a sleeper hit itself, must see for anyone at all interested in this genre

smartly written, well acted, intense and suspenseful. this show lives in the real world, not as fantastical as is "24",(and i am a huge fan of 24,incidentally). it has believable characters and in many ways is much smarter than most in this genre. it tries to present both sides of islam. so far, i have watched the first 4 episodes and find the story to be more evenly balanced. the terrorists are more complex and not one dimensional. and as a result of that balance, the terrorists become more frightening than the typical villains being portrayed in film and on television. last but not least, the hero is truly heroic without being a cartoon. i recommend this show for anyone who is a fan of 24 and the like.

if you watch this series you will get an interesting 10 chapters about a sleeper cell's story and each characters. and more intense with a fbi's infiltrate.nice story, nice characters and performs, but something is wrong (for me, of course). the final is wrong. you wait ten chapters hoping a great final (it doesn't matters if they fulfill its objectives or not) but.. well... i think is not enough. its a small final for a big series. also i hoped more definitions about characters stories.but, i repeat, it's and interesting miniseries. if you don't want to wait with large series (22-24 chapters), watch it. i give 7 of 10.

i'm not sure how this could have been better, so i gave it a 10. the acting was excellent - the main woman was so hot - the chap who played darwyn was a smouldering, pensive character who showed the inner turmoil he was suffering (the truck driver's death is one example)excellently. the storyline was believable and the series length was just about right (i.e. i love lost, but will it ever end?). as a brit i tend to think of yanks as gung ho. the lapd were in their ill advised attempts to arrest him, but the other agencies were portrayed positively. my main thought about programmes like this (and the also excellent 24) is - could it happen? would it happen? is it happening now? possibly, probably.i hope they do another series, but after reading some of the previous comments, it would appear not.to summarise - if you haven't seen it, make sure you do.

*be warned of possible spoilers*a friend told me to check out this series, and i'm glad i took her words for it.i read the synopsis on the dvd cover and i was immediately intrigued. the main protagonist is muslim? no way, this is a first! it's about an fbi agent who is under deep cover to penetrate a possible sleeper cell in la; and get this - he is a practicing muslim. i was a little skeptical at first, half-expecting some hero or the antagonist to spout maybe silly, gratuitous and mindless holier-than-thou fanatic drivels... let's face it, a lot of shows have been guilty of this.but then i watched the first three episodes, and i thought: okay, this is good. it wasn't until episode four ("scholar") when i was well and truly impressed. i would like to commend on the great writing and also, superb performances from the actors. i just love how complex every one of these characters - they're not straight out two-dimensional cardboard cutout good guys/bad guys. michael ealy gives a wonderful and believable performance as the muslim fbi agent darwyn al-sayeed, treading the fine line between being the good muslim and being a man with flaws. oded fehr gives his character farik an interesting depth - farik is not the typical oily middle eastern stereotype, but simply someone who truly believes in his cause and doesn't see himself as a fanatic but a man willing to do whatever extreme measures to justify his beliefs. he's very charismatic and authoritative. but i would say that it was alex nesic's performance that clearly left an impression in me in "scholar". his portrayal of his character's emotional struggle was amazing - torn between the softly spoken words of a muslim scholar encouraging him to return to the non-aggressive way because it is the only acceptable way in god's eye and farik's persuasion to believe otherwise.i'm looking forward to watch more shows like this, and not some ridiculously high-octane one man show series. it's clever and open-minded.

sleeper cell is what 24 should have been. 24 is a cartoon. (i watch 24 but feel cheated with every stupid episode, all four or five seasons so far. who can keep track as they are all the same. jack gets in trouble, jack gets out of trouble and then immediately gets back in to trouble and then...) sleeper cell is really well done and is far superior. unfortunately they blew it with the ending in season two. i can think of a half dozen better endings off the top of my head that would have worked better for the writer's obvious goals and not been so contrived. shame on the writers for wrecking what had been up to that ending a really good series.

i don't understand why this show didn't go on there could've been various ways to continue on the line of darwin and farik after season 2, obviously darwin couldn't have been the uc agent infiltrating cells and sabotageing them from the inside, but still they should've given this show at least another season.the show is well casted, believable, and views the islamic religion from both the normal and the extremist point of view. it touches controversial subjects in detail and it has a dramatic meaning that can be said of very few shows nowdays. i'm actually sad that i didn't know about this show until late 2007.

i enjoyed this series, but felt that the whole thing was let down by the sound recording/mixing.for whatever reason, they've had to employ an awful lot of what's called adr, where the actors replace the original location sound with a re-recording of it in a sound booth.the reasons for doing this are usually due to problems at the location, or because somebody screwed up somewhere in the sound production chain.it wouldn't be so bad if the adr was done well, but at times it's just plain distracting. it's not just the adr that's the problem - the sound mix just doesn't match up to the quality of performances and the pictures.i'd be curious to know what went wrong.

has the drama, suspense, and character developments you would enjoy if you like drama that engages you and entertains as well as educates.the writers know their material and it shows. the direction is always engaging and not blase, and the acting terrific. why this show didn't win any awards tells me the "powers that be" in hollyweird don't know drama or much else for that matter. there is a plot twist in this episode at the end was a complete surprise and was very well played out. i'm glad it wasn't used as a shock scene for any climatic end to this series which would have been more typical and dull. rent this series at once! let's hope its brought back from celluloid extinction.

i watched sleeper cell with a bit of trepidation worrying over whether the terrorists would be glorified. this mesmerizing series not only handled the subject matter responsibly, it created depth and substance to almost every character. oded fehr just gobbles up the screen in every scene he's inand even though his character is the charismatic leader of a jihad terrorist cell, he still has hypnotic appeal. michael ealy held his own well, though in some scenes i wondered why he wasn't shot on the spot because of the scowl he wore on his face.the pros of the series are the two leads, fehr and ealy, the well written characters--all of which were believable and tragic, and the disconcerting issues addressed in the story. having been married to a muslim myself, the atmosphere created was quite realistic. the cons, for me personally, were that the female t&a was overkillmost seemed gratuitous, as well as some of the sex scenes. despite that, it is a raw gripping series that will make you think. somebody give fehr more juicy roles like this one and let him run with it. he's got incredible screen presence and a strange kind of innate power emanating off him.

this is an extremely involving series that is well casted and portraits a sensitive subject with great splendor. we follow michael ealy as the undercover fbi agent darwyn, set to infiltrate a terror cell lead by farik (oder fehr). the series is very well written, and has enough plot twists to keep you sitting at the edge of your seat waiting for whatever happens next.michael ealy is by my definition one of the best actors i've seen portraying an undercover agent. icey cold on the outside, but still a good human being underneath trying his best to keep his head afloat in a highly emotional roller-coaster ride that fbi has had him embark on. oder fehr on the other hand comes off a guy that pretty much could fit into any social scenario. big and strong, but yet able to disappear into the gray mass if so needed. highly authoritative and extremely cunning. the way the two communicate on screen is nothing short of spectacular.the way the story develops, and the level of detail that the script offers makes the whole story extremely believable, and also very true to life i would imagine. it is of such magnitude that you're left with the feeling of being insecure, not knowing what might happen next in real life. we read about terror every day, and here we are given a good sneak peak into an underworld which most of us know very little about.it's a series that will for sure have you coming back for more, sitting there at the edge of your seat just waiting for next weeks episode to come on. it's a sure winner in my eyes, and i have no problems stating that this series is on my list of all time best.

a real sudsy soap opera here as spencer tracy tackles the role of an illiterate until the age of 20. he marries the woman who teaches him and her ambition and his drive leads him to success.success but no happiness here. a n'eer-do-well son and a faltering marriage leads to disaster and tragedy. tracy buys a railroad and succeeds only to be subjected to a disastrous rail strike and the death of 406 workers.the film appeared at the beginning to be uneven but is rejuvenated thanks to the excellent use of flashbacks here.a double separate suicide here. we know that riches can't buy happiness but this is a little too far fetched. nonetheless, we have riveting performances by tracy and colleen moore. ms. vinson, as the 2nd wife, is also quite effective.

despite later claims, this early-talkie melodrama has very little in common with "citizen kane": it's a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat, told in flashback but hopping around time. the scriptwriter, preston sturges, shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog, and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of "kane" are evident. still, it's very watchable, with a young spencer tracy (his old-man makeup makes him look just like, well, an old spencer tracy) showing depth and authority, and colleen moore -- a little past her prime, and not physically well matched -- playing a multifaceted woman-behind-the-man. there's also helen vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history, sending the final third into ecstatic soap-opera reverberations. the surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets, and there are some plot holes left open (how would she know whose son it was if she's sleeping with both of them?), and the music is awfully hokey. for all that, i was quite fascinated.

a precursor to "citizen kane" in its analysis of the life of a just deceased tycoon, here reviewed by his faithful secretary in a series of interlocking flashbacks. in spencer tracy's 15th film he already looks middle-aged even in the scenes where he is meant to be young!a little silent-screen type emoting is understandable given the vintage but this is a most enjoyable, well-written drama.

preston sturgis' the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kael's the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz - orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis' screenplay here. as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site, kael overstated her case.there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane: the newsreel (representing ralston - the henry luce clone), thatcher's memoirs, bernstein, jed leland, susan alexander kane, and raymond the butler. each has his or her different slant on kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kane's story. this method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.this is not the situation in the power and the glory. yes, like kane it is about a legendary business leader - here it is tom garner (spencer tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. but there are only two narrators - they are garner's right hand man henry (ralph morgan) and his wife (sarah padden). this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner. henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in henry.typical example: although he worked his way up, tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. henry describes tom's confrontation with the union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. but henry's wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the union's headquarters - killing many people). so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.i'm not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kane's success (few films do - including all of orson welles' other films), but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.when they marry, tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. but in america great business success comes at a cost. tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). but it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with sally. and he also notices eve (helen vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.similarly tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry). eve marries tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be eve's son by tom's son tom jr. (philip trent). the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself.the film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. so on the whole it is a first rate film. no citizen kane perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america.

the story of tom garner opens with his grand funeral and is told through a series of elegant flashbacks narrated by his faithful lifetime friend henry. henry and his wife debate whether tom was a great man and a genius or an utterly worthless scoundrel. the film is beautifully written, acted and directed, and i highly recommend it.tom was the fabulously rich and successful owner of a large railroad, dominating his board of directors and his competition, terrorizing his employees, slaughtering strikers. tom's ambitious wife sally was responsible for all of tom's success. when he met her, he was illiterate and entirely content with his work as a trackwalker for the railroad. sally teaches him to read and takes over his trackwalker job while tom goes to school. he starts to rise one step at a time through the railroad hierarchy until he eventually takes over as president.but as tom becomes a business tycoon, his marriage to sally gradually falls to pieces. his spoiled son despises him, and he takes up with a much younger woman (the aptly named eve), with predictably catastrophic consequences. in his business life, tom is a total success; in his personal life, a disastrous failure. much like the hearst figure in "citizen kane," tom symbolizes the best and the worst of the capitalist system.spencer tracy is terrific in the role of tom garner and the business scenes ring with authenticity. colleen moore is also excellent as sally; both of them age beautifully in the multi-generational story. the film was written by preston sturges, but is nothing like the screwball comedies for which sturges became famous.

god bless joe d'amato...i love italian horror, cheese (movie-wise ;)), sci-fi, etc.this one, admittedly, was a bit harder to watch, but another fun bad movie.i like how people preface a negative review with "i normally enjoy bad movies, but..." no buts, this was a bad movie for people who love bad movies. it's one of my top bad movies.miles o'keefe was a poor man's conan, but oh what fun. who can't have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb, a hangglider and a cheesy rubber monster? it's fine to hate this movie if you only like hollywood drek like "titanic" or "pretty woman" but if you truly, i mean truly love bad movies, check this one out.this is one of those movies that are fun to rent for a beerbust or when you have a couple buddies around and looking for a little mindless fun.my rating 8/10.

blademaster is definitely a memorable entry in the swords and sorcery category of movies. i found blademaster along with quest for the mighty sword at a thrift shop attended by mentally handicapped people and was very happy to pay 2.00 each for them. believable sets and costumes, good sword fighting and a beautiful female warrior, mila make this an enjoyable watch. a few problems though, there were a lot of details in the plot that didn't quite fit, like the cave men for one. i didn't understand their purpose. also, this movie could have really benefited from some more monsters. the snake was cool, but i guess it does borrow a little from conan. however, any primitive sort of movie where someone winds up with a hanglider is ok by me (see yor and battle for endor). i think ator is cool! oh, and was anyone else reminded of gallager by the villain or is it just me? i give blademaster a 7/10

the ator series is a shining example of what b-movies should be. they fail in every aspect, but in such a hilarious way that they are funny rather than sad. "ator l'invincibile 2" aka "the blade master" aka "cave dwellers" shows us europe's favorite conan clone, ator where we left him in the first movie- after showing us a lengthy recap of all the events of the first film. this time the world must be saved from "the nucleus", a kind of bomb, represented on screen as a bright light (i guess they couldn't afford a prop). this one features invisible attackers and samurai. as with the first film, lots of stock footage is used (including one rather obvious bit from "star wars"). thoroughly laughable and unforgettably bad- this is an exception b-movie.

this film, blade master, may be cheap, clumsy in appearance and it is sometimes, but it shares thoughts on problems that are way beyond the era this film is set in. ator is the chosen one that has to protect the earth against a terrible weapon, that is compared in an unforgettable and unpredictable way to the atomic weapon. he goes through obstacles as a witful character who is just more than muscle power, although he has quite is lot. i would say this aspect of the movie makes it surpass a film like conan the barbarian, which is the least i can say, quite brainless. it doesn't diminish in any ways the great adventure movie that is conan, but it gives ator his wholesomeness that he shares not with the barbarian. for a lower budget movie, this film does good in terms of setting and the fights are most of the time believable. zor, the villain, has with is prisoner throughout the film one of the most interesting psychological confrontation that gives tension to the movie, even if ator seems way too fit for the task to loose. what gives this movie that little extra are those scenes that may look quirky, but worth of mention. the fight with the serpent god, even though he is a gigantic puppet, is well handled as the snake, with good lightnings, remains a silhouette and the fight is quite convincing. the movie climaxes in a most unusual way, quite anachronic, but breathtaking : the deltaplane sequence. the scene itself is not introduced properly, read not at all, where did ator get that machine, it's pretty unconvincing, but it leads to a really poetic and beautiful midair sequence, that standalone, is the culminating point in the movie, elevating ator in a place where few human fantasy heroes have been. if blade master is not among the great fantastic movies of all time is no surprise due to its lacks, it's a bigger surprise, considering the philosophical way it chooses on the confrontation between good and evil, the truth it speaks and the heart it shows, that this movie is so unwlecomed. i suggest it for every fan of the genre and try take it seriously as an intelligent movie that's to be taken more seriously than it seems.

this film must have been quietly released on some other side of the world, perhaps even in english. hopefully nobody understood a word, not there's anything to understand in this movie anyways! haahaa! call me a nut, but i think this is one of the best movies ever. why would i come to that conclusion?? because it's my national pasttime to sabotage horrible films and this one begs for it every other minute! once i became a fan of myster science theater 3000, i had no doubt in my mind they'd find it somewhere and use it. sure enough! the version they acquired was entitled "cave dwellers" using some strange intro footage not even from the film itself (apparently, they were ashamed to use footage from their own film!). i can't say i recommend buying this film. rather, i highly recommend getting the mst3k version. sure to find it most anywhere mst3k dvd's are sold, don't miss out!

expectacular the ator's second part!! directed rapidly by joe d'amato, specialist in all kinds of subkinds(subgenres) of exploitation, and interpreted again by miles o'keeffe. the budget of the movie debio to be derisory or minimal. in spite of not being a better movie of his antecesora not mas entertained, ator 2 either, it has something, something that makes it enterteining. his introduction you prop it explains ator's origin to us with images of the first part. the script is incredible, is like any comic-book of the brilliant roy thomas. has so fantastic elements inside dle world of the sword and such fantasy as invisible men, black gentlemen, cannibals - monkeys ... the role of the villain this one interpreted brilliant. the final this struggle very well. lacking mas violence and blood, but this one well. never it becomes boring. it has everything what there was lacking ator 1. be charmed with to my me!! 4/5

when the italians and miles o'keeffe work together nothing can go wrong! as ever, miles is great as the almost as great ator; the most lovable barbarian of all times. totally lives up to the first movie.

miles o'keeffe once again assumes the role of the mighty ator in this the first sequel to the original film.what can i say? - this pretty much represents b-movie nirvana! the plot is ludicrous, the script is terrible, the acting is hammy throughout, the special effects....well let's not even go there! - all in all this movie is a veritable delight! highlights of the film include ator and thong (his mute companion, not his undergarments) being attacked by invisible assailants in a cave (certainly saved on the fx budget there!), ator battling what has to be the most unconvincing giant snake ever committed to celluloid, and of course, the infamous hangliding scene! there's one question i have though......at the end of the movie we see a huge atomic explosion when ator supposedly destroys the geometric nucleus (as the narrator tells us)......how in the hell did ator destroy it and manage get out alive?! did he fashion some form of primitive timer/detonator or something? oh well, such an illogical ending really only adds to the movies overall charm - they just don't make them like this anymore!

the jazz singer is one of a number of films made in the late 1940's and 1950 about the jewish experience in the united states. other than crossfire(1947) and gentleman's agreement(1947) which dealt with anti-semitism they usually had a musical-theatre background. these films included the jolson story(1946), jolson sings again(1949), the eddy duchin story(1951), the eddie cantor story(1953),the benny goodman story(1956) and margorie morningstar(1958). the leading actors in these "jewish" films were always played by non-jews. for example larry parks a non-jew played al jolson and gene kelly played noel airman in marjorie morningstar. this casting was probably done to make the jewish theme palpable to a mainly non-jewish audience. the jazz singer(1952) is no different. danny thomas was a devout catholic and peggy lee was certainly not jewish although she plays a non-practicing jewess in the film. the clue to her background is when she attends the golding's family meal before entering she says "i haven't been to a sader (passover service) since i left home".the film is about a cantor's son who has just left the service after seeing action in korea. his dilemma is whether to become a cantor, a family tradition or to be a singer in musical theatre. his choice of theatre leads to an inevitable conflict with his father.however, there is much more to this film than this. this film was made after the rosenberg trial during the mccarthy whitchhunts and the hollywood blacklist. therefore in this film the jews are shown as good loyal citizens andare quintessentialy american. the synagogue choir would rather play baseball than practice. the cantors friends also talk about baseball in fact one of them is a major league umpire. the synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and george washington is said to have visited. therefore jews are presented as part and parcel of american society. nobody in this film has a eastern european accent. peggy lee appeared in very few feature films. in this film you get to see her sing "lover" and "just one of those things" wonderful. danny thomas is quite credible and he acts and sings the part very well. the comedic routines could have been left out. yes, the film is schmaltzy and sentimental but it is well worth seeing. i enjoyed it very much.

to be frank, this is probably the best version in my book as a sound movie version of the jazz singer. the 1927 version is really a silent movie despite its build-up as the first talkie.danny thomas is a great comedian, and he sings very well. he does the jewish stuff with feeling. peggy lee is great and any film that has her is always entertaining. allan joslyn is not too entertaining and we could have done without him. one question: since when do cantors live in such luxurious houses???

by 1952 hollywood decided to remake the al jolson first-talking classic.this time the cantor's son was played by danny thomas. coming home from the army, it is expected that he follow in the footsteps of his father and other male relatives by becoming a cantor. however, young mr. golding has quite a zest for show business.at this time, he meets peggy lee, an aspiring singer. she acts very well and her rendition of her favorite song, lover, is remarkable. the film writers were smart not to plug the obvious jewish guy and non-jewish girlfriend relationship. if anything, this is glossed over. in his anger, for betraying his pledge to become a cantor, his father makes the traditional jewish sign indicative of a loss in the family. this would not be done under circumstances of breaking a pledge, it would be done if among the orthodox, an inter-faith marriage would take place.thomas does a really good job of playing the cantor's son. his singing is up to par as the film ends on a positive note.am surprised that technical advisers did not realize that women do not carry pocketbooks into synagogue on the sabbath or at all during that period.

this is like something i have never seen before. it had me cracking up the whole time i don't think there was one scene that i didn't laugh through. it is about a girl from the country in south who goes off to a big town for college. at the school she befriends the ra across the hall. when she realizes that he has no family to go to for thanksgiving she invites him to come home with her. rabecca and her family and her serious boyfriend all go out to dinner one night and becca realizes what her boyfriend is about to do...propose. she urges cral to do something so he stands up and shouts something like... sorry mate but you are too late i already asked becca to marry me a couple of weeks ago back at the school and she said yes. that all turns into chaos. please watch this classic it is totally worth it... i swear.

the cast was well picked. pauly shore is hilarious and does a good job of bringing the plot of the movie together. however, tiffani amber thiessan is who really makes this movie special. her talented acting combined with her great looks makes this movie a definite see.

this movie is extremely funny and it also contains the best looking girl, this young man has ever seen. tiffani-amber thiessan is a great actress and she has the looks that stop traffic. tiffani completes this movie, which contains funny scenes put on by shore.

this movie was great and funny. pauly is funny. the best looking girl is all the way tiffani, she is totally hot in this film and she proves she can act with this film. this movie is a must see comedy.... and its not all about tiffani, its a great movie in general but tiffani adds the zest to this film, cause she does her scenes very well and she is all the way sexy........

i was cast as the surfer dude in the beach scenes. almost got cast as the muscle guy, since the real muscle guy was really really late that day. pauly had my brother and i (the skateboarder in front of the tattoo place) do some vj stuff in between takes live from venice since he was still doing his mtv thing. this movie is really good as well. would it have made my top 100 if i wasn't in it........?

i think this is pauly shore's best stuff, he played the part perfect. i really enjoyed this movie, patrick renna is really funny as zack the annoying little brother. son in law is a good comedy worth your time, but the only thing i wish tiffany thiessen was the farm chick instead of the one they had.

when i first saw that this movie was going to be playing on tv, i only new of pauly shore as this joke of a comedian who wore really weird outfits back in the day. i still decided to watch it and i was impressed. shore brings a fresh breath of air to the screen. in this movie, he plays crawl a college adviser that probably needs his own adviser as well. carla gugino, in an underrated role, plays becca, a midwestern "farm girl" with a simple family and a movie-cliché boyfriend travis. when she heads off to ucla, she meets crawl and he quickly turns her into a bubbly, blonde californian girl. she decides to bring crawl home for the thanksgiving break. when travis decides to propose, becca needs a distraction. crawl then decides to make everyone believe that him and becca are engaged already. this leads to crawl spicing up the romance between becca's parents, befriending her brother, and even getting the dancers at the local bar to get a little loose. i'm not going to reveal the end, but i liked it. anyway, don't rent it if you want a poignant performance; rent it if you want to laugh your butt of and enjoy an often-missed part of 90's humor.

this was such a funny movie, which was soon forgotten about, probably because there are so many teen and young adult comedies, such as this. the movie is not quit as predictable as one would think. crawl is an unattractive, but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend. still, an unlikely match for rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly kind boyfriend back home. when he helps feel more at ease at school, by showing her around the neighborhood and encouraging her to socialize more, they become buddies, but it is completely platonic. when she realizes her boyfriend might propose, she does not feel ready, he seems to like her boyfriend, but she seems to be enjoying her free laid back party life at college is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility. you kind of learn what a good friend crawl is when he tells her he will help get her out of getting married. when her boyfriend proposes to her, in front of the whole family, she kicks crawl and puts him on the spot. he tells the whole family that he proposes to her, and gives her his diamond ring, which it tunrs out was his the whole time (he must have come from money or something. well they never really show a close up of the ring). the message of the movie seemed to be not to judge people by their looks and not to judge people before you get to know him. rebecca's boyfriend, who her parents love, turned mean when we find out he druged his new girlfriend after rebecca,(amber thesan) and crawl, so that rebecca would have broken up with crawl, thinking they were a couple. although they were not, rebecca was mad at him, which when you think about it, was kind of unfair, since they were not a couple, but i think they were starting to like one another. and i think she thought there was more. the movie never showed them actually become a couple, they left it open for the viewers to decide. they never even actually kissed at any point, although there was one part where they almost did. that was one thing most viewers seemed to misunderstand. many people saw it and said, that he would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or a shock, but they were just friends the whole time, even towards the end. and she did not introduce him as her boyfriend; still they never told her parents they were not engaged. rebecca almost did. even if he would never become her boyfriend, they could have still been friends. in the 90s for some reason femanin men were in, and there was this big stereo type that woman liked femanin men (not that there is anything wrong with that), think it came from the fact that women like the kind sensitive type, which crawl proved to be, through his friendship with rebecca. but when i saw the movie, i must admit, if i went for looks, i thought i would have gone for the first boyfriend. still it was a creative movie, that tried to teach a lesson on friendship and judging others.

i've sat through several pauly shore movies, but this is the only one that i've liked. of course, it helps that he is far less irritating than usual, perhaps even a little likeable. the rest of the cast does a fine job, especially underrated carla gugino. the film itself is basically a harmless and silly comedy, and although few of the jokes are especially funny, the film is quite entertaining overall.

if you like pauly shore, you'll love son in law. if you hate pauly shore, then, well...i liked it!

this is the only pauly shore movie you should ever see. o.k., it's the only one i've ever seen, and i think i've made good choices. i normally find shore's shtick kind of tired, but he is very funny in this movie. actually, the script is pretty funny, and shore doesn't overwhelm the other actors with his ... what do you call it? tomfoolery? anyway, this is a funny, if ultimately forgettable film. --frink-3

though not exactly a comedy in the usual sense of the word this more rewarding than any movie full of laughs but devoid of substance. i don't think bergman's movies can be easily classed under narrow genres, even the lightest are quite complex. this movie in spite of its light touch poses a series of problems related to marriage and its shortcomings and what happens when the flames start to die etc. i don't really communicate personally with all these issues as i am sure others do. but the atmosphere of the movie is extraordinary, you almost wish it not to end. i have to admit that i was swept away by the bergman of the fifties, having come to know most of his later, groundbreaking efforts. before nykvist, von sydow, ulman etc. the master produced some of the richest, warm and touching movies i have ever seen. though it's a long shot, i have seen this kind of love for human kind, in its complexity, only in fellini's movies of the same period. a lesson in love alongside smiles of a summer night are worth seeing for bergman fans, to have the full image of the man's capabilities, and for those who love cinema with a heart. may he rest in peace!

i've been watching buffy the vampire slayer and really didn't begin to love the show until season 4 started. this episode "hush" was view by me alone in the dark just after midnight with my windows open and the wind blowing through furiously by an after storm. the writers of this episode did an excellent job scaring the heck out of me. i was in awe the entire episode which i just finished 2 minutes ago. amazing doesn't touch the surface of what this episode accomplishes with almost no dialogue. if you've never given this show much thought at least watch this episode. if this doesn't impress you then no episode probably will.btw my heart is still racing...

having seen the movie years ago and been disappointed by its squandered potential, when i heard that it was becoming a tv series, i flatly refused to watch it. my best friend became a rabid fan immediately, and knowing my love for horror movies, could not believe that i wouldn't watch a single episode. i told him that the movie had scarred me for life as far as anything buffy was concerned, and he told me to forget that the movie even existed. he insisted that i give two episodes a shot: "once more with feeling" and this one.both of them are why i am a buffy fan today. he was right - i was hooked immediately. i have never seen a show with the guts to dare try an episode that has next to no dialogue, and nothing else could've pulled it off with the panache and the pure creativity of buffy. i think x files might've gotten away with it if they'd thought of it first, but i'm glad that buffy did it instead. it is a credit to everyone involved that you are riveted for the entire hour, sometimes hanging onto the edge of your seat. and when it was all over, i craved to know more about every character. so i went out and bought the season one boxed set. and the rest is history...i guarantee you that if you've never seen it, either, you'll want to see more if you make this episode your first. the only reason i'm not giving it 10 out of 10 is because i'm reserving that score for "once more..."

this is a good episode, but it's not my favorite. a lot of people love it and on a creative level it's brilliant. most of the episode has no dialog, which is such a cool idea and "hush" handles the silence really well. plus, this episode introduces tara, who i like a lot. but, i don't like riely or the initative or maggie walsh and they seem to get a lot of screen time in "hush." plus, i don't think the gentlemen are that scary and i get tired of watching the float around sunnydale. i know that i'm in the minority, but i tend to fast-forward parts of "hush." of course, there are other parts of the episode that i think are great, so if you're watching on dvd, i recommend seeing this episode. it really is a classic."hush" revolves around the entire town losing their voices. skelatal looking demon-guys called the gentlemen arrive to gather seven hearts from human victims, but if they hear a human scream they die. so they steal the voices of everyone in town. buffy and the scoobies try to figure out what's going on, while the initative also start investigating. meanwhile, xander comes to realize how much anya means to him and willow meets a fellow witch named tara. buffy and riely finally come face to face while fighting the gentlemen. they are both stunned about what they learn... he's a commando and she's the slayer. in the end buffy saves the day, but she now has to deal with her new knowledge of riely's secret life.really, the creativity of "hush" can't be seen in a basic outline of its plot. it's the overwhelming silence of the episode, that makes it so great. the characters try to communicate in different ways, (white-out boards, pantomime, obscene finger gestures, etc...) and it all just works really well. after a while you forget that there's no dialog because they're all so good at expressing themselves. during the "talking" parts of the episode, there are a lot of references to the importance of really "hearing" each other. anya claims that xander won't really talk to her. giles ignores spike and xander's protests and insists that spike move into xander's apartment. buffy quickly substitutes the word "petroleum" for "patrolling" when she talks to riely so she won't have to explain her calling. and then at the end, when buffy and riely really do learn the truth about each other, they sit there with nothing to say. it's all pretty cool.there are a lot of good parts to this episode. i love that people keep forgetting that they can't talk. buffy and xander both try to use the phone. riley can't use the voice recognition thing in the initatives' elevator. people try to scream. it's basically what everyone would really do if they suddenly had no speech. and i think it's hilarious that spike has to move in with xander. (they'll also share an apartment for a little while in season seven.) xander and spike have a fun bickering childishness that's just hilarious. also i like the beginning of tara and willow's relationship. tara plays an important role for the rest of the show and she and willow are pretty cute together. it's nice to see them just starting out.on the downside, i don't understand how the gentlemen are choosing their victims. they just seem to float around dorms and pick random people. also, i don't like riely. i've never liked him, but from "hush" on i'm pretty much just waiting for angel to come back to town and beat him up. finally, what happens to olivia after this? it seems like we just met her, she and giles have a relationship, everything's going fine... and then she's suddenly dropped. i don't get it.my favorite part of the episode: giles' "who are the gentlemen?" lecture to the scoobies. the whole scene is wonderful and his over-heads are just hilarious. he makes some similar looking flashcards in season seven's "first date." pretty much anytime giles starts drawing monsters, it's just gonna be fun.

the creepy demons "the gentlemen" capture the voice of the population of sunnydale, to steal human hearts without scream. giles find that in accordance with a legend, if a lady screams, the creatures will be destroyed, but buffy and her friends, including riley, have to fight the monsters speechless."hush" is certainly the best episode of the fourth season of buffy up to this moment. having lots of humor and funny situations, i liked a lot. spike is hilarious, the romance between xander and anya is cool, but i loved the "intense" dialog between buffy and riley in end. the gothic scenario of the final battle against "the gentlemen" recalls the environment of "dark city". my vote is ten.title (brazil): "silêncio" ("silence")

this episode of buffy was one of my personal favorites. also number three of joss' personal favorites as well. the episode featured very little dialogue and despite that the good folks at the emmy's decided it merited a nomination. unfortunately it didn't win. when hush first premiered it received about 6 million viewers, which was the highest rated episode of season four. that should tell you something. even though there was very little talking it managed to intrigue people enough to tune in. those gentlemen characters (who were played my mimes) were some of the scariest creatures the show has produced (or any network tv show i've seen). nothing is creepier then a bunch of silver teethed men coming at you with a scalpel while smiling away. i think that despite the lack of dialogue the actors did a fantastic job on the episode.

episode no. thirteen of the fanciful (excuse the incredibly gay terminology) "supernatural" tv series relocates sam and dean winchester to missouri where they have been called upon by an old flame of dean's to investigate a string of mysterious murders occurring in their small town. as it turns out, a large pick-up truck with an unseen driver is running down african americans on a desolate stretch of road... while dean attempts to rekindle his past love affair, more towns people turn up as roadkill. the cause appears to be due to a past racial incident back in the 60s, causing a frustrated redneck spirit to remain in ghostly limbo, seeking to kill black motorists. "route 666" is another good installment (which isn't uncommon, i've noticed) which contains a few notable aspects pertaining to the pair of main characters such as dean getting laid and sam's admitted regret for having left college... the killer truck does't come across as the most terrifying thing in the world, though, for an hour long show, it does it's job well. not a hands-down fantastic episode, but a solid concept with more horror movie references.

to say i wasn't expecting much sitting down to watch "the couch trip" is an understatement. i had no idea what it was about - i thought it was going to be a journey into the realm of sexuality when i heard chevy chase played a condom man and the movie's title involves the word "couch trip," *wink, wink.* then i figured out that it had something to do with a mental institute and a patient escaping. my expectations dropped even lower.i was literally expecting a grin movie - the type where you grin once and walk out feeling a bit cheated. and in a way, this is cheap comedy - it doesn't have the greatest gags, the plot is ludicrous, but you know what? i had a big dumb smile on my face the entire time i was watching it.dan aykroyd plays john burns, a patient at a mental hospital who may or may not actually be mental. he gives the psychiatrist, lawrence baird (david clennon), plenty of grief and misery, which leads us to believe he is a sane person after all.following a little bit of a riot in the mental institute's cafeteria, burns is awaiting a tongue-lashing from baird in his office when the phone rings. burns picks it up, pretends to be baird, and finds out the caller on the other line, harvey michaels (richard romanus), wants the real dr. baird to come fill in for a radio shrink named george maitlin (charles grodin), who is taking a vacation with his wife, vera (mary gross). michaels wants baird so bad he has even booked him a ticket on an airplane.burns escapes the institute with the help of a receptionist, and drives to o'hare. he gets dr. baird's ticket, gets on the plane, and eventually poses on the air as dr. baird. his show is a phenomenal success. "people love him!" one man says, and the other man replies, "it's because he actually cares about them."donald becker (the late, great walter matthau) is an ex-mental patient who recognizes burns' clothes to be confinement-issued pants and shirts. to keep him quiet, burns promises becker a percentage of his income. the secret is kept closed.meanwhile, maitlin and his wife get in an argument. he flies home to end his vacation short and realizes that the man on his talk show is not, in fact, dr. baird after all, but no one believes him. he gets the real dr. baird, but unfortunately he has lost his id so the police take them as nutcases and don't listen to their story.let me name just a few of the plot holes i noticed while watching this film: burns poses as dr. baird, but is never asked for his id, even when claiming his plane ticket (he was robbed, he says, but they would still make sure he is baird). if burns becomes so very famous, how come the real dr. baird in chicago never heard people talking about him? word travels. and finally, why would the police ever arrest maitlin and baird (the real baird, that is) without following up on their stories?to be frankly honest, i couldn't care less. i went into this movie with a closed mind and it surprised me - i really liked it. it entertained me. its ideas are essentially ludicrous and not at all realistic, but dan aykroyd gives a truly spirited performance as a half-a-loon that makes "the couch trip" a trip worth taking. 3.5/5 stars -john ulmer

this is a strange, little, forgotten movie from the late eighties. it's one of those "large-cast kitchen sink" movies that delivers some good gags. if you like the people in this one, give it a shot.

does anybody know why this movie is called the couch trip? i was just watching it and am still not sure why this title was picked the movie was very funny and its probably my favorite dan aykroyd performance it even beats out his ghostbusters performance i had never heard of the movie before i seen it in a sears store i read the back and thought it sounded good so i bought and when i finally got a chance to watch it, i thought it was better than what i had originally expected. this movie rates as good as animal house and national lampoon's vacation in my mind i wish comedies that have come out lately were written as well as this one was nothing sad happens in it and the bad stuff that does happen are also funny parts if anyone else feels this way and would like to read a comedy script for a movie that doesn't have a sad situation in it email me at killer2511@hotmail.com

a lot of people don't think dan aykroyd is funny. this movie proves otherwise. aykroyd is brilliant delivering his one-liners in this comedy. the only major problem with this is that it wastes far too much time near the end jumping back and forth from aykroyd's character and the doctor who is pursuing him to prove he's a fraud. the doctor goes nuts like doctor leo marvin (richard dreyfuss) in "what about bob?". the scenes where the doctor is desperately trying to get back to los angeles are silly, unbelievable, and unfunny. other that this aspect the movie really is funny, especially the first half.

i would agree with the comments already posted to this site by the previous rater.i first stumbled across this movie back in the '80s, when i was employed at a psychiatric hospital. unfortunately, many of the barbs aimed at the psychiatric profession do hit home. i especially enjoyed the ending, where the psychiatrist would speak thru the door to the hospitalized grodin. trust me, its fairly accurate.of course, doors at most psych hospitals are not locked, nor are straightjackets used much these days, and any hospital must be licensed to have a "padded room".but a wonderfully underrated film, and certainly one that is quite amusing.jeff

i first saw the couch trip (1988)on late night television years ago and instantly fell in love with it. the funny thing is i usually catch all the comedies made but have never even heard of this one until i saw it. dan ackroyd is plain and simpley hillarious period. he has made a couple great movies with belushi and don't forget saturday night live. but i think the couch trip is probably his best and funniest. with a good supporting cast of charles grodin, david clennon, and walter matthau this piece of cinema shines with comic gold. ackroyd's wife donna dixxon even does a fine job here. my favorite moments of the film involve ackroyd and david clennon's charachter lawrence baird. those two played well off each other. so if you haven't seen a good comedy in awile take a trip back to 1988 and rent or buy the couch trip. i just did, amazon 78 cents. what a bargain, too bad i got hit with a 2.50 shipping fee. oh well still well worth it. any guy will love this flick check it out.

i am surprised that this, well above average 80's comedy scores only a 5.2 from all the imdb voters. dan ackroyd does his usual satirical turn as a con who seizes a great opportunity to steal a contract from his prisons physician. he retreats to california to start his work giving advice on a radio show pretending to be the infamous dr lawrence baird. the only person that knows he's an imposter is the drunken priest (walter matthau) who comes along to be pampered by ackroyd's new found wealth having blakmailed him. charles grodin throws in a good supporting performance too. for its genre i think this film deserves the same crediblity as 'ferris bueller' or 'trading places'. 7.5 / 10

as a fan of dan aykroyd, i watched this film when it was recently shown in the middle of night on tv. i wasn't expecting much, so it came as a big surprise that i loved it so much.this is the type of film that dan aykroyd seems to love to make. a chance for him to 'ham it up' and not take things too seriously. if you loved him in the blues brothers or ghostbusters you'll know what i mean, and you'd be wise to check out the couch trip.avid fans of aykroyd will also have fun spotting all the tiny links to his other films in the script!i can't describe this film without spoiling it for you, so all i can do is tell you to check it out. i can't praise this film highly enough, and it must surely be time for a dvd release!!

michael ritchie's "the couch trip" is a wonderfully anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist. it is so subtle and wicked that you start to realize what a stinging satire it really is. it is also dan akyroyd's best movie, made in a particularly great film year (1988)for him. first, "the great outdoors" and now this.akyroyd stars as john burns, a career crook who fakes insanity to escape prison. now, a dumb comedy would just be about this. but "the couch trip" uses this as a springboard for everything else. beverly hills psychiatrist george maitlin (charles grodin, subtly hilarious here)has a nervous breakdown and a replacement is selected: lawrence baird, who happens to be akyroyd's psychiatrist! you can pretty much guess what's going to happen, but the great thing about "the couch trip" is not what happens, but how it is done. "the couch trip" gives dan akyroyd the best role he has ever had. his john burns is one of the truly original comic creations in movie history. wicked one liners and physical humor are a part of it, but what makes it special is that akyroyd makes burns a lovable character. we root for him and grow to like him a whole lot during the 98 minute running time.but akyroyd isn't alone here. he gets strong support from other great comic actors. walter matthau joins the hilarity as a con artist minister who catches on to burns' secret and commits genteel blackmail. charles grodin "slow burns" his way to another great comic role as the burned out psychiatrist. grodin has been one of the most underappreciated actors in hollywood. it's criminal they haven't used him more often. richard romanus plays grodin's slimeball lawyer to perfection."the couch trip" is one of many films made by the now-defunct orion pictures corporation that are currently unseen. mgm spent a fortune buying the orion library but have yet to truly cash in on their acquisition. "the couch trip" joins "dressed to kill", "blow out" and countless others in gathering dust rotting in the vault. shame on mgm for their inaction. hopefully, with new management, "the couch trip" will find the audience and respect it deserves.**** out of 4 stars

i loved complete savages! why did they cancel it anyway? they should have made a second season and so on... god! they always cancel the good shows... and leave all the boring stuff. nothing interesting at tv since complete savages is gone. this show was a great idea. a single firefighter father with five crazy sons and a lazy dog... each and every one of them has his own madness in that house. tj is always the kid...always the smaller one... kyle rocks! he breaks everything he touches! he's always on detention, he's always doing the wrong stuff... but still, he's so funny by all the things that he does. sam is the smart one. he's always shy and stupid when it comes to girls... finally he ends up by dating angela. chris is the sports guy who doesn't have much to do with school, studying, and stuff like that. he's always funny. and finally... jack! the rock of the show. the oldest of all, the macho guy, "the rock star"... but still, as crazy as everybody else. nick is...helpless with these guys. oh! and i almost forgot! uncle jimmy... he's the man! he's like a 30 year old kid. he's like doing the same stupid things that the boys are doing. i always wondered how did he end up by being a firefighter... and the dog is the image of all the savage family. the thing is... this show had everything to become something really big. it had everything, man! but, of course...they canceled it...

a great show.first, to the people who don't like it..don't like it, then don't watch it...this is(was) an awesome show. better than according to jim (a favorite of mine). it shows a real family household (as opposed to 8 simple rules,etc, where everything goes peachy).they're loud, they're messy....i can sympathize with their dragging all the garbage into the kitchen. it happens in real life..sorta like the "portal to hell", and everyone growling like dogs over the fast-food boxes.it's a "been there" show....you know what's coming, but fun to watch, because you have been there before.a good cast, they work great together, a admirable enough show to warrant a dvd release. mel gibsons "safety videos" were a highlight of the series as well.opinion? good show, really deserving of a dvd release (deserving to not be canceled as well).

am glad that i am not the only one to find this series very good. this is the best series for young ladies! i have so strange taste on comedies and i find so hard one to please my intelligence, and i am so happy that their humor is exactly what i need. love the gang of actors! if anyone knows a series or just a movie similar to this one, i say pretty please write back because i miss the series.and kindly ask the writers and the producers to continue it, even if the actors are now all grown up, i guess!have a nice morning/day/evening/night! (because i do not know the exact time you will be reading this post)

each show is excellent. finally, a show about something other than why it sucks to be married or good looking people talking about why they are like normal people. shame it got canceled.mike scully and julie thacker, formerly of the simpsons, wrote or executive produced some of the funniest episodes of that series and a lot of the similar style humour seeps in here. take officer steve cox and think troy mcclure. however, it does come with its own unique brand of humour and let's face it, a teenage girl will love it just by on the faces alone.what is it with television that cancel most good shows and we are spoon-fed with such abominations as who my mother almost slept with or whatever that show is called? please learn a lesson. not everything has to be about cuteness or romantic travails or especially reality shows on how to demystify every aspect of life. some people actually like to laugh and not have to think afterward. well, my griping is done for the day. now back to the simpsons. when is it on? oh, yes! all the time.

i think that complete savages is a very good tv show and they should make many more episodes. it is one of my favourites!!!! it is very funny and it is really good acting. i say that you should give them a chance to do more episodes. iknow that they can and they should!!!! they should put complete savages on nickelodeon more than what they do! i'm sure that many people will agree with me!!!!! i like the tv show because it is a very good programme for people our age and it is very funny. i also like complete savages because it isn't always about the same thing and things that happen could be real, unlike other yv programmes. when they advertised it, i didn't like the sound of it, but i watched it for the first time and i loved it. complete savages is an excellent comedy and i miss it being on tv!!!!!!!!!! i can't really compare complete savages with any other tv series because it is different!!!!

teen deviyaan is a great film. a very breezy entertainer and a very modern film for its time in the 1960s. the music and songs are terrific though the lyrics of majrooh are meaningless at places. dev anand is a tremendous star and as usual does great justice to his role. kalpana is sexy and nanda is ok. simi too is just about ok. the film has terrific dialogue by vrajendra gaur who wrote most of dev anand's films like mahal, duniya, warrant, jaali note, manzil, etc.etc.it is a story of dev getting attracted to three females - the mod kalpana, simi and the homely nanda. he eventually opts for nanda. the story is about ok but its been narrated in a gripping way and the dialogue and songs and the great dev anand are the highlight of the film. a must watch film for all dev anand fans.

one of the best romantic classic,teen deviyaan is a film which is all about selecting among equals your most soft emotion,love.this is a simple story of a middle class man who came into limelight by his poetic talent and charming personality. he is attracted towards three women and vice versa, one a hindi movie star, the second a rich lady and the third who lives in his neighborhood.the situation put him in confusion as he has to decide one of them as his life partner.he asked for few days from all of them.ultimately he goes to a astrologer and asked him who he loves most.his confusion is no more and he came to know the lady living in his neighborhood who really cares for him and loves him is his true love.devanand played the lead character and has fully justified his contemporary romantic image.

i saw teen devian in 1993 telecasted in doordarshan on a friday night, and could scarcely believe that such a remarkable film was ever made in bollywood. it was mind blowing  a film with a "modern" storyline, superb music, three lovely ladies and my fave superstar dev anand.in this unusual storyline, dev falls in love with three women  the simple nanda, the ravishing kalpana and the sophisticated simi. they too are enamored with him and want to marry him. this puts dev in a dilemma (which is the crux of the storyline)- whom to marry?. he consults a hypnotist who asks dev to gaze into a crystal ball. dev finds the answer and marries nanda. beautifully directed (most probably by dev saheb himself & not by amarjeet the official director) the b&w classic has evergreen music  some of sd burman's (helped generously by rd burman) best compositions. "uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth" is the probably the most sexiest song ever composed in hindi films. credit should also be given to majrooh sultanpuri for penning the memorable lyrics teen devian is a breezy musical which completely suited the style of dev anand and he did full justice to the role. unfortunately teen devian has never received the recognition & popularity it richly deserves.a must see for any hindi film buff, i will rate the eternal favourite 9.5 out of 10.

i think it was way back in 1987 that we had our exams and my friend and i saw in the papers that one of the theatres was playing 'teen deviyan'. we decided to go just for the heck of it without hoping anything great. but we were in for a pleasant surprise. the movie was made in 1965 but even by today's standards, the plot was absolutely modern and way ahead of its times. the music was wonderful and dev anand as a city bred looked and acted his best. i still remember that elated feeling when we came out of the theatre after the movie was over. whoever thought of this story of one man falling for three very different girls at the same time? no he is not three timing or fooling them but he genuinely likes all three of them for different reasons. one is homely, one is an actress and the third is a 'high society' girl who can also help dev in his career as a poet. the question is which one is the 'one' for him. what makes the matter worse is that all three of them like him too. when things come to an impasse, a hypnotist takes him in and in his hypnotized state he dreams of his future with each one of them and reaches the right decision.this dream of his which is the only colored part in an otherwise black-n-white movie is the crux of the film but surprisingly is edited out from most of the versions available today. if you want to watch this movie make sure that this part is intact. in case you watch this movie without this part and get confused, don't worry because you just watched an incomplete movie.

for all intents and purposes, 'teen devian' might seem like just another lightweight bollywood musical. to some extent, this might even be true, especially because the producers had to be sure that the film succeeded with the masses. but somewhere behind the scenes, either sadashiv brahmam (who had the 'idea' for this story) or amerjeet (who directed the film) decided that there would be a twist to the usual formula, and succeeded perhaps beyond even their own expectations.this is not simply about a handsome man flirting with 3 women, undecided on whom to choose as his life's partner. dev anand's character was really in love with each of the 3 women at various times, and they with him, despite being aware of the other two. dev anand's relationship with simi and kalpana is particularly interesting - in that each of the women comes to depend on him heavily. there are quite a lot of suggestive teasers in the stars' body language that lend themselves to imagination depending on the viewer's maturity. the theme is surprisingly adult and after all that it was ashame that the ending was tame, obviously designed to please the masses and deflect criticism.

this flick is strange but i liked it a lot. its about a good girl who loves her bad boy and their messed up honeymoon. he doesn't love her back and he's a mean son of a bitch. he starts to love her after some really whacked stuff happens on their honeymoon i wont give it away. its weird yeah!! but different than other movies in a good way i think. i don't know what to compare it to but its a love story. but has lots of funny stuff too. like get to see james franco in a wig. i liked the notebook a lot and it kinda felt like that because of the love story. but the rest is way different. nothing like that. sienna miller is really good. i saw this movie at a test screener because i like her a lot and her fashion. i liked her in factory girl but this is a better movie than that was. her and james franco look really in love in this movie and i hope they are together in real life but don't knowsee it!!!!

i saw this at a test screening in chatsworth a week or so ago, and went with a bunch of my girlfriends. we all really loved it a lot. james franco is amazing and so hot, i would see it just for him!!!!!!! but sienna miller is also really good and plays a southern girl who is in love with him so much that she can't let go. david caradine who was in kill bill plays a cowboy and he is perfect for that. the story is kind of strange but if you believe in the power of love and magical things you will love it!!! it is really original, and it is also very funny and everyone laughed a lot but by the end it gets more serious and we all ended up crying. i am going to see it again with my friends as soon as it comes out, it is really good!!!!!!!

this movie rocked!!!! saw it at a screener a coupla weeks ago. kinda a strange story, where james franco plays this jerk who marries sienna miller just to get out of the country and they go to niagara falls for their honeymoon. don't wanna give it away cuz the movie isn't released yet but its totally cool and you would never expect the stuff that happens. i kinda thought i would hate it cuz its a romance but its also kinda twisted and stuff which i like a lot. the acting is really good and sienna miller is totally smokin' and plays this really sweet girl. i think she should do more roles like this. james plays a jerk but you end up liking him and the end of the movie is really good. david carradine plays a cowboy and he is good. i gave this movie a 10 because i came out of the movie really liking it and wanting to see it again which i didn't expect and my girlfriend really liked it and cried. good date flick

i saw this movie at a screener and its the best movie i have seen in a loooong time. i loved it!!!! james franco is sooo hot and him and sienna miller make the perfect couple. i don't want to give away what happens but they play a pair of newlyweds who go off on their honeymoon to niagara falls and some pretty wild stuff happens along the way....the movie is really really funny and sad and original. i can't even say what it reminded me of, but go see it! i cried so hard but really loved it and wanna see it again as soon as it comes out! my friends cried too. i hope it comes out soon - does anyone know when? i would really go see it if i were you

i loved it. others have revealed spoilers, but i won't. it was an unusual premise, actually sort of weird, but i went along with it completely. camille was a difficult part to pull off convincingly; maybe that's why some people hated it. but i think sienna was excellent and her acting skills enabled her to nail the part perfectly - without being maudlin or ridiculous. i don't know why she was even interested in a loser like james franco, but married him anyway. i like him as an actor and also thought he did a terrific job. he has nothing to be ashamed of. there have been movies with with similar setups e.g. "ghost". i simply love sienna miller and went along with the situation as written in the script. i feel her great acting talent is vastly underrated, and hope it becomes more recognized by the public. i thought all of the actors played their parts very well, and hope more people get to see the movie. i highly recommend it. i was surprised that my local block buster store had about 10 copies available. i definitely plan to buy it.

an unusual movie, which starts off with the classic premise of a hooligan who marries a girl who loves him in order to escape the country. but a twist soon turns the tale upside down. most of the film hits the right buttons: the story develops smoothly, acting is solid (sienna miller's drawl is priceless, she really can act!), chemistry between both leads works, and rolling american rural scapes and quirky side characters really make for a good time. the mood, which starts off as light and romantic soon moves into something darker and downright eery at times.at times though the pace slows just a tad more than we would like, but don't let this stop you watching this unusual little cinematic treat. alexandre montin, paris

as most people i am tired of the by the numbers clichéd movies that hollywood makes. there seems to be no creativity in hollywood. companies only want to spend money on remakes are sequels that have an audience built in.this movie is a welcome change. it could be classified as romantic comedy for it's genre but don't let that turn you off this movie. this is a very original movie which is not like most things hollywood produces.if you are reading this, you already know the basic plot so i will not bother going over that. the only movies that come to mind to compare this to are "interstate 60" and "art of travel" which are little known gems that take a different path than most of the hollywood garbage.this is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching more of the same.dean

super original. really great movie! james franco and sienna miller really do go so well together on screen. i sure hope it comes out soon. i first saw this movie at a screening. because of my age and gender, i was asked to stay for a "talk." we all got to comment on the movie and a lot of people didn't seem to like it. i really loved it and i don't know why so many people didn't think it was that good. go see it when it comes out and decide for yourself! one thing that you might want to do if you are going to see this movie is to go into it not knowing anything about it. i had not known anything when i went to the screening other than, it was called, "camile." it really is worth seeing.

i saw this movie many years ago, have tried to locate it but perhaps understandably it is nowhere to be found. it was so esoteric, & yet one of a handful of movies that remains with you for a long time. i am still not sure what the reality of the movie is, and perhaps, like the uncertainty principle, the obscurity is the definite thing. acting is superb, the atmosphere is always filled with a sense of foreboding, an overall melancholiness permeates, & yet, it is hard not to be absorbed in the story. i rented it thinking it was science fiction (it was in the sci-fi section with some totally misleading blurb), but quite clearly it is not. or horror, or even suspense. in fact, one feels thankful the director took the courage to make a movie like this, for which obviously there is no solid audience. i know some people have complained about klaus kinski's short role, but i think it is very appropriate - his limited exposure is critical to the formation of the mystery of this movie.

"footprints (on the moon") is almost certainly the strangest, most convoluted and most atypical giallo ever made. it may come as a restraint to some of the sub genre's fans, but this film doesn't feature many of the regular giallo trademarks like bloody knife murders (preferably committed by a masked killer wearing black gloves), ravishing scantily dressed beauties and unpredictable red herrings. however, to compensate for all this  and much more  "footprints" benefices from the most indescribably mysterious and non-stop compelling atmosphere i ever experienced in this type of film. the level of mystery in this movie is so high and unbearable it literally makes you feel uncomfortable and scared. like the female protagonist alice cespi herself, you absolutely have no idea of what's happening or why, and this feeling of utter powerlessness is unquestionably the film's main strongpoint. as a viewer, you crave to help this poor woman understand the things that overcome her, but you simply can't. alice has a successful career as an interpreter, but her quiet and peaceful life gets brutally interrupted when she wakes up one morning and slowly begins to realize she has absolutely no recollection of the previous three days. she finds a torn apart photograph of a hotel located on the holiday island gama and decides to go there in order to investigate what happened. on the island several people including a lonely little girl seem to recognize alice, only she used the fake name nicole, wore a red-haired wig and acted like she came to the island to hide from an unknown danger. meanwhile, even the poor girl's nights are restless as she has reoccurring dreams of astronauts hopping on the moon surface and an uncanny scientist called dr. blackman. the plot of "footprints" is truly bizarre and slowly brooding, and particularly the cosmic sub plot is really difficult to link with the rest. alice assumes they are just images from a sci-fi movie she saw long time ago, which sounds like a reasonable enough explanation, but you sense there's a deeper meaning and actual connection to all the other events. fans of tension-driven and stylish italian cinema can't afford themselves to miss this film, really. this is director's luigi bazzoni's psychological tour-de-force, with staggeringly beautiful photography and mind-altering music. in spite of the lack of violence (or maybe just because of it), the film is genuinely disturbing and the mental agony alice goes through honestly affects the viewer emotionally as well. as it is sadly too often the case in gialli-cinema, the climax suddenly comes rather abrupt and nearly doesn't give a waterproof explanation of all the awkward events you just witnessed for the last hour and a half. still, the content of "footprints" will keep you contemplating long after the film has finished and its powerful impact will only increase. florinda bolkan is sublime as the tormented leading lady and receives excellent feedback from the limited supportive cast, including the young nicoletta elmi. the eminent euro-cult star klaus kinski receives top-billing as well, but his role is merely an extended cameo. this film is actually a lot better than director bazzoni's more acclaimed (and much easier available) giallo "the fifth cord", so here's to hoping "footprints" will soon receive a fancy dvd-release as well.

a very insightful psychological thriller! footprints is a stylish example of the 70's powerful italian film making.and luigi bazzoni, a wrongly underrated director and visually amazing 'auteur'. the movie develops its unusual plot with an incredibly suspenseful atmosphere and never disappoints,especially in its sad and dramatic finale! florinda bolkan delivers an excellent performance,rich of nuances and touching sensitivity,being able to portray a dark lady who is not only fascinating,but also painfully real and tragically lonesome.but the all cast is a treat,as well! lila kedrova,nicoletta elmi(the mysterious kid by the beach),italian screen legend caterina boratto and stunningly beautiful b movie queen evelyn stewart in the brief but haunting role of the protagonist's friend! and klaus kinski in a surprisingly disturbing cameo! it's peculiar to notice how incredibly well done movies like footprints were! vittorio storaro's moody and creepy cinematography,stylized locations and sets,nicola piovani's haunting score and first of all the story,so intense and disturbing,so intelligently layered and structured! a thriller with fantastic elements,but especially with a soul and a personal vision. i wish movies like footprints would not be forgotten! i wish the movies were more insightful and personal today as they were back in the 60's/70's! and yes..i wish somebody will soon make a digitally remastered widescreen dvd out of this little masterpiece!

alice (florinda bolkan), a translator living in italy, discovers that she has a memory loss and can't recall the last couple of days. she starts to follow a trace of memory fragments, which leads her to the small town of garma. people in the town seem to recognize her and she's beginning to suspect that the re-occurring nightmares of astronauts conducting horrible experiments has something to do with her own amnesia.the movie is interesting and the plot is good, but it's a bit to slow moving and arty for my taste. the plot takes some nice twists and it's really hard to figure out where it's heading. florinda bolkan is good in her role (but even better in "flavia the heretic") and it's always nice to see "star" child actor nocoletta elmi. klaus kinski's role is too small though. this is not a movie for the die-hard gore hound or exploitation addict, but still a very nice hour-and-a-half mystery.

footprints is a very interesting movie that is somewhat difficult to categorize. "psychological thriller" is the most appropriate description i can think of. the female protagonist, alice cespi, discovers that she doesn't remember anything of the last three days. the only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel. she is also haunted by a recurring, very vivid, dream about a science fiction movie that she believes she saw many years ago. in her pursuit of the truth behind her amnesia she doesn't trust anyone, but little by little it becomes obvious that she has visited the town where the hotel is located before. this is an exciting flick whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how the events will unfold, and particularly, how it will end. the unusual loneliness of the main character and the unreliability of everyone else ensure that the good old paranoid feeling is present throughout the film, whereas beautiful colors and some spectacularly filmed sequences make this a visually attractive movie as well. the important part of the one and only nicoletta elmi, everyone's all time favorite redheaded obnoxious child star of italian horror, is an extra bonus.

this is actually a very good surreal mystery movie, despite the description that tries to sell it as a sci-fi movie. balkan stars as a woman haunted by mysterious visions and lost memories that she is trying to piece together. she spends the majority of the movie trying to make sense of her visions. very atmospheric and effective. it is true that kinski does not appear very much in this film, but the staring actors are very good. there is only an english dubbed version available in the us, and the dubbing leaves something to be desired, but the actors do a very good job. the cinematography, by academy award winner vittorio storaro is excellent. an earlier giallo by director bazzoni, the fifth cord, is also excellent, and also lensed by storarro.

when, oh, when will someone like anchor bay or blue underground release this on widescreen dvd??? le orme, which i only know because of my rare/vintage video collecting habit, is a film in my collection that i would not only sit through, but actually enjoy watching. the fact that klaus kinski is top billed, but is only in small parts of the film, means little to me. (though several comments expressed disappointment in his rather limited screen time.) i cannot say that this is a good horror film, a good mystery, a sci-fi epic or anything of that nature. it is simply unclassifiable in the "genre" sense of things. it is more like a confusing, frightening (though not particularly violent or bloody) dream, filled with great visuals and mystery. it relies on visuals and emotion, much like bava's "lisa and the devil". both films are beautiful in almost every sense, but almost impossible to describe in a logical manner; they both occur in such a dream-like atmosphere. don't be deterred by force video's synopsis on the back cover. it is infinitely more complex and intriguing than that. though force video's release from 1986 (the only one in the us, that i know of) is cropped to full-screen on tape, even in that format it is still great. releasing it remastered and/or letterboxed would make it magnificent (hint, hint... dvd companies).

this a haunting piece of work.its only ten minutes long but i would sooner pay ten bucks into the cinema to see this than to see any full lenght movie currently doing the rounds. it is a simple piece of a man's reflection.he arrived a young man in this place and was mesmerised by a room and the music coming from it...and now here he sits,dying in old age in this place he so fondly connects to his youth. the music in it is brilliant,the guitars have that jazz-room twang like neil young's music in dead man. if you get the chance,watch this film.its worth it.if rutger hauer made more films like this i think he would get more respect than he gets.at the moment you hear him put under phrases like "everybody's favourite psycho".im sure that is not what rutger would want to be rememered as an actor for.he also directed this film,so in this shows that he a very artistic actor/director.a change from the b-grade movies he has been doing since the early 90's.i hope to see more of this rutger hauer as he is one of my favourite actors.

it must be so difficult to tell a story where not much happens, yet still grip the viewers attention. i think this short film achieves this with effortless quality. rutger has an amazing voice that is very soothing, wise and fatherly, (i'm not gay) it reminds of the qualities that robert redford has in narrating. the end is very sad, but beautiful. one wonders how long harry has left, will he be lonely and will he get to say his goodbyes? also one gets annoyed at mr hauer for not getting involved in more work of this caliber. lets hope he continues to do fine work in holland and stays away from hollywood.worth watching

"edge of the city" is another movie that owes a lot of credit to "on the waterfront". from it's nyc locations, to its score, to the belief that whatever trouble you may be in, you can somehow right your wrongs."edge" also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism. in my opinion, that is where the movie does not succeed like "waterfront". at 85 minutes the movie rushes through the establishment of relationships, and ties everything up so quickly that much of it seems forced and unbelievable.possible spoilers****the relationship between sidney poitier and john cassavettes could have been further developed in the beginning. i don't believe that these two characters, from two very different places would have built such a strong relationship so quickly. i think that the whole love sub-plot with cassavettes could have been eliminated. he is so awkward with a woman that it becomes painful to watch. the only reason why it is in the movie is so that she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end. there are other ways that they could have shown this. i would have also liked to see some scenes of axel in the army to illustrate why he is the way he is.the acting is excellent. poitier is terrific in a role that is beautifully written. his role as tyler is interesting and multi-layered, and (especially for 1957), a man who is confident, respected, and intelligent. cassavettes, as axel north, while very good, does not seem quite right for the part. warden is terrific as the boss who knows axel's secret (although his fight scene with cassavettes at the end is staged horribly. too many break-away boxes). i thought ruby dee was wonderful in role of poitier's wife.on the whole, "edge of the city" is a smart, movie with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style picture, without taking the time to let the drama build.7 out of 10

a skillfully directed film by martin ritt where a drifter and anti-hero, john cassevetes lands in n.y. to escape a tragic incident in his life, where he killed his brother in an automobile accident as well as going awol from the army.cassavetes, always an intense actor, shows grit in his portrayal of a film. am surprised that montgomery clift didn't get this part.ruth white is his mother and does remarkably well in two scenes on the telephone.once in new york, he befriends sidney poitier as the two work on the docks. immediately, jack warden, a bully and villain in this film,takes a dislike to him and tragedy ensues when poitier tries to defend his friend.ruby dee, plays poitier's wife in this film, and is brilliant in a scene where she urges cassavetes to reveal the killer of her husband.this is definitely an interesting film of moral values and the loner in society. with the backdrop of tenements, the right mood is depicted in the film.

horror movie time, japanese style. uzumaki/spiral was a total freakfest from start to finish. a fun freakfest at that, but at times it was a tad too reliant on kitsch rather than the horror. the story is difficult to summarize succinctly: a carefree, normal teenage girl starts coming face to face w/ extremely disturbing events as the small town she lives in seems to come under the control of spirals. the spirals are everywhere, in the air, clouds, dirt and everyday objects. the spirals take control of people and bad things will happen to them. oh, another thing, people are randomly turning into snails. why? who knows or cares, people are turning into snails, that's enough for me. this wasn't as much scary as just creepy as it doesn't have a lot of suspense or jarring attacks as horror films often do. uzumaki prefers to creep and crawl (like a snail might!) rather than to jolt. a favorite scene: a woman lies sleeping in a hospital room when this long, thousand legged centipede creature makes its way into the room and slowly up the bed post, across the sheets, over the pillow and into her sleeping ear. i cringed and curled my toes. uzumaki has a handful of scenes really violent but that are sort of humorous as well. for example, a man is obsessed w/ spirals, he gets into his washer because he sees a spiral in it when it spins, he commits spiral suicide inside the washer. the last shot we see of him is w/ his body all coiled & rubber like, a human flesh spiral w/ a engorged single eye blinking in the middle of the washer. a bizarre image. uzumaki has a blatant psychodelic slant to it which adds to its charm and fun. i love horror movies like this. it's not about killing, a la slasher films, it's about a force of evil (the spirals!) taking over you and trying to kill you, force you to kill others. films like uzumaki prove that there are many ways to make a horror film and thank goodness for that

i'm a horror movie freak, and this has got to be one of the most phenomenal horror flicks i've ever seen. the plotline is totally original (who else would think up a town who gets totally obsessed with a certain symbol to the point of death and insanity?), the special effects are amazing, and the cinematography couldn't be better. some may find it disturbing, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. it also makes a good point. the spiral symbol is kinda ubiquitous. the spiral notebook, spiral seashells, spirals on cakes. of all the shapes they could have used (square, triangle, trapezoid, rectangle) this was one of the best choices. if you can find this movie, definitely see it. it's certainly unique, and quite unforgettable.

wow.. i just saw this movie on the sundance channel, and it really is bizarre. i may not be a film expert, but it's probably the most bizarre film i, as an average movie fan, have seen.whoever came up with with it had a great imagination. i'm a bit of a fan of japanese dramas, and there are often actors from dramas in movies.. (matsushima nanako, for example, the lead in ringu, is a major j-drama star.) but it looks like this is the first film for kirie and shuichi's portrayers. i must say, if they really are debuting here, they do a pretty good job.kirie was a very sympathetic character, i thought she was easy to relate with. she was kind and good-hearted, perhaps not the most popular girl but nicer than some of the other attention-seeking girls. she was also pretty in a classic kind of way. i hope she does more films, but it's been a couple years so maybe she has no such plans.the ending was odd. i'm not going to give anything away, but the rest of the movie's bizarreness was kind of put to shame.very bizarre, but very imaginative and unique movie. i'd recommend it for japanese horror fans, though i'll warn you, it's a lot more bizarre than ringu.nonetheless, i'd give it a 7.5 out of 10, for originality, imagination, good characterization, above average acting, and just being plain intriguing.

as is frequently the case when manga is translated into live action, there is quite a bit lost in the translation. however, this remains a highly entertaining film. the premise is unusual and it is presented in the quiet, understated style so prevalent in japanese films (ha!). the special effects are a little 70s camp but, it adds to the comic book feel of the film. i wouldn't recommend this film to everyone but, if you are familiar with (and enjoyed) other japanese horror films like "evil dead's trap", this film will appeal to you.

hey now, i have never laid eyes on a manga comic, but apparently this movie is based on one. ah well, such is life. anyway, this is a pretty bizarre, to say the least, movie, as things literally spiral out of control in a small japanese town. people are becoming obsessed with the uzumaki (spiral) and this young girl watches her friend's father videotape a snail, and later in the movie, people start becoming snails? it also seems this boy's dad becomes so obsessed he somehow commits suicide in a household appliance. there is some bizarre humor here that might be at home in a tim burton movie, but there is some nastiness & gore like only the japanese can do with justice. as with a lot of japanese films though, the ending is the ending, and did anything get resolved? well, not to my mind, it didn't. there are some hints as to why this is all happening but they aren't explored and there's a lot left to either the imagination or else it wasn't deemed important. still though, there are lots of things for the eye to feast on and if you aren't obsessed with everything making perfect sense, this is well worth seeing, because it's just so original and bizarre. my favorite was the father with the spinning eyeballs, personally. 8 out of 10 stars.

i've seen a fair few films from the far east recently.....some were excellent (battle royale, infernal affairs, the eye), and some were not so great (versus, the triple cross). then there are ones like uzumaki and returner, which while flawed i still enjoyed.the basic premise involves the mysterious and horrific effects that a growing obsession with spirals has upon a community. sound silly? yeah, thats what i was thought. firstly, the good stuff. direction was top notch, sure a bit over the top in places but never the less interesting and stylish. secondly the story, was original and like other writers commented very lovelace-esq...it was interesting. what it reminded me most of however was early cronenberg; films like shivers and videodrome.the acting wasn't great, but not too horrible either. to be honest i was actually bored on a few occations....i felt the pacing especially initially was a little slow. my main problem was that it was too silly and funny to be true horror, and yet not so enough to be considered a comedy. *spoilers* below.*spoilers* some good scenes (washing machine =)) and i liked the final shot/voiceover. at first i thought it ended far too abruptly but about 20 seconds later i realised the meaning and liked the end. however, because of the lack of seriousness in the story, combined with over the top scenes such as the news report at the school ment that i did not care for the characters much in the end. the final scene which was perhaps supposed to be a little poignent, while in reality i couldn't really care for the girl or her boyfriend. *spoilers end*so overall i kinda did like this film, but it frustrated me and i think there was real potential in addition to some good scenes. couple of other points, the main girl is quite pretty and cute, and the song that plays at the end is good too. i rated it 7/10.

i happen to have read all of junji ito's english released manga. i watched the tomie film and it was a big steaming pile of turd. thankfully uzumaki actually does justice to the manga. i think those who have read the manga will really appreciate this film more, as many screenshots and camera angles are exactly like in the manga and it is interesting to see how the book characters are played in the film. this film reminds me of eerie indiana. the ending differs to the manga, which i was expecting. kirie looks like her manga counterpart, and her male friend suits the whole very well. very creepy i have to admit, this film feels like a feverish nightmare, the kind you have when you were a kid. not really scary at all, but freaky, if you get my drift? another great horror from japan, get yourself a copy.

it's very true that this film defies convention by not spelling out the plot for the viewer. while some may have a problem with having to figure it out for themselves, i embrace "uzumaki" for its irreverence. there is a plot, it's just that it may not be immediately accessible to a lazy viewer. this is a film that invites numerous interpretations, as all great art does - however, this film is also very entertaining, making it a rare film experience. it's simultaneously provocative and fun.

"uzumaki" takes place in a small japanese rural town,where people are going mad.they go nuts over vortexes and spirals.the crisis is getting worse,because people are turning into snails and vortexes appear everywhere."uzumaki" has to be one of the most bizarre and original horror movies i have seen.the plot is really clever and the gore scenes are really funny as the film doesn't takes itself too seriously."uzumaki" is wonderfully photographed and the use of colors is top-notch.the characters are likeable and there is enough shocking surprises to satisfy fans of japanese horror.despite of some hilarious scenes,the overall tone of this film is pretty dark."uzumaki" is not as good as "ringu","ju-on" or "audition",but if you like japanese horror movies you won't be disappointed.7 out of 10.

a town in japan is being taken over by a horribly brutal abstract shape: the spiral. it's becoming a theme in everything from animals to clouds to people and twisting them, mentally and literally. this film shows it happening to several groups of people. some demonic possession is implied, but nothing is entirely sure except that the best bet is to get the heck out of dodge. the film progresses really well from normal life to abnormal phenomena (giant snails and crazy people) to the truly supernatural (walking dead).as a jaded american horror movie fan, this was just what i needed. maybe it was just the novelty of a different culture's film, but it seemed to have a very original progression, set of characters, and the premise was definitely new. the japanese may think "horror shapes" (uzumaki means "spiral," i'm told) are old by now, but it was nice for me because i'm used to monster/alien/virus/disaster/undead films. in an american movie, you know who's going to die (the annoying/nasty/lascivious/racist characters) and who will live (the children/heroine/dogs/cats/nice guy). that's not true in japanese horror. it was not predictable how they would fight the evil or how it would end up. also, it had this really new (but probably typically japanese) color leached pacific northwest style cloudy day thing going, which was a fresh visual effect for me. the horrific moments were seriously creepy, relying on a little gore but mainly just impossibly overdone facial expressions (think the ring) and body manipulations. this should be one of the greats, up there with once-original ideas like the first nightmare on elm street or night of the living dead.

each frame in the movie is a lesson to new directors or existing directors to know how a movie should be taken. hats off to sekhar. he is underestimated in indian film industry. the director has got all the qualities in taking this movie in the range of satyajir ray, adoor.. every character is portrayed effectively in the movie. though it's simple story, it's been taken to such extent it can be considered to one of the best in india. i don't have enough adjectives to praise the movie. just as the way the life goes in day-today atmosphere, the movie has been taken. though the songs in indian movies are considered to a weak area, songs in this movie has given extra energy to the potential of the movie..especially background score..it's amazing

anand is one of those low-budget but well taken movies. it's a "cup of coffee" entertainment, with no violence, blood or "jump out of your seat" excitement which most telugu films have. however, it does have some massala of it's own. roopa is a headstrong and down-to-earth young woman who is not afraid to confront any sort of situation, even her offensive mother-in-law's distaste for her. she even backs out of the wedding because her fiancé doesn't stand up for her. however, her air of confidence and independence is enough to make anand, a rich young gentleman living in the city, aspire to be her new husband. his father accidentally kills her parents in a car crash anyways, so why not pay her back? but roopa is not the kind who will fall for charming smiles and polite behavior, she puts him through a bunch of situations, continuing to be rude and a pain. it's not until he stands up for her and saves her life that she understands she loves him too. but complications ensue

actually, i have more a question, than a comment. i loved z-boys, and the lords of dogtown. saw lords first, then the doc, and while i loved the story, i am curious as to why in the movie, sid was an important character, but in the documentary, he wasn't part of the team, and only merely mentioned as just some kid they knew. does anyone know the story on that? the story of these boys was amazing. i never experienced the skateboarding craze where i grew up, but my kids have enjoyed it. what i have seen in local skate parks is what these boys had invented. i never knew that. when the film showed the competition, and z-boys did their thing, they put to shame the others in competition.

right there. good, entertaining and accurate era-feel to most scenes. enough personality variations to cover the real people around those days without story distractions from the exceptions. the credits show peralta from mar vista, california.. up the hill from venice and south of malibu. i lived there in the heartbreak hotel days, pre-beachboys, next to that surfer kid bob cooper up on wasatch avenue, where the alley was used to burn surfboards that didn't work. old skatekey skatewheels were used on plywood cutouts to roll down sidewalk waves. things were different in each succeeding decade as the cool innocence of the fifties broke into the warmth of the sun whitewater freedom and exhilaration of the electric sixties and then into the assertively innovative playtime and inventive evolutionary madness of the weird seventies. the movie gives you a piece of that kind of magic moment in time; in a place where the imaginary wave was real.. the source of culturally significant influences. and btw, there's another movie that has a similarly american street edginess to it, and has the same genuinely unique goodness with laid back realness that helps refine that elusively eternal sense of cool.. "two lane blacktop" (with one of the best examples of freesouldoit attitude in west coast california history.. dennis wilson). like monte hellman did with that one, thanks, sp, for being right there with this one. gwr

i hate films about sports. i guess the pre-fabricated hollywood sports film is a bit tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year, what i am trying to say is that there isn't much creativity in this genre. use exhibit "a"  "the game plan" as evidence of this if you want. so, needless to say, i was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element, but at the same time i couldn't wait because i love surfing documentaries like "step into liquid" and "billabong odyssey". i took a step, i plunged into the unknown, and to be honest, at first i wasn't happy. i didn't like the direction, the people, or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs. with my first viewing, i thought that history couldn't be fully recorded, so i thought stacy peralta was splicing stock footage with faux-actors acting like they were from the late 70s. the music was intense, it matched well peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment, but the visuals were anything but stimulating. the elongated scenes, while using amazing music to support, just seemed flushed and too long for my attention. i wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool. i wanted a combination of who these kids were, where they went during their rise of fame, and where they are now. it felt like i was watching the birth of our nation with a great score to the settlers just rowing their boats all day. i wanted to know the men behind the myths.then, with a thought that i would have another negative review under my belt, i watched the film again with peralta's audio commentary. his passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished "wow-ed" me. this suddenly transformed into the film i wanted to see. peralta lets us know more of where these kids are today, what they are still doing, and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera. he hadn't seen many of them in 20+ years, so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface. he was sincere; he was sympathetic, yet he showed so much dedication to this project. while i do not agree with everything that he chose to do (i.e. the sean penn mess up is not punk rock), he revitalized this film for me. it was due to this commentary that i rate this film much higher than originally thought.jay adams. tony alva. jeff ho. peggy oki. wentzle ruml. these are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned, and continually praised, if skateboarding is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees. while tony hawk's name sells products, it is these guys, these mild-mannered pavement slackers that redefined an entire sport. sure, others were probably doing it in the stone ages, but these guys did it with style, grace, and moved it to the next level. this was a hobby for them, but it also propelled them in a direction i believe none of them were ready for. "dogtown and z-boys" is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted, and about friendship. we have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity, and this is definitely a story that should be added to that. i cannot say that i loved this film, nor will i, but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend. it was sad, it was emotional, and these guys aren't multi-millionaires over again  they are people with a passion, and very rarely do you see that in documentaries.overall, i cannot watch this film again, but i will suggest it to friends and family time after time. i think the downfall for this film, to me, was the filming  the attempts to be avant-garde with the style, which ultimately drew away from the characters and events. as mentioned before, there were some elements that dragged on too much, which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now. peralta obviously had a passion for this sport, for the people, but he seemed out-of-focus at times. the music was intense, and worked perfectly with the film. sean penn, while he was decent with his voice-over, wasn't needed at all. they could have spent the money elsewhere. on the positive, the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing. peralta's voice, instead of penn's, brings a stronger human element to the scene, while he tells us better stories of the people, places, and events. watch this film, but don't expect to be blown away. listen to the audio commentary; i think you will be impressed.grade: *** ½ out of *****

my son, an avid skateboarder, sat me down and made me watch this with him. as i love documentaries, it didn't take a whole lot of pressure on his part. the whole amazing story of it all - a bunch of dirt-poor kids drift together and end up creating something revolutionary out of thin air - well, more out of some wood, wheels and lack of waves to surf - it just floored me. it still does. i didn't think i would enjoy it the way i did, nor did i think i would tear up watching stacey peralta tear up over the fate of jay adams. and just watching jay adams himself.....the sheer genius of the kid skating and the shrug of the adult remembering. i watched it again last night for what has to be the 10th time and i still get goosebumps watching him fly down the hill with jimi hendrix's "freedom" playing in the background. and i teared up, again. not too many movies have the same impact with me after several viewings. brilliant.

dogtown and z-boys is a documentary about the zephyr skateboarding team, and their influence on skateboarding. it also focuses on the history of skateboarding. it was directed by stacy peralta, a member of the original zephyr team, and was written by stacy peralta and craig stecyk, another member of the team. the documentary stars the members of the zephyr team and is narrated by sean penn.the documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding, and how it evolved from surfing. it discusses skateboarding's popularity in the late 60s and the 70s, its decline in the 80s and its 'rebirth' in the 90s. skateboarding was introduced in dogtown, the nickname of the poor side of santa monica, california. the zephyr team originated from the zephyr surf shop, which manufactured the first modern skateboards. the documentary mainly consists of the original zephyr team members talking about the past in the zephyr team, the competitions they won, and their popularity and prestige. it focuses on three particular members of the team; peralta, tony alva, and jay adams, three virtuosos of skateboarding, and probably the best three members of the team.the interviews in the documentary were usually voices over archival footage from dogtown in the late 60s and 70s. very rarely to you actually see the people being interviewed, but when you do, they are shown in black and white, while the archival footage was in colour. i think stacy peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past (i.e. the glory days of the zephyr team) and not the present. the documentary is very fast paced, in that we often see clips of impressive skateboarding over up-beat music of the era (such as jimi hendrix, led zeppelin and david bowie), and the interviews tend to be quick and to the point. knowing nothing about skateboarding (i.e. not even knowing how to ride one straight along the ground) i was very surprised that i found this documentary so interesting. the reason is that this doco was more about the zephyr team than the actual sport of skateboarding, so while i couldn't relate to skateboarding, i could relate to the boys in the team. because it was made by actual members of the team, it gives it a little more depth and authenticity.all in all, i would have to say this is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen. it gave me a whole new insight, not just into the zephyr team, but into skateboarding as a whole. for those who love skateboarding, i can only imagine how it must be even more interesting. seven and a half stars out of ten.

dogtown and z-boyssummary: dogtown and z-boys is a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers that changed the world of surfing and skateboarding in venice (dogtown), california as we know it today. with their low pivotal style, they embarked on a larry bertlemen influenced journey that would lead to countless successes and a couple failures. after the dogtown articles were featured in a reinstated skateboarder magazine, the sport was revamped and the members of the zephyr skateboard team forgot about jeff ho, and looked to be on summer vacation for the rest of their lives by joining other skateboard teams that could afford to pay them like movie stars. the original zephyr skateboard team put together by jeff ho (zephyr surfshop owner) and craig stecyk (photographer) included jay adams, tony alva, stacy peralta, bob biniak, chris cahill, shogo kubo, paul constantineau, jim muir, peggy oki (the only female), nathan pratt, wentzle ruml iv, allen sarlo, and david ray perry. all of the original members except jay adams and chris cahill are still well and surfing/skating. jay adams, at the time of the documentary, was serving time on drug related charges. chris cahill, at the time of the documentary, was last seen in mexico.themes: the themes of this documentary are kind of read-between-the-lines, but if there were a clear-cut theme it would be that even kids can spark revolutions. other themes would include extensive partying in one's past may lead to an unfulfilling future, and by planning and being careful with one's assets a very rewarding future could be at hand.other works: stacy peralta (writer and director) has a fairly wide range of documentaries that he has either written, produced, or directed. most with a common theme of surfing or skateboarding, such as riding giants, sk8 tv, the bones brigrades, and lords of dogtown. he has also done films with a theme of growing up in america as a teenager, films such as: influences: from yesterday to today, crips and bloods: made in america, and the 70s: the decade that changed television.subjects: the subjects of dogtown and z-boys are the original members of the zephyr skateboard team excluding chris cahill. peralta included jeff ho and craig stecyk in the interviews. other subjects were people who grew up during the 70s reading the dogtown articles as well as skateboard enthusiasts. skaters from the dogtown area, but not on the team were interviewed.editing: the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion. there were scenes of the subjects talking so that the audience could see who was speaking and get a sense of the character, but would immediately cutaway to archival footage that would explain what the speaker was saying. when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song old man by neil young was played, which evokes many emotions. sean penn was the narrator for the film and he explained the transitions throughout the film. the film was presented chronologically from the time the zephyr surf team was put together, to creating the skateboard team, to all of the z-boys leaving the team to join other skate companies or create their own company. cinematography: the film was shot in an interesting way. the film of the subjects speaking were all in black and white and all of the archival footage of the z-boys surfing or skating were in color. of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film. the interviewees were mostly shot in the same area it appears, but all were outside. all of the footage was very well-controlled even the archival footage which i found very surprising. music: "seasons of wither"-performed by aerosmith "toys in the attic"-performed by aerosmith "generation landslide"- alice cooper "one way out"- performed by the allman brothers "lollipops and roses" and "whipped cream"-performed by herb alpert "into the void" and "paranoid"- performed by black sabbath "godzilla"- blue oyster cult "aladdin sane" and "rebel rebel"- david bowie "fastcars"- the buzzcocks "gut feeling"- devo "i'll give you money"- peter frampton "funk 49"- james gang "ezy rider" and "foxy lady" and "freedom" and "bold as love"- jimi hendrix "sidewalk surfing"- jan and dean "achilles last stand" and "hot on for nowhere"- led zeppelin "six underground"- the sneaker pimps "surfrider"- the lively ones "cat scratch fever" and "motor city madhouse" and "wang dang sweet poontang- ted nugent "us and them"- pink

tramps "hannah"- rob trower "rocky mountain way"- joe walsh "old man"- neil young "la grange"- zz topthe music in the film make the movie. every one of these songs contributes to what the subjects are saying and evoke emotions that would not have been called to mind otherwise.

a dozen bored surfers, mostly kids in venice, california, not only reinvent the skateboard but remake a once-forgotten-about suburban fad from the 1950s into an action sports revolution.narrarated by sean penn, dogtown depicts life in the more rundown "locals only" beach communities circa 1974, which consisted of mostly of surfing in the early morning tides and loitering. the zephyr team (or z-boys as they are called) spend one summer combating the boredom by building their own boards with the help of a local who owns a surf shop. after they enter re-emerging skateboarding competitions in socal, they transfigure it all into their own scene; one that rouses a generation of skateboarders consisting of greats like tony hawk, shaun white and the creators of the of x-games.dogtown puts chronological perspective into skateboarding, and the up-from-the-bootstraps history you never knew it had.from andy frye at mysportscomplex.blogspot.com

take a subject i didn't know much about and make it exciting, why don't you? it so happens that back about 1979, director robert altman said that he didn't believe he had ever made a real movie and that he expected that one of these kids riding skateboards--if he doesn't break his neck--will make the first movie. well, i wouldn't put such an expectation on stacy peralta, but he is a skateboarder who has made a good movie. of course, he was forced by the nature of the film he was making to use existing footage, and it is certainly a good thing that so much archival footage existed. peralta edited it together well with not-your-usual talking head shots of his erstwhile colleagues as they are today. the whole effect is post-modern in the best sense, but that has been done. altman's prediction hasn't quite come true. what peralta has done, however, is capture enough of the energy of those heady days that we can appreciate what it must have been like when modern skateboarding was invented by the z-boys. this is all good. i highly recommend "dogtown."

excellent piece of work!i am not a surfer nor a skate board fan, but work this good about sorting sock drawers would have been riveting. a must see!there is a lot to enjoy here. excellent visuals. great sound track mix. huge body of documentary work both pictures and film.the life work and love of the subject is captivating.

solid documentary about edgey kids who first surf then skate in the face of the american dream. sadly some of the youngest and most gifted succumb to the lure of drugs while others become slaves to the crass marketing of their go for broke instincts. few come out on top. but the die is cast and fruit of it all is the new national pastime, skateboarding (the new york times notes that "it was once considered a snub to authority. now, however, skateboarding has its own summer camps, video games, magazines [actually it always had these] and corporate sponsors.") commercialism co-opts another kid birthed cultural node.

in the groovy mid 70's a scruffy bunch of brash young venice, california adolescents from broken homes and the bad side of town known as the z-boys turned the previously staid world of professional skateboarding on its ear with their fierce punk attitude, radical unconventional riding style, and unbridled spirit of pure in-your-face aggression, revolutionizing the sport in the process and paving the way for the many extreme variations on sports that popped up in their influential wake. director stacy peralta, who's one of the legendary z-boys himself, relates the incredible exploits of this amazing ragtag crew in a ferociously punchy and visceral manner that's both informative and wildly entertaining: the snappy rapid-fire editing, ceaseless speedy pace, and raw, gritty photography deliver one hell of an infectiously kinetic buzz, projecting a sense of sheer joy and full-on bustling energy that's a total pleasure to behold. better still, this documentary neither sanitizes nor romanticizes its subjects: these rough'n'scrappy lads were so fiercely competitive and out for themselves that they all went their separate ways when the lure of fame and fortune manifested in their lives. the ultimate fates of certain guys is poignant and heartbreaking, with gifted and spontaneous ace skateboard rat jay adams rating as the saddest and most tragic: he blew his chance at the big time and wound up doing time in jail. the other dudes are very colorful and personable as well; charismatic ball of cocky and defiant fire tony alva in particular comes across as one arrogant, yet impressive piece of furiously assertive work. marvelously narrated with delightfully easy'n'breezy nasal nonchalance by sean penn. the terrific rock soundtrack likewise seriously smokes. but what really makes this documentary such a winner is its refreshing complete dearth of pretense: it's every bit as dynamic, exuberant and larger-than-life extraordinary as the gloriously outrageous z-boys themselves.

this film to me deserves a lot of praise, because even though i am not a surfer or skater, i remained inspired throughout the whole documentary.the depth of history and development of these two extreme sports emphasised what they were able to do for two groups of individuals. the dedication that these individuals had/have is truly inspiring and it was because of them that others can now enjoy and do what these guys founded.unlike most other documentaries, this one was cleverly put together, the amount of footage that was recorded and survived throughout the decades is outstanding and it was because of this that some of the greatest editing i have ever seen was put together and resulted in the subject remaining focused. without the urge for them to retort to recent footage of the more famous surfers and skaters that remains popular today.the film explores areas such as the success, such accomplishing new tricks, winning competitions and gathering fame. as well as failures such as injury or burning out.it was also fulfilling to hear the experiences come from the skaters and surfers themselves and not from second hand information. this resulted in a better picture to be drawn.overall, a truly outstanding effort.

i saw this movie on the lowlands festival (23, 24, 25th of august) after a friend of mine said this is a very cool movie about the history of skating. i didn't now what to expect from this movie. was it recorded by a couple of skaters who thought they could do a couple of cool tricks, or was it a documentary about skating.so i went in, after waiting for about an hour, whit out any expectations.this movie is really a nice piece of work about the beginning of skateboarding. it started with the zephyr team, who where a fine group of surfers. this is taking place in a not so nice area to live in. at a certain point the waves are not so good any more to surf on. so they try something else. skateboarding was a fact. if you were a part of the zephyr team in that time, you where one of the cool guys/girls. because a lot of people saw an escape from the place they were living in with the zephyr team. so they were trying all there new tricks now on a skateboard. in no time skateboarding was popular again. there were a couple of competitions and one national competition. the zephyr team was taking part on several competition and also the national one. but what they were doing on there skateboards was unbelievable. but the jury didn't now how to judge them. so they put the whole skateboarding world on it's head.anyway i can tell you the rest of the film/documentary, but you must see this one with you're own eyes. because then you can feel the vibe of this movie. this movie got a lot of style for me, so i rewarded it with a 8.greetings from gijs and the rest of holland. see you.

this film moved me at age 39 in the same way that all the footage and coverage of dogtown affected me when i was 13. for all of those who criticized the self promotion of the z boys interviewed, they have the last laugh on you. that was their whole deal, "we're better than all of you and here's why....(insert footage of the smoothest pool carve imaginable)" this was a film to tell their story and that was their story whether you like it or not. it was their opinion of their skating that mattered..... not yours or mine. i thought the film captured their attitude and influence exactly as i remembered it in the 70's. the reality is that they did revolutionize skateboarding, they were the impetus behind extreme sports and they did inject a cultural paradigm that reached into every corner of americana. this movie gave rebirth to images of bertleman on a wave and alva and jay adams ripping up the coping that was the california dream to an entire culture of young american teenagers that just wanted to have fun and get rad! as i watched this film i realized that it was these images that i lived with every day until i was old enough to move out and back down to so cal after my family had moved to nor cal when i was five. until i could get back, my buddies and i built and thrashed ramp after ramp, searched for every empty pool possible and mimicked everything stecyk covered about these guys. we are all educated and have family's and careers now but this film reminds me who i was at that age and why i still surf. this is an inspired film that anyone who has an interest in pop culture, extreme sports, the 70's or even just good documentary film making will enjoy completely. whenever it comes on cable i can't change the channel. kudos to stacy peralta for making a beautiful piece of art!

i remember when skateboarding had it's rebirth in the 70s. i begged my parents for money to by a second-hand skateboard from a friend. it was a piece of junk, complete with clay wheels and everything. i also remember reading skateboarder magazine and being both completely impressed and totally terrified of the dogtown crew. skating never became a way of life for me, but in some ways it has always been a part of my life, whether it is using a board for transportation or just having a bunch of friends that skate.this film is a brilliant documentary of the real birth of modern day skating. watching this crew turn skating from the flat boring hobby it was into the vertical lifestyle it has become had me sitting slack-jawed for 90 minutes. it's amazing that enough footage from this period still exists to have created this film, and thank god for that. the footage is brilliant. it gave me the feeling of watching an old buster keaton film: i've seen some of the tricks keaton did repeated countless times in other films since then, but when you go back and see the first person to perform that trick it's amazing that, not only were they the first person to try it successfully, but that they lived through it and made it seem effortless. that's the feeling this film gave me. yeah, i've seen people skate pools before, but to watch the first people skating pools and inventing the tricks that eventually became the basics of modern skating is like watching the facade of the house fall on keaton, leaving him standing safely in the frame of a window. it's absolutely brilliant to watch something that, up until that point, had never been tried before, but since, has been tried by almost everyone.this film is beautiful to watch and incredible to listen to. the soundtrack is one of the best i've ever heard in a film. this is a film that will appeal to people whether they like skating or not. i've talked to a couple of friends of mine who made their girlfriends sit through this film after heavy protest, and they all said that their girlfriends were mesmerized by the end of the film and loved it as much as they did. as for the previous comments on this board that complain about the film being too self congratulatory, i think that's an unfair disparagement. i liked seeing these guys get excited about their past. they created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever. they have the right to pat themselves on the back. they were stars for doing what they loved to do. most of these guys/girls never achieved the staggering success tony hawk enjoys today, but that kind of success wasn't available to skaters then. sure, they had some success, but more importantly, they have been able to live a life doing what they love to do, and, as we see in the end, almost all of them still surf, skate or work in the surf/skate industry. how many of us can say that we have been able to live our lives and have been successful by breaking all the rules and doing what we love to do? they can. my hat's off to the dogtown and z-boys for being themselves and changing the world of skateboarding forever.

this is one of the greatest documentaries i've ever seen along with "dark days". i have skated for maybe an hour my entire life, and i still love this movie. peralta and his excellent editor captured the feeling and atmosphere perfectly, helped in part with some incredible archival footage. tony alva is one of the coolest individuals in existence. love those knee high striped sport socks, you rock tony!not only is this movie a visual feast, but the soundtrack has to be one of the best in history, if you're into 70's rock. buy the dvd, you won't regret it.

i have seen this movie twice now on cable. the first time i saw it, it caught me by suprise. the skaters i was seeing were the guys we followed in the pages of skateboarder magazine back in the late 70's. these were the guys we copied and tried to become while skating. i am glad that a film was finally made that gives an accurate account of how it all came to be. i am almost 40 years old now and i guess a pretty uptight kind of guy with all of life's problems, however; this film did a great job of taking me back. back to the vacant pools, the backyard halfpipes and the road trips to cherry hill nj. i suspect that in order to really understand this movie and appreciate it, you had to live it. otherwise, it probably won't have the impact on you as it did me. but for those of you (and you know who you are), who did live it, you know exactly what i am talking about! in any event, i don't care who you are, if you get a chance to see this movie...do it! i give thanks to the z-boys of dogtown for the memories of my youth and thanks to stacy for making this movie! job well done!

let me say first of all that i spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard before i realized i was totally uncoordinated. i've always thought it was cool watching cats that know how to get extreme on 'em do their stuff, but i've never been a skateboarder and have never really followed the sport. that being said, i thought this was a very informative and interesting documentary. some reviewers have said that these dudes were sort of waving their own flag a bit, but what the hell? it looks to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as anyone for giving the skateboarding world a jolt and they've provided some good footage of their innovations to back it up. it's great the way viewers are allowed to see these guys both then and now and the footage they shot while they were teens growing up in california provides some interesting nostalgia that goes a bit beyond the sport of skating. i never would have realized where extreme skating came from, but this films sort of ties all the pieces together and gives us an informative documentary. i'm sure it's at least a tad biased, but aren't all documentaries? worth watching for anyone interested in the sport or, as in my case, anyone who grew up in the 1970's.

this documentary traces the origins and life of the zephyr skateboard team, using original film shot in the 1970s (mostly by craig stecyk) combined with interviews of the team members and other influential people today.the first part of the film documents how the "dogtown" section of venice, ca came to be, starting back around the turn of the century when the town was created to be a venice, italy-like european city. by the 1970's, the one remaining local attraction, the pacific ocean park, had been abandoned, leaving a beach with lots of exposed piers and other hazards. the poor kids living in the area had nothing better to do than surf, and they excelled despite (or perhaps because of) their surroundings. because the waves dissipated in the afternoon, they took up skateboarding to fill their time, and the empty swimming pools caused by the drought during those years plus their surfing backgrounds led them to create the vertical skateboarding style that is mainstream today. i found that the film covered much more about surfing than i expected, which seemed like a bonus since i really didn't know much about surfing or skateboarding before i watched the film. the soundtrack, not surprisingly, was good as well. i also liked how these kids were just following their passion and generally ended up better off for the experience. the parts that didn't work so well for me were the drama that they tried to create, which seemed somewhat forced, and the team's somewhat overinflated sense of self-importance (although this is probably just left-over street attitude from where they grew up). this is not to say that they didn't have significant influence, but only that it seems extremely likely that there were other factors as well. one note: my wife is more affected than most to nausea when films use what we refer to as "spasticam" (wiggling camera movements). this film is often guilty, so if you are so afflicted, be warned. i would recommend this film to anyone, but especially to anyone with skateboarding and/or surfing in their history.seen on 5/11/2002.

back in the day, i was one of the rn's in the emergency rooms, these skaters would occasionally land in. they were not treated well, and some of it was brought on by their asocial personalities- but we all knew they were a talented bunch of "wonderkids" even then. they deserved better care than they received, i'm afraid. they had "attitude" in spades.i'm so glad i caught this documentary on ifc tonight- it will be on again at 1 am and i'll be watching again!little attention was given to them until the rich dying kid was able to talk his parents into draining the pool- and the film really highlights that as the taking off point....it was an amazing time, and deserved to be recorded. stacy peralta is due all the praise heaped on him, and long may those z-boys enjoy their memories and contribution to the real sport of skateboarding. as for the few "sour grape" reviews contained herein, there always were and there always will be "wannabees" and hangers-on who never do more than dream...the z-boys lived it, breathed it, were it.nice to see the vintage films and even the lone girl, "peggy" who was so talked about as being the only female to win their respect.thanks to ifc i get to really take the occasional drug-free head trip of my youth and relive the heart pounding excitement again.

if you have ever been, has a friend, or a kid that is or was into skating at one time, then watch this flick!. i have seen it several times and i get something new out of it every time that i see it. it reminded me of why i got into skating in the first place (a long time ago) . it reminded me of what skating brings to a person and i have found will also help a person who doesn't understand why skaters, well, skate. sure there is a very dark side to the whole seen, which the movie does touch on slightly. but it tends to focus more on what is at the core of skating. just a person on a board, doing it because they love to do it. this movie was so inspirational to me that i'm now skating once again (i'm 32) and i haven't been this happy with my self in years.. give this one a go, you will not be disappointed.

being in the suburbs of new york when the z-boys were creating history in dogtown, i was only exposed to a glimpse of what was going on. i had a p-o-s black knight skateboard with clay wheels. it is long gone, and on the ash heap of my personal life. but i never forgot. it's like watching long-lost brothers and friends, and it hits me right where i live. i cannot watch this film enough. every time i view it, some other aspect rises to the top, some other viewpoint come into sharp focus. the vintage footage, the incredible stills, the current personalities intermeshed with the vivid shadows of the brightly lit past, the heartfelt and not over-done narrative, all beautifully edited together in such a way as to make a landmark documentary of a genuine slice of american history. in the words of glen friedman - "it was f-ing unbelievable."

my skateboarding career ended in 1974 when my two-by-four skateboard with steel roller-skate wheels hit a rock and i tumbled, for days it seemed, down the sidewalk outside my parent's house in boston. by the time the cast came off my arm, summer was gone.but i have always admired the x-games types and surfers especially. i think i spent the first month after i moved to southern california on the beaches and piers watching the surfers, bemoaning that fact that i had missed my calling. it's the sort of thing you should learn young, before the horrible senses of self-preservation and self-awareness burrow in. or else at best, you'll be so worried about not getting hurt or laughed at, you'll wind up looking like a trained bear.i always admired how a good surfer seems to not care about anything but that moment, that wave, that experience. at one with the forces of nature. a good surfer makes it look like there is nothing else but that wave right there, and the way you interact with it. there's a lot of zen in it to me.this documentary outlines how a few young folks took the surfing concepts and extended them to skateboarding. ramps, downgrades, low sweeping curves while interacting with the cement waves beneath their feet. in their day and time, this was all new. radical. prior to the zephyr skate team the idea apparently was to go as fast as you could in a straight line on a skateboard, hence my long "evel knievel at caesers palace" like tumble down the front walk.this film is a look back through time, to an america before everything was labeled, tagged, marketed, and jam-forced down our throats as "extreme". (seriously, what's so "extreme" about an "extreme value meal" at taco bell? other than the fact that it is an extreme hazard to your colon...) watch this film and watch the birth of 'extreme sports'. before there was an x-games, before boom-boom huck-jam, before crusty demons, before the asa...there were these young street urchins who created 'extreme sports' without really trying. they were just doing it for the purity, the pure pleasure, of skateboarding in the sun with friends. i hope they get a cut of the 'extreme' money out there. goodness knows they don't get the credit they deserve. maybe this film can correct that.excellent film with a great soundtrack, a portrait of a southern california, indeed an america, that no longer exists.i don't care for sean penn but he does a decent job narrating.

anyone looking to learn more about the development of skateboarding should find dogtown and z-boys adequate research material. this is not to be confused with lords of dogtown, that sorry hollywood attempt to cash in on the success of the original dogtown revival. directed by stacey peralta, a former z-boys himself as well as pro skater and mastermind behind the 80s bones brigade, and co-written with skateboarding photojournalist craig stecyk, this documentary traces how a group of surfing kids from southern california's mean streets (known as dogtown) who formed the z-boys skateboard team (actually there was one girl--peggy oki) revolutionized skateboarding. the film contains interviews from nearly all of the z-boys (chris cahill's whereabouts are unknown) with the most noteable being bad ass tony alva and the youngest, jay adams, who's talents (along with perlata) seemed to transcend the rest of the teams. there are interviews of the team's (and the dogtown shop) founders, surfboard designer jeff ho, skip engbloom, and craig stecyk. there are also interviews of folks like tony hawk (obviously), ian mckaye (fugazi), and henry rollins, who were young kids in the 70s when dogtown was making it's influence on skateboarding (skateboarding was a whole other context in previous years as the documentary explains). it really shows you not only who the dogtown team was and how they formed, but why their style changed not only skateboarding tricks (pool skating became immensley popular, and thus gave way to vert skating), but also facilitated the sport (though not into the extreme commercialism it is today) as more than just the fleeting fad it had been earlier as these surfing kids who's waves ran out in the early morning needed ways to spend their time and eventually got into skateboarding. the days of russ howell and alan gelfand were long over as the dogtown, at least through the publicity of their skate team, paved the way for the new generation of skaters. because dogtown got all the attention, they were able to push skating to the next step.it's a great documentary in the way that it is put together, though stacey peralta always knew how to do this even when producing the bones brigade mini movies/skate demos like "ban this" and "search for animal chin." narrated by sean penn, the film is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, contains lots of terrific archive footage, and lots of interview to give you a genuine feel of who the z-boys were and how they made their mark on skateboarding.

after watching ingmar bergman's skammen, i had many feelings, but most notably, i felt unsatisfied. i have heard so much hype about this movie but i came to find it lacking. don't get me wrong, i can fully appreciate the artistic value of such a film, but as far as depth and emotion, i was not so impressed. i found the characters to be disagreeable and unrealistic, which detracted from the dramatic effect. in addition, the fact that the war was fake led me to feel that the emotion was not real. dramatic war movies, in my opinion, are much more effective if the events (not necessarily the story itself) really happened. i find that of all the movies that try to show the brutality this one falls in the middle as far as effectiveness.

oh, it's an excellent piece of work, to be sure. in fact, several of the best scenes in cinema, or at least in bergman's cinema, are to be found in this film. liv ullmann and max von sydow are as good as you would expect. do these two give bad performances? sven nykvist delivers some masterful, although unconventionally masterful, cinematography. the script is quite good, especially in individual scenes. sometimes the film lags, and the pace is uneven, though probably intentionally. so what's the problem? well, the film is too bleak for its own good. other bergman films are similarly bleak, but nowhere near this harsh. eventually, i just gave up and i started to become a little irritated. i was greatly affected often during the film, but, by the end, i felt uninvolved. it's a great film, but i doubt i'd ever watch it again, nor suggest it to friends. or, if i did suggest it, i'd be very sure to warn them of what's ahead. 8/10.

it came as no surprise to me that this was a very depressing and draining movie. after all, it's all about the impact of war on civilians and it's by the "king of depression", ingmar bergman. in other words, so many of bergman's works delve deep into human misery and angst and so this movie seems not so extraordinary coming from this director.even though it is more difficult to watch, the last half of the movie offers perhaps more insight into the lower depths of humanity. that's because initially, the main characters (liv ullman and max von sydow) try to overcome adversity and are basically decent (though a bit stupid) people. however, as deprivation after deprivation occurs, they (especially von sydow) become less and less humane and more animalistic--doing anything in order to survive.fun to watch, no freaking way! but, an interesting insight into human nature.ps--1 thing i loved about this film is that it avoided a stupid movie chiche. when the couple sat down with the shopkeeper to drink a glass or wine, they finished the wine completely! in most movies, they barely touch their drinks or leave them untouched. it drives me crazy, as i would never leave a $4 alcoholic beverage without drinking it unless it tasted terrible or had a bug floating in it! bravo!

shame, is a swedish film in swedish with english subtitles. the film is about a husband and wife named jan, and eva. they live on an island working as farmers. there is a war going on and soldiers start attacking people on the island. once the war subsides a little jan, and eva are arrested as going along with the opposite side. once released even more trouble ensues and the film shows how two ordinary people will act in a situation of war and life or death. winner of the cec award for best foreign film at the cinema writers circle awards, the guldbagge award for best actress (liv ullman, who plays eva) at the guldbagge awards, the nbr award for best foreign language film and best actress at the national board of review and the nsfc award for best actress, best director (ingmar bergman) and best film at the national society of film critics awards. shame, has good direction, a good script, good performances by both max von sydow (who plays jan) and liv ullman (who plays eva), good cinematography and good production design. shame, is a well acted and well made story of how people in a desperate situation will sometimes do whatever they can do in order to survive. the film has a powerful message and is a good film. the reason i'am not rating this film higher is because it is not a masterpiece like some other ingmar bergman films like wild strawberries, the seventh seal or persona, for example. the film didn't have as big an impact on me as i thought it would and it lacked ingmar bergman's thoughtful and philosophical dialog. while nowhere close to being one of his best films there is still a lot to like about shame, and it is a good movie. i just probably would have liked it more having not seen some of those other bergman masterpieces.

bergman´s tale about how the hell of the war can drive a sensible couple of musicians to the barbarousness. with many memorable scenes throughout the film, i found particularly remarkable that close to the end where ullmann and von sydow go in a boat completely surrounded by corpses of soldiers floating on the sea. a fascinating masterpiece!

'war movie' is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. the civil war-era "cold mountain," starring jude law, nicole kidman and renée zellweger is such a film.then again, calling cold mountain" a war movie is not entirely accurate. true enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts "glory" director edward zwick shame. however, "cold mountain" is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman, played by jude law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain, north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, ada monroe, played by nicole kidman. at first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived."cold mountain" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. meanwhile, back at the farm, ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. coming to ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails ruby thewes, played by renée zellweger, who helps ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada.within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn south unfolds. the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby's deadbeat father, ray winstone as an unrepentant southern "lawman," and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. all have been greatly affected and changed by "the war of northern aggression," mostly for the worse. the dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.make no mistake, "cold mountain" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.

i really enjoyed this both times i watched it. and both times, i walked away thinking about it, and the "morals of the story" a great deal. i agree with another reviewer in that the movie is not centred around the sci-fi aspects you might expect from an alien-on-earth movie, but rather is about the human condition. the characters in the psych hospital provide a great insight in to that, and how they go from hopelessness to hope. this movie has touches of sadness to humour to sympathy to the final "is he or isn't he". that final question was well handled and even though some might argue you don't know what happens in the end and the question goes unanswered, i feel it is done in far more detail than something wishywashy like say, the movie ronin (with robert de niro) where you never find out what's in the box and feel very frustrated because of it. i highly recommend k-pax. 8/10

kevin spacey again picks a winner with k-pax, an endearing movie that expresses profound revelations at human existence via the prot character's naive, yet at the same time unquestionably wise, point of view.it's enjoyable trying to work out 'if he is or he isn't' as the plot expands and the robert porter character gets fleshed out. however some may find the ending a little unsatisfying but in reality it couldn't have been any other way.my few issues with the film revolve around the rather cartoony and over simplified portrayal of mental patients. i was surprised because the films plot shows a great deal of intelligence and i don't feel it would have lost anything by being more honest regarding how people with mental health problems behave.that said, i realise this was a movie and not a documentary and the film itself is exquisitly shot and the story unwraps at a pleasing rate. bridges is great and spacey delivers a languid and relaxed performance, more like a stand-up than an alien.a good film that will get you talking with your friends.

i thoroughly enjoyed this film. i had read the book a good ten years ago and was intrigued about how it would translate to film.the screenplay is very true to the book, which i was charmed by - this is a rarity in itself these days. the characterisations were solid and believeable, and the stroytelling kept me shifting in my perceptions, even though i already knew the ending from the book.an intelligent and well crafted film.

after watching this movie once, it quickly became one of my favorites. as different events happen in the movie, you change your mind about prot, back and forth, until the end and even after. the movie is very thought-provoking and a must-watch!!

at last, a movie that handles the probability of alien visits with the appropriate depth and loving warmth. just in case we're not alone, i do believe that these visitors are just too touristíc to care for us or give that wayward bunch of anthropocentric goofs a stable proof of their existence. we wouldn't interfere in the battle rites of some agitated desert tribe either, unless we're out for messing with our travel insurance, huh?anyway, the movie depicts the transitional cathexis of a weary mind and body by a superior entity. that happens quite unspectacular and rather unrecognized, but we're dealing with a movie here, right? so prot's hospitalization is just a trigger to the plot.jeff bridges acts great as usual, but spacey is hilarious. the role seems tailored downright to him, convincing and lovingly "mad". eating unpeeled bananas, sitting in a tree, giving his doctor a hard time with quickness, wisdom and (most of all!) stunning quotes. they made me think and philosophize for hours already.it's an encouraging film, to say the least, and the soundtrack by edward shearmur is simply beautiful. just go and get a copy. catch a beam of light. now.

who's the man~~~ what's that i hear? a resounding cry of kevin? well if you didn't shout for the 'usual suspect' i'd recommend changing your medicated prescription. anyway this is no first class movie, just a very well produced story, that is almost believable. considering its about an alien your probably wondering what the? all acting is top stuff and also the first i've seen a balanced, sarcastic alien. just enjoyable is all i can say and almost for the whole family (if not for the scene later in the movie). seven stars

*may be spoilers* no doubt one of the best dramas if not the best in the genre i've ever seen. is prot an alien or just a crazy bugger? this is the question you'll be asking yourself all throughout the movie. kevin spacey is simply amazing, as is jeff bridges. you can't beat this kind of acting plus some humour at times. some of kevin spaceys actions in this movie are very funny. when he was up in the tree, for example, and when he was talking to the "queen" mental patient, the way he hid half his face around the wall and just stared.to simply put it, right from the start you'll be hooked, and if you really love drama's you won't be dissapointed.a solid 85%.

(possible *spoilers* warning)you never know. the guy keeps telling he's an alien but... oops, seems to be the most human in the whole story. arrived from distant planet. said weird things. advanced the earth's science. healed the doctor... or was it just a crazy dream? you never know. better see k-pax for yourself. think.great acting of all the cast. don't forget to notice the music, it's right in a place. lot of fun, some sadness. 8 of 10, after all.

if you like movies that will make you think, this is absolutely one of the good ones. i always liked david lynch and cronenberg. they have always made high-quality movies.iain softley has directed k-pax brilliantly. the movie tears in feelings and philosophy of the mind and world. kevin spacey and jeff bridges both delivers superb acting skills. it caught me, i did not take my eyes away from the screen during the movie. on the other hand, if you are hoping for a special effect sci-fi movie, this is not for you. the story is being dragged a bit, which can be a bit boring, but also works as a way of building up the theme of the movie. enjoy this film, i did..

i thought this movie was highly underrated. the subject matter does seem like it would be a little strange, and i was put off at first, but once i was watching the movie, it didn't seem strange at all. i was intrigued with all the different possibilities that the story had to offer, and i couldn't wait to find out how it would end. once it did end....i thought about it for a long time after. i was pleased with everything about k-pax, from the acting and the story and the scientific elements and psychological issues, to the ending. it's not an especially upbeat or happy film, though it does make you chuckle from time to time, but i found it to be especially entertaining and thought-provoking. i own it now, and intend to watch it many times.

prot (kevin spacey) is a mental hospital patient who claims to be native to a distant planet called k-pax. his psychiatrist, dr. mark powell (jeff bridges) tries to help him, all the while trying to understand prot and find out if he is really from k-pax.this movie doesn't really fall into any particular genre. one big part of k-pax is drama/ science-fiction, another part fantasy, plus, add to that a dash of comedy and you begin to get what k-pax is all about. the story (as you see above) isn't too complicated or deep, but it still offers some good twists and turns of the plot that may still surprise you as they did me. no special effects or graphics accompany this movie, and there's no need to have them, the music in the film is great however. a techno soundtrack along with a terrific piano piece makes k-pax sound sci-fi and makes certain scenes intriguing.kevin spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing alien (prot) from the planet k-pax, emotional with great facial expressions, spacey does a fine job in the lead role. jeff bridges is dr. powell, that aids and attempts to understand prot. bridges is also excellent in his part. bridges and spacey fit together very well and they should, after all, they've both had a lot of experience. the wife of dr. powell is rachel powell, played by mary mccormack. mccormack plays her part well, showing the frustration from having her husband gone and so dedicated to his patient. alfe woodard plays dr. powell's coworker claudia villars, we don't really see claudia too much, but overall she puts in an alright performance.k-pax is rated pg-13 for "a sequence of violent images, and brief language and sensuality", and that covers it. as far as "violent images" go, we don't see too much. a few people that have quite a bit of blood on them, but that's all. language is as follows: 1 "f" word (wow, only one!), 11 "s" words, and a few uses of the lord's name in vain. not too bad really. the "sensuality" part is just from when prot explains to dr. powell how reproduction works on k-pax, nothing terrible, just something about it feels like "having your nuts in a vice." not too bad on the content level for a pg-13 movie, it could have been a lot worse.in conclusion, k-pax is not a bad movie. it won't stun you, but it is enjoyable and kind of fun to watch. it has some funny parts, sad parts, really sad parts, and, well you know what i mean. it's a story of a mental hospital patient, what do you expect? all in all a good rent for those of you looking for a good drama that you can kick back and relax to, k-pax is a well done movie.bonus! if you've seen this movie already, like it, and are thinking about getting the dvd, i would highly recommend it. it has loads of extras to look through, and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes. 8/10

a beautiful, magical, thought-provoking and heart-warming story. excellent direction, perfect cast, marvellous script, excellent score, beautifully lit...... need i say more?if you love films that not only make you think but also warm your heart (some that spring to mind are 'contact', 'field of dreams' and 'groundhog day') then you're sure to love k-pax.most highly recommended.

well, not much really to say about this. but it is really good. very good job from softley directing and the movie have good cast of acting. movies plot is also believable and... hehe good. so the good is main word in this case. i just hope there would be more this kind scifi movies. thats why this one s pointed out in the crowd. i give it 8.5 of 10

just watched this and it was amazing. was in serious doubt about renting the dvd or not. so if you are...and like watching other than brainless action-movies...don't hesitate any longer. don't let the dull cover put you off. the script is one of the best ever. inteligent, funny, original, touching and keeps you at the edge of the seat through the whole movie. i had already watched another movie right before this one and was really sleepy, and usually i get bored on watching a second movie in one night, but this one really made me wake up and didn't have any boring moments. it also made me rethink a lot of things in life and gave me a really good feeling.also the acting is great (one of kevin spacey's best roles). the visuals are beautiful and the use of music is very well-chosen. if i have to come up with something negative to say about it....well....i can't really find anything......enjoy! 10 out of 10

this is a movie that will leave you thinking, is he or isn't he? while many people have complained about the ambiguous ending, it gives room for the audience to think and interpret it from the signs. this is my interpretation and theory, and i believe it is very sound. first, here is the plot. one day, prot (kevin spacey) suddenly appears in the midst of a busy train station. after attempting to help a woman from muggers, he is arrested and sent to bellevue, and later transferred to dr. mark powell's (jeff bridges) hospital. prot freely talks about how he came from the planet k-pax and is here to do a report on earth. naturally, he is classified as a looney and is locked up in a low security level ward. he befriends the other patients and quickly convinces them of his story. in fact, he tells them he can take one person back with him. soon dr. powell is beginning to question prot's insanity and as the plot progresses, it is harder and harder to prove prot wrong. in the end, dr. powell learns that prot is robert porter, a smart man who worked in a slaughter house in new mexico, when his wife and daughter were murdered. prot claims that he plans to leave for k-pax at a precise time on the fifth anniversary of the murders. the time comes and goes, and powell finds prot or robert in a catatonic state. one of the patients is missing and is never found again. on to my theory: prot is not crazy. prot is from the planet k-pax. robert porter is a friend of prot's. on one of prot's previous visits to earth, robert was a child, learning about the constellations from his father. prot and robert became best friends. after the death of his family, and robert slaying the murderer, robert decides to commit suicide. prot is on k-pax at the time, but he rushes back (in multiples of light speed) to stop robert. so prot takes over the thinking of robert, taking over his body so to speak. awhile later, prot (still inhabiting robert's body) comes to new york and is locked up. when he leaves for k-pax on july 27, he takes bess with him, but he must leave robert's body behind. hence, we now have the catatonic robert.explanations or clues:prot's knowledge of the planets around libra: as prot says, any child knows about their own system. only a few people on earth had an inkling about the system, and prot added to their knowledge. robert porter, while smart and knows his constellations, was no astro-physicist. dr powell feels chosen by prot: it's true. prot could've left the institute at any time, but chose not too. prot's last words to dr. powell are, "now that you've found robert. take care of him." prot was probably staying there to ensure a place for robert when he left. super-human abilities: it was a proven fact that prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see uv rays. prot provides his usual k-pax reason, but there was no earthly reason given. it was also mentioned that prot was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effect.helping the patients: throughout the movie, you see prot helping the other patients (or the patients discussing prot's suggestions) to a better sane world. while the psychologist balk at prot's help, dr. powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leading.the sprinkler scene: the sprinkler is associated with porter's home in new mexico (which is ironically where roswell is). does porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family? is her trying to protect powell's daughter from that horrible fate? i have a different point of view. it is assumed that porter had committed suicide in a river. indeed, prot (under hypnosis) is greatly concerned about robert. i believe that prot associates the danger with the water, not the sprinkler. he is trying to protect the girl from watery death, like he did robert.hypnosis: dr. powell feels that under hypnosis he can uncover prot's true identity, but while prot gives plenty of information, he never gives up his prot persona and claimed homeland of k-pax.the security camera: why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason? mysterious disappearances: first, prot disappeared for a few days to his trip up north. funny, the patients are not at all alarmed. indeed, they try to reassure the doctor. sometimes i think they understand better than the staff. naturally, the most telling disappearance is of bess, the winner of the essay contest. not only does she disappear at the approximate same time, but the only remaining clue is her winning essay.this is only my humble theory. you can conclude what you want. you can take dr. powell's theory, that prot was merely a persona taken up by robert porter to mentally defend himself from reality, but that would be giving up too many plot holes.

at least for me. and rather unexpected -as subject. a movie that makes you question your beliefs, your life, your approach on everything. that helps you see the world you , we live in through a lens - or a multitude of lens...a moving, surprising and haunting movie.and it benefits of one of the best performances ever from kevin spacey. seconded very well by jeff bridges. there isn't a false note in this tango. it's a perfect dance. perfect 'till the end.what does the ending reveal ? well...everything you want it to...a movie one will want to see again. maybe not right away. maybe after a few days. months. years. but it's something to go - or come - back to.

if you have enjoyed the butterfly effect, donnie darko or the machinist, you will enjoy k-pax too.to me, this movie felt really uplifting and yet depressing in the end. spacey delivers a great performance as prot. also, lets not forget the appearance of saul williams in the movie, who i am a big fan of.after watching it, i recommended the movie to lots of my friends, and everyone was pretty much blown away.but still, it is very underrated, maybe because of the lack of action and explosions. i'm sorry, this is not a movie about blowing things up, it's about how humans behave, and how people live in worlds that don't exist.go on, and enjoy.

the always delightful kevin spacey makes us once again question certain truths in our lives. after driving us into believing he is a mumbling small time crook (only to expose the true power of cinematic deception) in the classic the usual suspect; this time around he leads us into believing he is prot, a likable alien who assumes a human form whilst strolling around the earth.prot is a peculiar stranger who has seemingly appeared out of nowhere, only to be hospitalized in the manhattan psychiatric institution. dr. mark powell (jeff bridges) soon takes extreme interest in him, and even finds himself pondering if prot is actually a supreme being from planet k-pax, or perhaps he is only a forgotten human being with severe psychiatric issues. while the ending can be seen and discussed in many ways, it remains a complex, enlightening journey which leaves a gr eat deal of intriguing/philosophical questions behind it.

in kpax softley brushes on the subtleties of eastern religious mores from the small archetypes embedded all over the film to the actual purpose of prot. spacey (prot) assumes a predominantly didactic role throughout the entire film - it is as if the statements he makes embody general truths about a culture of peace which is strongly promulgated in buddhism and hinduism. it can be said that prot is the eye of the storm - the world is in disarray and is 'bright' and the false veil of reality is what everyone else sees, but prot sees truth - he sees the minute - and appreciates it and at some points fears it as he transcends his social construction of reality and becomes more humanly.the film is particularly detailed, therefore i would recommend that you watch it at least twice to see how softley interjects nuances. listen carefully to the narratives at the beginning and end as they truly touch on concepts not commonly presented in western philosophies.9 of out 10 rating - superb - with nominal room for improvement.

i was truly surprised when i first saw this movie directed by iain softley; it differs in so much ways from the usual hollywood mass-production. the plot itself is simple - kevin spacey plays a mental patient prot who claims to be from the planet k-pax who arrived to earth by a beam of light, while dr. powell played by jeff bridges tries to help him to solve his delusions... first of all, i must admit the cast is perfectly chosen: kevin spacey is really brilliant in portraying the intriguing character of prot, always walking in the fine line of convincing us that it is real and then making us wonder whether he is delusional or not... some of the gem scenes include the one where prot innocently eats the whole banana (even the peal) while in session with dr. powell; or the observatory scene where he confidently shows his knowledge of the k-pax system to the astonished astronomers... jeff bridges on the other hand is the subtle, rational side of this movie, and he delivers it perfectly. there is a whole other cast of excellent actors (like saul williams' convincing performance as ernie) who make this film truly work.k-pax has it all, elements of comedy; sci-fi, even psychological thriller (concerning the prot's identity) but most importantly it can be categorized as a heartwarming drama. the main premise of the movie is quite intricate, but the director never lets it get loose, he always keeps it believable and yet two-ways interpretable. the camera and photography have almost a crucial part here, continuing the main idea of light travel, there is much focus on light-shadow play, lightning settings - one of the memorable scenes is where dr. powell holds a crystal figure in his office which refracts light in a beautiful way while all the time he suspects can the idea be true? subtle and slow paced, intriguing and pleasurable, k-pax is truly a gem to watch, one of the kind movie that may not be for all tastes, but those who see it - might fall in love with it.

following a mugging incident at new york's grand central station, an innocent bystander (kevin spacey, "the usual suspects") is arrested by police who believe him to be under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. we can understand why they think this, considering how the man politely informed them that he wears his dark glasses because "the light on your planet is really bright." and so prot (as he identifies himself, pronounced as rhyming with "goat,") is shipped off to the psychiatric institute of manhattan, where a weary workaholic doctor, mark powell (jeff bridges, "the big lebowski"), attempts to understand this man's so-called delusion.prot's manner is courteous and cooperative. when asked why he believes he has been institutionalised, he matter-of-factly replies that it is because "you think i'm crazy." within minutes, after satisfying his insatiable newfound hunger for earth-fruit, the completely forthright prot has revealed that he is an extraterrestrial from the planet k-pax, which resides 1000 light-years away, circling the binary star system agape and satori located in the lyra constellation. he also details how his infinitely-more advanced species has already mastered faster-than-light travel, through harnessing the energy of light, an accomplishment that is allegedly eons away for the human race.powell is understandably very skeptical of these outrageous claims, though he is nevertheless fascinated by them, and commits himself to understanding how prot came to believe such a thing. meanwhile, prot uses his time to observe his fellow patients in the psychiatric ward, eventually offering everybody around him something to live for, and hope of a cure. on july 27, prot later reveals, he will depart again for k-pax, and he can only take one human with him. of what will actually happen on that date, nobody is certain.originally slated to play dr. powell  with will smith as prot  kevin spacey stepped into the main role when smith had to withdraw from the film. you can tell that he had a lot of fun with his character, the completely matter-of-fact delivery of his sometimes ridiculous dialogue ("your produce alone has been worth the trip") often eliciting genuine laughter. there is undeniable intelligence behind many of prot's words, but logic maintains that he must be delusional... mustn't he?the audience is led back and forth between the possibilities  for the first segment of the film, we almost accept the possibility that prot is an extraterrestrial (this is a sci-fi movie, isn't it?!), before being totally convinced when prot inexplicably displays an impossible knowledge of the astronomy of a newly-discovered planet system. a final investigation by dr. powell offers us a neatly-packaged terrestrial explanation for prot's delusions, but this is just as quickly whisked away, and we are left scratching our heads again. the film, quite rightly, keeps its ending open, leaving the audience to contemplate what they've just watched and to discuss it with those around them. nevertheless, whether you believe prot to be an alien or not, two irresistible certainties linger in your mind: the universe is, indeed, a fascinating place, and perhaps there are higher forces that we humans are yet to discover.

one of the best movies ever, the idea of a double interpretation involves we all. would be prot a schizophrenic or an e.t? (no doubt in my opinion, but let's keep the question open...). kevin spacey, the big screen monster, plays prot as it should be done. let's not forget jeff bridges and his great psychiatric. lastly, a masterpiece that speakes for itself. can keep our eyes wide open from the beginning to the credits and our minds thinking even when the movie is over. if you still didn't watch it, go right now! and again, again...

usually i do not like movies with/about aliens but k-pax is different. the actors are great in the movie - especially kevin spacey played his character breathtaking! the movie never fall to a lower level - the suspense is always in the movie and you absolutely wanna know how it ends, what's about prot... you have to think a lot after the movie over the movie because there are a few open questions... is robert porter prot or is prot only using robert porters body as a means of transportation. how can he see uv-light and how can he know that much about astrology. but everybody can make his own end and can decide in what he wanna believe. very good movie with an excellent kevin spacey!

i'm a fan of jeff bridges so i snapped this up on dvd without having seen it previously. i instantly became a fan of kevin spacey, also.the general plot of "alien in human body" has, in my experience, been done to death, but i liked the approach taken in k-pax, which struck me as quite different and much more sensitive than most. bridges makes an excellent doctor (you *want* to tell him what's on your mind) and spacey's expressions and gestures are perfect in the role.the interaction between prot and the entirely human characters in the clinic is delightful, particularly the subtle manipulation of their behaviour.the ending is bittersweet - i like prot's choice, but the final scenes (with bridges) made me teary.

personally, i think kevin spacey is one of the greatest actors of his generation, maybe the greatest. this in combination with another amazing actor named jeff bridges, it can't be bad. and that's exactly what this movie is! "k-pax" is one of the most pleasant surprises of the latest years. to start with has the movie a brilliantly written story. it's part of what makes the movie so great. the other aspect that contributes to the greatness of the movie is the acting. the combination spacey-bridges really works.this was already the second time i saw the movie and i'm sure it won't be the last time. "k-pax" has everything. there are moments which are extremely funny, parts that remind of a true thriller and others which reminds of high-class drama. i think this movie deserves a much higher rating and a lot more awards. great movie! 9/10

this film is brilliant...... without a doubt. watched it a while ago after constant pestering from family members who are right into their sci-fi films (which i am not), and thought it was quite good. but after recently watching a few documentaries on outer-space etc we watched it again... and it is good.kevin spacey is without doubt one of the greatest actors ever and i really like jeff bridges (big lewbowski, blown away, arlington road). the film revolves around a patient in a nursing home who claims he is from another planet. yeah right, you think... but what if his story is so believable that even his psychiatrist begins to wonder if he is telling the truth.that is how the story evolves with bridges going through all kinds of emotions dealing with prot (as he is known), his own psychiatric colleagues, his wife and family, his brother-in-law and his cosmologist astronomer work colleagues (who after getting some data from prot, pretty much admit that he might be telling the truth!) a great film... that get's you wondering.....8/10 dave

due to a very misleading advertising campaign, i saw this film in theatres at the relatively young age of 10. the trailers on tv portrayed the film as a comedy, and i bugged my parents until they took me. after seeing the movie, i was blown away. i had no idea what to think. totally different than anything i had seen before, leaving far to many questions for such a young mind. needless to say, i loved it. this morning was the first time i'd watched in in probably 2-3 years, and i still think it's one of the greatest films made in the last decade. kevin spacey and jeff bridges are both in top form, as a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet, and the psychiatrist that develops a bond with him while trying to decipher his mystery. the supporting cast are near perfect as well, each resident of the mental institution is incredibly convincing in their own way. the open ending was handled very well, giving lots of evidence to support whatever you believe happened in the end. how this movie failed to receive at least a nomination in that year's oscars is beyond me. if you haven't seen this film, run to wal-mart right now. the dvd is usually in the bargain bin, pick it up! 9.5/10

k-pax is exactly what a heart warming film should be. the story is about a mysterious mental patient prot, played by kevin spacey, and his unbelieving psychiatrist dr. powel, played by jeff bridges. the two have a very friendly bond, and as their relationship grows dr. powel can't help but wonder whether or not there is more to his mysterious patient, who insists he is from another planet called k-pax. this film is very funny, and kevin spacey pulls of well placed one liners as if it was his second nature. k-pax is a smart film, and i wasn't expecting it to go where it did. in the end, i found myself thinking about the small things in life, and the wonder and magic of the every day life we so often take for granted. i left the theater with a warm fuzzy feeling inside, and for families and couples on a date, k-pax is a splendid film, that will not disappoint. i highly recommend this film to anyone interested in something more than the monotonous releases of glossy, action packed, gore fests.

ok, so i'm not usually one that runs out and rents foreign movies...especially foreign dark comedies. i think i can count on one hand the number of films that i found genuinely hilarious from beginning to end. this movie will be added to the short list. even dark comedies right out of hollywood sometimes turn me off because they require an incredibly dry sense of humor. but this one had my eyes welling up with tears. my sides hurt. i haven't laughed that hard in a long time. this movie was recommended by my mother and i don't think i would have even dreamed of watching it had she not raved about it. don't be afraid of having to read during your movie - you'll miss out on a hilariously well-acted flick.

of adam's apple and with your permission. i didn't know until looking it up just now. also the errrrrrmmmmm 'wilbur wants to kill himself' i prefer this very focused deadpan ...drama over adam's apple's over the top comedic zeal. but with your permission is much more layered and subtle, but that's another director.once the 'meaty' part of the story takes place i felt the dread of coming back to the shop again and again. a bit claustrophobic .. maybe that is intentional. it builds on the atmosphere. you dread the rediscovery and again and again until the 'kick in the shin'.this is some funny stuff.

send them to the freezer. this is the solution two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh. an incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror film. the complex characters defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile - if you can stand it. definitely a dark film but also a bit redemptive.

not sure i've ever seen a black comedy from denamark before but this is quite good actually. the humor is suitably low-key and deadpan to go with some of the gruesome activity. svend and bjarne are fed up with working for their boss, because he's always putting them down (in fact he mentions that they weren't bright enough to unzip before peeing at one point). they do what they have to to start their own butcher shop and when a workman is accidentally locked in the cooler overnight while fixing a light, they hit upon something that makes their butcher shop far more popular than their old boss's. in fact, he's the one they sold their first "filets" to, and it's partly his fault, since he served them at a rotary dinner at his house and the guests raved about it and showed up at svend and bjarnes the next day. bjarne is somewhat horrified what svend has done but it doesn't stop there. svend has risen above his sad little existence to be someone of some popularity which is new for him and he doesn't want to let go of that, so the freezer continues to fill up with all manner of acquaintances (and, at one point, "a small swede from the park"). suspiccions arise, though, because ex-boss holger thinks something is wrong. bjarne is also haunted by his twin brother eigil, who lived in a sanitarium for years in a coma and whom bjarne wanted the plug pulled on so he could get inheritance money to help open the shop. when eigil was taken off the respirator he was revived, much to bjarne's horror. and bjarne has a love interest too in astrid, who works at the cemetery. neither svend nor bjarne are well adjusted individuals and so things start to spiral out of control. the deadpan humor really makes this, and while this isn't exactly laugh out loud material it certainly is amusing. it is somewhat creepy though considering the cuts of meat and body parts casually lying around, especially since these two take it all so matter-of-fact. if you're a fan of black comedies this is recommended, i liked it quite well myself. 8 out of 10.

not entirely sure how i stumbled upon this movie, but i'm so glad i did. initially, we were put off by the fact that it was subtitled, but even my dyslexic brother who hates to read (especially at the weekend) enjoyed this film. i found the script fantastic and the way it was delivered in such a dead-pan manner only added to the puddles of pee on my sofa. not entirely sure whether it's quite so funny to the native danish as the comedy seems to be enhanced by the tonelessness of the subtitles and the ambiguity of the translation. i haven't watched many danish films (or any for that matter), but judging by this film i'm guessing they're not constrained by the same political correctness as elsewhere (gawd bless 'em) making the character of eigel a breath of fresh air, because let's face it special needs are funny. there are so many great one-liners in this film it puts american sitcoms to shame.

my family watches this movie over and over. even our 3 year old loves it. i like the "goodness" in the movie. giving the stranger a chance...showing goodwill to one obviously in need of some unconditional acceptance. the movie gives a feeling of goodwill and victory. one other aspect of the movie that makes it so appealing is the personalities of velvet's siblings. the bird lover. the bug lover. the boy lover! very cute and happy movie. there is one thing, however that is irritating about it. that is how mrs. brown often makes mr. brown look foolish or unwise. she, at times,comes off as a know it all, and he as a dimwit, which he is not. too bad to put that into such a nice story. nevertheless, we will continue to enjoy this wonderful, old movie!

i hope we never become to cynical as a society to appreciate the simple beauty of this movie: beautiful to look at with its romantic english countryside, and beautiful in its message of faith and loyalty. watch this with your children, especially your young daughters- velvet brown is a wonderful role model for girls. this was one of my daughter's favorite films.the story is based on a best selling book by enid bagnold about a girl, velvet, whose whole life is her horse, pi, and about her single-minded pursuit of her "impossible" dream. i won't say anymore about the plot less i spoil it for first-time viewers. she lives with a big loving family in a small coastal village.this is the movie that made elizabeth taylor a star, and to watch the film is to understand why. she is a natural actress who radiates an inner beauty that matches her outward beauty- trusting, passionate, innocent- she is the emotional core of the movie.mickey rooney gives a wonderful performance as mi, the young man who arrives on their doorstep one day, stays, and helps velvet train the pi. this is one of his finest performances. also standing out is anne revere as velvet's mother in an academy award winning role. her strong, loving and wise character understands that life isn't of much value unless you follow your dreams: "we're alike. i, too, believe that everyone should have a chance at a breathtaking piece of folly once in his life." i heartily recommend this very sweet, very inspiring classic from hollywood's golden age.

first, let me say that i find films like shawshank redemption and green mile, and most of spielberg to be absolutely horrid and stomach turning. although, national velvet on the surface would seem to be in the same genre and has what should be cringe-worthy moments, i thoroughly enjoyed it, laughing and bawling throughout the film.the premise of the plot, a young girl with an unknown horse from a small village entering the grand national is certainly as implausible as could be, but it is the only thing that you have to accept for it to work as a fairy tale or allegory. the characters have depth and grow throughout the story. ann revere gives an absolutely stunning performance as one of the wisest women ever depicted in an american film. her interaction with the good-hearted donald crisp is funny and sweet. while liz taylor tries a bit too hard to be even cuter than margaret o'brien (she succeeds btw), her passion and love for her horse shines through her face. mickey rooney gives a beautifully nuanced performance of the trainer.this is far from a perfect movie. some of the situations and scenes are a bit corny and dated (the kids' antics, and rooney's scenes at the track and in the pub for example) but it doesn't matter. the plot remains true to the characters and leaves quite a bit unsaid. we don't have unnatural overly dramatic and preachy moments - sometimes more is less. the final scene is a great example of this - the emotional dialog is left to the viewer to fill in.strong understated performances, rounded characters, pithy dialog, intelligent and internally consistent storyline. we believe in the characters and are moved by their story. yup - they just don't make them like this any more...

national velvet (1944) the movie that put taylor on the map. costarring the then number one box office champ, mickey rooney. taylor plays a girl in love with her horse and when jockey mickey rooney is unable to ride in the grand national race, spunky liz cuts her hair, pretends to be a boy and races the horse to...well i won't spoil the end for you. it's quality melodrama that mgm was famous for putting out. and it's another early color picture to boot!

this is a delightful film. elizabeth taylor does a wonderful job, as does mickey rooney. the film just makes you feel happy. it's inspirational, and even though some parts are a bit overly sentimental, that is easily forgiven. i could watch this movie again and again. the race at the end is exciting every time i see it. highly recommend this film.

this is the greatest movie if you want inspiration on following your heart and never giving up on your dream. elizabeth taylor is velvet and in her prime (of her childhood, at least), mickey rooney is a cynical friend who eventually becomes her trainer and they go off to the grand national steeplechase with her beloved horse "the pi"--short for "pirate"--only to have velvet become the jockey and have a chance at victory. to those of you who have not seen it yet, i won't give away the ending but you should see it and once you do you'll love it. notice a very young angela lansbury as velvet's eldest sister.

so the koreans are now knocking off american horror flicks. but they are doing so with style. doll master is a close copy of puppetmaster and dolls, and even has a little child's play going for it. several young adults are invited to attend a special event at a gallery filled with dolls, only to find they are targets of a vengeful spirit. the dolls come to life and do some pretty nasty things to the kids. the gore level is reasonably high, the photography and set design and production values are first rate, the acting isn't all that bad, and the scares are definitely there. doll master may not be in the same league with a tale of two sisters or even dead friend, but it's close. give it a watch. you won't be disappointed.

it's quite simple that those who call this movie anything below "decent" do not know their cinema. "the doll master" creates a sense of dread and suspense rarely seen in movies outside of asia.think of a mixture of "manga" and "ringu" rolled into one and this is what its all about.first rate acting, first rate direction, first rate sets and effects.this is right up there with the best of asian horror cinema; ringu, dark water and a tale of two sisters.an absolute must. take it from a guy who knows his movies.

yong-ki jeong's "puppet master only with scary parts" was the most recent korean horror flick i had the pleasure of watching. with the title of "inhyeongsa" in asia, this movie struck me immediately when i saw it reviewed online, with images that made me think of puppet master, childs play and other toy/doll based horror flicks in the past. but for some reason i didn't think.."boy, this will be tacky", i imagined it would be creepy and fun. toysome horror done well almost.the movie starts slowly, but i like that, so it was fine. the score, almost like i found with acacia, was beautiful and very much reminded me of classic horror scores of the past. i wont give much away, but the story was strong in this one, and i would highly recommend it to any fan of asian horror. it isn't extreme, it isn't to be taken with utmost seriousness, but it is really good.

i wandered into blockbuster with a friend the other night having decided that we were too broke and too lazy to do active. she decided she wanted to watch closer, which seemed like such a repellant idea that i had to rent another film for once she'd gone to bed. looking around i didn't see much that interested me, but saw the doll master in the new releases section. just based on the cover sleeve (a woman with a doll-like face crying tears of blood) i thought this would be interesting enough to rent.as for the film itself, watching it in an almost empty house, with all the lights turned off it was pretty scary. i must admit i've always had a bit of a phobia of dolls since i was a kid (and watched an awful film called asylum, one of the stories in it involved a mental patient creating a doll which killed people. lame, but scary at the time) and the first three quarters of this film really hit the spot for me. the first half hour in particular was awesome. the creepy foreboding atmosphere really set the scene well, and without moving the dolls seemed genuinely threatening. but unfortunately as soon as they did start to move it all got a bit cheesy, i was a bit disappointed when moments that could have been genuinely frightening made me laugh because of the way they were filmed.as for the characters, it's a horror film, you're not really expecting anything memorable. i found i remembered names and faces better than most asian horror films i've seen, which suggests there must have been some hidden character development that i didn't consciously notice. the typical stereotypes are out in force in this movie each one having some kind of character quirk that sets them apart from the others, from shy and quiet yeong-ha and her doll damien, to the outgoing bimbo seon-yeong.the plot itself was fairly cool, even though the ending, which bought together many of the loose strands of plot, seemed a bit confused and didn't really do anything for me, although it did have a couple of really cool plot-twists that i won't ruin here. the basic plot is a bunch of kids are invited to be modelled as dolls by a famous reclusive old doll maker, they have to stay in the creepy house (adorned with scary dolls, some big some small) and things start to happen as our heroine hae-mi starts to explore areas of the house and things start happening to the other inhabitants.overall, i would definitely recommend the film, not to watch with too many people as some of the moments would probably make you laugh if surrounded by friends, but as something too watch on your own in the dark, with the windows and doors open just a bit, just in case any dolls feel like watching with you. it really does leave you guessing for most of the film, allowing you to go off on wild conspiracy theories only to completely destroy them later on. if you really get into it and ignore it's cheesiness in places i can guarantee you'll check under your bed before you go to sleep and maybe even leave the lights on.or maybe that's just me :p as for closer, it was ok but i preferred this.

i couldn't disagree more with those who says this is a lousy movie. me and my friend went to see it during the stockholm film festival and this was actually one of my favorite movies during the festival. dolls being used in horror movies aren't something new but i haven't seen that many movies were it has been as well carried out as it is in this movie. the atmosphere, the setting, the actors, the camera-work.. everything is just beautiful. and they really work well with each other. now if you expect this film to be another grudge or ring then you probably won't like it. but if your out for a good, stylized scare then it's perfect. even though it's pretty predictable and at some times laughable i still recommend this to anyone who likes horror flicks. go see it. now.

this program is a favorite of our family, and we feel it must be released on dvd by seasons!!! the title of "promised land" is very apt, as it is a positive statement about all the good that is left in this great country and the people who live in her! it's a "god bless america" type of program with inspiring stories, old-fashioned values, down-to-earth characters, truthful and encouraging messages, beautiful scenery, and well-written humor and drama. it's a show the entire family is able to enjoy and benefit from--without worrying about bad language, "adult" themes, crudeness, violence, etc. we always felt blessed when we were done viewing an episode and can't wait to see each one all over again when they're finally released on dvd!

i absolutely love promised land. the first episode that i saw, was while i was on my mission from 2003-2005. i really loved the rich family background portrayed in the show. here was a family with struggles of their own, but instead of dwelling on them; they would reach out with love to others who may have had the same problems, in an effort to forget themselves, and go to work. this is what caused me to fall in love with the show. all of the actors; especially gerald mcraney; had demonstrated the true meaning of "family" which has left an indelible mark on my life. i have been down the same road they have, but it has taken allot of time for me to develop that kind of character. i love this show so much, that i have wanted to share it with friends; but i was really stunned when i had heard that it was taken off the air. i thought and still think they should bring it back! so many lives can benefit from heaven inspired media. i honestly believe that this show was divinely inspired; because it brings the spirit every time i see just one episode. this show really (in my book) has truly defined what a "promised land" is. it is the love that you hold in your heart for others; which brings you to a higher destination. the spirit of love, is one of the most potent messages in this series, and all i can say is, bring it back. -robert

hey yall! the best drama every is now on gospel music channel! go to their website to see the schedule and find out what number it is on your cable or satellite this was one of my favorite shows growing up. it has everything that i want a tv show to be, a clean family friendly drama that does not gross me out. the story about a man, who after loosing his work, decides to set off for a great cross country adventure. along the way they meet all sorts of interesting people and find themselves in the midst of all kinds of trouble. this show was originally a spin off of touched by an angel, another really good family show. make sure you check it out!

all i can say is i really miss this show!! my wife & i just got married around the time this show started up!! why did cbs take it off the air??? i think it was the best show for the whole family to enjoy!! it made me laugh!! it also made me cry. but when cbs took it off the air my wife & i thought cbs made a big mistake. you know what would be so great?? have a reunion show!! that would be so cool!!!! anybody know if it is on dvd yet?? on the last season of promised land, did cbs show the whole last season?? i think cbs took it off the air at mid-season. my wife & i will never forget it. the opening with that theme song was fantastic!!! this show only comes once in a life time! may we never forget promised land!!

i thoroughly enjoyed this made for tv movie. i was channel surfing, and came across the start of the movie. boy am i glad i stopped. this movie has a real hot cast, as well as a semi-believable plot. there's drama, comedy, action, and best of all, the human nature aspect of this film is what makes it great. i hope it comes out on video, because i will buy a copy. rating...9 out of 10 stars

the original story and funny compelling characters went over well for a teen girls slumber party movie (2 times now). i loved it, it was fun and moved quickly, no boring drawn out scenes. it is violent and has a little language (though most of it is covered up). its a great movie. david strickland was a terrific actor. ron eldard gave a wonderful performance. i watch it with the girls every time.

this film is completely underrated.it's a film similar to will keenan and patrick hasson's waiting, as well as adrien brody's restaurant and the classic film breaking away, which are all about young adults who are stuck and know they're stuck, with little or no chance of breaking free.death by pizza (delivered) is about an intelligent, free-thinking, artistic young adult (will, played by david strictland) who is stuck and waiting, bitter at the world's hypocrisy and bitter at his own lack of direction and desire. will meets his nemesis, reed (ron eldard), another intelligent young adult who's so bitter, he's chosen the path of crime. both end up helping each other to free themselves of their bitterness, which enables them to get unstuck.for these young adults, getting unstuck, or, breaking free, can mean both forging ahead into life, and plunging downward into death.will's life is filled with the trademarks of a young "stuck" adult: a soul-sucking, sweaty, under-paying job, crude customers, an ex-girlfriend who left him because he was unmotivated, a partial college education with no degree, a house filled with self-made art, and of course the new friend whose ungodly choices help him to save himself.

first off- what are some of you thinking? this is the best movie i've seen in ages! secondly- i don't think of it as a british movie as it is set in dublin and has mainly irish actors- moran, gambon, aisling o sullivan(rita), deirdre o'kane etc.thirdly- i thought that moran was excellent. he was hilariously funny through out. micheal caine seemed only to be there to get moran context. each character he took on he perfected. abigail iversen i thought was better than any other child actor i have seen. she was believable as the smart kid and also as a kid and an adult(yes i know that sounds strange but hey...). even she managed to upstage caine. iversen and moran worked very well together and were very funny in the preparation scene.barreler(gambon) was very funny in his ineptitude.

this movie is all about entertainment. imagine your friends that you love spending time with, the ones that you know inside out becoming a bit silly and perhaps taking on a character or two. that's what this film is about. an inventive script and brilliantly performed. it's not about pleasing the masses with this one, it's about having fun with a bunch of brilliantly talented people. which is what i'm sure they all thought when they signed up for it. the above review sounds completely unfair and i think that the person who wrote that was in the wrong frame of mind when they watched the film. in a lighthearted moment, there is great dignity in it if you care to look.a job well done, i thought it was a great film. i'd watch this before the north american norm any day.in a nutshell, it's not the best film you're ever going to see but it has a hell of a lot of moments. i haven't laughed that long in an age.

tell you what that was excellent. dylan moran is simply the funniest actor on screen( and on stage) and with micheal caine as your partner ain't to bad either, both are great to watch in a really funny film. true, not all the gags come off but its worth sticking around for the ones that do, but come on its got micheal caine in a dress in it( the whole admission fees worth that) and every time dylan moran's on screen its more like bernard blacks movie. the story is two actors(moran and caine) who decide to steal money from a group of gangsters by acting out different persona's to fool them all but getting away with it's a different matter. basically "the actors" is a great british comedy that was somehow missed by many, seriously if your a moran fan(or want to see micheal caine in a dress) definitely see this

look as being anglo-irish i assure you this reviewer is anything but bias. but i assure you this is very much an irish film - and not english as the last comment seems to have suggested. this film was written by neil jorden and conor mcpherson and directed by conor mcpherson too - both irish. the cast is almost entirely irish - it was shot in ireland with an irish crew. even michael gambon was born in ireland - i remember him joking about it in an interview about this film.michael cane was evidently brought in to boost box office takings abroad.loved the film, i just wanted to correct a totally uninformed comment!now on with the review - i loved dylan moran, have always been a fan of his, himself and michael cane formed a surprisingly good double act. it was great to see morans range as an actor as he plays several different made up characters during the film. i would recommend this film to anyone with an interest in comedy - as it represents a fresh, quirky and inventive turn in irish feature length chuckle films. i laughed a lot. what more could you ask for?

this film is a joy to watch and should do well on dvd and video. i suppose you really have to be irish to appreciate the some of the subtlties such as accent, colloquialisms and the dress sense of some of the characters but let me assure you that when dylan moran impersonates 'barreler' the impersonation is quite familiar to most people from dublin because we have many characters in our fine city that look, act and talk like that! the sheer simple comedy employed and michael caines genius acting alone are worth the money but on top of this the plot is great, the script is fantastic and the dialogue fast moving and catchy. a perfect light entertainment movie without the madcap humour of jim carrey.

if you are going to watch this film because michael caine or michael gambon are in it then don't bother, it's not their typical role although i found gambon fantastic. instead watch it for dylan moran i am a fan of everything i have seen him in and this is no exception, i didn't even realise he could act but even the characters which he has to pass himself off as i found completely believable, which is impressive considering the audience knows they are fake.the plot is genius and although it is not constant laughs all the way through it has plenty of other charms. a great film for people with a sense of humour.

although the plot of this film is a bit far-fetched, it is worth seeing just for the performances of michaels caine and gambon. the latter delivers a truly wonderful dublin accent. caine hams it up...which is exactly what the character he is playing should do. entertaining and fun, this is a hour and a half of easy watching.

i know this film has had a fairly rough ride from the critics, but i have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed it. the real star here is the fantastic dylan moran. he never fails to be both hilarious and convincing in all of his varied disguises. he also manages to radiate a sweet charm that belies his outrageous pratfalls. special mention must also go to michael gambon who plays for laughs with a brilliantly accurate and yet comedic inner city dublin accent. the only weak link is caine who, while obviously having a great laugh hamming it up, plays the least interesting and most unsympathetic character. it probably won't play that well overseas but it's well worth a watch all the same.

a ham actor without a penny. who better than michael caine to play such a character? he is totally and utterly hilarious but, as in most of caine's performances, he goes for it for real. the film seems to be a showcase of dylan moran and he's splendiferous in his double act with caine. this, however, is where the script falters. moran's impersonations should have been incorporated in a rather more organic way. they are too much of an act on their own and makes the potential plausibility of the plot fly out of the window. never mind. get it if you can find it. there is enough in it to make it a pleasurable journey.

at first i thought this film was going to annoy me.it was as though i had seen this movie somewhere before. the disillusioned hero, the father figure and the 9 year old sister who is older and wiser than her years (see gregory's girl), but then, not 15 minutes in, it became a laugh out loud, comic gem of a movie. dylan moran (who i thought was just going to bug me) was excellent. as was mr gambon and the mad scottish hitman. lena headey was extremely sexy. for half of the film i was trying to remember where i'd seen her before. the parole officer. she has the most amazing smile. but clearly the true hero of this film is mr caine. this man should do much more comedy. this ranks alongside some of his best comedy roles (without a clue, dirty rotten scoundrels). he is a pleasure to watch in all of his scenes but especially the end.no one can quite say f**k the way michael can. 

i like dylan moran from his work in black books, although i found some of his stand-up to be really indulgent in terms of long confused gaps... however i was intrigued to see this film starring he and michael caine and curiosity got the better of me.i was stunned.dylan's vocal range and characterisation of the different people he was playing in the film was absolutely perfect, something beyond the skills of a mere stand-up comedian and really truly on a par with alec guinness, john hurt and the other greats- truly he was skilled in his portrayal.michael caine was a very convincing prima donna and the standard british film device of having a precocious child on hand to be overly wise and withering worked- the only aspect i didn't really like was the unbelieveable plot feature of the chemistry between dolores and the cockney gangsta's hard man played by dylan.other than that, it was great.i also like the non-cop-out ending where it did end up happily ever after, but with mc getting a beating. ok, it's not exactly being strung up by your goolies and beijng disembowelled (which is what a real crime boss would do to you if you nicked £50k off them) but it showed at least a small measure of reality in the story.i liked the film, and i would recommend it to anyone- but- i would also warn them not to turn it off after 15 minutes because it started a bit slow. if you stick it out, then it will all come back.and with regards to the swearing- well, they're in ireland. it wouldn't be real otherwise.

to surmise, this film involves two actors (caine and moran) trying to con a gangster. the plot is flimsy at best as several plot holes occur throughout. however this normally shouldn't matter as the comedy should carry a film like this. there are some genuinely funny bits (mostly provided by dylan moran). however, other times, there are long melodramatic scenes that fail to add anything to the movie. caine's character seemed overdone to me. especially at the start, he continually quotes shakespeare and acts like a pompous actor. one could say he was playing the part properly but the character seemed to me flat and unfunny. overall i would say see only if a fan of the actors involved. otherwise wait for video or tv.

i was at the world premier of this movie, and have even met todd a couples times around town (once at olive garden). todd isn't a bad guy, he is just a small time film maker with little to no budget and big dreams.as for the movie, it is good if you like zombie films with very little plot and lots of blood and guts. you get to see some kansas city locations and lots of raw meat, what could be better? :-) look for the same 2 dozen people playing different zombies (with just a change of clothes or hats). you can have a good drinking game with this movie, take a shot whenever you see the same zombie in a different shirt.

todd sheets has created one of the greatest low budget zombie movies ever. the story is great, the gore is grand, the psychos are wicked! yet the movie is flawed by its petty dialogue and sluggish imaging at times.despite this zb2 delivers what any zombie movie should, gore, good plot, fast pace adventure into the macarbe. if only mr sheets had been given a 100k budget this movie would out do every zombie movie ever even the almighty dawn of the dead.but as time goes by he gets better and as he gets better more money comes into his pocket. thus allowing this man this modern day genius to craft his vision better.just remember that zombie bloodbath 2 was just one of his great stepping stones when he is atop of gore mountain

i am a glutton for b-movies. i love the old drive-in fare like this movie. this film, made for very little money it seems, does do one thing that some bigger budgeted films fail. it is cheezy. it is gory. it has no real plot, but it entertained me for an hour and a half. i was either laughing or covering my eyes in shock. there are a few great effects like a shot from inside a guy's mouth when he gets stabbed in the chin by a knife and it pokes up through his tongue and slams into the roof of his mouth, and one gross-out with a guy getting his eyeballs yanked out. but there is also loads of zombies, and some psycho killers patterned after texas chainsaw massacre, and a demon possessed scarecrow. i loved the dialogue that the killers spout as they torture and kill people. it has great camera work, and some cool editing tricks. this one is more original than the first bloodbath, and the undead look better, but it is still patterned after those dubbed trashy zombie movies of the 70's and 80's and it still has a cheeze factor that ranks mighty high. don't expect romero, just second-rate fulci. i would say that horror fans will like it, and it is funny and cheezy and a fast ride through b-movie land.

just watched this one again. i wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time. this is why these kind of movies are made, to entertain people and zombie bloodbath 2 does that for me and for everyone i have showed it to.the story concerns a group of teenagers in a van that run into a group of escaped convicts who have taken over an old farmhouse. when a scarecrow (that is actually a demon i think) gets disturbed, it comes to life and re-animates dead bodies from the local cemeteries. this leads our heroes to escape only to land in the arms of two insane killers that are in the process of torturing some people in a deli in a small town. pretty soon it's a showdown with humans fighting zombies.i loved this movie! from it's different formats (black and white film, video and digital cameras) to the very fast pace and great music, there was always something going on and it never bores you! sure, it's cheap, but you can tell that a great deal of care and hard work went into this film. i have read other reviews and all i can say is that these people have missed the point. if you want 35mm full moon fluff, or if you are into modern stuff like urban legend, then i say pass on this. if you like low budget stuff like gates of hell and evil dead, i say buy this now.the make-up and gore is very good, the acting is uneven at times, but over-all it is pretty good and the editing is very impressive. there is enough going on in this one to fill two more films! it is actually one of the better b-movies i have seen in ages.

just finished with zombie bloodbath part one on the amazing zombie bloodbath trilogy dvd from camp motion pictures. zombie bloodbath 2: rage of the undead is next. now this one left me a bit puzzled due to a few plot holes and some confusing twists here and there, but it is a better film on many levels. director todd sheets truly shows a major leap in style and talent between the two films. again, this is not for people who want gloss and hollywood style horror films, this is for people who like their zombies bloody, raw and grainy. the story as far as i could tell, was basically about two robbers who in 1945 try and steal from an elderly couple only to find that the couple are members of a cult. one guy is simply killed and the other, the one in charge, is basically turned into a scarecrow and crucified and they stand him in the nearby field, still alive but dying. cut to present day and a van full of college kids break down near a farmhouse. at the same time a group of convicts escape from a nearby jail. both groups end up at the same house. the house was the one the elderly coupled used to live in and when one of the convicts knocks down the scarecrow and takes it's jacket, it causes the scarecrow to wake up and he in turn brings the cult members back from the dead. wow. and this is all in the first half hour. there is another plot also going on in town where a couple of serial killer types have taken some workers at a deli hostage. this actually works though, as the people trapped in the house finally escape and end up in the same deli. most of the twists work out pretty good, but it is obvious that the film was just too complex in some spots for it's own good. it all ends in a huge showdown with the remaining heroes finding a delivery truck or something full of flesh eating bacteria vials. of course they throw it at the undead and cause some major melting and a few heads to explode and then we get an odd, thought provoking ending. first, let me say, that while it was not always easy to follow, i still had a major good time with this movie. it was fun and the acting was pretty darn good for a low budget effort. it was obvious that todd sheets was truly trying to bring more to the table than a typical zombie film, and in that regard, he has succeeded. it had better special effects than the first film, great pacing and some cool music and visuals, plus there is a true show-stopper of a shot from inside a mouth as a knife is jammed through it. care was taken here and it shows. the weakness lies in the scripting and in a few of the lazier performances. again, i recommend listening to the commentary track. it was even better than the first one and i learned a lot. like finding out that some of the scenes were shot on super 8 film for effect and that the film came back ruined from the lab and they could nit use it. and they had already been editing the film by the time they got the film back, so some of the confusion is from a few scenes not being in the film. also, i learned that todd sheets truly has a passion and love for making horror movies. it shows. the film is a good example of no budget cinema that could have used one more rewrite, but still shines with more style than most dv films i see. not quite as fun as the first film, though a better movie technically. i really admire sheets as one of the true innovators and trailblazers in the area of dv cinema... and this one is a great addition to the cheapo zombie genre!

ok, i got the dvd set last week and i am finally getting around to posting my reviews, but i sure liked this sequel in many ways.zombie bloodbath 2: rage of the undead. ok. this one movies at a fast clip, has some really good gore effects and some really well done atmosphere and style. i would actually go on record as saying this may be one of the most stylish dv shot flicks that i have bought. most of the time, i get rather angry at dv movies for being boring and looking like soap operas. even a movie like bone sickness that i like, has incredible stretches of dull. not this movie. it never stops long enough to let you catch your breath. although i wouldn't say i liked it better than the first film, i will say that sheets certainly improved technically in the two years in between films. this one has better gore, the inevitable zombie feeding scenes, scumbag characters, and a few returning actors (although their roles are different) mainly jerry angell as a pretty good psychopath with a killer mullet from hell. the shots are more ambitious as well as the script this time around because you can tell sheets is trying to pull a lot more off than he did in the first film. some of it works and some of it doesn't, but i have to say that at least he wasn't just trying to do a larger version of the first film. there was no mention this time around of a power plant of chemical spillage, just satanism and the occult that brings the undead back to life. so i say kudos to mr. sheets for trying to do something different with this one. i give this film two bloody thumbs up!

"you can't take it realistically." -sheetszombie bloodbath 2 (zb2) is a world all of its own. i've really never seen anything like it. the only thing i can think to compare it to is psychedelic drugs. forgive the clichéi don't simply mean that it's incoherent and absurd, though occasionally it is. i mean that it takes you through such a broad range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly as to overwhelm you, and when it's over, you find that it's all happened while you were sitting on the couch.it is worth noting that it's extremely low-budget, as a disclaimer to those who, after seeing "shaun of the dead," consider themselves fans of underground zombie films. also of note is that it is much more "brutal" than you'd expect. children get disemboweled, and someone taunts a teenage girl before shooting her in the groin. her corpse is subsequently "raped." these are certainly not flaws, and indeed i feel it is to the film's credit. but if it doesn't sound like your kind of movie, don't waste your time.(i don't mean to over-hype it, regarding brutality. don't go in expecting "inside" or something.) i hesitate to give away any of the plot, because it's really full of surprises. even the opening scene, which has nothing to do with zombies, is at once a classic horror scene and something quite original.man, i'm three paragraphs in and i've hardly said anything at all. here's why i thought the movie was awesome: 1. it's big, and it keeps moving. at one point, you expect it to turn into another notld clone, a board-up-the-windows movie where everyone stays in a farmhouse and argues with one another. by the end of the film, however, the farmhouse scenes will seem like a distant dream. there are also a number of outdoor, urban scenes. these are rare in low-budget zombie films.2. the makeup/gore is much better than zb1. more convincing and more creative. something kind of funny: the early zombies look really lame. then, halfway through, they suddenly look really good, with prosthetics and everything. some of them look like fulci zombies, some are reminiscent of mr. tongue from "day of the dead." and it's got big scenes of dozens of zombies shuffling around. never gets old.3. there's something oddly emotional about it. one character asserts that heaven exists, and that our dead/undead protagonists are now in heaven. in the context of the film, we believe it to be true. though the characters behave with typical horror film stupidity, they genuinely seem to care about each other, and accordingly, i found myself caring about them.4. the pacing is great. there's hardly a dull moment.my only observation that borders on criticism is that todd sheets comes up with the most bizarre dialog i've ever heard. i personally feel it adds to the experience, but i don't think he does it on purpose, so i can't fairly give the film a perfect rating. (example: when a car breaks down, the owner yells at the passengers. then he says something to the effect of, "sorry i yelled at you guys. you don't know what it's like to have your dad standing over you with a straight razor when you're five years old." wtf?) at the very end, it gets to be more than i can handle. involves a montage with bill clinton, and then some preachy end credits explaining the zombie metaphor. really, by this point, i was firmly re-living my drug experiences.highly recommended. 7/10.

do-it-yourself indie horror auteur todd sheets returns with another entertainingly atrocious nickel'n'dime shot-on-video clunker that's basically just a feeble excuse to sling around a lot of watery blood and gleaming guts as often as possible. an evil demonic scarecrow resurrects the dead as ravenous rot-faced zombies so they can feast on the living. a bunch of bickering college kids, a trio of dangerous escaped convicts led by the vicious slade (byron nichodemus hamming it up to an outrageous degree), two equally savage sleazeball hoodlums, and a trio of hottie sisters all have to do their best to survive this harrowing ordeal. that's it for the needlessly muddled and convoluted plot, but fortunately what this hilariously horrendous hoot lacks in narrative coherence (plenty) it more than compensates for with a pleasing plethora of gloriously gross'n'graphic gore. disgusting highlights include a woman having her fingers chopped off, a fatal gunshot to a young gal's groin, attempted necrophiliac rape, evisceration, and, of course, more repulsive entrail eating than you can shake a pile of moist intestines at. moreover, we've also got rough, grainy cinematography that constantly alternates between washed-out color and grimy black and white, ineptly staged fight scenes, lousy acting from a uniformly pathetic no-name cast (jerry angell in particular cops the top crummy thespic dishonors for his laughably abysmal histrionics as slimy no-count psycho criminal joe bob), a grating head-banging thrash metal soundtrack, and a generic shivery'n'ominous synthesizer score. let's not forget the ridiculous ending in which several of our survivors stumble across a few vials of flesh-eating bacteria to use on the shambling undead hordes. sure, this flick is pure dreck, but it has a certain endearingly abominable quality to it that in turn makes it a great deal of so-awful-it's-awesome grade z fun for hardcore aficionados of bad fright fare.

governments are elected for three year terms, as reg whithers said in 1973, the liberals were determined to continue forcing labor to the polls until they were defeated. if you ask me, this is portrayed in the docudrama, but, anyone who says kerr acted properly in this fails to acknowledge the self-serving and costly strategy of the liberal party of australia. on the series itself, i though max phipps was a poor whitlam, his voice was too ghostly. also, more of the key political players on both sides should have been used, though this may have been a reflection of budgetary constraints at the time. nevertheless, i recommend it, with caution.

i first saw this docudrama in the uk in the 1980's, and found myself intrigued and then astonished at how such good intentions could go so wrong. previous commentators (who are australian) have explained the unfolding plot's detail better than i ever could, but i would like to make an observation about what may lie behind the governor-generals 'uk sovereign power'. all modern laws, as i understand them, need an ethical or philosophical root to exist in the first place and to become a law at all. that being the case, and if say the conner's/khemlani mess had been possibly set up,(just how many businessmen/millionares had been served by khemlani, presumably without complaint), then the labour government could have been victims of 'entrapment', which would surely have had to have been investigated' by the governor-general as or until he could see that the budget standoff was a genuine result of whitlam's fecklessness, and not elaborate entrapment, sponsored by 'person or person's unknown'! if its the case that kerr in effect didn't have to refer to the law because fiscal circumstances overrides everything, then 'royal power' borders onto unreason; the implications in any commonwealth country is that 'fiscal' rules literally, and that any person or organisation has carte blanche to break any other rule, physical or mental, so long as they have the control over the purse strings ultimately!

as a canadian, i didn't know very much about the whitlam dismissal. i had read the wikipedia page about those events, but that was about it. earlier this year, when canada went through a potential constitutional crisis (it fizzled out, thankfully) that might have led to intervention by our governor-general, the whitlam dismissal was mentioned in the press. in an effort to learn more, i ordered the dvd of this mini-series through ebay.i was greatly impressed by how interesting the account was. as dramatic as events were, this could have been a very boring political drama. however, it was a pretty suspenseful mini-series. i was also impressed by how understandable it was, despite my lack of familiarity with australian politics. it didn't take long to figure out who everyone was, and what their roles were.having said that, it is not an entirely impartial account. malcolm fraser is certainly portrayed as a rather machiavellian figure, who lets no person or thing get in the way of his quest to be prime minister. gough whitlam is portrayed in a more noble, almost saintly, light. however, the actor portraying whitlam channels the nobility in such a way that it comes across more as pomposity. i thought that sir john kerr was portrayed in a fairly sympathetic manner.i must warn people that the dvd is of very poor quality. i understand that it was made for television in the early 80s, but it would appear that no effort was made to restore the picture quality or sound quality. it was very disappointing that no extras were added either. a documentary, or even some interviews with the historical figures, would have enhanced the experience, but there is nothing.i highly recommend this mini-series for anyone interested in the real-life events.

in nineteen eighty two when it was announced that the dismisal was going to be made , there was a storm of controversy. this was an event which still left open wounds in the hearts and minds of the australian people. after some changes (listen out for the well timed telephones ringing to disguise names) the dismissal went to air. it was nothing short of brilliant. the leads were perfect. max phipps as gough whitlam lead the way, closely followed by john stanton as malcolm fraser and the evergreen john mellion as sir john kerr. the time was created well, the feelings of the people were well done and the political elements were not two dimensionally made into melodrama as in so many american series. the dismissal was a faithful re-creation of a time in australia which some would rather forget and which we cannot forget. it did not take sides and it pointed out the mistakes and lies of both sides. it leaves one wanting to maintain the rage and change the constitution which still allows for this to all happen again. the dismissal is now available on dvd in australia. watch it, learn from it and learn about our modern history.

although i lived in australia in 1975, i moved overseas not long after, fed up with constant industrial unrest, the general worship of mediocrity - unless one is a sportsman! - and the complacency of so many australians who chose to ignore the breakneck pace of change taking place in countries to their north. consequently i missed the dismissal, along with many other australian-made tv dramas of the '80s and '90s, such as the superb janus and phoenix series, which i have since seen, along with wildside.to me the filmed story of the dismissal is fair and, as far as i am aware, accurate. however, as to public "outrage" it only shows one side of the picture, not how families were riven by the controversy. i know, as my two brothers would not speak to me for months afterward. but the commentary is, in my view, very one-sided throughout. the inescapable fact is that, notwithstanding fiery expressions of rage from a substantial proportion of the community, the australian electorate chose - and chose decisively - in favour of fraser, as they did again two years later. this apart, a historically accurate and superbly well acted docudrama.

after traveling around the world, it dawned on me that australia really lacks one thing that other countries have: history.fortunately or unfortunately, australia wasn't establish following a war, it has not had a civil war and most of its political history is rather..... boring! nothing "big" happened to mark some sort of turning point in australia's history.... until the dismissal of the whitlam government by the governor-general of australia - john kerr.for those who are australian, you can skip this paragraph and move onto the next. this is for the benefit of curious non-australians! australia was colonised by the british. as time went on, it became apparent that australia was capable of standing on its own two feet. accordingly, the uk granted australia permission to establish its own parliaments, laws, courts and so on. the law and politics of australia would no longer be provided directly from the british; rather, australia would be run by australians in their own right, even though the courts, precedents, parliament and so on is largely modeled on the british system. this shift was codified in the australian constitution. despite the fact that the constitution lawfully establishes australian governments, law-making procedures, courts (but for those who are curious - no bill of rights), their are two "pro-crown" sections that were included and remain there to this day. these are more or less regarded as the "reserve powers of the crown (king/queen of great britain)." the first group of sections relates to the creation of the office of the governor-general. briefly, the governor-general is considered the queen's chief representative in australia and is described as the "executive" branch of the australian government. when a piece of law is passed by the australian parliament, the constitution states that it only becomes law when it is signed by the governor-general. as such, the govenor-general is regarded by some as nothing more than a rubber stamper performing an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function on behalf of the crown. theoretically, the governor-general can refuse to sign a law passed by australian parliament if he thinks fit. for instance, if parliament passed a law which allows the police to shoot dead any australian over the age of 50 (hypothetically of course) then the gg could refuse to sign it and it would not become the law of the land. however, this power is theoretical and has (to date) never been exercised. by "convention" (which is the buzz word of the events leading to the dismissal), the governor-general virtually acts at the behest of the australian government and therefore, if the government passes law and the prime minister instructs the governor-general to sign it, he will, almost always without question. in fact, by "convention" the governor-general acts in accordance with the advice provided to him by the prime minister of the day (and the prime minister alone). the second aspect is section 64 of the constitution which states that the government ministers hold office at the governor-general's "pleasure." now the events of 1975 - covered in this film - gave rise to a precedent on this particular section: if the governor-general is somehow 'displeased' with the government and/or prime minister, it would appear that this section allows him to lawfully sack the government (which happened in 1975... hence the title of the film "the dismissal.") whether 'at the governor-general's pleasure' can be construed as "the unfettered right to dismiss" is a contentious point though that led to rather heated exchanges amongst australians at the time - especially considering that the governor-general is not elected by the people of australia.now that this background aspect is out of the way, let's get back to discussing the film. it was well made. the pace was patient, but didn't drag at all. the drama was well contained and very realistic. it didn't over-dramatise the events and most importantly, it did not present its point of view from one political perspective. on the contrary, i felt that it was fair and balanced, even though concluding text before the credits indicates that the film-makers probably didn't approve of the governor-general's decision to dismiss the whitlam government. but i wouldn't describe the film overall as bias in one direction or the other.in terms of accuracy, it was virtually spot on. the film-makers certainly did their homework and evidently read the books and writings from all the principle players concerned. there were a number of finer details that were somewhat skipped over, largely because they took a long time to explain and ultimately had little impact on the events of 1975, so i forgive them for that. further, i think it was difficult to recreate the public sentiment of that post-vietnam war era, but noyce pretty much pulled it off.finally, i was pleased that the film attempted to raise individual policies of both sides without becoming analytical, obsessive or judgmental over them. moreover, any that we're raised, for example connor's pipeline, had a great deal of relevance to the story. the film makers realised that their task was to tell the story of the events leading to the dismissal and not to present a political endorsement or opposition in relation to policies and viewpoints. this was smart because it meant that the film can't be accused of misrepresenting one side's policies.the dismissal is probably the most incredible piece of political history that has occurred in australia in its short life. i am glad that it has been crystallized in celluloid. essential viewing for any australian.

kennedy-miller could hardly have done a better job at tackling a very challenging exercise: making dry political events work as human drama, and providing an even-handed representation of explosively controversial subject matter.the key to its success on the first count is brilliant acting, although i was less impressed by max phipps' performance as gough whitlam than some other commenters here. the clear standouts for my money were john stanton as malcolm fraser and bill hunter as rex connor. the latter must have been one of the easiest casting choices in history - hunter could not have been more perfect for the role. on the second count, the series avoids the "myth of objectivity" trap through a narrator who articulates the sympathies of the director (phillip noyce, who more recently demonstrated his left-wing credentials in rabbit proof fence), while being carefully even-handed and sympathetic in its dramatic portrayal of all parties. the adherence to the lady kerr/lady macbeth theme popular among labor partisans was perhaps a little partial, though not ruinously so. in particular, credit is due for the sympathy shown to kerr and the extraordinarily difficult position he was placed in, whatever one might think of his actions.however, there is one sour note for which the producers were perhaps not entirely to blame - the portrayal of the jim cairns/juni morosi affair. those who come to the series with no background to these events will get the impression that cairns and morosi were the innocent victims of a smear campaign by a prurient gutter press. the producers may have been restrained in this respect by australia's stultifying defamation laws, and the recently demonstrated willingness of cairns and morosi to use them against those who suggested their relationship was sexual (which cairns would eventually admit to a year before his death). however, more could have been made of the bizarre fashion in which morosi managed cairns's office as treasurer.speaking of defamation, there are a couple of disorienting occasions where dialogue is obscured due to injunctions taken out by offended principals - by a beeping noise on one occasion, and a very loud telephone ring on another. a further curiosity: the dvd release excises a line from the comic relief scene where a customs officer (played by the late paul chubb) serves tirath khemlani on his arrival at sydney airport. next in the queue is a dishevelled looking hippie, who now receives only a disapproving glare from chubb when he presents his paperwork. in the original version, chubb said something along the lines of: "drug bust in bali, eh?". obviously this line no longer rings true in the wake of the schapelle corby case, which dramatically illustrated that those busted for drugs in bali can expect far worse than deportation.

even a decade after "frontline" aired on the abc, near as i can tell, "current affairs" programmes are still using the same tricks over and over. time after time, "today tonight" and "a current affair" are seen to be hiding behind the facade of journalistic professionalism, and yet they feed us nothing but tired stories about weight-loss and dodgy tradesmen, shameless network promotions and pointless celebrity puff-pieces. having often been subjected to that entertainment-less void between 'the simpsons' at 6:00 pm and 'sale of the century' (or 'temptation') at 7:00 pm, i was all too aware of the little tricks that these shows would use to attract ratings.fortunately, four rising comedians  rob sitch, jane kennedy, santo cilauro and tom gleisner  were also all too aware of all this, and they crafted their frustrations into one of the most wickedly-hilarious media satires you'll ever see on television. the four entertainers had already met with comedic success, their previous most memorable television stint being on 'the late show,' the brilliant saturday night variety show which ran for two seasons from 1992-1993, and also featured fellow comedians mick molloy, tony martin, jason stephens and judith lucy."frontline" boasts an ensemble of colourful characters, each with their own distinct and quirky personality. the current-affairs show is headed by nicely-groomed mike moore (rob sitch), an ambitious, pretentious, dim-witted narcissist. mike works under the delusion that the show is serving a vital role for society  he is always adamant that they "maintain their journalistic integrity"  and his executive producers have excelled into getting him to believe just that. mike is basically a puppet to bring the news to the people; occasionally he gets the inkling that he is being led along by the nose, but usually this thought is stamped out via appeals to his vanity or promises of a promotion.brooke vandenberg (jane kennedy) is the senior female reporter on the show. she is constantly concerned about her looks and public profile, and, if the rumours are to be believed, she has had a romantic liaison with just about every male celebrity in existence. another equally amoral reporter, marty di stasio, is portrayed by tiriel mora, who memorably played inept solicitor dennis denuto in the australian comedy classic, 'the castle.' emma ward (alison whyte) is the line producer on the show, and the single shining beacon of morality on the "frontline" set. then there's the highly-amusing weatherman, geoffrey salter (santo cilauro), mike's best friend and confidant. geoff makes a living out of always agreeing with mike's opinion, and of laughing uproariously at his jokes before admitting that he doesn't get them.for each of the shows three seasons, we are treated to a different ep, executive producer. brian thompson (bruno lawrence), who unfortunately passed away in 1995, runs the programme during season 1. he has a decent set of morals, and is always civil to his employees, and yet is more-than-willing to cast these aside in favour of high ratings. sam murphy (kevin j. wilson) arrives on set in season 2, a hard-nosed, smooth-talking producer who knows exactly how to string mike along; the last episode of the second season, when mike finally gets the better of him, is a classic moment. graeme "prowsey" prowse (steve bisley), ep for the third season, is crude, unpleasant and unashamedly sexist. it's, therefore, remarkable that you eventually come to like him.with its cast of distinctive, exaggerated characters, "frontline" has a lot of fun satirising current-affairs programmes and their dubious methods for winning ratings. many of the episodes were shot quickly and cheaply, often implementing many plot ideas from recent real-life situations, but this never really detracts from the show's topicality ten years on. celebrity cameos come in abundance, with some of the most memorable appearances including pauline hanson, don burke and jon english. watch out for harry shearer's hilarious appearance in the season 2 episode "changing the face of current affairs," playing larry hadges, an american hired by the network to reform the show.particularly in the third season, i noticed that "frontline" boasted an extremely gritty form of black humour, uncharacteristic for such a light-hearted comedy show. genuinely funny moments are born from brooke being surreptitiously bribed into having an abortion, murder by a crazed gunman and mike treacherously betraying his best friend's hopes and dreams, only to be told that he is a good friend. the series' final minute  minus an added-scene during the credits, which was probably added just in case a fourth season was to be produced  was probably the greatest, blackest ending to a comedy series that i've yet seen.below is listed a very tentative list of my top five favourite "frontline" episodes, but, make no mistake, every single half-hour is absolutely hilarious and hard-hitting satire.1) "the siege" (season 1)2) "give 'em enough rope" (season 2)3) "addicted to fame" (season 3)4) "basic instincts" (season 2)5) "add sex and stir" (season 1)

the sad thing about frontline is that once you watch three or four episodes of it you really begin to understand that it is not far away from what happens in real life. what is really sad is that it also makes extremely funny.the frontline team in series one consists of brian thompson ( bruno lawrence )- a man who truly lives and dies merely by the ratings his show gets. occasionally his stunts to achieve these ratings see him run in with his line producer emma thompson ( alison whyte ); a woman who hasn't lost all her journalistic integrity and is prepared to defend moral scruples on occasions. the same cannot be said of reporter brooke vandenberg ( jane kennedy )- a reporter who has had all the substance sucked out of her- so much so that when interviewing ben elton she needs to be instructed to laugh. her reports usually consist of interviewing celebrities ( with whom she has or hasn't 'crossed paths' with before ) or scandalous unethical reports that usually backfire. martin de stasio ( tiriel mora ) is the reporter with whom the team relies on for gravitas and dignity, as he has the smarts of 21 years of journalism behind him. his doesn't have principles so much as a nous of what makes a good journalistic story, though he does draw the occasional line. parading over this chaos ( in name ) is mike moore ( rob sitch ) an egotistical, naive reporter who can't see that he's only a pretty face for the grubby journalism. he often finds his morals being compromised simply because brian appeals to his vanity and allows his stupidity to do the rest.frontline is the sort of show that there needs to be more of, because it shows that while in modern times happiness, safety and deep political insight are interesting things; it's much easier to rate with scandal, fear and tabloid celebrities.

this show came to canada via pbs in the mid 90s and i really, really loved it then. even 10 yrs later watching the various news networks, i cant help but think of the cynical manipulation that goes on in the name of ratings and the various "show ponies" we all see on tv as depicted in various frontline episodes. the scripts are tightly written and the actors all have impeccable comic timing and none of it is encumbered by an idiotic laugh track. there is a lot of funny material here really well executed and we don't need to be told when to laugh and what to laugh at. i don't understand why this show never took off in north america as its truly a gem! i was really excited to see the dvds available, even though they are pal format. i figured i would rip them to my computer and then watch the converted files. i took a chance and ordered it from abc 6 to 8 weeks later, i had all 3 seasons. even better it worked on my ntsc dvd player. i suspect any player bought in the past 2 yrs that does xvid/divx will play them. great stuff! 10 yrs later the episodes all hold up really well! you don't need to know anything about australian politics to get the humor as it will all be familiar to western audiences. my wife and i had a 10 day frontline fest and are still chuckling weeks later after watching all 39 episodes

this is one of my favorite movies. the performances of rip torn and tantoo cardinal are excellent and their performances combined with the music, scenery and reality of the movie are quite compelling. a look at a true, tell it like it is, logging, mountain man who refuses to give up his way of life in the name of progress and development. the music of the horseflies is very unique and adds an eerie quality to some of the scenes. after seeing this movie for the first time, i had to go out and purchase the video and the soundtrack. overall, a quiet type of movie with bursts of panic. both torn and cardinal are very believable in their roles. i put this movie in the same category as winter people with kurt russell and kelly mcgillis, another favorite.

this is an incredibly compelling story, told with great simplicity and grace. the story itself is the object of the film, although the scenery is beautiful. the acting is understated, even superbly so, for the characters themselves come through in all of their eccentric simplicity.this piece of art will likely not be appreciated by those who view movies "casually", without due attention. it takes work to be brought into the story, but once you become involved the captivation is complete!

i was really surprised when i came across this movie on cable tv a couple of years ago. the story is a wonderful example of how our land keeps changing and the fight to hang on to it and use it according to need. conflicting desires of "the people" and the government. the actors were fantastic in their portrayals and i absolutely fell in love with tantoo cardinal-she is so believable and was such a character in this movie, as was rip torn. the story was also a love story about the land, the past, and between the 2 main characters. i have tried to buy this film and have been unable to locate it-but i would sure would love to own it.

seeing that this movie was on the imdb bottom 20, i simply had to rent it.suprise! suprise! i have no regret of seeing this movie at all. in fact, i really enjoyed it. there's a level of camp in this movie that puts cult classics of the 80's to shame. is it stupid? yes, but jim wynorski proves that stupid is not necessarily bad after all.rent it for a laugh that seems unintended but is actually meant to be funny. wynorski is a genius. hope he directs the next ninja turtles movie

ghoulies 4 is pretty ghoulish sequel. the ghoulies look very different from the first three ghoulies, but there still cool. there are some nice flash backs, from ghoulies the first movie. jonathan is back once again in this one. he wasn't in parts 2 or 3 though. the movie is low budget at times, but fun to watch. you've got tony cox as the dark ghoulie and arturo gil as the light ghoulie. the ghoulies in this movie are actually good guys, instead of evil like in the first three movies. both ghoulies are pretty funny characters in the movie. then you've got the very hot alexandra! it's a great dark comedy and funny! any fan of the ghoulies movies will enjoy watching ghoulies 4. the dvd is finally coming out this july 2007! hopefully one day ghoulies iii will be on dvd in the usa. i'd really like to see a sequel to this movie one day too. i doubt it will happen though. it's 2007 now and no sign of a sequel yet. if there ever is a sequel i hope jim wynorski will make it.i give ghoulies iv a 9/10

okay okay, i must admit, i do somewhat like peter liapis and i'll admit this is not the best ghoulies sequel. i mean, yeah, it had its flaws, such as no ghoulies themselves. but the two ghoulies that come to earth were really funny, i guess they were called, dark and lite. i enjoyed the plot of the movie. and even at the end of the movie both ghoulies implied that there would be a sequel. still waiting. lol. peter liapis reprised his role as jonathan graves, this time playing a detective, how cute! ghoulies iv may not be scary or suspenseful, but it is definitely funny. i thought i would comment on this movie and just say -- it's not that bad. it is worth watching even though the ghoulies aren't in it.

ghoulies iv may not be the best out of the series but it isn't too bad, if you don't take it fully serious then you may enjoy it.it's nice to see peter liapis return as johnathan graves who has gave up using magic and has became a detective but still thinks about what happened in ghoulies.the plot is about a woman named alexandra that is johnathan's ex-girlfriend that breaks into a museum and takes a red gem, using the gem she awakens her boyfriend named faust that is johnathan's dark side but he needs the gem so he can enter the real world and john is sent to hell.something goes wrong and alex loses the gem so she needs to find a new one, as she leaves the gateway is still open and two little ghoulies named lite and drak appear. they're not the true ghoulies since they look like guys in a troll costume wearing a mask but that doesn't matter since they are humorous in parts.lite and dark need to find johnathan since he can return them home so they go around causing mayhem as they try to find johnathan. another difference is that the two ghoulies are the good guys unlike the ones in the previous films.i found ghoulies iv to be good but this film may not go for everyone, check it out if you like low budget films like troll 2.

at least one kind. very human and moving. not out to teach a lesson or anything like that. all principals are effective. i saw the movie years ago and still remember it (but can't remember the morgan fairchild role).and a nice slice of american life.

francis ford coppola's first 'personal' film, completed and released in 1969, was the last movie he made as a mostly unknown, up and coming director before the godfather, and is in stark contrast to both that film, and the rest of his uneven career. it's ostensibly a road movie involving a disconnected young woman bored with domestic life, and pregnant with a child she isn't sure she wants, fleeing the trappings her dull marriage and hitting the open road in search of freedom. along the way she befriends a nice man, an ex-footballer player that suffered brain damage from a traumatic head injury, played in unexpectedly subtle fashion by a young james caan, and decides to 'help' him, despite becoming frustrated with his simple ways. her efforts to rid of him always fail, either by guilt or chance, and eventually lead her directly into the hands of an emotionally wounded cop(robert duvall), who has ideas of his own. the plot is threadbare, but coppola does a great job at detailing the emotional life of these characters, and uses editing techniques to relay back story that were not at all common in american films of the time. shots are simple, yet extraordinarily effective, conveying both the moody desolation of the open highway, and the emptiness of american suburban life, infused with a gentle melancholy provided by the film score. coppola also deserves credit for addressing the issue of domestic discontent from a woman's point of view in the culturally turbulent 60's. overall, a fairly low-key film that is not what audiences have come to expect from coppola, but one that is a minor triumph in its own quiet, unassuming way. 7.5/10.

shirley knight plays sara ravenna, a long island housewife who runs away from her marriage when she discovers she is pregnant. she plans to drive into america's heartland and start anew. along the way she picks up a friendly hitchhiker (james caan) who calls himself 'killer.' soon she discovers that the good natured 'killer' is actually brain damaged, and by picking him up she has unknowingly taken on a huge responsibility. the two of them drive all the way to nebraska, where sara gets killer a job helping out at a roadside reptile farm. it is here that sara meets gordon, a local cop, and soon things go horribly wrong for everyone.this is a powerful drama about people disconnected from society, alienated by the choices they make or by the limits imposed on them by others. even with such a low budget and a very freewheeling attitude, the film is able to capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters. shirley knight has a complex, diverging role and there are moments of some awe-inspiring acting by her. one of my favorites is when she is on the telephone calling her home to her worried husband the first time. it is such a tense scene on both ends, and in every small gesture and inflection of a word, so much about her is spoken with so little. then comes in the character of 'killer' played by james caan. this character is unlike any i've ever seen him play, and he performs wonderfully. it's one of his best performances as he is very restrained and moving.the way coppola develops the characters by using short, dream-like flashbacks is very clever, adding a fragmented kind of view onto it all. the quick flashbacks that are graphic and self-contained contrast well with the longer shots in some crucial scenes. also, because this film was shot on location all over the eastern u.s., it offers an interesting, authentic look at america in the late 1960's.i haven't seen many other films starring ms. knight, i'm only familiar with her more recent work on television, usually playing a nagging mother in law or a dotty old woman. it was great seeing her so young, beautiful, and so wonderfully subtle in this movie. it's also kind of a shame that james caan went on to be typecast as the 'tough guy' for the rest of his career, because this film evidenced that he is capable of so much more than that.

**spoilers** simple movie about simple people who's problems are far too complex for them to handle.natalie aka sara ravenna, shirley knight, has become overwhelmed with married life and the fact that she's now pregnant is the straw that breaks the camel's back. taking off from her homes in long island new york natalie has no idea where she's going but hopes to find peace and tranquility somewhere in the heartland of america. it's on the pennsylvania turnpike that natalie picks up hitchhiker jimmie "killer" kilgannon, james cann,who seems as lost and confused as she is. as natalie, calling herself sara at the time, soon finds out jimmie had suffered a serious brain concussion while playing football on his collage team and has been reduced to such a simple minded individual who's so passive that he lets everyone, including later in the movie natalie, step all over him.sympathetic at first natalie becomes very annoyed at the self pitying jimmie for not standing up for himself and letting himself be used as a doormat by everyone he comes in contact with in the movie. not knowing what to do with the child-like jimmie natalie finally gets him a job in far off nebraska as a cleaning man at the reptile jungle pet market owned and run by, mr. alfred, tom aldrege. being the both kind and simple-minded person that he is jimmie lets all the animals out of their cages causing havoc at the pet store and has him fired by his boss mr. alfred.in the meantime natalie who thought that she was finally through with jimmie ends up back at the reptile jungle when she's given a speeding ticket by traffic cop gordon, robert duvall. it seems that mr. alfred is also the acting county judge and is the person that natalie is to pay her traffic fine to. while all this is happening gordon-the cop- had developed a strong liking for natalie and wants to get her in the sack, at his trailer home, the first chance he can. gordon a widower with a uncontrollable 12 year old daughter rosalie, marva zimmet, needs a mature woman-with lots of lovin'- to make him forget his many social and psychological problems and natalie is exactly the medicine that the doctor ordered!***spoilers*** wild and shocking final with gordon going completely out of his mind and attempting to rape natalie, who refused his drunken advances, which has jimmie finally get out of his self-pitying stupor and came to her rescue. there's no happy ending here with natalie saved from being both manhandled and raped by gordon but jimmie, who was bouncing gordon around like a ping-pong ball, ending up dead for all his good and noble efforts.jimmy by far was he most tragic and sympathetic person in the entire movie. all jimmie wanted was a friend to talk to and spend time with and all he ended up getting was the sh*t end of the stick. by everyone even the one person who at first treated him with kindness and understanding natalie ravenna! in the end jimmie even though he was treated like dirt by everyone despite his willingness not to offend even those who stepped all over him came out as the most likable kindest as at the same time heroic person in the entire film.

francis ford coppola wrote and directed this stunningly personal story of a married woman's flight from her husband--and the reality that perhaps the youthful glee and excitement of her younger years are behind her. we learn little about this woman's marriage except that she has been feeling her independence slipping away as of late; she's also recently learned she's pregnant, which has further complicated her heart (she doesn't want to be a complacent wifey, despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone). she meets two men on her journey: a former college football hero who--after an accident during a game--has been left with permanent brain damage, and a sexy, strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life. the clear, clean landscapes (as photographed by the very talented wilmer butler) are astutely realized, as are the characters. shirley knight, james caan, and robert duvall each deliver strong, gripping performances, most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms. some scenes (such as knight's first call home from a pay-phone, or her first night alone with caan where they play 'simon says') are almost too intimate to watch. coppola toys with reality, turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks we've been made privy to. he allows scenes to play out, yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy (there are at least two or three very frisky moments). it's a heady endeavor--so much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later. some may shun coppola's unapologetic twisting of events in order to underline the finale with bitter irony, however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate its shortcomings. *** from ****

i have a letter from ms. knight, who went to college with my older sister. in it, she tells of the hardships of making this film. she, herself, was pregnant--an interesting conjunction with the movie's plot--and the novice director was unsure, fairly green, and having great difficulties with all the decisions, logistics, etc. they were on the move all the time, and it was a very difficult shoot. the film, however, with a strong debut for james caan, remains effective and affecting. it's a great showcase for the talent that ms. knight has demonstrated her entire career--on television, in movies and on the stage, where she won the tony for "kennedy's children."this film has aged well.

in some scenes in the rain people, francis ford coppola's precursor to his hey-day of the seventies, there is the mark of a similar situation to 1969's easy rider, but not exactly in the same reference frame. here we have a drama about disconnected people from society, in some ways alienated by the choices or by limits imposed by one mean or another. it's one of those rare original dramas where some scenes stand alone as total knockouts. even with such a low-string budget and a very freewheeling, so to speak, attitude about filming the movie, coppola is able to capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters and the curved, unexpected degrees of one character versus the helplessness of another, or vice versa, or both. and, as one might be inclined seeing as how it is very much about the cutaways of suburban life of the 1960s, it has that escapism of the film mentioned before, but of a more concrete, near timeless quality with the drama and the underlying issues. in a way, if bergman were on route as a quasi-guerrilla 20-something filmmaker out to get the strange truths of everyday outsiders, this might be it.but along with all of the very direct and sometimes self-conscious photography (though also with a more documentary approach at times, akin with its indeterminable characters), the actors all fit into place. shirley knight, an actress i'm not too familiar with, has a complex, diverging role as a pregnant wife running off in a sort of existentialist conundrum of what life is there to have. there are moments of some awe-inspiring acting by her, and one of my favorites (if not my favorite) is when she is on the telephone calling her husband the first time. such a tense scene on both ends, and in every small gesture and inflection of a word so much about her is spoken with so little. it's extraordinary in ways that mirror others in coppola's films. then comes in the character of 'killer' played by james caan. this, too, is a dangerous character to take on, as it is a mix of childish bewilderment and amusement with scarred memories. think forrest gump if he didn't make it past the football and wit. it's one of his best, actually, by being the most minimalist- for a guy who's usually playing tough guys in movies, here's one that also is part of the crux of the story and of knight's character. also very good in a supporting role is robert duvall as a cop with a rough side and rather checkered past; kind of an early sample of other defected characters he would play later on in his career.so the characters, and what coppola risks in having an uneasiness running in them, are really what make up the film, as whatever story there is it is definitely not resolved in the usual way you might think or expect. the last ten or so minutes are like others in coppola's work, where the specific tragedies on all sides are undercut by the emotional- and psychological- implications this will leave on the principles are amplified to the sublime and sad. this is, for its time, brave on the part of what is trying to be represented (in both the freedom as well as the flaws and ambiguities) in the subject matter. and the style of the picture adds a fragmented kind of view onto it all with quick flashbacks that are graphic and self-contained in a contrast with the longer shots in some crucial scenes. it's a road movie of its period, but its also got a lot more working than it would under another filmmaker with less chances to take on the nature of these outcast characters. one of the best films of 1969.

newly-pregnant knight bolts from husband for non-specific reasons which are apparently self-related. on the road, she becomes entangled with caan, brain-damaged former football star, and duvall, wacky but abusive cop. the type of movie that could only have been spawned in the 60's. worth a look for its non-formula plot and for early performances by future stars.disappointing resolution does not take away too much from rest of flick, which shows an interesting slice of life.

early coppola with sublime cast that most folks never got to see (a pity). there's some wonderful things going on in this one - shirley knight's best performance (an underrated actress), a road trip in the late 1960's, james caan very restrained and moving, robert duvall in a part he was born to play (edgy, lonely, motorcycle cop), and a touching script with f. coppola behind the wheel.if this had been made five years later by some nobody, it would have been a smash (so much for timing). anyway, i recommend this to all people who don't need outer-space explosions and bad mother-in-law jokes or a billion dollar budget to sit for a few hours and watch a story unfold. give this one a chance if you can find it!

for avid sci-fi fans this movie is just what you've been waiting for. watching this movie gets you lost into the characters, especially riddick, the movies bad guy. this is the case where you root for the bad guy and want to see him live and win. as you watch the survivors struggle to stay alive you long to see who lives and how they survive these unknown creatures that have taken over this planet. an excellent movie, vin diesel did a wonderful job as convict riddick and the acting and suspense were ravishing.a+

i've seen director's cut version and can be nothing but content. excellent acting (esp. cole hauser, i was sad about little space for claudia black though), subtle visual effects and photography in overall, believable plot (considering the genre) without a lot of logical holes, really non-predictable twists, build-up characters. these are the greatest assets of the movie. combined with style - some may consider this movie a b-grade effort but i would disagree with that. the whole thing really is very original and stylish.and even though i'm not a fan of vin diesel, this tough guy role of riddick suited him well. can't wait for chronicles of riddick, it's really cool this flick's gonna have a sequel...9/10 if you ask me

reasonably effective horror/science-fiction a la "alien" is fairly well done given its limited ambitions. some nice special effects and well paced action sequences adequately patch the cracks in the rather tiresome dialogue. when a space craft crash lands on a remote planet the survivors soon become aware that a hideous terror awaits them in the dark of the upcoming total eclipse.

(very mildly spoilerish)i must start by saying that i'm not usually impressed by science-fiction, so pitch black (2000) was a pleasant surprise. it had me hooked from the very beginning with rhythm, intensity and visual outburst that left me fascinated and glued to my seat. i'm very happy to say that this movie was the best (okay, at least *one* of the best) science fiction piece that i've seen in a long, long time.the plot in short might sound simple -- a (space) ship crashes on a supposedly deserted planet and the captain, caroline fry (impressive radha mitchell), must lead the survivors to safety. at first, a cold-blooded murderer, riddick (vin diesel, who plays the role with very believable spare style), might seem like the group's biggest problem but as the dusk starts crawling in, the creatures of the night start awakening... this leads to a desperate attempt to escape from the bloodthirsty predators, which, as we all can guess, does not lead to a happy family picnic.it's not the plot itself that makes the movie worth watching -- after all, let's face it, if you strip it down to the basics it's not *that* original -- but the skill in which it's told. the story flowed forward, didn't leave me yawning (at least not much) in any point. the directing was fabulous work. this was a very visual, even beautiful movie; the purple night view was a real treat. although, 'beautiful' might not be the right word to use; yes, the images shown were candy to the eye, but they also added a touch of unspecified grotesqueness, eeriness, as if something was just about to burst out from under the still surface. (not to mention that the monsters were really well done, they looked realistic, which seems to be rare nowadays [maybe people just can't be bothered to make them look real...])i did not only enjoy the visual side of the movie but also the psychological aspect of the story. during the movie we get to see the characters unraveling -- some of them fall, some of them rise -- but what fascinated me the most was the developing of the character of riddick. i enjoyed watching the change in him throughout the movie. to go even further, the other thing i enjoyed a lot with riddick was the incredibly well and originally executed ust (unresolved sexual tension) between fry and him that "didn't" (you'll get what i mean once you see it). [one can't deny that they had chemistry. don't even try or i'll seek you out and make you listen to me playing chopsticks until you scream *grin*] it was fresh. as radha mitchell once put it (a modified quote), "pitch black is a really sexy movie with no sex", which is what makes it even more so interesting.so, to summarize, i recommend this movie -- even if you're really not a fan of "space stories". the suspense was kept until the very end and, what's important, we were (or at least i was) left wanting for more. if you can't be bothered to think about psychology, subtext and such (as is my bad habit), you'll still find pitch black highly entertaining. just kick off your shoes and enjoy.

in the future, a disparate group of people asleep aboard a commercial spaceship is forced to improvise their survival when the spaceship crash-lands on a remote, barren planet. they already have one problem in that one of the passengers is intense criminal richard riddick (vin diesel, in his first top-billed role); however, they are soon preyed upon by a strange species of predator that thrives in the darkness - and a rare solar eclipse is soon to take place.while the script for this movie is ultimately on the routine side, it is decently acted and it is especially well-made technically. location work, photography, and design (production as well as creature design) are all very impressive. it is not the most original or stimulating science-fiction / horror picture ever made, far from it, but it still provides good entertainment. diesel is particularly good at getting under the skin of his intimidating character. it is not entirely predictable, however, and gets some points for**spoiler**having a more politically correct ending than most of its type.filmed on location in the desolate coober pedy area of queensland in australia.a sequel of sorts is in the works.7/10

the influences of other science fiction and thriller movies and stories are evident throughout this film. the movies that come to mind immediately are alien, aliens, and starship troopers. the story itself is fairly straightforward and not all that original, hibernated traveling through space, crash landing on planet with no apparent life and a "deserted" geological expedition - except when the lights go out, forcing different types of people to work together toward their mutual survival, while the body count mounts. this kind of movie always tends to be fun, as long as it's done well. i believe that pitch black was done well. the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.vin diesel plays riddick, the stereotypical convicted criminal who has a murderous past, physically prowess, high tolerance for pain, and conveniently can see in the dark. you know he is going to end up doing the right thing at some point in the movie, because it's hinted throughout the movie that he actually may have a conscience about things.cole house plays the drug-addicted bounty hunter who's probably in many ways a real bad guy compared to riddick, as his character reveals itself throughout the movie. it is most likely that he is most courageous when the odds and firepower are in his favor. a very self-serving character that in the end gets what he deserves.radha mitchell plays the co-pilot on the doomed vessel, who is jolted out of deep sleep because the ship ran through a meteor swarm or the tail end of a comment. finding the pilot dead in his sleeping chamber she attempts to land the ship, which leads to our discovery of that's character's potentially fatal flaw - fear of responsibility, accountability, and being a leader. her character in the short span of the story probably grows the most, in that she actually grows some conviction, takes charge, and doesn't sit around waiting to be gobbled up by night stalking aliens. she in some strange way connects with the ever-distant human side of riddick, who in turn in the end, respects her for her choices and her sticking with them.the story in some cases plays out as you would expect it, but i think you'll be mildly surprised by which characters survive this harrowing experience. this movie is an entertaining train-wreck in progress to watch. go watch it!

*possible spoilers*i thought pitch black to be quite enjoyable, with some nice effects--i liked the larger beasts, although they aren't a patch on the aliens from the alien series. it had quite a good atmosphere, which i felt vin diesel helped contribute toward.one thing which kind of stumped me was how it rained. if the planet has three suns and is in almost continuous daylight, where did the moisture come from to form clouds and therefore rain?i liked the fact that fry died at the end--it reminded me of the new hollywood films of the 1970s, with the main heroine not making it to the end.

this timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be dated. i can't even count how many times i've seen dirty dancing. this is one movie that i could probably watch every few weeks and still love.there is something timeless about this movie. i have loved other "blockbuster love story movies" like pretty woman and when harry met sally. i think their up there but there is something about dirty dancing that just makes it absolutely perfect. the characters, the chemistry between swaze and grey, the movie's direction, the incredible dancing, the warm summery atmosphere, everything about dirty dancing is absolutely perfect. it is an instant classic and i've never really seen a movie like it either before or since.i don't think there is one particular element that makes this movie so loved but many things, a lot of which are mentioned by numerous reviewers. dirty dancing has a nostalgic, languid, summery mood, realistic characters, a relateable honest message coupled with incredible music and dancing, and the one of the best dance sequences cinema has ever given us. this movie is always on tv and i will continue to watch it as long as they show it. but i will mention i have no interest in seeing "havanna nights", this one they should have left alone.

i don't really know what it is about dirty dancing.. there is some sort of absolute magic in this movie.. i cannot possibly recount the hundreds (yes, hundreds)of times i've watched it, beginning to end... but every time i do come upon it on tv, i am entranced and mystified and sit myself down and there i am, for two hours, loving the movie as if i'm watching it for the first time. although patrick swayze and jennifer grey absolutely hated each other throughout the making of this film, they possess a beautiful chemistry on the set.. it makes the viewer enjoy it that much more, to see this passion and commitment.. and i can't help tearing up a tiny bit at the end, when patrick comes up to the houseman family and tells her dad, "nobody puts baby in a corner". (classic moment) for all those people who believe this movie is corny and sappy, maybe in a way it is, but it was the penicle of the 80's films, and put patrick swayze right on the map; his performance was immaculate. three cheers for dirty dancing !!ps- the soundtrack is fantastic, an absolute masterpiece

i remember this in a similar vein to the young ones. we'd stumble back from the pub and watch this or tape it and then spend weeks replaying the lines to each other.we called one of our mates "zipmole watkins" after the brilliant episode in which daniel peacock has a bit of 'restyling' on his nose by the back street abortionist.lots of great lines "remember at 5:30 in the morning you can only get white bread from a brown man. take it easy guy!" - gandhi as a local shopkeeper.tony woodcock was definitely on there in the episode they were teaching ralph (daniel peacock) to be a barman "it's no good amanda i'll never make it as a bar man" helen lederer teaches him to ask people about the match "see the match last night? i thought woodcock played well" after a string of failed conversations the curly haired arsenal star was sitting at the bar: "see the match last night?" "yeah. i thought i played well"we still do odd stupid lines now - "reg and ralph..... or....... ralph and reg. reg, reg... reg reg reg reg"lots of very surreal silly moments and very surreal songs from the flatlets - the back street abortionist a personal favourite with the great ending line - "and he'll mark your packages 'return to sender"good old danny peacock - you added a lot to some young drinkers' evenings sir.**update - i found a couple of episodes on tape - i'm going to upload the gandhi sketch to youtube **

ahhhh, 1984.... i was young and stupid, and just developing a taste for those exotic cigarettes, whilst living in a squat in manchester's moss side, with the most unbelievable case of cockroach infestation.after a few of those doobies, this show was rotflmao material - i was an avid fan. then i'd look down at the floor (or up at the walls, or just about anywhere) and see my very own collection of "little armadillos" scuttling about.not sure if it was the chemical enhancement, but i remember thinking at the time that the overt surrealism of the show was fantastic - it was my second favourite thing on tv at the time (#1 was the season of luis bunuel movies being shown by channel 4). radical art lives on! also you gotta that theme tune! ....i swear, i'll never drink no more....

i loved this show. i used to actually leave the pub ten minutes before closing and run down the road to catch it. i remember daniel peacock's sketch about gandhi in the newsagents as a masterpiece. the set design and lighting were out of this world, creating an atmosphere that you felt you were actually living in. v unusual for a comedy.unfortunately i have only encountered one other person (apart from the other reviewer here) who ever knew that this programme existed. in fact i have to thank the imdb for coming into existence and proving to me that i hadn't in fact imagined the whole series in a drunken haze, which i was seriously starting to believe!

meatballs is a classic comedy with so many laughs that it's impossible to count.in what was merely a precursor of what was to come, murray rules the screen in what can only be described as comic mastery. tripper harrison is one of the greatest comedy characters in the past 50 years. sarcastic all the time, smart when he has to be, stern when he needs to be, and caring when it suits him, murray infuses tripper with that snl glint in the eye.the c.i.t's are merely in awe as they cower beneath the comic genius that is mr. murray.summer isn't summer without a viewing of meatballs. one of the best comedies to ever grace the screen.

i love meatballs! terrific characters and poignant situations make this one dearly loved. bill murray is hysterical and you gotta love that 4-mile trail race at the end! a total classic and one of my favorites now for about 20 years. it brings back fond memories of camp and deals nicely with the experience of being rejected by foolish peers and the empowerment brought one by being rescued by a sympathetic adult. tons of great one-liners and quite an assortment of wacko counselors. this is the kind of movie where you repeat key phrases among friends for years afterward. also nothing overtly crude and what a sweet late '70's soundtrack to bring on just the right amount of nostalgia. i can't say enough about meatballs; it's a classic. be forewarned! all the sequels are putrid stink bombs that simply bought the name rights for marketing. they have no connection to ivan reitman's masterpiece.

when i was younger, this movie always aired on friday night in the summer on channel 40 (this was the years before fox was a network and took over the programming). i always looked forward to it. i'd go grocery shopping with my parents, then sit down with my swanson's tv dinner and a lady lee cola(the only time of the week i was allowed to drink cola, and enjoy. sure, the script is predictably late 70's (like little darlings), but it's a fun movie, and i loved rudy and tripper. bill murray coasts with little effort in the movie, but he is charming. gotta love spaz and those taped glasses (pre revenge of the nerds). chris makepeace is pretty much the same character he played in "my bodyguard" but he does it so well.

"rattlesnake! look out!" "is that a bra you're wearing or are you expecting an assassination attempt?" "spaz, what are you a homo or what?!" "ok way to go you guys! feed fink, he's our hot man" "do you know they use the most sophisticated training methods from the soviet union, east & west germany and the newest olympic power, trinidad-tobago." "oh spaz you old make-out master!" "what, no mustard?!" "oh my god his nose is bleeding." "it's gonna get even bigger now" "our political roundtable...henry kissinger will appear. yassir arafat is gonna come out, spend a weekend with the kids just rap with them."these and many other great lines make meatballs a hall-of-fame comedy. only in caddyshack is bill murray funnier. he probably ad-libbed half the lines. the high school actors seemed to have a blast being in the same movie with him.hilarious movie to watch any time of year, not just the summer.

meatballs works its way into conversations, like no other movie. especially during summer. whether it's the song about the cits (counselors in training) or the cut-downs or the inspirational rudy the rabbit or it just doesn't matter speech...it pops up! poor mickey/morty, who knows where he'd wake up next!?! such a great snapshot of the seventies and a cultural icon for my generation of those who understand that non-pc is really funny, no matter who you are! wheels and spaz are favorites, as is the hot dog eating contest with the famous line "what..? no mustard?" oh, how many times i've reiterated that line and been the only one laughing! thank you to the writers, actors and directors! applause, applause!

the quintessential "let's get ready for summer movie." it's dumb, goofy, and maybe a touch dated, but my kids just saw it and they laughed as hard as i did when i first saw it. in the style of all "little guys versus the establishment" movies, so yes, the plot is very predictable, but it's warm and funny. and no, it's not bill murray at his bill murrayest, but he is starting to stretch out in what was his first starring role. odd, though, to see how few of the "fresh young faces" in this film went on to do much more.

i rarely even bother to watch comedic movies or television these days. they're insipid, vulgar, and, most importantly, not funny. this one could be seen as a refreshing blast from the past. it's worth watching, and i don't believe it would be dated in any significant way. classic humor is classic humor, and good writing is good writing regardless of the era in which created.i would love to see this film again; it came to mind after having seen the somewhat similar "summer school" on television recently. like that slightly newer film, "meatballs" is funny without being cruel, overly sexual or indulging in bathroom humor. the key, of course, is how the adult character makes such a difference in the life of the teen character -- maybe even a virtually life-saving change -- and how they both grow up in the space of a summer.

i first saw this movie in the mid 80's and thought it was a funny movie. as i have gotten older i watch this movie for different reasons. i like to view it when i'm feeling sad/nostalgic for my "lost youth". i was a teenager (14) at the time of the release of this film so i can identify with many of the same problems/dilemmas that the campers/cit's in this movie have. i enjoy seeing the clothes that were worn at this time and hearing the same old urban legends such as was told on the overnight canoe trip. the film is also full of funny one liners. i highly recommend this movie to anyone that was a teenager in the late 70's to early 80's.

if you take the movie for what it is worth, you won't be disappointed. if you think murray is supposed to win an oscar for his performance and that is the type of movie you are expecting, don't bother. it was funny when i saw it in 1979 and hasn't lost its charm. good clean fun for the kids and mindless entertainment for the older folks. the story line is simple and easy to follow. murray has done better, but this is his first film. the movie reminds me of a time when we didn't need blood and guts to be entertained. morty is the head dunce and plays the part perfect. the other counselors are typical revved up teens looking to have fun during the summer. one nice thing about this movie, it has a message.

i know that was a goofy movie, but i enjoyed it immensely. it's one of the experiences that make me smile when someone says "bill murray." i almost always like movies involving the underdog, and this movie has more underdogs than you can count. it's overall a kind movie--some of the adults are not wrapped tightly, but the laughter is accepting rather than brutal like so many teen movies these days. the rich kids across the lake take a beating, but no one i know minded at all. i never went to camp, but i did some things that were somewhat parallel and most of the "bits" and tricks ran true. they were even understated at times, but i'm sure that was an accident.the cast performed well, with bill murray showing hints of what he would become. it's not groundhog day or broken flowers, but, hey, a good goofy laugh should be appreciated these days, but then...it just doesn't matter...............................

luckily for bill murray this is such a light-weight project since he pretty much has to carry it. meatballs is the story of low-rent camp northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another. then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named camp mohawk which culminates in a two-day olympiad competition. above it all is bill murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut.the film is sprinkled with medium-sized laughs, chuckles, and more than a few guffaws along the way. the biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director. three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while he's sleeping. morty, or "micky" as everyone calls him, wakes up along the side of a road, strung up in some trees several feet above the ground, and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake! there are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another, but this is a pg rated film with little in the way of raunchiness.the film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named rudy who is played by chris makepeace. of course it's up to murray to teach the kid how to open up, and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the olympiad. the sentimentality of rudy's situation seems tacked on to a great degree. notice how when murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him, "you must be the short depressed kid we ordered." makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or murray was just ad-libbing while the cameras were rolling. in other words, murray might as well have said to makepeace, "you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesn't fit in." but before it's all over, murray's performance makes this plot device more than bearable. he really seems to have some good chemistry with makepeace.the film culminates with the games between the two rival camps. very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable, but "it just doesn't matter". this is a pretty good film on many levels. don't let the absurd 5.6 rating this film is currently getting scare you off. murray will keep you laughing throughout. just be warned..... avoid the sequels!!!! especially the one with corey feldman!! 8 of 10 stars.the hound.

the plot is predictable. it has been done many times in other movies. you have competing summer camps in this one: the rich kids vs. the underachievers competing for "bragging" rights in the typical camp contests, while the kids and consolers pursue pranks, sex, and "a good time!" "are you ready for the summer?" meatballs is the first (and best) summer camp movie for feel-good comedy. as others have posted, it's no citizen kane, but this type of movie isn't meant to be. the film works because of the wonderful comic timing and classic one-liners of bill murray. his scenes with a camper where he tries to raise the kid's self-esteem are very good. bill's one-liners throughout the film are very funny.i also like that this movie isn't dirty or explicit like so many other "teens at camp" movies today. there is some mild sexual innuendo and maybe one or two cuss words in the entire film. but meatballs is the type of teen movie that is actually appropriate for the younger crowd. it's rated pg.this is a movie that you have to see a few times to get all of the jokes! when bill murray is on the screen or making one of his classic "pa announcements" you are drawn to the film. bill seems to carry the movie all by himself. but he does it so well, that when you see meatballs, you will realize that this is the film that made him a star! a side note to this review is to avoid all of the meatball movie sequels. they are horribly bad.

as a young teen when this came out, i completely related to it. as an adult in the present sex- obsessed american culture, it doesn't have enough nudity to be called tame. if you are looking for american pie-type lewdness, vulgarity or fart and feces jokes, meatballs will disappoint with impunity and a guarantee. if you like bill murray, and you like good clean fun, you will probably like and enjoy this film very much. similarly with stripes, ghostbusters, caddy shack, etc. enough said, just go watch it, and stop intellectualizing it. it's meatballs, for crying out loud! why read a review? just enjoy it and have fun. and ignore the trash talk by others. films, like so many other things in life, are subjective. to each his own. always beware the 'expert' who diminishes others' taste.

imagine spending the summer without your family or friends from school, and meeting new people. or yet, it's your first time where you're a nobody and the only person you can count on is somebody from camp. "meatballs" packs lots of comedy in this film. in camp, there's a eccentric counselor(bill murray) who knows how the boys and girls can have a good time. enter a kid named rudy(chris makepeace) who has no one to look up to. he doesn't fit in with anyone, only tripper can make him have fun. the rest of the can are just as crazy as tripper. camp northstar is an average camp with an above average team. one the other hand camp mohawk is an elite camp that has them running for their money. in the basketball game, the mohawks got pantsed! and in the olympiad the northstar teal got the revenge they needed when one of the members take out the saboteur. and morty(harvey atkin), this poor soul can never get himself in gear if he tried. a very, very funny comedy, and it's a big keeper i'll say. this movie shows that camp can be fun, if you wanted to be! 5 stars!

i liked this movie for the most part, but have to say had there been anyone else besides bill murray in the lead role it would not have been as good. he brings an energy to the role that steps this film up a notch than it would have been otherwise. i mainly enjoyed the pranks pulled on the one counselor and there are other humorous things in this movie too such as the hot dog eating contest. this movie would also set the stage for summer camp movies with the competition at the end. nearly every camp movie has either this or the unruly or troubled kids plot, or a combination of both. this series also would take a rather strange shift in tone as this one and two are both family friendly movies while part three and four are more adult oriented, more like the old teen sex comedies of the time. it kind of did the opposite of the police academy movies that went from r to pg-13 to pg movies. this series goes from the opposite to r. still this first one and only good one is worth some chuckles largely due to bill murray.

this film marked the end of the "serious" universal monsters era (abbott and costello meet up with the monsters later in "abbott and costello meet frankentstein"). it was a somewhat desparate, yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the wolf man, frankenstein's monster, and dracula one "last" time.i say desparate, because in the previous film, "house of frankenstein," both dracula and the wolf man are killed according to how the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be (dracula by the sunlight, and the wolf man by a silver bullet). yet somehow they return in house of dracula with no explanation. this movie could have played as a kind of prequel to house of frankenstein if the frankenstein monster plot wouldn't be continuing chronologically into house of dracula from house of frankenstein, and if the wolf man didn't get cured. then there'd be no plot holes. but since this is not the case, the plots of dracula and the wolf man make no sense.however, ignoring these plot holes, house of dracula is a classic atmospheric horror film that's fun to watch. it has many high points. especially seeing the wolf man get cured. i know i just said that this shouldn't have been included, but it was nice to actually see him get cured after all this time. and the scene with the lady playing "moonlight senada," on the piano then all of a sudden playing a haunting melody when under dracula's spell was very eerie. dr. edleman's transformation into the "dr. jekyl/mr. hyde" type character was also done very well.and it's great to see dracula, frankenstein, and the wolf man together, one "last" time.*** out of ****

the second (not animated) movie about the only people still refusing to surrender to the roman empire is even more hilarious than the first film "asterix & obelix contre ceasar".where the first movie got all the laughs because all cartoon-characters were so perfectly brought to life without losing their cartoonesque identity, this sequel (which is a separate story as are all the comic-books) is even better. sure, all the ingredients that you find in the first movie and in the comic-books are present again: obelix is still dying to taste the "magic potion" that gives his other tribe members such enormous powers, caesar and the rest of the roman empire are still enemy number 1, but some new, refreshing elements have been brought to the stage as well.not only is setting very idyllic (biggest part plays of course in egypt) but rather than repeating movie number one, some extras have been added by making all kinds of references to other movies (bruce lee etc.). this is all not very new, but the unexpected combination of the known story from the comic-book (with almost the same title as the movie) and references to stuff that has got absolutely nothing to do with asterix & obelix really works.in that way the movie builds further on a tradition by comic-writers goscinny and uderzo who didn't hesitate to bring laurel and hardy on the stage and even dedicate an entire story to kirk douglas.if all of this doesn't convince you to watch this movie, i'm sure monica bellucci playing cleopatra will....

cleopatra (the delicious monica bellucci) is challenged by cesar (alain chabat): in order to prove that the egyptians are better than the romans, she promises to build a fancy castle for cesar in a period of three months, without any delay. she calls the one-arm architect numerobis (jamel debbuzi) and gives him two options: to be covered by gold if he accomplishes his mission, or become crocodile food if he fails. numerobis will ask for help to panoramix (claude rich), asterix (christian clavier) and obelix (geraard depardieu) (with ideiafix). this movie is very funny, specially the parts where obelix and the pirates leaded by red beard participate. however, the screenwriter and the director should have noted that french is not an universal language as english is. therefore, the jokes with words (like in austin powers movies, for example) does not work well for people strange to french language. french people and persons fluent in french language will certainly like these jokes, but they do not make any sense for me, that do not speak french. my vote is seven.

eh oui, impossible n'est pas gaulois.well paced, highly entertaining film. pretty good command of the french language and knowledge of modern france (and history) are recommended. i don't think this film really works in any other language. the film is incredibly much better than the previous one (in search of...). apart from great actors and savvy camera handling it's the wit and firework of allusions, word plays etc. that make for a really great movie. the cartoon vorlage is recognizable but the film is very emancipated. the cost of the film is put to good use. indeed, all the special effects fit 'naturally' into the movie, you never feel choked by them.bref, oui, les 2cvs, ça traîne un peu mais à part cela, imhotep!-a neighbour from the other side of the rhine

i was a little afraid when i went to the cinema to see this movie. indeed, it is always tough to make a movie from a comics and the first episode of the adventures of the french two greatest heroes was good but not fantastic. finally, it is very funny from the beginning to the end with unexpected gags, some cartoon scenes, no timeouts, great fx, a great cast, great landscapes, great everything !!!however, i wonder how they will manage to translate all the french names in english or german, because it is certainly funny in french but how will it be in another language ???

this movie is just great... it starts out real slow and boring but as the movie progresses.....well the fun keeps on coming. the power of the movie is perhaps in it's subtle references to a lot (and i mean a lot) of other movies. for me the best part was perhaps the bruce lee/crouching tiger, hidden dragon scene. how the two actors switches from french to chinese or whatever asian language it was, it was awesome. then the jokes with the names, they are hilarious but perhaps you won't understand all of them when your an american (no offense). overall a great movie

the french people are not known to be great movie producers.though their amelie scores high points at the oscars. asterix et obelix is a very different film of what i am used to from the french. it is a great movie especially for kids. the only thing that boddert me was that it was spoken in french and subtiteld. normally with the english spoken movies (here in the netherlands) i don't have to read the subtitles. but with the french language you just have to read to understand. the story it self is just great with obelix who doesn't recall him self of beïng fat, but there also nice details mainly in names like brucewillix and malcomix. you all know the story from the comic books and this movie shows all most slide by slide the book. every thing is in it, from the sfinx nose braking till pirate red beards lose of three more ships. i would say a great movie for the weekend with the children.

this movie is quite better than the first one "astérix et obelix contre césar", but it is far away from perfection. the adaptation of the comic book is good, some of the pictures and the dialogs of the movie are the same as in the book. but there's few things that made the movie not as interresting as the animated movie released in 1968. for example the fighting between numerobis and amonbofis. this wasn't necessary or even credible, either for the little love story of astérix. there were also some stuff missing, like the songs that are in the animated movie, and some other things... i am deceived by the movie because they cutted in the stuff i was expecting tho see and they showed things that i did not wanted or needed to see. i know that it would have been very difficult to make the movie exactly the same than the comic book or the animated movie, but that's what i expected. in conclusion, even if the movie is good, i still prefer the animated movie, wich is in my opinion, far better.

the above line sums it up pretty good. the best assets of the comics are it's visual gags and word-jokes (the latter of which are almost impossible to translate, which is why the comics are at their best in their original language).both are quite hard to capture in film, which is why those will never be as good as the comics. movies are simply a different medium than comics. with that in mind, this movie does surprisingly well in capturing the fun of the comic.the word gags are bearable, and sometimes even funny (debouze does an amelie reference!). i have to mention that i watched the french version. if you don't watch the french version or your lack of understanding of the french language limits you to the subtitles, the word jokes will probably suck.the slapstick is okay as well; it's a very simple form of humor, and not really funny when you're older than twelve, but it captures the spirit of the comicbooks. the other visual jokes are the movie's saving grace for the older audience, as their often quite funny.the acting is totally over the top, but again, that's not annoying at all as it captures the spirit of the comicbooks. only depardieu and clavier don't really overact, which might be the reason some people think they didn't enjoy their roles (i didn't notice a thing). on the other hand jamel debouze and especially claude rich turn overacting into an artform. it's actually fun to watch. again, i fear it wouldn't be nearly as funny when the voices are dubbed.overall not a bad movie at all, much better than the previous one. it's not a classic and it doesn't dethrone the twelve tasks of asterix as my favourite asterix movie, but it's still worth seeing. the french version, that is. 7/10

if you are french native, then you find this movie extremely funny. it's good, just good! can though imagine that subtitles or translations don't mean much in english.

i don't know about the english version of this movie, but the norwegian translation is the funniest movie i've seen in many years. the characters say so many funny things and make so many weird references to current events that i'm amazed they kept having more options, like the architect who can never say the name of the wizard miraculix correctly. it becomes things like malcom(i)x and "utenriks", which is norwegian for foreign affairs.like the word "utenriks", many of the translations does not give any meaning in english, and probably not in french either, so the translators must have made up their own jokes, and done so very well. of course, they have a very good base to build on, with a film that's simply comical from beginning to end!recommended in all languages with a good translation!

in the original french version, the jokes of numérobis (great, funny voice - jamel debbrouze) are very funny.but in translated versions (i saw the german & english version) it's not half good than the original.but: goof special effects, almost the full comic (with differences, like the figure of lügnix (german name) is placed in an other comic book.sure, the asterix comic book are cult, but when you watch the animated comic movies from 1968 to 1998 you will see much better jokes, better story and the old "charme" and "flair" of the cult stories.for french speaking people i suggest to watch it in it's original version, with or without subtitles, where available in different languages.

the second live action outing for asterix is far better than the glued together elements of ten different stories that was called the first film, instead staying fairly close to the original comic.in a nutshell, queen cleopatra has made a bet with caeser to build a palace in egypt to show that the egyptians are a great people. royal architect edifis seeks the help of asterix, obelix and druid getafix to complete his task. there are several laugh out loud moments, some jokes that only the french might get (jibes at the 35 hour week) while others that are more universal. the big budget special effects are spectacular but overshadowed by the jokes from the original comic.depardieu and clavier still work brilliantly as a pair while monica bellucci makes perfect casting as cleopatra. also, for fans of the comics the hilarious pirates get a look making up for their absence in film 1.

a great combination: - chabat's humor - uderzo/goscinny world and characters - limited presence of christian clavierthe original comics was great - one of the better of an overall great series - and alain chabat, one of the funniest member of the famous french group les nuls, was able to film, replicate and supplement, the great work done by goscinny and uderzo by cleverly enforcing the story, giving to djamel debouze his best role (at last a little bit far from his usual repeatable part), gathering a bunch of great actors (gerard darmon is wonderful, as often, chabat himself is a great cesar).in addition, while being obligated to keep on with christian clavier as asterix, chabat cleverly tuned down his role in the movie to give prominence to darmon and debouze... which is always a good idea!=> great environment, great scenario, great director, great actors, great humor, beautiful cleopatra... this movie would have deserved a 10 if clavier hadn't been involved.

i watched asterix and obelix in operation cleopatra, which was my first exposure to the live action version of the classic comic. like the comic the whole movie is full of jokes based upon puns, anachronistic jokes and slapstick gags which rarely fall flat.asterix and obelix are gauls who use a strength potion to fight the roman legions in their native gaul. here they end up in egypt helping a friend build cesar's palace (yes its puny) in three months to prove the egyptians are just as good as the romans.the reason i picked this up was because monica belluci is cleopatra. she's good but the role is little more than a cameo. however, even though she's rarely in the film i didn't care since its so clever and the jokes so funny i was in hysterics. i loved it. i loved it so much that i can't understand why the movies have never been released in the united states.the import dvd has the film in english dub- which is quite good especially when you consider that when you watch it in the longer french version the puns (and hence the jokes) are not always apparent since they are aural, so if you read the names wrong the jokes are lost. most of the jokes between the full french version and the shorter english dub seem to be exactly the same, though some have been changed sometimes for the better and some times for the worse. personally i'm gonna stick with the dub when i watch this again since its easier to pick up the jokes and enjoy the humor.you really will want to see this if you love puns and low brow, but clever humor this is a great comedy

it is the first time i can recall where an adaptation did exactly like the book... in fact, only jokes were added to the story rather than content blended or removed!such as the egyptian slave cellularis who had difficulty transmitting, um, communicating, lol! or when tidivinnus was played like a quasi-sith lord and got annoyed when the roman empire endured a blow, the general ordered for the empire to..? ah, watch the movie folks!i can easily believe that this picture was one of the most expensive in french cinema history and for my part it was worth it, depardieux was excellent as the roman bashing and boar chomping obelix. clavier playing the little indomitable gaul was perfect and a far cry from his days as the bumbling squire of jean reno in "just visiting."the fight-scene between artifis and edifis was hilarious and was nice to see the matrix theme was not borrowed to despoil an otherwise perfect battle!redbeard the pirate and his crew almost stole the picture, from scuttling their own ship to being the engine for otis' (edifis' assistant) invention used at the very end.i understand there's asterix and the olympics with many of the same team back, by toutatis, i plan to view that too!

i just managed to find a copy of "mission cleopatra," which is not as easy as you would think for someone living in the united states. so far, i have only watched about the first 10 minutes of the film, and i can safely say that i laughed more in those 10 minutes than i did watching the entirety of the *first* live action asterix movie.i am watching the dubbed version, and while the dubbing job is a little disconcerting, i have found the movie to be very funny and true to the book. i see that people on here have said that the dubbed version is very inferior to the subtitled version, that may very well be true, and after i watch the subtitled version (also on my dvd) i may have to come on here and alter my review. as it stands, though, i find it to be a very entertaining movie, and it more than makes up for the mess which they made out of the first movie.

i've read every adventure of asterix and obelix at least 5 times and i'm also a fan of "les nuls" and "les robins des bois" and jamel so i expected a lot from this movie.... and i finally got satisfied. unlike the first adaptation of asterix on the big screen (astérix et obélix contre césar) which wasn't a real success besides the appearance of laetitia casta, this one really captures the spirit of the comic (and we get the beautiful monica bellucci). in the first movie the director tried to be too realistic about the time where the story is set and it killed the whole spirit that made asterix hilarious. in this one all the clothing, the way of talking and everything is identical to goscinny and uderzo's work... more, it really stick to the original story with the downside that we know pretty much everything that's going to happen but alain chabat gave us a few surprises at the end. i really enjoyed that movie, and everytime that the first sign of boringness starts to appear, jamel comes in and makes us laugh like crazy. this movie is a big mix of all the kind of humor i really like, and even if maybe it's mixing it too much, i can't help but to like it. so, if you like asterix and the humor of all these young talents that started in "nulle part ailleurs" (a french mix of the tonight show and snl) go see this movie.

i give this a 10 out of 10, not because the plot was hard to uncover because it wasn't... but because it leaves one caring for the characters. the acting, by all the cast, is superb, especially joan hickson, and it's a marvellous episode because of it's heart. miss marple is called upon by jason rafiel's dying request to investigate, and solve, a murder that happened some seven or eight years previously, and she has to discover who, why and when as she goes along. mr rafiel is the same rafiel as was in a caribbean mystery and so there is a sense of a connection here. nemesis is definitely one for the amateur psychologists among us, and if you are one of those who is only happy with lots of blood, guts and rip-roaring action sequences, then you won't like it. but if you are like me, one who loves knowing about people and discovering what makes them tick, then nemesis is the one for you.

made the same year as the first lumiere films, this is a much more dramatic short than the brothers attempted until the following year's 'niagara'. the surviving print is very rough, but this only adds to the turneresque visual violence, as huge surges of water dash against a stolid pier, and seem ready to engulf the camera, the viewer.if you watch a number of these early shorts in chronological order, and try to get into the mindset of the times, there is a further shock in that, unlike the single frame set-ups of the lumieres, this film features an edit, which for me at any rate, was as slashing as the razor blade in 'un chien andoulu).unlike the mono-vision of the lumieres' films, paul opens up the possibility of multiple perspectives, freeing the viewer from the power of nature, eluding its grasp in a way the lumieres never could. the second shot features a similar gush to that of niagara, but is less frightening because, by way of the edit, we have sidestepped the danger. in a film like 'l'arroseur arrosse' or 'repas du bebe', nature stands indifferent and powerful, uncontainable by the camera. basic film grammar puts an end to its supremacy.

anyone who has seen the trailer for this film would be forgiven for thinking this film is an out and out comedy. in actual fact it's a light-hearted, though not overly funny, romp about a couple of highwaymen.there are numerous faults in the film. the script and plot are weak and the love aspect of the story is strangely dull. yet despite all this it is quite enjoyable, thanks largely to the two leads robert carlyle and jonny lee miller. these two fine actors, carlyle in particular, are always good to watch and here there exists a good chemistry between them.director jake scott is the next generation of the family whose brothers, ridley and tony, have given us films such as alien, blade runner, true romance and more recently g.i. jane and enemy of the state. his debut is directed with energy and enthusiasm, which keeps the film fizzling along, although without the strong cast he assembled the results might not have worked as well.in short if you're looking for an easy enjoyable film to pass an hour and a half then you could do a lot worse than plunkett and macleane. if on the other hand you fancy something subtle, historically accurate and thought provoking, go elsewhere. 7/10.

i just watched this movie for the first time after finishing the book last week. what's the problem here? folks admit that the performances are great--i mean, lange is stellar!--and that the film is good-looking, but it's got less than a '6'! i don't get it. come on! the writing's not that bad!having read a lot of pulitzer-winning novels, and having seen a lot of the films based on them, i think a better-than-decent job was done in bringing the screenplay together. i thought the paring down of all the dialogue in the novel was executed almost perfectly. this story had a pretty hefty amount of dialogue in it, and the story really came through on the screen despite the fact that only a portion of it was used.**book spoiler part** i was, however, a little disappointed in the ginny-tries-to-kill-rose subplot's being omitted. i thought that was one of the more emotionally jarring parts of the book, but it was probably a good bet to leave it out. avid movie-goers, more than avid readers, i think, tend to be less forgiving of protagonists pulling antagonistic stuff. it's apt to confuse johnny lunchpail and joe sixpack.if you loved the book, you will like the movie. if you hated the book, you will likely hate the movie.********rog

okay...so i am gazing through my mom and dad's extensive dvd collection (mostly because they don't charge late fees;-)) and i come upon "a thousand acres." i was stunned that here was a movie that had jessica lange and michelle pfeiffer (with a small appearance by jennifer jason leigh) that i had not seen. i don't think i had ever even heard of it before. well, this is exactly the kind of find that i dream about since i have to admit that my parents raised two movie buffs in my brother and me. with a few exceptions (neither of us can even get them to consider watching the lord of the rings movies, but my dad loves the matrix trilogy -- go figure), we have very similar tastes in movies.it was a particularly awful day today, weather-wise. it poured rain all day, so i popped in this movie and shortly after i was mesmerized.this has to be one of the all-time best "sleepers" i have seen. jessica lange and michelle pfeiffer are great in their roles especially since they are playing very different types. jessica lange's character is a people-pleasing follower who, despite her being the senior child in the family rarely takes a leadership role. rather, she bows to her father (jason robards) and sister rose (pfeiffer) and is hell-bent on teaching her little sister caroline (leigh) how to follow suit. michelle pfeiffer plays a very strong willed cancer survivor who is barely able to keep the anger at her unhappy life contained. this movie is five years prior to white oleander, mind you, so it was definitely inspiring to see her playing such a strong, angry character.i would have to say that this movie will probably appeal more to women. however, true movie buffs who enjoy a film for what it is, regardless of genre or target audience, will have a hard time denying the charm of this touching drama about family secrets and what they do the people involved and those who love them. i don't know how i missed seeing this movie before now, but it sure was a nice distraction on a rainy afternoon. enjoy!!

a touching movie. it is full of emotions and wonderful acting. i could have sat through it a second time.

i watched this movie, having never read the book, and took the characters at face value, but having already been introduced to them, watched it again recently. i got a whole different viewpoint out of the film.without the burden of having to focus intently on each character, learning their quirks and foibles, allowed me to focus on the cultural issues laid out in the film. the farm families of iowa are so intimately inter-related as they are in the area of indiana where i grew up in the 40's and 50's that i immediately recognized the back-stories and motives behind the characters. perhaps, jane smiley did mean for us to see beyond the superficial into the world these people had to live, but viewers are so caught up in the "hollywood" aura of the individual actors that they miss a rich layout of a lifestyle that exists less and less as each decade passes. another film with these characteristics is the "bridges of madison county". try watching both of these films again with an eye to the whole picture.

a jane smiley novel, loosely based on shakespeare's king lear about the cook family and its dark secrets. director moorhouse seems tamed in her approach, allowing the characters to step forward and take a bow. and how could you go wrong with the talents of pfeiffer, lange, leigh, firth, carradine and robards?

low budget, mostly no name actors. . . this is what a campy horror flick is supposed to be all about. these are the types of movies that kept me on the edge of my seat as a kid staying up too late to watch cable. if you liked the 80's horror scene this is the movie for you.

this movie was talked about in fangoria where i heard about this, it was interesting to me mostly becuase it was direct-to-video and i recognized two of the stars on the cover, james marsden of disturbing behavior and christine taylor from the craft. and to my surprise on valentine's day when i was searching through the horror aisle to find it on the shelf! i immediately had to grab it. me and my brother and our girlfriends watched it and to my surprise it was pretty good, the tales were interesting and for once they were actually scary, unlike a lot of other horror movies being made recently. some of the plot i do not understand but once i watch it again i bet i'll get it. and to even more of my surprise there were other stars i recognized including one of the girls from the tv show my so-called life and jacinda from the real world, i'm not sure why this movie was only direct-to-video, with a little advertising this movie could have at least made up for how much money was spent on making it. the only problem i have is that since it wasn't released in theatres i guess i'll never be able to view it in widescreen. you should definitely take a chance and rent this one.

i loved this movie! i'm shocked and disappointed that it never made it to the theaters. every story was better than the last..much better than the much hyped "scream" series and "i know what you did last summer"and way better than the terrible "urban legend". i'd recommend this film to every horror fan.

it may not have had the big budgets, celebrities or endorsements of scream, urban legend or i know what you did last summer, but campfire tales had one thing these three movies lacked: true horror.this film tackled the subject of urban legends a year before the aptly titled and less than enthralling urban legend did. it was intriguing, masterfully scripted and logical in a way i know what you did last summer could only dream of. finally, it held its focus and finished with a flurry while scream fizzled and died.what's most exciting about the film is the variety of horror that the writers and directors achieved. the overarching story of teenagers around a campfire was classic dread at the unknown (but certainly expected) doom that awaited them in the forest, but the tales themselves are where the movie really shined.the opening sequence is pure, fast-paced urban myth. it's based on a popular legend, and the director plays on this with the style and pace of the action, making it more enthralling because we know what's going to happen.the first campfire tale is a straight-forward thriller. based on another popular myth, we don't actually realize this until the end, both because it blends so well into the story and because the action keeps our attention. being the thriller of the trilogy, this one plays off our fear of the unknown and includes several well-done "jump" sequences that don't feel nearly as cheap or contrite as those in movies like scream or urban legend.the second tale is more suspense. this time, though the characters still don't know what's going on, we do, and this provides the horror. no need for cheap thrills here.the final tale contains elements of the supernatural and uses a creepy/trippy atmosphere to scare the viewer. because we can relate so easily to the characters and their situation, our fear comes from their intensity and what they can't explain. this is the true ghost story of the trio.i didn't expect to enjoy campfire tales when i rented it. i figured that if i didn't like its more acclaimed, bigger-budget counterparts, how could i like it?the truth is, though, this film succeeds where the others fell far short of the mark.

this movie is so awesome! i loved it, it was really scary. i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there. it probably helped that i watched it at midnight. if you want a real scare rent this one! 10/10

i switched this on (from cable) on a whim and was treated to quite a surprise...although very predictable this film turned out to be quite enjoyable...no big stars but well-directed and just plain fun. with all the over-hyped crap that is out there it is very nice to get an unexpected surprise now and then... and this little film fits the bill nicely. 9/10

i cannot believe i enjoyed this as much as i did. the anthology stories were better than par, but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me. alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself "where i have i seen them before?" forget the running time listed on new line's tape, this ain't no 103 minutes, according to my vcr timer and imdb. space maggot douses the campfire in his own special way and hikes this an 8.

graphics: brilliant, obviously. the most stunning things were definitely not given away in the trailers. fight sequences move extremely fast, but after watching a couple of them your eyes should be used to it and it won't seem so confusing. cloud has a wide array of swords, and i kinda wish things were moving a little slower just so we could see them, because they were each incredibly detailed. oh, and we finally get to see exactly how one equips materia...music: brilliant also. i was a bit nervous about it, since (from what i've seen) nobuo isn't the best at writing music to go along with action (remember the steal the tiny bronco sequence?), but it's brilliant and it fits perfectly. i'm glad i preordered the ost. they changed the lyrics to one winged angel though, so you won't be able to sing along if you know the carmina burana lyrics.plot: the first half of the movie sets up things and introduces everyone in a fairly complex tapestry, but the second half is almost entirely fight sequences, once all the players are in place. i wouldn't call it a weak plot, but it's nowhere near as convoluted as the game's plot was. i think this is in an effort to avoid trying to overshadow the game, and i think that's a good thing...the movie is its own entity, and shouldn't try to top the original in terms of sheer plot.i admit, i was kind of hoping that this movie would bring ff7 to a wider range of people, but this is not a mainstream movie. i was going to give it only nine stars, just because it doesn't even really try to explain anything to newcomers...marlene (at least i think it was marlene...sounded like her) gives a bit of background at the beginning, but it's more of a refresher than a crash course. but then i realized, for me this movie is a 10/10, so why should i take off points just because other people probably won't like it as well...if you've played the game, or are at least passingly familiar with it, you should see this movie. but you don't need me to tell you that. if you're not familiar with it, go out and buy it, sit there for twenty hours and beat it, and then see the movie...although even without any background, it's still stunningly beautiful. you just won't get any of the inside references...which make up 50% of the movie (that is, everything that isn't a fight sequence).

"duckman" is a great show. i first saw it when i was 10 years old at the time and after school i rushed home and turned on comedy central. i saw a cartoon called "duckman" and i loved it!! it's such a funny and cool show. it's created by klasky-csupo, who are great creators of cartoons. they animated some of my favorite shows ever, like "the simpsons" and "rugrats".i've seen lots of episodes of this show and i think they're all really funny and sweet. the voice actors did a great job voicing the characters, too.i wish that comedy central could bring this show back, along with "the critic" and "dilbert".but this is a great comedy central show. great job, klasky-csupo!

rated tv-14 for sexual content and language.i remembered hearing about this show back in 1998 when it used to play on the channel teletoon.i didn't watch it then but now, it plays on the channel, razer.i have seen about four episodes of this show and i must say, it is fairly intelligent and funny.the show stars jason alexander of seinfeld fame and also tim curry of rocky horror picture show and it fame.the show is about a duck who is a police officer.he basically does his job as a policeman, while coping with personal problems.this show is fairly funny at times and fans of animated-comedy will like this.

perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the usa, "duckman" runs short at 70 episodes in four seasons.unlike the often innocuous criticism found in "the simpsons" (a pretty good show in its own right), and the rude-for-rudeness-sake humour in "south park," every bit of this series follows a plan. the criticism of us society, from its mercantilism to its selfishness, carries much more bite than it does in any other animated series.the cultural references in "duckman" also tend to be obscure sometimes (anyone browsing the fan sites will realize most have not even been caught). in that, it is different from "the simpsons," which usually uses pop culture instead of the high-brow stuff often hidden in "duckman." as other people writing about it notice, there is a growth in the characters (bernice, duckman and cornfed). also, by making the main character not just an offensive neurotic but in fact someone who is living a personal tragedy (as is made clear in episodes like "the once and future duck" ('you'll love her until the end of your days...') and in "bev takes a holiday" (when he takes a chance to tell beverly all those things he couldn't tell beatrice), the series is anchored in a deep sense of reality.one can't avoid feeling sorry for him and his lucid madness.all in all, in my opinion, the best cartoon ever made in the usa and one of the best series ever. i doubt it will ever be on dvd though. far too many things the duck said make much more sense today.

duckman was a show that used to be on during the last hour or so before it was time to sleep about ten or so years ago. it was a contrast to a lot of the kid-type of animation i was watching at the time; i was still a minor junkie for disney and looney tunes stuff, and most saturday morning cartoons were still on the run-off of the peak from the days of ninja turtles and batman. but also around this time i began to recognize that the more raunchy, mature, surreal, obscene, and (though i didn't know the term at the time) satirical cartoon shows were more creative than the stuff i was used to. around the time of beavis and butt-head, ren and stimpy, and even the maxx were hitting tv sets via mtv, usa put out two shows- one of them was weird science, and the other was duckman. i've always remembered a few key bits from the show, and some of the lines are very quotable to those who haven't forgotten it completely. luckily, i found a tape recently with about six episodes i taped long ago, and the jokes stayed very fresh. and the delivery of the jokes are rapid-fire a lot of the time in the better episodes. in the voice department, the choices in talent are top notch for the story-lines, which are usually just an excuse for crude, fascinating parodies of pop-culture, politics, movies and tv shows, music, detective mysteries, and the dysfunctional family unit. jason alexander is a wonderful choice for duckman, and his performance is a comedic 180 from his days on seinfeld (even if there might be some similar characteristics here and there). also, the voices of gregg berger as the unmistakably monotoned and deadpan cornfed, dweezil zappa as the hilariously inept ajax, and nancy travis as the sex-starved, obnoxious sister-in-law bernice, all contribute in a full amount. along with some great writing - even when a joke isn't sure-fire, the wit behind it compensates - the animation style, while a far cry from some of the refurbished, computer-enhanced product of today, is inventive and often abstract. it has that home-made, gritty quality that beavis and butt-head or south park would later have. and, like those shows, if you're a little kid, i mean little as in younger than i was watching the show, you may not understand most of the jokes (i.e. there are enough stripper and vd references to fill two shows sometimes). but it's inventive to catch if it's on tv late at night, and it functions rather well in that time slot. one can only hope for a dvd box set. so, to no one who's barely or even never heard of this program, here's a general note: think of this show as if dashiell hammett met up with walt disney and decided to go to slum part of vegas with a free mini-bar and make a collaboration in the vein of luis bunuel and the simpsons combined. not to mention, it's by the group that did rugrats.(strong) a

i've always enjoyed animated ducks for some reason: duck tales, darkwing duck, daffy duck, donald duck. though none of them are as deranged as duckman. originally broadcast between 1994 and 1997 duckman lasted for a total 70 episodes but could easily have gone on forever without becoming stale.the titular character is a discombobulated, unapologetic slob and pretty much the worst living person in the world. he's a private detective, a widower, a peeping tom, an alcoholic, a sex maniac, a murderer, a (fill in the blank). you name it, duckman has done it. but who can blame him for being such a slimeball when the world he/we live in is so insane, outrageous and just plain nonsensical? eric tiberius duckman(voiced by the maniacal jason alexander) could carry the whole show by himself but when he's surrounded by a bunch of eccentric supporting characters you just know that trouble is just waiting to explode at every opportunity. my favorite has to be willibald feivel cornfed (or just cornfed pig), duckman's incredibly deadpan sidekick who is seemingly talented and highly skilled at everything and is perpetually oblivious to his partner's infinity of vices and incompetence.the typical plot will involve some bizarre case he'll inevitably blunder through or will revolve around his highly dysfunctional household, though every now and again duckman's arch-enemy king chicken (tim curry), a sort of professor moriarty in fowl form, hatches some diabolical scheme in revenge for being bullied in high school.since i was a teenager this has been my absolute favorite animated show, better than the simpsons, family guy and even king of the hill. nothing will ever surpass it. there never was, or will be, anything quite like duckman ever again. the level of satire, observational humor and writing is so sharp it's deadly and the animation is done in that unique klasky/csupo style (anyone who has seen rugrats will understand). it's a wonderful, highly imaginative and wild world and all with a noirish, 1940s feel.you can never have too much of this particular bird.

ok, so it owes pulp fiction, but in my opinion has it's own voice and identity mainly because of the music-video direction style, sketch-like narrative and great performances. thomas jane delivers great (the drug-dealer show-down is extraordinary), aaron eckhart likewise. james legros has a short and effervescent appearance-great humor-"they got the wong house". the porzikova interrogation and rape scene is memorable, as is mickey rourke's cameo appearance-"take a peak".great hollywood popcorn b-production with strong performances of a-level aspirants and renegades(rourke).well, take a peak, it's worth.

pepe le pew can either really creep you out or totally sweep you off your feet. either way, you can't help feeling a little awe on beholding this classic wb character. this commentater personally believes that pepe was the inspiration behind other would be animated casanovas today from cartoon network's "johnny bravo" to disney's lumiere from "beauty and the beast". his unique brand of love making is to be wondered at in today's world where his antics would normally be slapped with a sexual harassment warrant and at least a 50m distance from all his victims. in this particular cartoon, a world weary cat decides to do an ultimate makeover and earn some respect for a change for pretending to be a skunk. all goes well, until pepe arrives and promptly pursues the unfortunate feline with his overwhelmingly enthusiastic love-making.the groundwork for pepe's many trademarks are laid in this cartoon. from his adorable "frenchified" love calls to that aggravatingly calm hop-chase of his. this cartoon only goes to show that as far as the world of cartoon fantasy is concerned, the most ardent wooer can go the distance...and have his beloved "pig-eon" leaving dust trails behind them.

i just watched this film, and i have to say it surprised me. it was very well done, with good acting and a deep look at high school students from japan, in adolescent love.the look and feel is a lot different from many movies, and you can easily get into the film. much of the emphasis seems to be in the story itself, which is extremely subtle. the main theme and relations with other characters are a bit complex. but the the overall sense of realism and dimensions still pulls you in.a main draw back is of course, those who like something simple. which is not here. you have to be open to many things, including a new culture, to get more into the film.i did enjoy this film though. it is worth watching.

watching this movie, i can't help drawing the comparison between it and wild reeds, another thoughtful film about teenagers coming of age.like wild reeds, this movie is slow and the director would not be hurried. so if you want a quick resolution to things, don't watch it. this movie is like a slice of life, beginning imperfectly and ending imperfectly. there's no resolution to anything, no happily ever after for anybody, just like real life.this movie is as real as it gets. the acting is surprisingly good. the director is fond of long, really long, shots and the actors and actresses excel at showing subtlety and inner thoughts.i love this movie. i almost didn't watch it but now i'm very glad that i did. it's not a movie for everyone but if you're willing to let it grow on you, you will be rewarded.10/10

writing about something so wonderful is completely hard. actually, it's almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this movie. this is a marvelous story about sex and gender, and it's almost unbelievable that we have not to deal with obscene scenes of sex. feeling, this film was made for people that like to feel, and just to feel, life in all its complexity in a gorgeous simple way. we look at it, and something starts growing inside our minds, even our hearts: it a pure poem. i've watched some "gay" movies, and i almost always got really unsatisfied with unnecessary scenes of sex, not because i don't like scenes of sex, but generally they are so pornographic that i'm forced to think that the director or the producers or the writer of the script thinks that homosexuality means perversion. nagisa no shindobaddo is totally different from that ones. three are the main characters. we have ito, yoshida and aihara, two boys and a girl in a peculiar love triangle. ito likes his best friend yoshida, yoshida likes aihara and aihara likes ito. imagine what this could turn in unprepared hands? but in the contrary, hashiguchi makes a magnificent story which goes profoundly in the philosophy of life, adding a question in our mind that made me think, astonished, in the end of the movie: why? and that why expanded in multiple questions inside of my brain and inside of my heart. the scenes, actually, sometimes tending to be boring, are moments of the most delightful poem which we are able to feel, but totally unable to write down in words. and maybe because of that, we are unable to understand the question in the end of the movie. i'm sure this movie was not made for us to discuss every piece of it some people want to understand a film almost dissecting it. others are so used to common "american gay" movies that can't appreciate the real value of this master-piece. watch it, close your eyes in the credits and feel, everything, feel yourself, feel the wonderful song. for all this and much, much more, i give a nine. and i just don't give ten, because ten of ten is perfection. but i confess i almost did it.

"nagisa no shindobaddo" or "like grains of sand" is an amazingly beautiful story about teenage boys and girls dealing with the state of becoming one with who they are. this movie isn't about homosexuality, but it is about sexuality.aihara, an aloof girl, will definitely make the viewers ponder who is behind the aloof girl. does she love yoshida? or does she love ito? or did she somehow turn into a lesbian because of the "incident"? (i doubt it).and what about yoshida? does he realize that he loves ito in the end? well, we all know he loves him as a friend. but you'll never know once you see this movie... haha :) in the end, aihara (along with ito) delivers an exceptional message to the audience: which is that it does not matter if you love a boy or a girl. and i have to tell you, i'm so dense that i didn't get it at first. ^^;; it's because of the whole no talking scenes... you have to try to understand what the characters are thinking and saying through their actions and not by what they say (especially the final part... whew, boy, that was confusing!) it's a confusing story, but it is beautiful nonetheless. :) this movie is certainly one of the best japanese movies i have ever seen (and trust me, i've seen plenty).

charlotte beal arrives at an isolated country mental hospital to become a full-time nurse there. she is confronted with a motley group of crazies and a seemingly crazier supervisor. is dr. masters all she seems to be?don't look in the basement is one of the best low-budget movies in the genre and why people always put it down is beyond me. the acting is excellent, my favorite performance being by betty chandler as allyson the nymphomaniac. the chills just jump right off the screen. you probably won't have to say "it's only a movie, it's only a movie", it isn't that scary, but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre, which i do. it is very hard to make a creepy film on a low budget and few actually succeed. axe is another cheap film that is looked down upon. maybe people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any movie that doesn't have excellent effects and/or isn't considered a classic doesn't have a chance with an audience. but i think that after people see this movie, they will see how important the low-budget horror genre is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other rubbish.

you'll either love or hate movies such as this thriller set inside a lonesome asylum in a far off lonesome land. it's not so much of a horror show, but a concoction of frightening imageries and wackozoid mental patients. "scream" is the best term to use in what was obviously a popular drive-in classic noted for some strange and wicked behaviors. notice the "judge", who's about to put on the ax from behind the doctor! brr-r-r-r!!! not much else can be described here other than some bloody tasty goodness, but when you get a chance, remember the familiar old saying by the hag lady: "get out! get out! and never ever come back!". don't you wish you haven't looked in the basement?

if you love drive-in cheeze from the early '70s you will just love this one.how could you go wrong with a low budget film about bloodshed in a lunatic asylum? you can't! crazy folks and sharp objects are always an entertaining combination.the film looks like it was shot inside someone's house for about $320.65. for me that just ads to the fun of watching this type of stuff.the gore is a bit mild compared to others of this ilk,but there is enough to keep us bloodthirsty sickos (like myself)happy.some horror films drag in parts and leave you waiting for something to happen.that's not the case here.the characters are entertaining enough to make every frame quite enjoyable.there is never a dull moment from start to finish.the mind melting climax at the end that is just unbelievable. i liked it so much that right after the end credits i watched it a second time.it's an absolute must see for any self respecting drive-in horror nut.9.5/10 on the drive-in-freak-o-meter...required viewingyea i love you..i do love you...now take your thorazine and put your clothes back on...please....8)

i had borrowed the three sarah movies from a friend, and had watched them while sick in bed during one weekend. i thoroughly enjoyed every one of them. i enjoyed how the last movie gave a glimpse of what caleb and his sister were like when they grew up. in addition, i liked the carry-through of the "billy-boy" song that first was heard during the credits of the first movie, the title "sarah, plain and tall." however, the one thing in winter's end that i didn't like was the youngest daughter. she was a very cute little girl, but she just had too much spirit and looked like a brat compared to the other kids, even compared to talkative but still good-natured caleb when he was younger.

i love sarah plain and tall:winters end. its such a good movie. it tells of the hardships of living on a farm.i live on a farm so i know what its like to have hardships.i love the setting in kansas. its such a beautiful place. my favorite country star is from kansas. i love the country in kansas its just so beautiful. i would love to live in kansas.sarah plain and tall:winters end i think is a love story. i love love stories they are so fun to watch. i like to watch them because it is nice to watch people fall in love. falling in love is not as hard as most people think. i've fallen in love once. sarah plain and tall: winters end is my favorite love story

jack palance,(john witting), was usually a bad guy in most of his films and in this film, he showed his great acting talents above and beyond my expectations. john witting unexpectedly returns to his son's farm after years and years of separation. christopher walken,(jacob), has a hard time trying to accept his father's appearance after he spent the night in the family barn. jacob's son and younger daughter greet their new grandpa and accept him just as he is, a very old man, at the end of his ropes. glenn close,(sarah witting), delves into the character of john witting and starts to bring out the truth about what happened to him during his years of absence from the family. this is a very warm and loving down to earth film about real events that happen in most families for generations to come and go.

sarah plain and tall's winters end was the best movie i have ever seen. the person in the story that i liked best had to be cassie played by emily osment. just because of her energy and how she speaks her mind. for example when anna calls from town cassie wants to answer and she says,"hello? anna guess what. grand father was lost but hes back now and he is not a good man!" i loved all of the sarah plain and tall movies for my rating i think sarah plain and tall was #3. skylark was #2. winters end was #1! if i could live in any family from the past it would have to be the witting family. i think there are so many good parts in this movie i can't name all of them. i think they picked the best and perfect actors to play all these people in the movie so if you ever want to watch a movie from the past i would highly highly highly recommend sarah plain and tall's winters end.

excellent story of lives that need repair....one of those rare films that i could watch with my 7 and 8 year old daughters... glenn close was excellent in the title role. it was also nice to see christopher walken in a more normal role.

what a joy to watch this family grow up and see the same children acting in this series eight years later. anna (lexi randall) is a beautiful young lady, working for a physician in town. she is in love with his son justin, who went away in the army and was injured in war. and the newest daughter of jacob and sarah, cassie, is an outspoken cutie, so transparently honest she often is embarrassing.on a cold winter day a stranger shows up at the farm. he is slow to reveal his identity. when they find out he is jacobs father, john witting, thought long ago dead, hard questions about the past are difficult to get answered.glenn close is magnificent as a loving mother, who wants only the best for all her family, and is constantly wrestling with the forces that tend to separate them. sarah talking to jacob said, "it's all so fragile, this life. anything can happen in the blink of an eye. i could have died in that blizzard. think of justin, and john. probably more ill than we know. time moves on. the moment passes, then it's too late. it's a shame, don't you think?"life lessons on honesty and forgiveness make this a meaningful evenings entertainment.

glenn close is back as sarah plain and tall, a woman who keeps a family together through the good and bad times. the acting is superb -- christopher walken (unusually non-spooky) as her husband once again delivers a top-notch performance. it's good to see young christopher bell all grown up; too bad we don't get to see much of anna (lexi randall, also a few years older), but the new addition to the witting family (played by emily osment) was very welcome. and finally, jack palance, as the long lost witting patriarch, is as fine as ever.

i don't ever remember reading sarah, plain and tall in school, but when my son told me about it and said they watched the movie in class, i wanted to see it too. i borrowed the video from the library and watched it as a family. it was a wonderful story. however, i didn't know until a few months ago that there were sequels. i finished watching those this week. i discovered one small oops: in the second movie, skylark, jacob is reminiscing when he was a boy, and tells sarah "my brothers and sisters and i would dream...". in winter's end, those "brothers and sisters" don't exist in conversations between jacob and his father. but it is a very small oops, and i only caught it watching the trilogy, the second time around. great movie, a must see for good wholesome family viewing.

i enjoyed two of the three movies in the "sarah, plain & tall" trilogy. this, the final of the three, was definitely one of the "good ones. " it is an excellent family film with wonderful acting by the three adult stars: christopher walken, glenn close and jack palance. the storyline is simple but well-told. the only sub-par performance was by one of the kids. it was interesting to see how the kids had grown since that first movie. of the three, that initial "sarah," was the best- filmed with some beautiful cinematography. this movie didn't have that, but it had the best story. it had some genuinely-tearful sentimental moments and a very nice ending. highly recommended.

i've seen this movie a few times and with each viewing i still feel the excitement of embarking on a journey and the frustration of trying to overcome the barriers that impede the path. it's more than a mere desire of finding home; it's about the very basic human spirit of finding one's way in the world, of overcoming despair, of facing the character foibles that deter our goals. underlying these human endeavors is the challenge to reconsider the origin of life. while this film is imbued with serious ideas, it has just enough comedic lines to leave the viewers hopeful. it is surprisingly funny. the execution of the story line is excellent! this is all packaged with visually engaging animation. a must see.

i was unsure what to expect from "driving lessons"- unsure whether rupert grint could carry such a role, but within the first few minutes i was completely hooked. all the way through, the music, acting and scenery were absolutely stunning. julie walters, as always, gave a superb performance as the eccentric old actress evie, and rupert grint, equally as good,gave a fantastic performance as the romantic ben.right from the beginning, i was forced into involuntary cringes, bursts of laughter and swellings of joy as ben broke free from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend, evie. a very controversial story, probably rather exaggerated but none the less one of the best films i have seen in a long time.highly recommend to anyone seeking a good british film and an evening to kick-back and just enjoy yourself.

i am not a movie maker but i know it is hard to tell a story and draw people into it in only seven short minutes. i think a good movie is one you don't want to end. eric did a great job of developing the charater of the microbe and making him seem "human". loved the music and the voice used for the microbe. i am looking forward to seeing what eric has in store for us in future films. this is one movie i didn't want to see end. great job.

anderson's animation easily rivals that of pixar and goes well beyond most anything i've ever seen disney do. while some say the story is a bit too abstract, i find it a thought-provoking and refreshing change from the exaggerated characters and bumbling animals typically found in animated shorts. it's an interplanetary version of castaway! anyone who has left the safe harbor of home and gone off to a lonely, frightening place by themselves, will readily identify with this forlorn microbe. excellent work, mr. anderson!

i'm not a movie maker but i do know it is hard to tell a story in seven minutes and draw your audience into the character. horses on mars does this and more. when you are watching a good movie you don't want it to end. this is how i felt watching this film. it is visually expansive and the microbe takes on such human qualities that you feel you are on the journey with him.really looking forward to see what exciting adventures mr. anderson takes us on in the future. well done.

in the history of cinema, every great film-maker had to create a first film. many times when viewed after they have become a success, a light bulb goes on in our heads. the connection is made and we see the solid foundation from where they started. so it is with horses on mars. it is the subtle humor woven around a seemingly straight-forward narrative that tells a great story, but allows you to enjoy the visuals at the same time. in the imagery, i found great attention to detail and a production polish that is rare in any student film.a young film-maker always has improvements to be made. but if mr. anderson continues on this path, i think we will someday look back on this film as the beginning a great career.you should definitely view this film. nothing beats the grandeur of the big screen.

horses on mars is an engaging animated short that takes a sometimes comical look at the process of evolution through the eyes of those yet to evolve. the story is personal, and at times sentimental, and is supported by strong digital animation and narration that involves the viewer in this science fiction story. i was fortunate enough to view this short in widescreen format at the 2002 sundance film festival, and must suppose that when transferred to the small screen, it will lose some of its ability to draw the reader into the no less thoughtful story and stunning graphics.

hercules the avenger is by far the best single entry in the muscleman genre i can recall. the charge against it made by critics - it is a cut and paste of two previous hercules films, with some added new material to make it appear fresh - misses the fact that this cut-and-paste approach solves one of the central problems of the sword-and-sandal movies. with most of these films, the middle third sags horribly - usually involving a sappy love story or arcane political intrigue or both (queen falls in love with hercules and her evil brother plots against them, etc.) it's often hard to hold on through this to watch the exciting finale. hercules the avenger cuts all that crap from the source films, and adds a rather brisk narrative of a hercules impersonator bullying his way into power. (it should be noted that this episode also functions as a distant but pointedly critical remark on the rise of fascism in italy.) this also sets up a fine final wrasslin' match between the real hercules and his impersonator.in a narrower focus, i might also add that further editing has improved individual scenes borrowed from the other films. for my money, the mutiny scene here is much better than it first appeared in hercules and the captive women, since it has been tightened with the reduction of several characters and their plot complications.there are also floppy monsters, creepy underworld atmospherics borrowed (literally) from mario bava, an entire city destroyed, and the usual amount of lovely babes in revealing gowns. since no one expects any of these films to compete with the seven samurai - or even with the magnificent seven - it seems a bit picky to hold the film's borrowing from other films against it.

eliza (elizabeth moorman) is a farm girl from the country coming to the city looking for love. she has met a man that has told her of an astrologist who will show her the stars. this is a journey of souls...eliza is put to the test, can she realize her true love when she sees him or not? tommy (tommy lee jones) is a construction worker trying to find himself in his native heritage. they show each other different ways of looking at things. all the while eliza is still looking for love and tommy is trying to protect the reservation that his grandmother lives on. this is a twisted story of looking beyond the obvious and finding beauty in the simple everyday things. the style is artsy and chock full of symbolism. the psychedelic camera styling might scare away the average moviegoer, but the deeper message and the interesting frames make this movie worth watching. it is a movie that explores the underworld of the weird, wretched and devastated individuals. this one strays from the path but certainly worth watching!

i can never fathom why people take time to review movies that they have not understood fully. i know people will read scathing reviews on these pages of this film, and it will keep them from seeking copies of this quite forgotten, late '20s style but 1932 movie, which should probably be referred to as "indecent," as that is the name on the main titles.myrna loy, best known as a comic actress in countless genteel roles, shows herself to be miscast in all of them. she was a true dramatic actress, something that i did not know before watching this film, which predates all of her famous roles. she is exciting and moving here, two things she never was opposite the graceful and refined william powell. i'm still rather in shock over how good she was.becky sharp (1935), the first three-strip technicolor feature, is more familiar but this one is far better artistically and an adaptation. it is also very poignant as an expression of a film style that was about to die. you cannot take my word for it, you must see it.

i love the thackeray novel on which this film is based. and while this modern version of becky sharp's story is a b film, the casting of loy, in her first top-billed role, is rather fascinating.before loy became mgm's reigning good girl in scores of genteel and comic roles, she was an actress. vanity fair was loy's follow-up film to emma, in which she played a snotty and greedy daughter who almost destroys the loyal housekeeper (marie dressler).loy's becky is much nastier than miriam hopkins' version 3 years later in becky sharp. loy's becky is very much a pre-code film character with her plunging necklines and amoral ways. it's the type of character that jean harlow or clara bow could easily have played, but becky here is still supposed to be of the genteel set. that's what makes her fallen character so tragic.in counterpoint to loy's grasping becky is the goody goody amelia (barbara kent) who is just not an interesting character. mary forbes is icily good as mrs. sedley. most of the other actors in this version are pretty blah: conway tearle as rawdon; walter byron as osborne; anthony bushell as dobbin. others are nearly dickensian is their quirkiness: billy bevan as joseph; lionel belmore as crawley; montagu love as the marquis; lilyan irene as polly the maid; elspeth dudgeon as the housekeeper.loy is front and center throughout. while the ending is rather shocking, she has several excellent scenes, such as the gambling scene in the casino where she tries to steal another woman's winning roulette bet. the more loy's becky descends morally, the more beautiful she gets until she is finally "caught." bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance by loy in a film that should be seen.

i've never read a good review for "vanity fair" and i can't understand why. for something that was "rushed through in ten days" it all comes off surprisingly well. though admittedly "becky sharp" is a better movie and miriam hopkins a better becky, there's nothing to stop this one from getting a solid 9/10. at times, myrna loy might seem just too cute and nice to be playing an utter bitch, but at other times she just has to squint her eyes and the air temperature drops a dozen degrees. meow! the move to a more modern setting did not work against "vanity fair" and the only thing that really causes some conflict is the casting. barbara kent (amelia) was under 5 feet in height, and few of the leading men were very tall either - this all coming together to make loy look like an absolute amazon woman!"vanity fair" is similar to "craig's wife" in that no matter how bad the main character is, you have to love her. and you know she deserves her comeuppance, and then some, but you still feel sorry for her when she gets it. though based on the same story as "becky sharp", this version had a different ending, which is interesting to see because most of the rest of the films were almost identical. for pleasure value, the ending of "becky sharp" is ultimately more enjoyable, although aesthetically, and from the flow of the story, there is no doubt that the ending of "vanity fair" is the better one, whether or not you actually like it.

this show was incredible, but too esoteric for most people. if you had never truly seen a european variety show in the 70's or 80's (or at least a mexican one) the entire show would probably be lost on you. if you had, this show was a dead on skewering satire of the phony spectacle and shallowness that these shows dive into at their worst. helmed by a chain-smoking suave wannabe with a pencil moustache and his ultra-glamorous and immasculating harridan of an ex-wife, "viva variety" is a variety show that tries to get off the ground every episode but always descends into in-fighting and acts gone very wrong. the hosts are joined by "johnny bluejeans", a dim witted side-kick who seems to have been named because blue jeans are a very popular product in his country and that means the kids will like him, which of course, they don't.the result was a hilarious spoof of variety shows in general. imagine the arguing that probably happened backstage during the last days of the "sonny & cher show". now imagine it's happening onstage in front of you and the stars are trying to keep their composure. now add cheesy acts and a euro-riche mentality (tuxedoes, gowns, booze, accents and smokes). now you have "viva variety".have you ever heard a musician whose music was pretty much written for other musicians? too conceptual? viva variety did this for comedians. way too esoteric for the standard american audience. it was funny as hell. and doomed.

viva variety was a unique hybrid program that was both a parody of and a tribute to the programs it represented. it was most directly a mock up of the classic 1970s favorite, "the sonny & cher show," with thomas lennon and kerri kenney playing a divorced show biz couple who were somehow forced to host this program together, the female of the pair towering over the male, and the constant barrage of "insult humor" the couple tossed at each other, plus sketch comedy bits and performances from what are most kindly described as "specialty" acts! the "hybrid" was the mix of fact and fantasy. of course, there was no "mr. and former mrs. laupin," and the program's announcer, johnny bluejeans, was likewise equally fictional. but all the acts that performed were certainly real, and some were even entertaining! but there were also some acts that would have clearly been better suited for the old chuck barris "gong show." the show itself was really more like an extended sketch from "sctv" (it was borne from the mtv series, "the state," after all), and some would suggest that it would have been better as a five minute bit in the mix of a program like that one, rather than a stand alone series. but "viva variety" certainly should get high marks for original concepts, and even though it was often more odd than funny, it was certainly worthwhile, especially when they road tripped to las vegas and brought in even glitzier acts to perform. it's unlikely we'll ever see anything like this on television again.

otto preminger's "porgy and bess" stands, to date, as a great american musical. i believe it is time bring this film out onto vhs and dvd for countless generations to view, admire, and absorb its wonderful music.

i had the great pleasure of recently viewing this beautifully filmed wide-screen adaption of the the 1943 stage revival (which unlike the original 1935 production) which included extensive spoken recitatives. this had been the fashion at the time, so to blame the film for an 16 year tradition. the film should be seen if only for sammy davis jrs brilliant catlike performance as sportin' life, creeping in and out of shadows. his seduction of dorothy dadridge's bess "there's a boat dat's leavin' soon for new york," is one of many highlights. nearly all of the principal music is intact and beautifully sung. it certainly never bores which the recent pbs and met versions did. it was a pleasure to see that time had not diminished the movie, and hopefully it will be made available in the near future for the generations that haven't had a chance to experience it.

i see it when i was 12 year old and i dream to see it again !what marvelous sammy davis jr singing "it ain't necessarily so !"

i found this movie to be one of the best for this time and era. the cast was very exceptional and most entertaining to all that saw it.i would like for my younger generation to have seen this movie,but i haven't been able to find or see the movie in the past.my first viewing was back in the early sixties and i have been looking for it every since.the movie showed me potential of how far we come go to become a gifted at a craft where we could only have meaningless roles to act as buffoons and servants. porky and bess showed some of the urban life of my neighborhood as i saw it in the time where i needed good solid male role models. the singing and acting had me skipping for days, playing the part of different characters in this excellent movie.

seems to have been made as a vehicle for w.c. fields and carol dempster and they dominate it. fields already has his film character well developed. carol dempster seems to dance through the film and her acting reminds me of mary pickford, who also worked a long time under d.w. griffith. typical of later griffith films technically.later remade as poppy (the original title) with fields in the same role.

the plot of "sally of the sawdust" is the usual melodramatic stuff-- an orphan, rags-to-riches-- but the film rises above most silents thanks to three people: this is not, of course, d. w. griffith's masterpiece, but it does showcase his film-making savvy in full maturity. he uses all his innovations, which are techniques we take for granted now: close-ups, cross-cutting, a mobile camera, and the ability to modify acting from theatrical exaggeration to cinematic subtlety.w. c. fields also showcases his skills-- not his signature gruff delivery, but his remarkable dexterity as a physical comedian. he does a few inventive juggling acts, cut too short to be fully appreciated, and some very deft pickpocketing, but it seems that every prop that comes within reach gets manipulated for comic effect-- hat, cane, car roof, dog, cash. he's a joy to behold.finally, there's carol dempster. much has been said against this actress, but her performance here is also richly comic. she was 22 at the time, playing a teenager, and her approach to the role is a combination of grace and awkwardness that may not be wholly convincing, but she truly engages the eye when she's on screen-- particularly when she's dancing. she's not a beauty--though she's positively luminous in the one scene where she's gussied up like a talmadge sister-- but her plainness only adds to sally's character, especially in the many moments when she shows very obvious affection for fields as her guardian/"father." few, if any, hollywood performers could compete with fields when it came to comedy, but griffith gives his leading lady every chance to match her co-star, and dempster absolutely holds her own.

well done melodrama that tells the story of sally, tomboy dancer in the circus, raised by sideshow performer mcgargle (played by w.c. fields), he of the top hat, little mustache, checkered pants, and proficiency as juggler, pickpocket, and runner of carnival con games like three card monte and the old shell game. mcgargle has raised sally, who worships him as her "real father" since sally's mother (kicked out of her home by her father, a judge, when she married a "circus man") died and left sally orphaned. sally is feisty and loyal to mcgargle no matter what he gets up to - but mcgargle seems to feel a bit of guilt over keeping her in the circus instead of with her own family all these years. when they end up performing in a carnival in the town where her wealthy grandparents live, mcgargle uses the opportunity to "investigate" sally's real family, with the idea that he may restore her to them. but grandfather the judge takes an immediate disliking to sally 'cause he doesn't like a "show girl" - what a stern, narrow-minded man he is, a real piece of work that guy! and meanwhile sally is busy being pursued by a handsome and rich young man, son of the man who helped grandpa get his riches.this is a very good film with a few laughs here and there and a sort of odd editing style (i don't know how to describe this other than it shows long shots, then sort of jumps back a few seconds or changes angle suddenly as a close up is shown). carol dempster, who plays sally, is delightful here - quite cute and comical in her performance. w.c. fields, even without his famous voice, is very funny - just the way he moves and his amusing, comical reactions to things (like a small dog seen in one funny scene), we even see him juggling briefly in this. i love the few peeks at the old-fashioned circus and carnival that is shown here. the print of this featured on the dvd is very nice looking, tinted a light sepia tone, and the piano score for this is really excellent, performed by philip carli based on the original cue sheets.

this story takes place in wisconsin. i was half heartedly watching my tape when i heard the name appleton. i wasn't sure where it was taking place until i heard them say green bay & then i figured it was wisconsin. watching further confirmed it.anxiously awaiting the outcome i could really feel corrine's frustration. i did not know it was based on fact until the end. it left me glad but sad and wanting to know more.

a man and his wife are not getting along because of the wife's jealousy and drinking problems. when the wife disappears, her sister begins a vigorous search involving the local police, state government, and a television crime show. what she finds out stuns the entire community. good drama with lots of fine performances; based on a true story.

a great suspenseful thriller the acting is first rate and the plot keeps you guessing. this well performed and directed movie is based on a true story and well worth while joe penny is cast extremely well and ann gillian is convincing as the concernened and terrified sister. joe again prove he's acting ability is amazing and the ending well done. it,s worth watching i hope they repeat it soon on any channel, i will definitely record it. for penny and gillian fans it's worth your time. rent it if you can better still try to buy it i going to. perfect early nineties thriller watch thismovie it's great.

one of the most macabre, depressing, yet eye-opening docs. i've watched in awhile. there's no narration or story that's told, just a "third eye" type camera following around 2 couples of heroin addicts in nyc through the seasons. watching them shoot up on the floors of public washrooms then "clean" their needles in the public toilets... sometimes it's a bit too much and you need to hit pause just to go for a breather.anyone currently in recovery of alcohol/drug addition should watch this when they're craving - it really shows you to what you could be going back to! after seeing this it's a wonder how anyone could even try this drug to begin with.the only thing it needed was a follow up at the end to tell where these people are today. judging from what is shown in the doc., there's no hope for any of them. they mention wanting to get better and quit, but it seems the only end to their habits is to quit by way of dying.this definitely isn't for all audiences. i found myself kind of like watching a car accident - after i started watching it i just couldn't turn it off. i had to keep watching with a dark/morbid fascination of what it's like inside the lives of these addicts.

i watch this film with horror in my heart because my mother also was a crack head like michelle. i've been wondering where michelle is now. there has been times where i had to find my mother in places i was scared to be but more scared to leave her there! to see michelle act like that made me wonder where she was sleeping all that time?? i watched in hopes the it was never that bad for my mom! and what i want to know is... where did matt and tracy "tear that ass up"?! worst scene for me was watching tracy shoot up in an old navy dressing room!!!! u never who try clothes on before you and it looks like all of them except michelle has aids!!!! where are they know 2008? can we get an update??????????

"dope sick love" is a really remarkable documentary made for hbo about two pairs of heroin addicted lovers roaming the streets of nyc. i managed to catch it one night by accident and found it absolutely mesmerizing. there is no narration and we never see any interviews with the subjects, the camera just follows them around, like a third eye, completely detached. the people being followed don't even seem aware that they're being filmed! (or, at least, they don't seem to care). the footage is amazingly candid. some of the most candid i've ever seen. this is as real as it gets. the nuts and bolts of what its like to be on the street and addicted to heroin. we watch them score dope, shoot it, make up, hustle, and even impersonate cops to rob people, and about a million other tiny details that less observant documentary filmmakers would leave out.some of the footage is truly horrifying. like watching one guy frantically searching for fix he lost. i found myself praying that he would find it, just so that his misery would temporarily end. and when he does find it, the guy literally dances in the street.the cyclical nature of drug addiction becomes very apparent while watching this. everything is about getting the next score to these folks, yet the next score seems to be well worth the immense trouble they go through. i would love to get a copy of this, if anyone knows where it is available. highly recommended, if you can catch it on hbo.

tracy and matt, michelle and sebastian: these are the two couples whose lives of addiction, crime, and squalor are brilliantly captured in this raw and honest hbo documentary. they're in turns petulant, charming, repulsive, astonishingly stupid, and dedicated: to the drugs and to each other. they're also each very different: matt is a working class boy who clearly revels in his naughtiness, whilst prep school dropout tracy supports the couple with western union money from her moneybags father, who makes a surprisingly sympathetic cameo towards the end of the film. meanwhile widow michelle (whose hubby died of an od) earns her daily bread by posing as an nypd vice cop willing to cut her would-be johns a deal to avoid prison time, and sad sack companion sebastian lives off the proceeds. you'll be pulled into their stories and will wish the film went on for twice as long. unlike most documentaries of this kind, there's no coda providing us with an update about their progress (can matt and tracy really keep that brooklyn apartment? will michelle go back to bellevue for more detox? and can sebastian become any more pathetic?). as a result, the film seems incomplete, but that may have been the point. essential viewing, as long as you aren't completely averse to scenes of people shooting up.

the animatrix: a detective story is very well planned and has a great storyline to go with it. carrie-anne moss plays trinity in this animated cartoon. i really like the 'private detective' ideas created by the director.

this is one of nine shorts on the anime disk, "the animatrix." it is my favorite. the artwork is amazing. the black-and-white, somewhat grainy texture perfectly captures the mood that the segment is trying to portray. the story is tight, and the ending is true to film noir.overall, i gave the animatrix a "7", but this particular segment deserves a "10."

film noir meets anime... brilliant! this was one of the highlights of the surprisingly creative animatrix shorts. this was one of my favorites if not my favorite (i also loved world record). this is basically a reference to those classic film noir detective stories and movies of the 40s, except it's animated and involves the matrix. but by being animated, it is able to take the extreme camera angles, the detective life style, the shadows, and everything film noir to an entirely new level. the femme fatale? trinity. the detective in this story seems to be living in the 40s in his mind but stuck in a modern world, and everything becomes too much for him when his case suddenly involves science fiction and agents when a mysterious woman in black walks into his office...my grade: 9/10

the detective story is not typical for the matrix universe. it is a film-noir-esque private eye story, with a strong narrator and a very rich feel. rich, in terms of its visual appeal. the snowing scenes, the grainyiness, it all stuns the eye.but what about the story? it is interesting, even if it feels a little out of place. the agents hire a privat detective to track down trinity. he finds out that they tried the approach before, but with hazardous consequences for the hired detectives. still, he tries to locate her and eventually succeeds, through alice in wonderland references and hackers and chat rooms. then things begin to get interesting...all in all, this is a perfectly satisfying short animated movie.8/10

this is the fifth part of 'the animatrix', a collection of animated short movies that tell us a little more about the world of 'the matrix'. this time they introduce trinity (carrie-anne moss) in a story about a detective who is hired to find her. with great black and white animation and an interesting story this is again a great animated short from 'the animatrix'.

this is one of the periphery stories told by the animatrix that isn't directly relevant to the war stopping one glorifying plot of the films, but trinity, voiced by carrie, does appear in it. it features a private detective who is hired for big money to look for a hacker named trinity. we see his search which features other pis, only one who he meets, who has seemingly gone mad from his own experience trying to track trinity down. eventually he makes contact with trinity who he assumes to be a man of course - told in the narrative and something that firmly puts us in his own perspective despite what we already know - on a hacker chat-room, and solves a riddle which forces him in a hurry to catch a train. he forgets his hat but his faithful cat throws it to him in a moment of ludicrousness so absurd it's hilarious.he meets her on the train but the ruse is thereby revealed when agents attack; the agents were using him to get to trinity and trinity was trying to free the pis sent after her, which he doesn't know of course, and which isn't explicitly stated in the animation itself, something common to film noir titles, which often hint at plenty of interesting back-story, subplots, developments etc. but don't show you more then the core story and a limited point of view to create an extra air of mystery and intrigue.almost everything in this short is in black and white, the music is reminiscent of film noir and the offbeat, old fashioned yet dedicated detective is the perfect protagonist for a film noir title. the trivia section of this title's entry on imdb also helpfully presents a few references this title makes to hardboiled literature, something it also borrows heavily from, a genre of mysteries for detectives, gangsters etc. who engage in challenging conflicts readily and often. animated aptly by studio 4°c and directed by shinichiro watanabe, it is an enjoyable variant on the usual matrix story.

the eighth, and thus second-to-last short of the animatrix ones, this is the only one quite like this. this takes two of the main types of filmed entertainment inspirations of the matrix, and combines them unbelievably well. this is immensely faithful to the trilogy in that aspect, the tone. the animation is a gorgeous, breathtaking animé. the style, which is omnipresent in this, is noir. the plot is fitting, and the story-telling, as well, as the music, is spot-on. the sound in general is fantastic, and really helps solidify the mood and atmosphere, along with the drawings and designs. the voice acting is impeccable. this is one of only two where people also in the movies reprise their roles, and both have anne-moss, who is the only of them appearing in this. this is one of the best of the nine, and also one of my personal favorites. this is about ten minutes long. the pacing is perfect. it never slows down terribly much, but it's not overwhelming, either. the ending could not have been more appropriate for this. this shares a nine and a half-minutes long making of with kid's story, and it's well-done and informative. i recommend this warmly to any fan of the universe and the two genres that this is made up of. 8/10

i've seen three of the animatrix episodes, and this is my favorite of all of them. the second renaissance provided a flimsy back story to the already flimsy universe. program was a stylistically impressive number, it just felt kind of silly. i guess what gives this one it's special touch is the direction from shinichiro watanabe, director of the incredibly popular (and for good reason) series cowboy bebop. it has some of the best elements of bebop: slick, sci-fi adventure, a no-nonsense, slightly apathetic hero working for hire, a bounty-head (more or less), and a chase scene, all wrapped up in an excellent film-noir packaging. watanabe's tarantino-style slickness comes through here full throttle.

this is one of the anime films from the animatrix collection, one of nine - the only one done in black and white, and the only one featuring trinity. richly textured and beautifully rendered in every way, and the animated version of trinity definitely does her justice. if you're a fan of the matrix, you will need to put this on your short list.

wow, its been quite a while since i've watched anything so mysterious in the way it is portrayed.a detective story uses old fashioned black and white images to portray a private investigator who dresses in an old fashioned trench coat and hat. the theme of this animation is reminiscent of that of sam spayed which was briefly mentioned by ash.sick of spying on cheating house wives because of his clients, ash was offered a chance to track down a "computer hacker" which he thought was a worthwhile chance for a four figure sum he could not turn down and the rest is history.the ending was a little bit bland but still okay. for those out there who like old fashion stories this is the one for you.

just how exactly do gay asians manage in a culture that generally refuses to even recognize the concept of homosexuality? for millions of gay hindus and muslims there seems little hope of ever leading a life that is accepted and endorsed by their otherwise very close knit families. this is the main point explored in chicken tikka masala - presumably named after the western spicy dish involving tender pieces of young chicken flesh! jimmy is a typical young asian brought up in britain by traditional parents with the common narrow minded and selfish views on marriage and grandchildren. like millions of others he is led into an arranged marriage that seems inescapable even though he is apparently completely gay and deeply involved with a very attractive young man with whom he lives. he knows that the truth should be told but fears for the consequences of that particularly so as his father appears to be terminally ill. and so he becomes embroiled in a web of deceit that becomes wider and wider as the plot develops.the film is beautifully sensitive and not at all judgmental or patronizing to any group portrayed. the acting is generally excellent although it might seem a bit ham in places as the director tends to search for humor rather than letting it blossom naturally. there are no prizes for photography or script but the film is made entire by the wonderful sentiment expressed at the very end - a sentiment that all fathers across the world would do well to learn from.

have just got back from seeing this brilliantly funny film.granted, part of the reason i loved it so was because i could point out people and places i knew ('i walk there everyday!', 'i work there!', 'i've had drinks there!', 'hey! that's our postman!' etc...). but, still, if you're out for a 'feel-good' with a bit of spice (excuse the pun) - this is just the right answer. relationships, culture and, most importantly, love are all woven together within the plot.with preston (where the film is set) recently being made a city, it is good to see this work featuring the place and adding to the feeling of uprise. it is also a brilliant representative of the many cultures in this part of the north.fabulous!

my comment is mainly a comment on the first commentator (the extra on the film) and his unhappy assessment of the film. i think his perspective indicates why an extra is an extra and a director is a director. the film was sweet, the acting sufficient, the experience of watching it a nice diversion from a busy work week. it wasn't "the hours" (acting), or "the matrix" (special effects), or even "the color purple" (direction). most movies won't be. but it also wasn't the crap fest that "vinny..." would lead you to believe. sorry guy, just my 2 cents.as to the movie itself, it was in the end very gay affirming (+ #1). it showed a world full of diverse and less than perfect people--you know, just like ours (+ #2)! it opened a door on one culture without excluding other cultures (+ #3). and i liked the music (+ #4).

this film is about a young indian guy who comes home one day and finds himself getting engaged to a woman. the problem is that he is gay. in order to stop the wedding without telling his parents that he is gay, one lie leads to another until it spirals out of control.this film is hilarious and got me laughing many times. sally bankes' acting is superb and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly. the plot is outstanding as well. i find the plot very realistic, and i can completely identify with jimi's feeling of being terrified, worried and upset. on the other hand, jimi's boyfriend, jack, is given much less attention in the film. i would have liked him to be given more lines in the film, and have more character development. however, as i guess the director wants to make this a more mainstream film, the love between jimi and jack was not developed in the film.it is great to watch a gay affirmative film. furthermore, this film preaches us to be accepting to other people's difference, be it sexuality, culture and the way of life. this film makes viewers think hard.we need films like this to give us a boost. thanks for making this film!

for people who are first timers in film making, i think they did an excellent job!! we have to support the emerging industry especially coming from up north. it was very popular when i was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs. it's a feel-good film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema! it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents. the film has just opened, i do hope it does well - people should support this little film. i think this 'vinny...' person is very bitter, about something! and getting too personal? shame!! i say well done to all those involvedhave a drink on me!! i look forward to you next venture.

typically spanish production - slow-moving, but with great sensuousness and sexuality oozing from the lead actress paz vega. (watch her in "spanglish"). great sets, lots of colour - you get to see cordoba, seville, spanish mountains and countryside. the plot tends to meander here and there, but if you follow closely (i managed to, even though the film is in spanish), you'll get the gist of it.it's about how one very highly sensual young gypsy woman, carmen, uses her feminine wiles to seduce men to do her bidding. carmen is being taken to prison after attacking a fellow cigarera at the cigar factory where she works. she persuades jose, the soldier in charge of taking her to prison, to let her escape. jose succumbs to her charms because she speaks basque (he is navarrese and speaks the same language). jose is punished by 1 month in jail and demoted to foot soldier. he later meets carmen at a party and they end up becoming lovers. but carmen refuses to commit to him, and continues her lascivious and flirty lifestyle. in a jealous rage, jose kills a fellow soldier who has been with carmen. they then have to leave town. life on the run turns jose into a bandit. carmen, meanwhile, remains the same, a wildly promiscuous woman. in the end, jose loses his mind and ends up killing carmen.the story is told by jose in prison, awaiting to be executed. the person he tells the story to is prospero merrime, a french writer and anthropologist, whose fancy watch (it plays beethoven's fur elise) was stolen by either carmen or jose.worth watching for the sets and for the delectable paz vega.

this movie is a quite fair adaptation of the prosper merimeé's novel. in the novel merimeé himself is a character, don josé is from navarra (north spain, and historically a basque country zone, they can speak basque language). they are in seville (andalusia, south spain) and they only speak spanish with andalusian accent, in no way they speak basque, but carmen explains to don josé that she was living in navarra. you can believe it or not, anyway this is the book's version, then you can't be critical with the movie about this, be with the book! you have to note are different the novel by merimeé and the opera by bizet, and this movie is an adaptation from the novel, anyway in the opera don josé is still spanish from navarra, never he's french. why so many people keep thinking don josé is french? i don't know but i guess because the novel and the opera are in french although is supposed to be in spanish.the only important difference between the movie and the novel is that in the movie don josé also kills the "torero" lover of carmen and in the novel he doesn't (neither in the opera). i guess they wanted to keep the movie a little more gore! i think the movie is quite good, anyway.

there have been approximately 60 different films & television plays,besides the classic opera of this tale of a sex mad girl and her hapless soldier lover. this story has been done so many times, in various ways.vicente aranda directs joaquin jorda's screenplay adaptation of prosper merimee's classic novel & play.this is the story only of bizet's opera carmenpas vega is an exciting carmen,full of passion & the ability to drive simple men to do terrible tragic things. leonardo sbaraglio is the hapless soldier who is ensnared into carmen's poisonous web & led to doing bad things.jay benedict is the author prosper who tells this tale.there is not much action, but there are some very hot sex scenes.in fact this is almost an nc-17 film.since i have seen this tale so often in so many guises i was not overly impressed.it is a very well made film & will be of interest to those that may not know of it,my not overly enthusiastic review also could be that i miss the fantastic opera score by bizet.see this as you may like it more than i did.ratings *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) imdb 7 (out of 10)

this is a nice movie with good performances by paz vega and leonardo sbaraglia . of course vicente aranda is a legend in spanish cinema and surely one of the great directors in spanish cinema but i don't think this is one of his greatest movies even if it's fine. the screenplay plays with the introduction of merimeé as a character , it's a nice touch but it's unbelievable. the music is composed by jose nieto , national spanish prize in cinema. i mean this movie is very good in all the technical aspects .there are very good actors in supporting roles like antonio dechent , maria botto and others . i give it 7 out of 10 cause i think this could be a better movie but as it is it is not boring at all.

even for the non-opera loving public the name carmen is immediately recognized as an opera by bizet about a gypsy girl whose capricious loves destroy men. but as much as the opera is now considered a staple in every opera house repertoire, the real story of the wild gypsy lass as created by prosper mérimée in 1845 has never been told as well as in this cinematic version by the abundantly gifted spanish director vicente aranda ('juana la loca aka mad love','amantes', 'if they tell you i fell', etc.). incorporating the author of the novel as a main character seeking the story of carmen from one of her lovers - josé - provides just the right vantage for the story of this famous gypsy wild lady to be told. carmen (the amazingly beautiful and talented paz vega) works in a cigar factory in seville, a factory adjoining the military station where the very proper josé (leonardo sbaraglia) is stationed. carmen is tempestuous and in a fight instigated by a fellow factory worker bringing attention to the fact that carmen is a gypsy, carmen murders the co-worker and is arrested. josé is physically attracted to the voluptuous carmen and when carmen flirts with him he consents to allow her to escape - his payback is the promise for a night of passion with carmen. carmen keeps her pact, providing josé with his first sexual encounter, and josé is doomed. his lack of military discipline results in his losing his rank and being imprisoned for a while, but at his release josé encounters carmen again, kills a fellow officer, and in fear runs off to the hills to live with the smugglers and gypsies that are carmen's people. many incidents occur to try the passionate bond between the lovers, but when carmen's real husband is released from prison, destructive behaviors take over, behavior's that include carmen's infatuation and affair with a bullfighter and the passion of carmen and josé comes to a tragic end. one factor that makes the story (as adapted for the screen by director aranda and joaquim jordà move so well is the role that prosper mérimée (jay benedict) plays: his questioning of josé completes the story that bizet's opera only outlines. the acting is superb, the cinematography by paco femenia and the excellent musical score by josé nieto contribute enormously to the success of this very fine film. this is a must for lovers of the opera carmen, and a splendid action drama for those viewers who admire historical pieces. highly recommended. grady harp

i thoroughly enjoyed carmen, better than original sin (angelina jolie & antonio bandaras), which share some thematic similarities, and which i also enjoyed very much. i felt the acting was stronger here (paz vega displayed a wider range, has more fire; and sbaraglia was also great). overall, their acting was more gritty, more believable (less dreamy than original sin, and both actors here had less 'celebrity status' and 'pretty face' to depend on to make the movie work. vega definitely sizzles, as to be expected.director vincente aranda has also built a detailed world (again, better than original sin) that lets you feel the grime and the daily goings-on of archaic spain - for example, people unloading goods from a cart on the street, workers changing the candles of the street lamps, all in the background of the action. whilst i greatly sympathize with the recent idea of redeeming our femme fatals (like brian de palma's femme fatale), carmen is a poignant, modern take in the tradition of the noir classic double indemnity, and is a delightful pleasure to watch. this is another fine example of the triumph of daring european cinema over glitzy and safe hollywood fare.

at school i was taught how some shots were called and there were two directors constantly mentioned : orson welles and sergei m. eisenstein. i didn't care that much then (i was a kid!) but now i know why, eisenstein is a genius and it is a shame to see what was possible in 1938 where as almost more than a half century we're stuck with countless blank movies! some say this movie isn't worth the genius of eisenstein (then they have to watch it over and over till they can say anything bad) or even worse that it is just some propagandamovie for the russians. let's say it as it is, it is indeed pure propaganda for patriotism but isn't "saving private ryan" or "the longest day" so? i could sum up so many movies in where america is being raised to the top so why not russia, and besides every war is fought for itrs patriotism why else would they raise flags? aleksandr nevsky is a must for anyone who cares about cinematography as almost every shot is a sublime picture. perhaps it's all overseen but i am in wonder why this isn't included in imdb's top 250 where as there is so many overrated oscarcrap in it as well.

if you like shoot em up westerns this is a keeper. i thought that the movie was fun to watch and to see folks that i have not seen in a while. i am no expert but i liked the acting. the town and props etc seemed to fit the period and kind of town that you would find out on the frontier. this is not an a western, not enough people and budget. the costumes and firearms were correct for the time! i expect to see the young actors in the film again in the future. rachel, chance, rebekah and kirby were great. the sass (single action shooting society)members that contributed to this effort were pretty darn good. hope to see more.

i really enjoyed watching hell to pay. i've been a fan of westerns for as long as i can remember and this one reminded me of a lot of the westerns from the 1960s (even though i was too young to have seen them in their first run). the one thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant music. it was distracting at times. one thing i did notice, and i wonder how many other fans of gunsmoke noticed, was the name of buck taylor's character. it was a play on doc adams' name from gunsmoke. instead of gaylan adams, buck taylor used adam galen. i wonder if that was his choice or chris mcintyre's? anyway, i would recommend this movie to fans of westerns. don't expect anything too "deep". just plain old entertainment.

this is a cute little movie that provides pretty much what it promises - some good entertainment. after all, when a movie proclaims it features top sass shooters, you have to figure that it is not a likely candidate for the "best picture" oscar. those guys are shooters, not actors. your next clue is that the movie doesn't star nicholas cage or jennifer aniston, i.e. you shouldn't expect to see the current hottest names. it was meant to be just plain old entertainment and in that regard it is every bit as good as a lot of the old "oaters" i have seen through the years.so what do you get with "hell to pay"? you get 100 minutes of good old entertainment. you get a chance to see some stars from past years, who act pretty much like what they did in their prime but a little older. you get to see some good sass shooters in major roles and a few sass hams in the background. it was a lot of fun for me seeing people that i have shot with, visited in their homes and who are my good friends get to do something that a lot of people only ever dream about - they're in a real, live honest to gosh movie. they're doing something a lot of wannabe actors and wannabe shooters will never get the chance to do and i think that alone makes it worth the watch.admittedly, not everyone is a sass member and so i saw lots of fun and humor that others may miss, but it is still good, old-fashioned entertainment, and frankly, there are a lot of movies in the theatre right now that i wouldn't give a nickel to see, so save the money to go see "brokeback mountain" get "hell to pay" and watch some real cowboys have some fun.

for a long time, this was my favorite of the batman films. it had the best cinematography and an edgy feel to it with two wild characters - catwomen and the penguin - along with the always-interesting christopher walken. however, after the last viewing it finally slipped in my ratings and, frankly, i now prefer the last batman: batman begins, with christian bale.the good - nonetheless, this is still the most intriguing of the five latter-day batman films. the stylish cinematography in here is the best of any of the batman movies. director tim burton is known for his films which feature stunning visuals, as this is a great example. the three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting, almost fascinating. of the villains, i preferred catwomen, finding her the most fun to watch before and after she changed. violence is not overdone here as it was in several of the other batman stories but one is never bored watching this. as he did in the first film, michael keaton does a fine job playing batman/bruce wayne.the bad - for a movie based on a comic strip that mostly kids read, i still think these first two batman movies, both done by burton, were too dark and the profanity was definitely not appropriate. although, unlike the first movie, there was no usage of the lord's name in vain in here, there still was profanity and both villains made too many sexual remarks. that would have been okay if they hadn't marketed this film for kids as well as adults. danny devito's "penguin" is downright gross in spots. "grotesque" i can handle, but who wants "gross." few guys, meanwhile, complained about the beautiful michelle pfeiffer playing catwoman. generall too much darkness and some cheap shots on christian- bashing also made me re-consider my previously-high rating of this film.overall - fabulous visuals and memorable characters make this the most interesting in the batman series, but too-dark an edge, too gross and too much anti-religious bias all finally turned me off after a half-dozen looks at this film. sorry, but i prefer a kinder-gentler batman movie. after all, it's just a cartoon. most will disagree, but i was glad to see the series lighten up after this one.

with "batman returns", tim burton succumbed to an important priority in american cinema: giving a sequel to a blockbuster. three years after the most successful movie of the year, "batman" (1989), here comes the hero of gotham city again for the pleasure of many spectators. like its predecessor, "batman returns" enjoyed an enormous commercial success. tim burton made batman come back once again because it is to believe that the victory of the latter on his enemy the joker did little to improve the image of gotham city. indeed, violence and corruption still exist and here, the second word is epitomized by max shreck (christopher walken) and the penguin (danny de vito). these two crooks who are eager to take control of gotham city are going to make life difficult for batman. his task will be more difficult with the apparition of catwoman... tim burton still delivered much work on the scenery and it seems that he tried to correct the faults of the first movie. it means that the director gave way to fight sequences which are better mastered than in the first batman. but he didn't neglect the psychology of his main characters for all that. if in the movie of 1989, burton had focused on bruce wayne/batman's psychology, here, it's the penguin that obviously interested him. the director attempted to make of him, very well acted by de vito an ambiguous character. on one hand, he's full of bad intentions (previously quoted) but on the other hand, he's searching for his past and would like to be considered as a real man."batman returns" also appears as crazier than its predecessor, especially with the cast. i think of michèle pfeiffer who offers a daring and powerful performance as catwoman. besides, at the time when i'm writing this review, it makes me remember that a new version of catwoman is currently at the cinema. but given the bad reviews (3 out of 10 on imdb!), it is sure that her performer halle berry must pale into insignificance beside pfeiffer.ultimately, this film is one of the best sequels of 1992 and it enables to develop tim burton's peculiar style. we also still find his taste for the strange and the gothic. concerning batman's other adaptations for the screen, you can skip them. "batman forever" (1995) and "batman and robin" (1997) are no good. i heard that christopher nolan was shooting the beginning of the batman story and it was to be released next year. will it match tim burton's works?

this film is where the batman franchise ought to have stopped. though i will concede that the ideas behind "batman forever" were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director, as it turned out this was not to be the case.apparently warner brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second batman film from tim burton turned out. apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the sixties tv series, i fail to understand how "batman returns" can be considered at all disappointing.true, it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in "batman," a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of keaton and jack nicholson as the joker in the first film. yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying.michael keaton returns as the batman and his alter ego bruce wayne, tangling with nouveau riche tycoon max schreck (christopher walken, named in honour of the 1920s german silent actor), his partner-in-crime oswald cobblepot, the penguin (danny devito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of laurence olivier's "richard iii"), and selina kyle, the catwoman (michelle pfeiffer), whom wayne romances both as himself and as the batman. the four principals turn in excellent performances, especially walken and devito, while together keaton and pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities.there are some intriguing concepts in this film. about the only weakness i can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places, which i think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight. there simply isn't enough time to properly explore what's going on.nevertheless, this is a damn good film. i highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first, and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under burton and keaton.

any batman fan will know just how great the films are, they've been a major success. batman returns however is by far the best film in the series. a combination of excellent directing, brilliant acting and settings makes this worthy of watching on a night in.tim burton, who directed this movie, has specifically made sure that this film gives a realistic atmosphere and he's done a great job. danny devito (penguin man) is a man who has inherited penguin characteristics as a baby, and grown up to become a hideous and ugly...thing! michelle pfiffer plays the sleek and very seducing 'catwoman' after cats had given her there genes from being bitten. the result in both the character changes is excellent and both catwoman and penguin man play a very important role in this excellent film. the mysterious catwoman is great fun to watch - her classic sayings and a funny part in which skips with her whip in a jewelry shop adds such fun to the film. danny devito also does well, his ability to impersonate some strange creature was vital, and he adds a great atmosphere to the film that takes us back to the dull sewers where he lives.you can't forget batman though. micheal keaton once again pulls of a comfortable performance, and shows us a different side to batman. his affection is let loose when he confronts catwoman at the end of the film, and his meetings with her when she's a normal person, selina kyle, result in him being seduced badly in his own home. there's a clever part after this when they leave, and the film is full of great scenes. its worth noting that bruce wayne's bat mobile is not used as much as in the other batman films, as close combat and story telling scenes make up this film.the winter setting is created perfectly in gotham city with most of the scenes being set at night, and with the town being filled with snow. therefore, if you watch this film during the summer like i have, it doesn't feel the same. best watch it during the winter.overall, its an amazing movie. all the credit goes to tom burton and the cast, they've done an incredible job.

batman returns is more gothic and somber than its predecessor, and i like it a lot. also, the scenery is more darker, and the entire environment is saddening along with the soul-chilling music composed by the so-talented danny elfman.however, i didn't like the idea to make the penguin a monster, unlike to the comic books, where he's human. even if he looks like a monster, he shows well that he possesses a human dignity, and i felt very sorry for him when he saw the tombstones of his late parents. but still, he was a dangerous villain in fact, and he needed to be stopped.michael keaton made a "tour de force" with his return as the dark knight, and this time he's powerful as in the original batman. it's not difficult to understand why he's called batman in public sometimes...also, michelle pfeiffer is so sexy and well-fitted in her role, and she gave a faithfully performance as the female villain/crimefighter dressed as a cat. really, the actors did all a masterful work with batman returns, which made it a successful movie.if you liked batman, watch its awesome sequel, cause it's very worthy for all the dark knight's hard-core lovers.steve baillargeon

tim burton is in essence an expressionist film-maker, disinterested in dimensions of character and obsessed with gothic scope, opting for style over substance incessantly throughout his career. however, with his style being so poignantly endearing, i, like many moviegoers, forgive all the countless flaws that can be found in many of his movies and become engrossed in what are essentially, one hundred million dollar art films.it's almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic, emotionally involving spirit within the second installment of a mediocre franchise, especially when that franchises target audience are half-witted 15 year old boys. batman returns should have been every bit as commercial as its predecessor, ensuring box office draw and cheap (in actual fact, very expensive) thrills, being entertaining without ever truly involving its audience. had this been the result, then tim burton would have surely been required to direct a third installment. instead, burton delivers something that can only truly be defined by the phrase, 'out there'.from the melancholy opening in which a high society couple throw a prison-like bassinette containing their newly born deformed baby into a river, it is clear that batman returns, ain't no picnic at buckingham palace. cut to thirty three years later, during a political speech made by bad guy business tycoon max shreck (sinisterly portrayed by christopher walken), the red triangle circus gang attack gotham city. batman (michael keaton returning to the role) makes his first appearance sporting a new logo, eventually saving the day. shreck is soon kidnapped by the circus gang and black-mailed into endorsing the political return of the baby, now a fully grown penguin man (danny devito in hideously perfect make-up), whose motives for return are suspicious only to batman.meanwhile, shreck attempts to off his nosey and awkward assistant selina kyle (played perfectly by michelle pfeiffer who quite frankly deserved more recognition for her performance) who transforms into the deliciously sexy and psychotic catwoman, out for revenge and harbours, for some unexplained reason, a deadly vendetta against the dark knight.batman returns is bleak. the production design is breathtaking, delivering a cold haunting gotham city with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor. danny elfman's score supports the film brilliantly, ranging from invigorating to tragic. the tone and direction of the whole film itself is intensely brooding, shot like a sad nightmare, burton's direction overshadows what is in fairness a diabolical screenplay with an almost totally irrelevant plot and yet at the same time perfect for burton's visual style of film-making. and whilst burton's action sequences struggle for exhilaration, the real excitement lies in the directional choices displaying the fall of each of its main characters, the penguins demise, the catwoman's mental state and bruce wayne's lonely destiny.warner brothers hated it whilst critical and audience reaction was mixed. after all, they wanted a batman sequel, not a weird, somewhat ghastly horror movie, in which a deformed psychopathic orphan attempts to kidnap and drown a batch of babies, all-the-while vomiting what can only be described as green mucus. the production company wanted an audience friendly feature, something for the mcdonald's clan to promote their happy meals with, not a movie of dire irredeemable characters, including a sexually repressed secretary who is pushed from a skyscraper and revived by a gang of cats awakening her from unconsciousness by chewing on her bloodied ice cold fingers.it's easy to understand the mass disappointment that followed the release of batman returns. the film never felt like a batman blockbuster. it is questionable if burton really knew who batman actually was or even if he cared about the character as much as he cared about the film fitting in with his usual themes of beautifully haunting art direction and misinterpreted, lonely characters who rarely conform with societies standards and expectations. this is why burton failed to create a great batman film. he did however; create a nostalgic and stunning, ballsy piece of cinema that remains a personal and nostalgic favourite of mine.this may not be a great batman movie. but it is a great tim burton film.

what can i say, this film is amazing. it has its flaws like every film does for example wobbly headstones in a graveyard, a clearly visible slide board during the penguins death scene, max shreck losing his heavy coat in a split second between shots during the image consultancy scene, batman losing his black eye makeup all of a sudden between shots so he can reveal bruce wayne to catwoman, dialogue being recorded but is played back and spoken differently than when it was spoken in the first place and lastly catwoman all of a sudden knows how to use a bull whip without any training whatsoever. these flaws are minor compared to some you would see in for example batman forever where the riddler can obviously be seen waiting for his cue or val kilmer's hair changing between shots.what makes this film so deserving of an 8/10 is the great acting because the performances are absolutely amazing. michael keaton reprises his role as batman and has a lot more to do in this film. he looks more comfortable in the role the second time around and is on par with the villains performances. danny devito is the perfect penguin. i really like the conversion of the penguin into the grotesque penguin man instead of the non threatening character from the comics or tv show because now the character has more depth and has a far more interesting story that generates from the basic need of family and to feel accepted and wanted. this gives us an evil character who we feel sympathy for because he was rejected for being what he is which is not his fault. michelle pfeiffer is excellent as catwoman. she is sleet and sexy and she is also a villain we can feel sorry for because of the way she is victimised. christopher walken is a great secondary villain and is so interesting a character even though he is not even in the batman universe.the soundtrack is far better than the first and danny elfman gets more of a chance to show off his musical talents this time around. the sets are amazing. they are detailed, eye catching, sinister, gothic , unique, dark and so many other adjectives can describe how amazing they look. the costumes and make up are great and obviously a lot of work went into making them and all the work pays off because the batsuit is better, the cat suit is amazing to look at and the penguin make up and effects are so convincing.the animatronic penguins look really realistic and are played to good effect. the script is really good and the storyline in my opinion is a plausible one. overall, because of all these factors this film deserves an 8/10 and stands as my favourite of all the batman films

the best batman movie of the 90's no doubt about it. this movie takes place in a city filled with insecurity and nightmares.although the villains are somewhat cheesy, they fit perfect for the movie's tone of colorful but nightmarish cinematography. the performances are really great and the comic tone behind them really delivers expectations. don't get fooled by the cheesy outfits, this is a movie in the pure style of burton. that can't be described; burton is a sui generis director that took the batman franchise to another obscure level but not forgetting about it's comic style past. recommended for fans of action cinema and best of all, if it deals with super heroes.

first off, this film has no story. it's obvious there were a lot of rewrites during production -- sometimes characters reference a timeline that is impossible, and this is probably because the timeline of the entire story was never known to anyone on the set.that said, the film is kinda brilliant. pfeiffer is amazing -- and i mean amazing, as catwoman; she nails the character's inherent sexy darkness and good/bad tendencies. walken is walken -- but even more nasty than usual. devito is not true to the comic book when it comes to penguin, but he is good and memorable. keaton is underrated as batman. and the music and style are pure cinema thrill. true, the 3rd act doesn't work. but the final 2 scenes are knockouts, and it's clear pfeiffer and keaton were meant to be in a trilogy that got derailed by this film's kinky darkness. that's too bad, because pfieffer and keaton had classic chemistry, and had they acted in a third installment, joel you know who might not have gotten the chance to destroy batman for an entire generation of movie fans.

when i first rented batman returns, i immediately thought it was going to be less than exceptional. i mean, jack nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so without him, how could there be a good movie? simple, throw in danny devito.batman returns is an arguably more dark movie than batman. there are more villains here, less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects, and more nerve-striking issues. however, the music is similar to the first if not darker. the scenery is definitely more depressing than the first, every detail right down to the time of year. this movie follows the same comic-style format we came to love in the first batman.now for the performances. michael keaton thankfully returns as batman/bruce wayne. he was great in the first movie, and just as much in this sequel. there was not enough screen time in the world for keaton as batman, need more! danny devito gave an award-winning performance as the penguin, the most grueling, disgusting, lovable, angry, evil, sad, pathetic villain ever to grace a superhero movie. you hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at the same time. and it explains him down to the last detail too, making it all the more conflicting. michelle pfeiffer was excellent as catwoman/selina kyle. two completely different personalities in one. she actually got a good amount of back story as well. christopher walken didn't disappoint as max shreck, the greedy, judgmental, selfish ceo of the power company. michael gough also thankfully returns as the lovable alfred, and he was just as good here as well. pat hingle also returns as gordon, although i feel he was really never in the spotlight.with lots of great twists and sub-plots, batman returns is sure to please any fan of the original.9/10

batman returns it is my opinion that the first batman of the batman series was only half the movie that batman returns is. in the first batman by tim burton we had only batman and the joker both played wonderfully by michael keaton and jack nicholson.in batman returns we have what i feel is the most perfectly cast batman movie (yes even better then dark knight). keaton returns as batman and is perfect in the role never going to far over top with the character of batman, which is perfect in this film when it comes to the two villains that he's up against. first you have danny devito who is delightfully insane as the penguin. then you have michelle pfeiffer as cat-woman, who i dare to say is one of the most interesting and complex villains in the batman movies. i feel this way about pfeiffer because of the way she becomes the cat-woman she starts off as the rather pathetic mousy selena kyle and then truly dives into the dark side of her mind and what you get is a brilliant performance of a woman who goes from trying to be a hero to a villain and then i suppose back to a hero in the end. also in this amazing cast you have the evil businessman max schreck played by the amazing and legendary christopher walken. while in a supporting role there's something about this role that i love and maybe it's the look of schreck in the film that makes his performance all the better then it already is.story wise i have to say that batman returns has so much more going on this time around as opposed to the first batman. part of the reason i loved this story so much is the fact that burton dared to go in a much more darker and twisted direction as opposed to nicholson's over the top antics. you have the story on the penguin and how he tries to deceive the people of gotham into making him the new hero and mayor of the city. then you have cat-woman and her struggle to decide just who she really is and what she should do with her new persona. when it comes to batman i feel that in this one he's more the ring leader that holds the two stories together but of course kicking ass at the same time.cinematography was the film is dark and atmospheric just like the story that's taking place within it. gotham city never looked as good as it does on blu-ray and hd so if you have the chance to see it this way then by all means do because it truly adds to the overall experience of batman returns.so all in i truly feel that of all the batman movies batman returns believe it or not tops the dark knight for me because while i enjoyed that movie for heath ledger's amazing performance as the joker i felt that the movie was lacking something. batman returns lacks nothing, so if you want to see an amazing film with what i feel is a perfect cast then this is the batman to light the bat signal for.

as a kid i grew up with the chintzy 60's tv series (and no i'm not that old pow!). however when director tim burton brought his novel vision to the silver screen, i simply took an immediate shine to it and never backed away from favoring his installments over the much hyped-latest additions ('batman begins' and 'the dark knight'), which i don't really care for. even if they're going for a much more grounded approach and wanting to explore bruce wayne/batman psyche further but in honesty i don't think there's all that much to tap in to. i wanted crazy fun with a dark streak and in my eyes that's what burton brought across, and this is the reason why i can watch them over and over again. after wowing audiences with the 1989 'batman', thanks to the gaudily gothic art direction and jack nicholson take no-prisoners performance of the camped-up, but psychotic joker. burton would return 3 years later for the follow up and my favorite of the batman films so far; 'batman returns'. camp, but well-done. in what would fair up to being even more expansive, louder, dreary, and nihilistic and having two villainous foes for the price of one. enter the grotesque penguin (with danny devito magnificently going out on a limb) and the ravishing catwoman (a steamy michelle pfeiffer who fills out the suit nicely) coming to spoil gotham's party. again batman (an aptly brooding michael keaton is equally commendable and looks quite imposing in that bat suit look at the eyes) plays second fiddle to the bad guys, but i always preferred this sober interpretation of batman that gave him an ominously gloomy mystique, but also a wearing psychological complexity that never felt the need to force feed. and his turn of bruce wayne was well served too. burton's illustratively atmospheric direction opens with his sleek gothic style engraving an carnival comic book world filtered in with a splendid range of characters and vivid costumes. the moody narrative (in what probably is a tad too long) is more so symbolic in its progression, rather show-piecing its spontaneously arresting and extravagant set-pieces and sharply etched art direction covered with shadowy tinges and grey/blue neon lighting of a wintry backdrop. the magnetically free-flowing camera-work takes flight and danny elfman's stately spacious score balances the playfulness along with gloomy touches with a very hypnotic pull. the rest of the performances might be overshadowed, but christopher walken digs in his teeth into a smarmily glassy role of a two-faced businessman max shreck. pat hingle is back, but gets very little to do as commissioner james gordon and michael gough is delightful as alfred. in solid support are michael murphy, andrew bryniarski, vincent schiavelli, doug jones and peter rubens also makes a cameo appearance.

i remember really liking batman returns when it came out in 1992, but now i think that this is the best of all the batman movies (even over christopher nolan's terrific 2005 batman begins and definitely over the seriously over-hyped overrated 2008 the dark knight!). i originally remember thinking that the 1st batman w/ jack nicholson was the best (and i still love it). but i think that this movie really hits the nail on the head. the 4 main characters (batman, penguin, catwoman, and max shreck) are all vivid and memorable. you really get to see what batman/bruce wayne is all about in keaton's terrific characterization. keaton is the best batman, not kilmer, clooney, or even the up-and-coming bale, who was exceptional in bb and could have stolen top honors from keaton had his character not been destroyed by nolan's hack film-making in tdk !. danny devito as the penguin is disturbing, scary, hilarious, and lethal. devito is great and doesn't need scenery-chewing to give great performance like nicholson's joker. the viewer can actually sympathize with this disfigured outcast and his plight to fit into normal society. i had never really been big fan of michelle pfeiffer until this film, but this is definitely my favorite performance of hers. pfeiffer's selina kyle is goofy and odd at first, then when she is transformed into catwoman, she is simultaneously sexy and scary, a total deadly sexpot! also, i feel that keaton and pfeiffer have more chemistry than keaton and basinger from batman; they form a tragic love story. and christopher walken as shreck is, well, as always, christopher walken!batman returns, more so than batman, is more confident and focused. it is assured film-making from beginning to end. the way burton introduces the penguin's heartbreaking backstory grabs you from the very beginning. the first 5 minutes are among my favorite beginnings to any film: danny elfman's music sets an ominous foreboding tone that defines the rest of the film. it is a modification from the original batman and a great one!then flash forward 33 years to the present day gotham and we are introduced to powerful businessman shreck who wants to build new power plant in gotham. during same scene we meet shreck's meek, bullied, under-confident secretary selina kyle. and not long after all this is the film's exciting opening action sequence as batman must battle the penguin's red triangle gang, a fun yet lethal group of outcasts and circus performers. penguin sets plan in motion to attack the gotham christmas celebration, kidnap shreck in the chaos, and force him to help re-introduce him to society. meanwhile, selina discovers shreck's criminal plans and so he "kills" her by shoving her out his high-rise office, then she is revived by cats. sound convoluted? yes, but burton never claimed to be posing a realistic story. he has created a world where the viewer can accept that things like this can happen, a dark, noirish world comprised of mistreated, deformed outcasts who deep down only want acceptance and to fit in. confident storytelling if you ask me!the action scenes are few and far in between, but they are all exciting, entertaining, and nail-biting. they aren't there just for show, the way some in batman are. and they all make sense. the climactic scene with penguin's "army" marching into the center of gotham with batman zoning in on penguin's hideout and sidekick butler alfred (michael gough in a welcome return from the original!) assisting batman is succinct, solid, heart-pounding fun!i also love the christmastime, wintry setting, which adds to the super-dark, cold feel of burton's batman world. i also love the way burton slowly introduces to us the batman "toys" without shoving them down our throats. each "toy" is appropriate for that moment in the film and we are compelled to accept them for their purpose. and although dark, returns is still a funny film. devito's penguin has many funny lines. so does walken's shreck. the batman-catwoman exchanges are extremely stimulating and humor-filled as well! a great ensemble! all in all, batman returns is a tightly woven tale of the dark forces at play in tim burton's fun, comic book world.

1992's "batman returns" was tim burton's second round as director and yet again he scored a hit by making this film again dark and gloomy like his 1989 one. gotham city again is a place of darkness and gloom with crime and corruption boiling out from every street corner. it was also clever to see how burton used politics as a subplot that tied in well and neat with the business corruption of businessman max shreck(christopher walken)and the plan to make the "penguin"(danny devito) mayor of gotham! anyway keaton again returns as "batman"/bruce wayne and he gives another stellar performance as a strange and torn man who just can't find love in a normal world yet he is challenged when he meets another lonely soul in selina kyle only ms. kyle has a dark secret of her own one that's very slinky and she's just a downright vamp as the sexy and mysterious yet dangerous "catwoman"(michelle pfeiffer). a plan forms between both villains to destroy gotham and most of all both want to rid themselves of the bat. really this film even though violent and somewhat gross with many penguin scenes is clearly an exciting thrill ride from start to finish as you never find a dull moment and thumbs up to tim again for his exploring of the characters as dark and conflicted it just made the film even more interesting. the performance from michelle pfeiffer was the best ever as no one could have played "the catwoman" any better and devito was perfect as the "penguin" his body frame fit the character just perfect his performance even though ghoulish was fun to watch. "batman returns" is an entertaining thrill ride that you can't take your eyes off of as a viewer you will enjoy it many times it's that thrilling and explosive.

i've enjoyed this movie ever since i was a kid and i still do. i also liked batman forever back then but the real difference is that this movie didn't date when i grew up. i did notice a few scenes in this film that didn't make any sense like: 'hhmm... the crowd is angry. hey! where did they get those tomatoes from?' then i thought: 'who cares? this movie is not 100% serious anyway!'the original tim burton batman was great as well but it was a bit cheesy at some parts and i didn't like all the actors. this movie improved on almost every aspect with a wonderful cast, a more gothic style and no involvement of prince. nowadays, many fans of the christopher nolan movies dislike burton claiming that the nolan movies are more serious and therefore more loyal to the comics. i don't think this is entirely true: -there has never been an adaptation of the original concept of batman which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun. -batman has taken many forms over the years peeking its silliness in the 60's (and a bit with batman & robin). a director is free to choose what kind of batman he's going to portray as long if it's good.my opinion: batman doesn't necessarily have to be serious. it's about a man in a rubber suit with pointy ears. burton managed to create a perfect balance between the silliness and the darkness surrounding the whole idea.i just recently watched the nolan movies and i love those ones as well (especially the dark knight). there's simply something about this movie that interests me more. nolan's goal was to give the character much more depth and in doing so, he looked for an explanation of nearly every aspect of batman. that's a bit too much for me, i'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of batman. the burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere.my conclusion is that you shouldn't compare the nolan with the burton movies. they're just different and it's up to you to decide which one you like better. my respect is for both directors.

i always thought the batman returns was a great sequel to batman. the story was an interesting one and danny devito, christopher walken and micheal keaton gave great performances. plus lets face it, tim burton was a genius and did the comic book character more justice than joel screwmacher ever did.plot: oswald cobblepot also know as the penguin(played by danny devito) is abandoned by his parents as child for being deformed. he uses this as an excuse to masquerade a sinister plot to abduct the first born children of gotham with the help of his goons(red triangle gang) and a very shady tycoon max shreck(played by christopher walken). max shreck later makes penguin the mayor of gotham. selina kyle(michelle pfeiffer) is pushed out of a window by max shreck and is revived by cats. later on she develops cat-like qualities and seeks to destroy max shreck and batman. her reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained.opinion: batman returns is a classic. it has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere. tim burton always had a knack for making grim backgrounds look appealing. micheal keaton is still sharp as batman. danny devito steals the show as oswald cobblepot/the penguin. when you think about it, he would have made a better violator for the movie spawn than john leguizamo. michelle pfeiffer gave catwoman more personality than halle berry ever could. max shreck is one of christopher walken's best roles. the main reason why i like batman returns is that its fun. its not only creative but its also fun. something a lot of big budget movies these days sorely lack. the batman series goes to the dogs after tim burton decided to do no more. you don't believe me, look at batman forever and batman and robin. thank god that christopher nolan breathed life back into the series with batman begins.

why is it better? because it's true to the dark vision of the comic. because the imagery is inventive and, unlike the first, there are real moments of fear and pathos in this one. the first one had too much of jack nicholson's shtick, too much prince music, and an awkward "romance." here, instead of one villain, there are three. no robert wuhl, and the leading lady is more than just a pretty face. in fact, pfeiffer is the #1 attraction of this film. her transformation is what drives the running theme, teetering on the edge of sanity and insanity, good and evil. she becomes truly fearsome. the costumes and makeup are excellent. danny devito's penguin is inspired and anguished, not just a nut. his circus gang posse is the one element of comic relief (besides that giant duck). max shrek is the only character i'd have toned down, walken is pretty hammy as the ruthless businessman. danny elfman's score is a perfect fit as usual, and the siouxie and the banshees song ("face to face") is easily the best of any of the songs from any of the films, a perfect match of musical artist and film soundtrack. the least campy of the films, it is macabre, doesn't pander, and demands second and third viewings like an amusement park ride. bravo tim burton and cast!

forget the over-rated "batman begins, this is the ultimate batman movie that you are not gonna want to miss out on. this movie has everything, and it totally surpasses the first 1989 mega hit. it may not have done as well as the first one in at the box office, but this is certainly a much better film. the visuals are amazing, burton works his magic as he always does in his films once again. gotham city, batmans hunting ground, is an amazing sight to behold. the story itself is actually quite good and the 2 villains in this one are very interesting, much more interesting in fact then there comic book counterparts. tim burton and screenplay writer daniel walters go a step further to bring you a truly emotional connection with these characters. the penguin, played to perfection by danny devito, is a type of tragic character who was abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeks revenge on the world that denied him. very disgusting to watch at times, but he has some of the most classic lines a villain could ever utter in a single film. the other villain is catwoman, played so absolutely brilliantly by michelle pfieffer, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and gives a wow performance, and totally steals the show as far any of the past and present live action batman villain's is concerned. she also has a tragic background. her name is selina kyle, and she is a very put-upon, mousy secretary for a shrewd business man called max shreck, who later murders her by shoving her out a window. somehow, she survives and is "awakened" by cats, and decides right then and there to become the legendary catwoman, not before, of course, the amazing sequence in which she completely lets loose and wrecks her entire apartment in one of the most oscar worthy performance's of rage and anger i have ever seen in an actress.michael keaton once again dons the cape and cowl as batman and also as bruce wayne and this time hes much darker. there's not much else to say here except that keaton is simply the best actor to play batman ever. he just oozes cool, and he has a kind of clint eastwood approach to playing batman, and he is very dark. he doesn't talk a lot, and when he does, he sounds very cool and he doesn't make his voice sound all goofy and fake ie bales "batman" voice in batman begins. he struts around gotham like a man possessed by his own inner demons. he's pshycologically disturbed, and you know it. in this outing he takes on 2 of the most famous baddies to ever grace the batman comic book world.i have to say though, despite the awesomeness of the action scenes, like the scenes with the coolest batmobile ever racing down the street knocking thugs to the ground and batman gliding across gotham, its the romantic angle between pfieffer and keaton that really makes this movie classic a top choice for anyone who wants to see the real batman in action, i rate this a 10, would give it more if i could.

so what is 'batman returns', anyway?it was marketed as an action film, and many people who've seen it seem to think that they've watched an action film - but really, there isn't that much action, and tim burton barely seems interested in it.people often align it with the 'grittier' superhero comics of the late eighties, but honestly, if you've read 'the dark knight returns', that seems just a little absurd; burton's excessive imaginings have more in common with the day-glo sixties tv series (the penguin drives around in a giant plastic duck, for goodness' sake).burton's style is often described as gothic, and that's a little closer to what we see on screen; the penguin - deformed, malign, with a tangled history and a subterranean lair - is a gothic menace dressed up in more respectable dickensian clothes - udolfo masquerading as uriah heep. but what of catwoman? she may be raised from the dead, but that pvc catsuit is decidedly twentieth century, and her alter ego selina kyle's world is all boardrooms and apartments - reminiscent of a 1930s romantic comedy.and then it clicks. the smart but downtrodden secretary romanced by a lonely millionaire? the ensuing complications caused by deception and disguise? 'batman returns' is, quite clearly, a romantic comedy in the old hollywood style, filtered through burton's s&m dungeon sensibilities. it has more in common with 'the hudsucker proxy' (including expressionist sets) than it does with other superhero films. like many a romantic comedy, it centres around the make-over of the heroine; not from ugly duckling to swan, but from doormat to dominatrix. michelle pfeiffer gives one of the performances of her (often remarkable) career; she's iconically sexy as catwoman (poor halle berry never had a prayer), playful and vindictive, memorable because she knows how to act with her whole body. in retrospect, though, it's her scenes as selina that impress; almost every one of them is a little comic gem, particularly the glimpse we get of her lonely home life. it's a delicately balanced tragicomic performance, and it's in these scenes that the film really sparks to life. nothing moves me quite like selina and bruce wayne dancing under the mistletoe to siouxsie and the banshees, a gun held between them, simultaneously empowered and trapped by their alter egos, doomed to conflict. forget the easy sentimentality of 'big fish' or the gossamer emotions of 'edward scissorhands' - this is the most heartfelt scene in all of burton's films. love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, insanity, self-loathing and not a little wit, all in a few short lines and absolutely nailed by the actors - particularly pfeiffer. elsewhere, danny de vito almost matches her, finding the wounded dignity buried beneath those truly repellent long-johns. the upper-crust villain of the comics is revealed to be nothing more than a sham; burton's penguin is a feral creature subjected to his own, eliza doolittle-style make-over (almost literally an 'ugly duckling'). it's burton's most radical - and funniest - reinvention. christopher walken's max schreck completes a perfect triptych of villains, sliding between casual charm and blank-eyed psychosis with unnerving ease (and is it just me, or does his company's logo bring to mind mickey mouse? perhaps we should ask former disney animator burton).christopher nolan's 'batman begins' - a real action film - has been much praised as the first film to do justice to batman; i admire nolan's film, but it would be a pity if it were allowed to overshadow this idiosyncratic gem.

this sequel proves that tim burton was for all intents and purposes the best choice to ever direct a batman movie. the story focuses on baman taking on three enemies: the penguin (wonderfully played by danny devito) catwoman (the slinky michelle pfeiffer) and max shreck (the superb christopher walken).perhaps the best entry in the series, it has it all: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out. the cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand-out is devito as the multi-layered penguin. here is a guy who is evil, pitiable, funny and perhaps most importantly, scary. the infamous scene with shreck's image consultants still sends shivers up my spine. in other words, the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances.i do not hesitate to say that "batman returns" is my favorite of all the batmans released (sorry, dark knight fans). if you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action, then please check out this badly underrated film. if nothing else, it's at least the best film tim burton has ever made.

batman returns is to be considered quality when one speaks of superhero films. its predecessor, batman, in my opinion, is by far the greatest and most well thought out of the comic book genre. for one to say that batman returns was disappointing, he or she has not fully watched the movie and considered the acting of danny devito as the penguin. devito and walken offer some memorable moments. the tale of batman is suppose to be dark and tim burton has fulfilled how the comic portrays batman. batman returns provides comic relief, action, suspense and fantasy; and it should not be viewed as 'crap', although we are all entitled to our own opinions.

good film.i managed to pick this up on dvd in a local store sale. £2.99 seems like a good deal and it is. thing is the film is named "to kill for". it took a little detective work to find out it's original name.in the uk it has been rated as an 18 and rightly so although the standard of films depends on the "ability to sell". having seen final destination 3 last night it, in my view, should have been a 18.maybe the fact the delightful, traci lords is in it tends to make the classification board step it up to 18. such a shame.traci is a great actress and should be given the chance to appear in bigger and large budget productions. she ability to turn what is branded a b-movies into a fine performance is nothing short of amazing.long live traci lords and her incredible talent as an actress.

it's been said that batman begins in the first batman movie to "get it right" but i think that's a horrible overstatement, for i think the new batman film, although greater that batman forever and batman and robin, pales compared to tim burton's classics, with this one being the best of the five. the darkness is beautiful, as is the music and scenery, creating a gotham city cloaked in mystery, unlike batman begins, where gotham city is a normal-looking city. the villains are terrific in this movie. you literally can't take your eyes off of the penguin and cat woman. i applaud tim burton for being original with his use of the penguin as a freak, rather than an ordinary criminal or a clone of the old batman tv show. in batman begins we have the scarecrow, whose not nearly as demanding on screen as the penguin or cat woman. the film doesn't need to focus only on batman, because we already know his story, and it is the villains who we are exploring and trying to figure out, and they are the ones who create the plot, with the penguin running for mayor and seeking revenge for his parents' desertion by killing the first born sons of gotham, a task he fails. danny devito gives the finest performance ever by a superhero villain in any film, surpassing even nicholson's joker. the closing scene where the penguins drag the dead body of the penguin into the water is touching and powerful. it's a tragedy that tim burton wasn't allowed to complete his trilogy, since warner bros., interesting in marketing appeal, wanted to "lighten" the batman movies up. and they got their wish...unfortunately. tim burton planned on directing the third film, using the riddler as the villain, with no two-face and robin to mess it up, and i'm sure michael keaton would've signed on. so this is the last great batman film. batman begins is dark, but boring, tedious, ordinary, filled with lackluster villains, and a playboy bruce wayne. a decent batman film, but the best batman film ever? never. batman returns holds that crown.

batman returns is a really dark movie, that shows the caped crusader fighting against the penguin and the sexy catwoman (i'll get to them later). michael keaton acts well as bruce wayne, showing he is a good actor. tim burton directs this picture well, and the locations of the movie are impressive. the villains: danny devito is menacing as the penguin. a cruel, yet disturbed man, that had a really hard childhood. but, michelle pfeiffer steals the picture. she is the best catwoman ever! she is threatening, and extremely sexy. there's a scene where she kisses batman the cat way that just heats the movie up. the action scenes are good too, and the ending is dramatic and tragic, probably the best ending of a batman movie. tim burton shows he can manage a batman movie really well (he already demonstrated this with the first batman) and also gives batman a darker nature. so much like him.

many of us find art agreeable only when the masterpiece itself touches something deep inside us. that is, the completed creation can only be accepted and appreciated if we can somehow personally relate to it. it was winter, here in australia 1992 when i had seen batman returns at the cinemas and it blew me away. both "me's". i was supposed to belong to an ideal, a standard, but at the same time i was living another life. tim burton was the first film maker to say its ok for a comic movie to be dark and to confess that darkness can happen to us all. after tim burton's batman interpretations, many other dark comic book heroes and anti-heroes flooded the cinemas. comic book folklore for decades had told of friendly, likable heroes with dashingly handsome smiles and magical superpowers who fly in the sky, and spun powerful webs from their wrists and wore red boots and had the strength of a locomotive. but what happens when you are only ten years old and you see your parents coldly executed in front of your very eyes? you snap. somewhere in your psyche,your young tender psychological make up breaks apart. the only way such pain and hurt can be managed is to create an alternate persona.you make a promise. your other self will be stronger, harness all the anger all the rage to use whatever means available to avenge the innocence of your parents onto that criminal, those criminals, any criminal. this is life seen through bruce wayne's eyes. both pairs. the world he sees is dark, gloomy, and cold. although he patrols the streets and people hear him cruise by, they don't rush out to get his autograph. he is their saviour, not the winner of a personality contest. batman returns is about losers. batman, for yet another christmas, remains "the only lonely man beast in town". bruce wayne never gets to lawfully arrest the vile max shreck. the penguin never gets to unleash his pain of being discarded by his parents onto the citizens of gotham, and selina kyle is forever lost to being mentally fragmented and traumatized. and the hero doesn't get the girl- or cat.this movie delves into the desire in all of us to want so desperately to belong, to have a home, as expressed by bruce wayne and oswald cobblepot.the film brings out a need in all of us to be heard, respected and not ignored as desired by selina kyle , oswald and of course bruce wayne. but sometimes we are all suppressed in one way or another, we are told to be an ideal, to behave to a certain standard. that is until we finally snap. only hope remains at the end of the movie as we see catwoman rise towards the night sky. but come what may we all must wish good will towards all men and women. as for me , i cant say that i will reach a point where i will believe my problem with duality will be reconciled. but thats ok. we all have a dark side. batman returns is not only the best of the batman films ,it is truly a stand out exceptionally fine masterpiece of storytelling.

ah, batman returns, is it possible to have a sequel to be almost as good as the original? with batman returns, it came pretty close! we have terrific actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new villains, catwoman and the penguin. we have michael keaton back as batman and he's still awesome than ever. michelle pfieffer, the perfect choice for catwoman and was perfectly cast into place. as much as i love and is such an incredible actress annette benning, she couldn't have been catwoman, she doesn't really have the look. danny devito, who could have imagined him as the penguin? he was just great and terrifying! batman returns with a more loving community of gotham city, they are celebrating christmas time with, max shrek played by a creepy christopher walken. the perfect villain who mistreats his lovely secretary, selina who happens to hear too much at his office causing him to push her out the window in hopes that she dies and will never reveal the information of knowing the penguin and the attempt to make him loved in gotham. when she survives and is awakened by cats, she wants revenge and is ready to go at it with her cats! but there is also another active villain, the penguin who is in search of his parents that abandoned him and now he is looking to be the new mayor of gotham city! can batman be able to stop both super villains from creating their hanous acts and stop the mayor from destroying the city as well?you'll have to see! batman returns is just as good as the original batman, despite the first one remaining the true classic, this one still takes you for a ride. and come on, i mean we've got michelle in leather! her classic moment of just meeting batman and the penguin "meow" is classic! there are memorable characters, lines, and sets! you'll have a blast! trust me! 9/10

and a perfect film to watch during the holiday season as the winter/xmas atmosphere that burton creates for gotham city is way cool. it's weird that warner decided to release this as a summer film. it doesn't fit.but what's even weirder, when you consider the content of this film, is that it was aimed at families. an upper-class family throws their mutant baby down the sewer, a socio phobic billionaire dresses up in leather as a flying rodent, a lonely secretary dresses up in leather as a feline and a freak runs for political office. and s&m and bondage are presented in a very perverted way. but burton got away with it. his visual style in this film is at it's best.this and batman: dead end are the only true live-action incarnations of the comic-book character. true, the animated series was the closest to the source material, but compared with batman forever and the un-nameable one after that, batman returns is the best of the four.darker and more violent than the first movie, the sense of gothic pathos reaches a new high. i was quite keen on michael keaton as bruce wayne (don't even get me started on george clooney!), he displayed the right balance of weirdo loner and cool crime fighter. michelle pfieffer is great as catwoman (much sexier and more 'realisticly' cat-like), she wears that leather outfit better than halle berry. and danny devito was so convincing as the penguin that his scenes became disturbing to watch. and christopher walken is brilliant as the spooky max shreck (if you think you recognise chip shrek it's none other than a very young leatherface/butterfinger).danny elfman's score is also even better than it was first time round. his powerful and engaging themes are way better than the dross that followed in the later 2 schumacher movies. this movie is the batman phenomenon at its zenith. forget the following sequels and stick to the animated series after this. let's hope that christopher nolan and christian bale can bring some integrity back to the live action batman with their movie next year.this dvd was one of the first ever dvds released by warner (almost 7 years ago!!!) and as a result there are no features and the case is a snapper. pick it up cheap like i did and hope for an se in the future.

in extramarital we see b-actress traci lords at her very best. she's all wrapped in horror & suspense here, a type of role that suits her very well.this mainstream movie lends a lot of its atmosphere from paul verhoeven's 'basic instinct' (1992), by the way. however, there are differences between the main female characters of traci lords ('99) and that of sharon stone ('92). for instance, in extramarital traci adds some tiny elements from her porn-past. we also shouldn't forget mentioning extramarital's three main actors. by putting down a convincing performance, each of them greatly contributes to the overall quality of this movie. all this makes extramarital into a very enjoyable b-movie. its storyline shows a good build-up, its tense being well-spread from start to finish. this movie keeps you at the edge of your seat, until its unexpected end.

the movie was very good. i'm an avid mystery fan and i usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. while i did figure out who was going to be killed i didn't figure out who did it. i wasn't happy with the portrayal of the gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. please know that while these poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have japp, ms. lemon and especially hastings! david suchet is definitely poirot. i have seen every actor who's played him. the worst was peter ustinov!

this movie was over-shadowed by 'the jackal' (bruce willis, richard gere) which was released the same year. having seen both films, i can honestly say this is the superior film.granted, the production value of 'the jackal' was very good, it probably had a substantially bigger budget. however, 'the assignment' is well written and has a fascinating story. aiden quinn is flawless in dual roles. aiden quinn and director christian duguay did a great job of establishing a deep and multi-layered relationship between the title character and his family. i particularly liked the ending.i was reminded of the jack ryan character in the tom clancy movies. both are naval officers thrown into unbelievably dangerous roles as they covertly work on behalf of national security. and yet, both harrison ford and aidan quinn reveal their respective characters as heros who manage to be both virile and gentle. they have a genuine tenderness and vulnerability in their relationships with their families. what i don't understand is how the opinions of all who have posted on this movie (myself included) can be so much more positive than the luke-warm reception the film has received. this is a movie that has enough complexity and subtlety that it remains compelling after multiple viewings. if you are a fan of espionage-genre films, i recommend 'the assignment' enthusiastically.

this movie is about carlos "the jackal" (quinn), an international terrorist who, by cia agent henry fields's (sutherland) description, appears to maim women and children for the heck of it. at least that's what he says to guilt us naval officer annibal ramirez (quinn again) into taking on the assignment of posing as carlos and setting him up as a traitor in the eyes of the kgb. ramirez is apparently physically identical to carlos but mentally he is his antithesis. he is borne of order and carlos is borne of chaos.the movie isn't all shoot-gun-jump-around action, and that's a good thing. in its first half, ramirez undergoes training to act and think like carlos, and that's actually where the movie achieves its distinction from other run-of-the-mill action flicks. an israeli agent (kingsley), joins fields in training ramirez, and together they appear to take on the roles of parents in the birthing of ramirez's new character. ramirez is taught to dislike the things carlos dislikes, to act on the split second like carlos would, and even to make love like carlos (courtesy of an ex-girlfriend of carlos's). naturally all that he is taught would be put to good use in the later half of the movie. it's a little contrived but quinn gives a riveting performance as a carlos-wannabe.another thing i liked about this movie was that it didn't utilize the much overdone plot point in evil twin movies - you know, the one in which the evil twin insinuates himself into the good twin's family. ramirez's family does come into the picture, but instead they highlight how his new character wrecks havoc on his family life.good chuckle humor is injected into this movie, often coming the acerbic duo of sutherland and kingsley. an exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke involving ramirez's first name (annibal, annabelle, get it?). also overdone was the constant harping by the duo about how powerful and cunning and intelligent carlos is. in my opinion, during the final showdown, the payoff wasn't able to match the build-up.on the whole, the movie was enjoyable. i'm not a big action flick fan but this movie was more intelligent and engrossing than the average action movie and it maintained my attention throughout.my rating: 9/10

once i knew that donald sutherland, (jack shaw/henry fields) was appearing in this film it instantly told me this was going to be a good picture to view. most of sutherland's pictures are full of action and suspense and he can play a rather cruel character and can also be quite charming and kind. in this picture, jack shaw did his very best to be a good guy and a bad guy while he was training a naval office to become a spy who had to change his entire identity and become a different person over night. there is plenty of car chase scenes and plenty of stunt men situations which i would not want to perform. this naval officer lived in a quite community with his wife and was a father, but you would never realize that fact until the film reveals his horrible background secrets which he had to keep from his family and friends. good spy film and great acting by all the actors.

the movie was very good. i'm an avid mystery fan and i usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. while i did figure out who was going to be killed i didn't figure out who did it. i wasn't happy with the portrayal of the gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. please know that while these poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have japp, ms. lemon and especially hastings! david suchet is definitely poirot. i have seen every actor who's played him. the worst was peter ustinov!

i'm a huge fan of the spy genre and this is one of the best of these films. the assignment is based on a true story, which has been somewhat embellished for the big screen, and it really takes you on a fun ride. the film has a great cast, starring aidan quinn, donald sutherland and ben kingsley.naval officer quinn is a reluctantly recruited by sutherland after a chance meeting with kingsley who believes quinn to be the famous terrorist carlos the jackal. because quinn so closely resembles carlos, sutherland stops at nothing to recruit him because sutherland is obsessed with the terrorist's capture or death.the training sequences are awesome. quinn is really put to the test by kingsley and sutherland, having to withstand attacks from remote controlled snowmobiles, from eating the same food each day, to being drugged with a hallucinogen. he even has to learn how to make love to a woman the way carlos would.the film has some great action scenes with quinn eluding allies because they believe he is carlos and in his final mission when he is to kill the jackal. throughout the film, quinn must struggle with the new personality he has attained versus his own. will he remain as ruthless and free as carlos or will he once again return to his life of a good husband and father? if you like the spy genre, this is a must see. the action is used only to propel the story of this thriller forward; no gratuitous explosions or fight scenes. rating 10 of 10 stars.

throughout the world the unmistakable imprint of the american c.i.a. can be found in many a muddled mess they have left behind. in the beginning, their objectives were simple: spy, remove enemy agents, steal classified information and destabilize unfavorable governments. years have elapse and although their mission remains similar, their clandestine black operations now include domestic spying, discrediting u.s. citizens and infiltrating american organizations who criticize the u.s. government. this movie however, centers on the c.i.a.'s world manhunt for the infamous 'carlos, the jackel.' the film is called " the assignment " and tells the story lt. cmdr. annibal ramirez, (aidan quinn) a u.s. naval officer who bears a striking resemblance to the mastermind of so many terrorist bombings. recruited by jack shaw (donald sutherland) of the c.i.a. and amos (ben kingsley), a special agent from the israeli mosad, ramirez is secretly trained to look, pose, infiltrate the elusive organization and to thereafter discredit the real jackel working for the russians. this film is explosively exciting, and packed with wild chases, killings and inter-country mayhem. quinn is wonderful and surprisingly artistic playing both sides of the war. easily one of his best efforts. ****

2002's the bourne identity is one of my all-time favorite movies. however, many fans of the book have complained that the movie had very little to do with the book's plot.the assignment is the real deal. it's odd that no-one on the "bourne identity" threads has mentioned this movie at all. (well, i jst did.)besides the excellent plot, i personally found this movie to be as good as any espionage movie i've ever seen, with the possible exception of the bourneidentity itself.the action is all completely realistic. i especially liked the protagonists' training regimen, which was very inventive.the feel is dark and gritty. there are a few surprising plot twists. the acting is excellent. if you like this genre, i cannot recommend this movie highly enough.

if you liked the richard chamberlain version of the bourne identity then you will like this too...aiden quinn does this one brilliantly, you can't help but wonder if he is really out there...i reckon he and the other main cast members probably had nightmares for weeks after doing this movie as it's so intense. when i first saw it i was just flicking channels on the remote late one evening..& i got hooked within minutes. look up www.answers.com for ilich ramírez sánchez who is the character that "carlos the jackal" is based on for both... i remember reading about ilich ramírez sánchez's arrest in the paper in 1997. it was front page for weeks, through the trial after his arrest.

i loved this film. it was so intelligent but it also had some great action sequences, without basing the movie solely around them. quinn, sutherland and kingsley all put in fantastic performances and there are enough twists to keep anyone interested. the ending was great as well.

this is probably one of the best thrillers i have ever seen. it has action, but not this bullet-flying, good guys - bad guys, van damme - stallone action, but quick, realistic and nervous action, it has a plot, cause till the very end of the movie you don't know how this is gonna end, it has characters, aidan quinn, donald sutherland and ben kingsley are just perfect, and it has suspense, this movie just won't let you go away before you've seen the end of it.though there are only a few characters, i didn't find it difficult to keep my attention the the story, and as for the story, it's basic (not too tom clancy-difficult, but simple and raw) and realistic.if you're in for a movie with a good story, some action and great acting, watch this and i promise, you won't go away till you've seen the end of it. the very end of it.

i will not comment on the story as such. i agree with most peoples comments that this is a good all round action movie with a well told story and good acting.this film deserves 100% for cinematography for its opening sequence. the opening shot is stunning and i have not yet figured out how they did it. the movie is worth watching for that shot alone! a pity therefore that the dvd that is currently out is just the movie and no information is given as to the making of the film. let's hope somebody comes up with the special edition.and the even better thing is that the opening sequence also becomes the ending leaving you totally guessing! great stuff. a must have for a collector of classic film moments.

i found this movie to be quite enjoyable and fairly entertaining. good characters,good actors and enough suspense to keep your interest throughout. the plot twists might have been a bit much but overall a decent thriller. if you liked this film i would recommend the spanish prisoner, the house of games and no way out.

this is one of the best thrillers i've seen. it's intelligently made and brilliantly filmed, and is one of the few thrillers that creates complex, interesting characters and makes the movie about them, not the action. i would recommend it to just about anyone, especially people who like movies with both style and substance.

christian duguay directed this tidy little espionage thriller early in his career. it plays on tv pretty regularly, albeit with some terrific scenes of violence and sex unfortunately trimmed. i finally got around to seeing the theatrical version on a $3 tape from the local video store. naval officer aidan quinn is recruited to impersonate the notorious carlos the jackal, and gets a little too caught up in the role. donald sutherland ben kingsley play quinn's superiors, with sutherland a true zealot and kingsley as the more level-headed one. the first half of this fun flick shows quinn being trained and indoctrinated. the second half has him out in the field, making love to the jackal's woman and shooting it out with sundry enemies. the idea is to make the jackal look like a turncoat to the russians, and let them take care of the world's most notorious assassin. things don't exactly play out as planned. at times, i almost expected the cast to break out laughing at some of the corny dialogue, but they all play it very straight. in the end, this is one terrific little thriller that deserves your attention. the jackal's former mistress teaching the highly proper and very married quinn to rough her up, lick blood from her face, and then go down on her, alone is worth the price of admission.

just after having moved into his new cottage in the english country, hercule poirot gets an invitation to dinner from sir henry and lady angkatell, the owners of a large mansion nearby. but the next day, one of the guests is found shot near the pool, and his clumsy wife is holding a revolver a few steps away....this agatha christie mystery is somewhat thin, though the killer's plan is still very clever. it's the exquisite filming and cinematography that elevate the story to a higher level. this episode mostly keeps the serious tone of "five little pigs" and "sad cypress", but contains more dark humor than them. the cast includes possibly the two most famous actors to have worked in the series by this point, edward fox (as the butler) and sarah miles (as lady angkatell), though the standout performance is given by the dazzlingly beautiful megan dodds as the ahead-of-her-time henrietta: her one-on-one confrontations with suchet sparkle and are the highlights of the film. oh, and since an english police inspector does get involved in the case, i think they could have brought philip jackson back for this one. (***)

it worked! director christian duguay created a very clever action/spy thriller. the actors donald sutherland and especially aidan quinn gave a top performance. what a pity that we couldn´t see aidan quinn in others movies like this one till now. he was simply the best in the role as ramirez/carlos for what he should have earned the oscar. the picture was very nice. the scenes are fast paced from beginning to the end and the story doesn´t let you a chance to get bored. the movie is too underrated and i recommend it to anyone otherwise you will miss something great. believe me you will not be disappointed. that´s why i give it 9/10.

the stunts sequences (as well as the special effects) are brilliant, in this movie. michael scherer must be one of canadas best stunt co-ordinators of all time. the explosion in the café, is a wonderful combination of stunts, special effects and visual effects. the director had an idea, that the crew managed to create on film.besides that; donald sutherland makes one of his best performances in this film.......

this is certainly a quality movie with a classy cast. as far as movies about carlos the jackal go, this one beats bruce willis' feeble efforts in 'the jackal' to a bloody pulp, then spits on them. i am a bit surprised that this movie hasn't attracted more votes, something of a 'sleeper' obviously. a pity because this film is definitely worth a watch. it is clever and never dull. see it, 7/10

slick, tidy, and well-made old school version of how a great international thriller should be made. determined to nail a feared global terrorist who is known as "carlos the jackal", jack shaw (donald sutherland, "without limits", "space cowboys"), a cia operative and his israeli counterpart, amos (ben kingsley, "gandhi", "sexy beast") get a noble naval officer, annibal ramirez (aidan quinn, "music of the heart"), to become carlos and use him in a daring plot to get the kgb to kill the real carlos, because he took an offer from the cia. sutherland and kingsley are both good here, but the movie really belongs to quinn here, who embodies himself here (in a dual role). director christian duguay and cinematographer david franco provide another great asset of the film here with hitchcockian-like suspense and great sights of the world.

it's hard to imagine that "the battle of elderbush gulch", directed by the legendary d.w. griffith, was made a way back in 1914. it is a showcase for griffith's emerging style. the story centers around a group of settlers called the cameron brothers and their families which include a young waif (mae marsh) sent out from the east to live with her uncles and a young wife (lillian gish) who has just given birth. a group of indians tries to capture the waif's pet dogs and are driven off by the men folk. during the confrontation the indian chief's son (henry b. wathall) is killed. the indian chief plots his revenge and launches an attack on the small community of elderbush gulch. it is this attack, which is quite brutal and graphic for this or any other time, that forms the core of the picture. the indians slaughter the towns folk, women and children alike and drive them out of town towards the cameron's homestead. the newborn baby becomes separated from its mother and all hell breaks loose. someone goes for help and returns in the nick of time with the calvary. the battle scenes contain some graphic violence. for example, we see a woman being scalped alive and there is also a sequence where we see a horse being shot down. i have never seen an animal being slain so convincingly on screen. mr.griffith was becoming a master of staging large scale battle scenes, a talent that he would use extensively in his epic civil war drama, "the birth of a nation" released the following year. even though it runs a scant 29 minutes, "the battle of elderbush gulch" is nonetheless an exciting and historic bit of film making. see if you can spot lionel barrymore and harry carey in bit parts.

this is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of 'the hollow'. it could be argued that the actual mystery here is not one christie's best but what makes 'the hollow' special is the characterisation and i found the actors here, more or less without exception, were perfect in their parts. in such a uniformly good cast it's difficult to select stand out performances but i have to say that sarah miles is just perfect as lucy angkatell. what is extraordinary is that she not only conveys lucy's dottiness, tactlessness and her more lovable qualities but she also manages to pull off the underlying truth that in fact, lucy is not really all that nice! megan dodds is also very good as henrietta and claire price very affecting as gerda. john christow is really quite an unlikeable character but jonathan cake nevertheless manages to make us see what his women see in him.as i said, the script follows the story quite faithfully. the only disconcerting thing i found was that midge and edward's relationship really comes out of nowhere and i do believe that some of it must have ended up on the cutting room floor! theirs a secondary story however and the primary story is very well done. the whole thing looks beautiful as well, really capturing a perfect english autumn.its a beautiful film in every respect and well worth seeing.

while i score the movie a 7, i also should point out that it is both interesting historically (as it stars mae marsh, lillian gish and lionel barrymore when they were all younger and less well-known) and features pretty exciting action for its day.the plot is odd for a western, in that all the trouble with the indians begins for the weirdest reason i have ever seen! the indians decide to have a giant dog banquet (no, they are not feeding dogs, but feeding on dogs) and when two indians arrive late, there are not pooches left! so, they steal two dogs belonging to two orphans from the nearby white settlement and this actually touches off an all-out war!!!! not only is this silly, but seems to play on the prejudices of audiences. i don't know if american indians actually ate dog, but it sounds like the sort of stereotype that later was applied to other ethnic groups. all this over dogs! the movie has some excellent battle scenes and exciting moments--such as when ms. marsh crawls across the battlefield to save a baby! exciting stuff! but, strange, too!

the movie is a starter to what really happened in phenix city. i'm a grandchild of the people who really lived the story. the truth never has come out to my knowledge. i have tried to find the whole story out but the people who lived it are still scared to tell it. phenix city is still run by crooked people. albert patterson was not quite the saint the story wants you to believe. the story was filmed in phenix city. it still has some of the famous sites in it that you see in the movie. the colonal funeral home still looks exactly the same. but if you are wanting the real history of sin city you have to visit us and find people willing to tell you about ma beachies and her kindness. she didn't get the name ma for nothing.

i'm from phoenix city and the first time i saw this movie and read the book it only confirmed the stories i had heard all of my life. i asked my grandfather about the mob and he told me that when he got back from fighting in the pacific theatre he started up a cpa firm that is know the largest in the columbus area. when he was just starting out he was asked by the mob to do financial work for them, but he said that he gently declined. even when the fbi and army came through phoenix city and cleaned it up my grandfather wouldn't take it lightly when my mom, aunt, or uncle went across the river, but i assure you all of that is over now. the downtown area of phoenix city is in need of restoration and it has slums by the courthouse where all of the shooting still occasionally takes place over angry, uneducated, low socio-economic people, and the 14th street phoenix-eagle bridge has been shut down for a solid 15 years and replaced by a newer 13th street bridge, but on the more fair side of phoenix city on summerville rd. it is very quaint and the scenery depressing.another incident was told to me by my best friend's family from high school that lives in a nothing spot on hwy 165 called holy trinity, alabama, which is about 28 minutes outside of columbus, ga. my best friend in high school's uncle was a man that went by the name of old man davis. regardless of how the movie goes, that fact is that there were 3 bosses and old man davis was one of them...you can even read about him in the original book. legend has it that he was so cold-blooded that he went to downtown phoenix city to make a deal with a man, but apparently the man backed out on the deal right in front of old man davis, so the old man davis proceeded to take a sawed off shotgun out of his coat and shoot the man in the chest in the middle of town by the courthouse. they say he even walked off nonchalantly because the mob had paid off every law enforcement official in town so he had nothing to worry about.another incident is about a bridge that another one of my friends owns a rental house next to in downtown phoenix city. it is the same bridge that the mob killed and threw a black man off of, and you can even read that part in the book. i also would like to as that in many columbus and phoenix city civilians were asked to be extras in the movie. when the patterson's friend is murdered and brought to trial and proved guilty in front of the judge but still set free, well, the judge is my fathers partner in his law firm in columbus, who unfortunatlly is deceased.

born in 1946 i was about eight years old when first viewing this movie and it left a deep impression.not only scary ,for lack of a better word this movie haunted me for more than 50 years.the mob goon played by john larch was terrifying.the only scene that stuck out in my mind during those 50 years was the killing of the little girl and the uncaring policeman referring to her as a "little n----- kid".those words were replaced when the movie was shown recently on tv,maybe there are two versions of the movie or someone felt compelled to alter a little bit this heart breaking scene.accurate or not the film went a long way in formulating my opinion of the south and still till today the closest i've come to visiting a southern city is el paso.that stand may seem extreme but there is a little bit more to the story.when the movie was shown recently it became clearer why it haunted me for years.with the newsreel like beginning this movie gives the impression that what is being shown is fact.the film is made supposedly only one or two years after the depicted incidents adding to its realistic credibility.the terror in the movie isn't provided by creatures or space aliens but by persons living in our society at the time.re killing of little girl:the recent viewing helped make clearer the impact it had on my 8 year old mind.when this movie came out the only school i had ever gone to was attended by mostly african-americans.the victim looked like a girl in my class,it was like seeing an actual killing.it made a horrible scene that much worse.maybe no one will find this review helpful but it helped me.

**spoilers** shocking yet true story of the horror that befell the alabama/georgia border town of phenix when it was taken over by a gang of organized hoodlums who turn it into the sin city of the south.with crime skyrocketing and no one to turn to a group of concerned citizens get well respected phenix lawyer albert patterson, john mcintire, to run for the office of state district attorney. with the criminal element of phenix doing everything, from intimidation to outright murder, to keep the voters form getting patterson the nomination he still wins with the other 86 counties of the state, not including phenix's russell county, giving him the nod by just over 1,000 votes.terrified in what patterson would do when he takes office head of the phenix mob rett tanner, edward andrews, has a hit put out on him. patterson is gunned down while driving to his office but his killers are spotted by ellie rhodes, kathryn grant, who soon becomes, through an informer in patterson's office, tanner's next person in line to be targeted for murder. what tanner & co. didn't expect is that the late albert patterson's son john, richard kiley, got the news from ellie about his dad's murder before his boys could shut her up! that major miscalculation on tanner's part will end up putting an end to both his criminal organization as well as his freedom!powerful documentary-style crime movie with the actual persons involved in the events given some 15 minutes, at the start of the film, to tell their stories. this despite the fact that they were still in danger of being murdered by the tanner mob that was still at large at the time their interviews were filmed!finishing what his brave dad started john patterson single handedly brought the story of phenix city to the front pages of both the state and national newspapers giving tanner the very negative publicity that he tried so hard to avoid. with the now alabama national guard flooding into phenix city the blood-thirsty and gutless, in not willing to stand up to people with guns in their hands, tanner mob evaporated from sight like a morning mist after the sunlight hits it! and with john patterson now taking the place of his murdered dad as the state of alabama's new attorney general you can be sure that the patterson mob has seen its last days of pushing people around as well as murdering them. the only thing that they'll see now in the future is the gray prison walls and bars that will be their home sweet home for the rest of their rotten and miserable lives!very probably the most graphically violent movie to come out of hollywood up to that time "the phenix city story" didn't pull any punches in showing how a group of lawless and powerful criminals can turn a quite american city into living hell for everyone in it. no one was speared from these ruthless gangsters who didn't even think twice when it came to murdering even women and children if that's what it took to keep them in power! as for the phenix city police departmentn they had better thing to do then enforced the law that they were sworn and paid to uphold. they were out having coffee and donut's while their city was being burned to the ground by the gangsters like tanner who had them in their hip pocket!

this movie deserves a 20/10 if i could give one. "the hollow" is a great hercule poirot novel and the twist at the end fools most people. i am overjoyed that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel. there was no major difference that i could spot. the only difference was that poirot was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel. the acting was superb, and the music, as usual, was amazing quality! david suchet is perfect in his role, and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either. in no other movie that i've seen so far has poirot been portrayed so brilliantly! hats off to the producers-- they have made a movie that i along with many others will cherish for a long time to come!

excellent work all around especially by the actress who played the wife gerda (claire price) as well, of course, as david suchet. i did really figure out whodunit but that is beside the point. the ending, which i won't divulge (someone describes it on the board in answer to someone else's question if you are interested.) i found really sad. despite agatha christie's reputation for writing cardboard characters, i thought these really well-rounded by and large.the pacing of the story was good and i enjoyed seeing sarah miles as lucy and edward hardwicke (cedric's son i believe in addition to being a well-known dr. watson.)) as her husband.

la antena (esteban sapir - argentina 2005).a completely unique take on silent cinema in this fairy-tale like story by esteban sapir, beautifully shot in black-and-white and practically without dialog, "la antena" is a feast for the eye and a must for lovers of german expressionist cinema, with most of the nods to the works of fritz lang and friedrich murnau.'the city without a voice', 'la ciudad sin voz', is ruled by mr. tv. he has taken the inhabitants voices and is in total control of all spoken words and images, forcing everyone to eat his own brand of tv-food. mr tv is not just a monopolist, he is the personification of evil and totalitarianism, even the swastika appears as a symbol a number of times. he secretly works on a hypnotizing device to control all the citizens minds through his television broadcasts. for this purpose, he kidnaps the only one left with the voice, a beautiful singer, but a tv repairman witnesses the kidnapping and flees to an old tv antenna in the mountains in order to halt mr. tv's evil plans.the production design is stunning with beautiful sets and imagery. although shot primarily with the basic language of silent cinema, esteban sapir also adds a number of fresh techniques of his own, like a combination of typographic and animation techniques. everyone talks with each other through text balloons (usually floating near their mouths), the louder they talk, the larger the characters. the texts themselves can be pushed away or crushed. in the opening sequence, we see a book, titled "la antena", that opens and a city of paper rises from the pages. there are hardly any references to argentina. it's constantly snowing, which gives the film a very un-argeninian feel, while the surreal setting suggests any large city in the northen hemisphere, with only some of the songs revealing the film's argentinian background.the pace is swift and there is so much happening on screen, it's hard to keep track of the film's surreal narrative. not only breathtakingly beautiful to look at, we're also given a few messages about media monopolies, corruption and totalitarianism, but they are breezily packaged. one of the most original films i've seen in years. a delight.the film was shown as the opening film at the iff rotterdam 2007.camera obscura --- 9/10

all y'all hatin' on the fact you'd probably neva make the cut for "second string" need to save it. if more guys out there took their sorry behinds to the gym for once...maybe y'all have a chance....well,...maybe. take shawn woods' "hook" physique for a "perfect" example...and i stress the word "perfect" put that in your pipe and smoke it...!!! you couldn't look better sha-shawn

so forgive the *really* lame game-play scene, cardboard background and studio like stadium. for this part i should have give the movie 5 instead of 7, but read on...from the premise to plot there is a lot similarities with "the replacements". some say this movie rip off "the replacements", while some say this script wrote before it. both movies require some sort of "suspension of disbelief on the basic premise, and this is especially difficult for "second string" since it has nfl license team and all the history behind it. food poison excuse may sound too lame for some people, and not to mention in "second string" bills has to overcome big scores again and again, with the limit budget in shooting the game play scene, this make it look even bad. in "replacements", the premise and the league is fictional yet you know it happen in real life. i believe it is easier to accept fictional story and setting with real event ("oh yeah, this happen before!", rather than real setting/background with fictional scenario ("there is no way bill can win a superbowl!"; some of the scene were actually shoot in pre season game of raven games, real stadium, real audience and some nfl match alike shooting angle.but let say both movies came out on the same day, and we erase the budget factor (thus forgive the game play action scene): overall, i like "second string" over "replacements", not by much, but i like this more. it has "relatively better" character development. in "replacements", keanu character is too "out sync with the world", and all he care is maybe, get a girl? in second string you see the struggle of the qb from getting the job back, and deal with his past with coach. or the fumble guy problem. this "hold the ball all day long" solution of course is not new, but we see progression in fixing it.how about those trick play? i think it is "relatively realistic" than "replacements". the "dan marino" like fake knee pass, flea-flicker, wild cat full back rush, all real, except sometimes this look a bit too easy. but for me it is better than "replacement"'s center catch and rushing for 50 yards call, or how a 60 yards field goal look too easy. oh btw, i am glad they didn't force the te kicker made his shot....of course ---if you objectively review this movie over other football movies all there, this could easily be a 5 out of 10 movie. but some say this is the worse football movie? try "the comebacks".

being a bills fan, i originally found it annoying that they made a movie about the bills and the losing of four superbowls. but once i began to watch, i felt really connected. it was actually nice to see the "bills" win the superbowl, and i must say, that for a tv movie it was actually very well done. gil bellows as the qb, and jon voight as the old-school coach did a very fine job. 8 out of 10

in the year 2000 (keep in mind, this is two years ago, not four), two men had the motivation to create the most miraculous piece of art on this side of the mississippi.thanks to jere cunningham and tom flynn, the world can now enjoy second string, a delicious tv movie depicting a tale of a rag-tag gang of second stringers (thus the title) who are thrust into the position of starters due to an order of bad oysters.because of the motivational direction of both the director robert lieberman and the buffalo bills' last minute qb, dan "give 'em hell" heller (portrayed by canadian actor, gil bellows) the oft super bowl snake-bitten bills find themselves in the ultimate position.with an intriguing mix of internal and external conflict, a love story, comraderie that only the fine sport of football can bring, and an overall theory that the underdog can compete, second string is an excellent movie worthy of viewing every possible moment that it appears on tnt.the only thing potentially bad about this production is the spelling of the costume designer's first name, jenifur jarvis.

david suchet,(poirot),"foolproof",'03, gave an outstanding performance as a perfectionist in almost everything he did or said. if he had a cocktail, he always had a napkin to blot the excess on his mouth with unbelievable perfection! you could just view the expressions on the detective's face and see that he never missed an item of importance in the suspects behavior. the beautiful falls colors through out the english countryside was simply breath taking. megan dodds, "bait",2000, gave an outstanding performance as a very sexy, wild woman who was able to keep very important secrets away from mr. poirot. a very enjoyable film if you really like the acting of david suchet as mr. poirot!

for a made for tv movie i thought that it was a great popcorn movie - don't expect anything to be very accurate and don't expect any award winners in this bunch but i do recommend this for a tv type version somewhat like "the replacements". look for cameos from real nfl players & officials.

in a better civilization, this and many other of the david suchet movies would be released in theaters. the plots are fabulous (no, i'd no clue who had done it, but the clues were all there if i'd been more imaginative - the best kind of mystery), the production values astounding, the acting (from edward fox, sarah miles, lysette anthony, megan dodds, and of course david suchet as hercule poirot) simply perfect, the dialogue wonderful, the music and sens of suspense and tension just wonderful stuff.one of the pleasures of these hercule poirot movies for a man is how many beautiful women star in them! here were have two - the sexy sinuous megan doods and the stunning lysette anthony.you really can't go wrong renting these - they're just wonderful - like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine - your mind constantly working because it's all there and you struggle but by keeping your mind constantly thinking can keep up with everything - and the settings gorgeous.i can't think of movies that stimulate thought more than these hercule poirot/david suchet movies. it's impossible to over-praise them - and i had never seen one before a few months ago nor read an agatha christie.

the hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from agatha christie and of course poirot. it' s set on a country house on a weekend. as always all the guests are suspects and it's up to poirot to figure out the truth. with movies like this it's always best not to give too much away so i'll stop here. what i loved in the `hollow' was that it's a mystery the old fashioned way. when poirot arrives everybody is around the body for example. everybody seems to be the culprit. there's that suspicious look and the atmosphere is just perfect for the story.you can expect a wonderful time giving guesses as to whom did it and how and why and maybe in the end even be surprised. a cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you got a pretty enjoyable experience.the actors are all very good. as a curiosity notice edward hardwicke who played dr. watson in sherlock holmes. nice to see him after a few years. suchet is amazing as always and fortunately is on screen most of the time.i did find out who the murderer was but still it's not predictable and it's also very believable.so in conclusion a great movie and as always a pleasure.

i first saw this movie back in the early 90's,and instantly fell in love with it.richard benjamin and his wife paula made the 1981 movie "saturday the 14th"in 1981 prior to making this movie in 1983.i think they work quite well together.this movie made me laugh on several occasions.it also has a young molly ringwald,who would later go on in the late 1980's to do movies such as pretty in pink and sixteen candles.it is fun watching her a little younger.although not seen by many people..i don't even think the average movie fan has ever heard of this movie.but when i first came acrossed it i was glad i did.i gave this movie 10 out of 10 stars as i think it is a fun movie the whole family can enjoy.lastly i would like to say its not available on dvd,so i picked up a vhs copy on ebay,so if your interested,you probably can find one on there.it might be in the $20-$30 dollar range but i got mind for $12 bucks.i wish they would eventually release this on dvd.

...and i'm so disappointed because i can't seem to buy the dvd or vhs of it anywhere.its a kind of mix of, uncle buck and the great outdoors and molly ringwald is fabulous as the spoilt teenager. this was made when molly was still a brunette, just before she hit the big time with pretty in pink.i'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy, with an edge! if anyone has a copy of this, or knows where i can get one...please leave a message for me - it'll be much appreciated.

this has to be one of the funniest movies i've ever seen. the idea of a typical family leaving everything behind to live in the wilderness. when mom and dad both lose there jobs, not to mention they have green slime in their bathtub. they decide it's in their families best interest to move to oregon. once there everything goes wrong. an interesting cast of characters compliment this movie. including a young molly ringwald,this a movie i would definetly recommend.

the story is about a working girl (ann sothern) who has a pretty thoughtless boyfriend (paul kelly). this boyfriend is so busy trying to start his own business that again and again he forgets dates or shows up late. the final straw is when sothern has a birthday and kelly says he's too busy to take her out to celebrate. so, not wanting to just stay home, she goes on a blind date with what turns out to be a very rich young man (neil hamilton). sparks fly but it also becomes apparent after sothern breaks off her relationship with kelly that new boyfriend hamilton is a "love 'em and leave 'em" sort of guy. how all this is finally resolved is not too difficult to predict--just suffice to say that in the end everything works out just perfectly.this is a very modest little film from columbia pictures--with a relatively small budget as well as second-tier stars. it's clearly a "b-movie" despite there being small roles played by a mickey rooney and jane darwell--as both had yet to become famous. now this is not to say that these are bad actors or the production isn't any good. in fact, given the production values, this is a pretty amazing film as everything seems to work so well despite having a pretty ordinary and somewhat predictable plot outline. that's because the actors and director did a really good job putting the story across. plus the writers did a good job of humanizing the characters and making you care about them. the ending, in particular, is really sweet and practically had my tear ducts flowing! because of these factors, the film earns a 7 of 10.

"blind date" is one of three stories-made-into-movie by author vida hurst. lots of familiar faces in this oldie from 1934. mickey rooney as a mouthy little punk. he seems to be in the film for comedic and homey "family values". jane darwell again plays the strong-willed mother, just as she had in grapes of wrath and the oxbow incident. ann sothern is kitty, who has been dating bill (paul kelly), but meets up with rich bob hartwell, played by neil hamilton, who may or may not be better for her. you can certainly tell that this was made at the very beginning of the hays production code -- at one point, kitty says she can't be up there alone with him if there isn't anyone else in the house...what a change from just a year or two prior, when anything and everything was ok. good solid plot, but a whole lot of conversation and mushy love talk. it raises the question over what a girl should be searching for in a man; should she hold out for a man with integrity who treats her nice, or just find a man with big bucks, as most of the movies from the previous 20 years had advocated...? and how do men change when their situation changes ? watch out for some violence in the strange dance marathon scene. tv viewers from the 1960s will recognize hamilton as commissioner gordon from batman..... also some weird drama in the off-screen lives for some of the cast in this one --paul kelly had gone to jail for being accessory to murder in a love triangle. mickey rooney had an affair with norma shearer, who was 20 years older; rooney ended up being married eight times. tyler brooke (emory) and spencer charters (pa) both knocked themselves off in real life. the title "blind date" has been reused many times, for films, tv series, and even cartoons, but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one.

working girl kitty (sothern) is engaged to bill (kelly), who neglects her by working long hours at his garage in order to save money for their marriage. after being stood up on her birthday, kitty goes on a double-date/blind date, where she meets department store heir bob hartwell (hamilton). she falls in love, but leaves him when his protestations of love appear to cover a desire for her to be his mistress, rather than his wife. faithful bill rallies 'round to comfort her, and at last she gives in to his repeated requests to reinstate their engagement, pressured in part by bill's support of her family after she loses her job. when bob returns, however, convinced that he wants marriage after all, will kitty follow her heart or her conscience? this film was a lot better than i'd expected it to be. the character of bill at first comes off as the sort of loud comic irishman type that jack carson played so often. but kelly (and the script) infuse the character with real compassion and love, and bill turns out to be the best person in the entire group. viewers may find themselves rooting for him against the feckless hartwell! the tone of the film wavers, however, between light-hearted romance and a much darker side, especially in the depiction of a dance marathon and a rather horrific accident at bill's garage.the cast is rounded out by the dependable jane darwell as kitty's mother, an impish but not yet thoroughly obnoxious mickey rooney as kitty's younger brother, and spencer charters as kitty's ne'er-do-well father.

i saw this movie for the first time when quentin tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the alamo drafthouse in austin. he prefaced it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation, it was hilarious. i can see how it would be damaging to some audiences, and the subject is not funny at all, but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard i thought i'd pee. they don't come until after the halfway point, but when they do, oh god...you will die. oh and jim brown is brilliant. he's not in a lot of the movie, but when he's there, you know whose movie it is. naturally, the best line in the movie (and the funniest) is his; you'll know it when you hear it.

this film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70's exploitation film, except it was done in the late 80's for the direct to video market.you have a young couple in love, but the whole world around them is involved either in crack dealing or gang violence. when the boyfriend goes to jail, the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals, who are everyone in this movie except for the cops. first she gets hooked on crack by a dealer and then because he owes drug lord jim brown money, she becomes brown's property. then she's basically enslaved in a military style crack house that the movie is named for.as if this isn't enough reason to see this movie, you also have anthony geary playing a seemingly conservative school guidance counselor, but he's really a major crack dealer. in a sleazy yet hilarious scene, he demands sexual favors from the heroine because she has no money for a fix. in an earlier scene it was established that he is her counselor. that scene and another where jim brown forces her to take a scalding hot shower because she stinks are hysterical. lead actress cheryl kay was really good in this film. tarantino, bring her back.it's not surprising to me that someone mentioned in another review that tarantino is a major fan of this. it has just the right blend of comedy, action, sex, romance, and yes a central message to stay away from drugs. jim brown's villainous turn here deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another great 80's b villain, wings hauser in vice squad. sometimes i think there should be a b movie oscars where performances like this could be acknowledged. in the meantime let's hope that the modern straight to dvd filmmakers learn learn to use this same type of tongue in cheek humor.

crack house (1989) was one of the few film during the 80's that falls into this genre. what's supposed to be an anti-drug film turns out to be nothing more than some white-exploitation exercise in depravity. there's nothing wrong with that however. the video presentation even has an anti-drug message from one of the stars of the show richard "turncoat" roundtree,the movie follows two young lovers in high school. one of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is his girl. one of them get's turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at his ex-friends. jim brown appears as the movie's "mister big", he's one bad dude who still can punk-out anybody and is a very sadistic guy who likes to smack his hoes and beat the tar out of those who try to defy his word. luke from general hospital makes a guest star spot as well.if you like hard edge sleaze then this movie's for you. sadly, hollywood doesn't make these any more and when they do, it's neither exploitative nor entertaining.recommended for sleaze fans.

the emperor and the assassin (w/english subtitles) at 161 minutes is long, but the time is packed with a story that barely fits into it. golden hued palace scenes and dusty yellow panoramas of chinese landscapes background a true story of china's unifying king, circa 300 bce. an intricate plot with a myriad twists and turns is played out with excellent portrayals by the cast. king qin's simple wish for a unified empire for his common people is fulfilled, but not without treachery, plots and counter plots and oh yes, bodies. lots of bodies. this epic story of china's beginnings is a great way for westerners to glimpse little known asian history. emperor qin's legacies include the thousands of life-size terra-cotta figures which are still being excavated today. as an historical person, this film makes it clear that emperor qin should be regarded along with george washington, napoleon bonaparte, alexander the great, genghis khan and julius caesar, to name a few of the world's greatest conquerors/statesmen. i highly recommend seeing the emperor and the assassin, especially on the big screen.

for a feature film, the plot closely follows history--or at least historical gossip. but then the chinese, who know the story very well from seeing it portrayed again and again, would never tolerate it otherwise. the attention to detail is wonderful, especially for anyone who has read sima qian's account in the records of the historian. jing ke, according to sima qian, did indeed make an attempt on qin shi huang's life at the request of the crown prince of yan before unification. sima qian explicitly mentions both the head of general fan and the dagger rolled up into the map, as well as the dagger being thrown into the brass column. although jing ke is described as no stranger to swordplay, he's hardly the invincible warrior portrayed by chen kaige. jing ke is indeed this film's weakest link. in reality (again, according to sima qian), he was a heavy drinker and put off his visit to qin for as long as possible, spending a good deal of time with the ladies of yan before the crown prince finally ordered him on his way. he was, in short, a human being and was not looking forward to death although he was willing to accept it. chen kaige's jing ke is afraid of death, but not his own. he is the classic ruthless killer turned disillusioned pacifist. his love (or maybe just affection) for a woman and pity for several hundred children whom zheng had buried alive (not even two thousand years of hostile confucian historians claimed qin shi huang did this, although there is a legend about him burying 460 confucians up to their necks and then beheading them)is enough to make this former assassin kill again. the melodrama is not convincing and the character ends up being just plain boring. the acting here isn't shabby, though not very interesting given the character. as for lady zhou, in all the numerous stories i've heard about qin shi huang, she's never come up. anyway, gong li is famous enough for americans to have heard of her (thanks to zhang yimou) and there needed to be a love interest, so here she is. it's unfortunate that her performance is almost as wooden as jing ke's character. she's done much better (in qiu ju for example) at being subtle; here she just barely manages presence. but all of this is trivial compared to the extraordinary acting of li xuejian as zheng himself. qin shi huang is for the chinese rather what milton's satan is for us: accepted as a villain, but a noble one. qin shi huang's accomplishments radiate an awe all the way across two thousand years into the present and li captures his frightening will without compromising his humanity. li's performance is enough, but the scope of the film is grand although the photography is purposely drab. it does feel ancient. the score is adequate, scarcely moving though very appropriate to the action. though i've only seen it once, i believe that chen kaige should be given more credit for his camera work than other reviewers have allowed him. the opening credits are exhilarating. if five stars its absolutely average, i given three more for li xuejian's acting and chen kaige as an actor, writer, and director.

this is an excellent film. no, it's not mel gibson in "braveheart," but then, it's not trying to be. actually, "the emperor and the assassin" probably has (thankfully) more in common with a shakespearean production than a hollywood blockbuster.in the third century bc, the king of qin is attempting to unite (in other words "conquer") the seven kingdoms of china. he has already overthrown the kingdom of han. now he needs an excuse to invade the kingdom of yan.this is where the lady zhao comes in. she and the king have been friends since childhood. they are obviously very much in love, but cannot marry for political reasons. together they devise a plot. she will pretend to have fallen into disfavor with the king and escape to yan. once there she will convince the prince of yan to send an assassin back to kill the king. when the assassination fails, the king will have his excuse to invade yan.once in yan, however, lady zhao begins to reconsider. hearing and seeing more and more examples of her old childhood friend's ruthlessness, she begins to wonder if the king may need to be assassinated for real.one sure sign that you're not watching a hollywood production is the final encounter between the king and the assassin. unlike a hollywood movie where the hero and villain are clearly defined and the final outcome already predetermined, this is a fight that could truly go either way.this is a well crafted and well acted story of a tumultuous time in chinese history. there is a mixture of both incredible beauty and incredible ugliness. most beautiful of all, however, is gong li as the lady zhao. i grow more and more convinced every time i see her that gong li is the most beautiful woman in the world.i must say, however, that she does have one unintentionally funny line in this film. early on gong li asks one of her servants "do i have a beautiful face?"duh!!!

after watching the movie a few times, i found so many subtle touches and emotions within the dialogue. jing ke, the assassin has become one of favorite movie characters of all time. this fine chinese actor says more with his eyes and his economy of words and movements then any big screen american actor today. qin, the emperor, is brilliant as he leads the audience to believe the kindness in his heart, only to unleash the most cruel acts upon the people around him. the promises he makes with incredible passion and shattered with an evil fist. gong li, as in just about every movie i've ever seen her in, is simply fantastic. her screen dominance is so graceful and emotionally charged.in case you couldn't tell, i loved this movie.

this three-hour chinese epic, set in 220 b.c., may ultimately amount to a familiar theme of an emperor's idealistic dream of peace through unification mutating into corrupted isolation, and there's nothing inherently challenging about the film, but it's a compelling narrative, crammed with intrigue and passion and betrayal and epic events told in vivid strokes. even for those not drawn to such historical spectacles for their own sake, it's an astonishing feast for the eyes: the scene depicting the coup attempt of the marquis is one of the most staggering evocations of physical space and grandeur in memory, and the battle scenes are memorable both in their scope and their immediacy. the title sums up the film's use of compelling contrasts - huge plainland vistas set against intimate horrors; the noblest of motives set against the most degraded; hope turning to dust. if you've never seen a three-hour chinese epic, this wouldn't be a bad place to start.

this is an epic film about the unification of the ancient kingdoms of china in the third century bc. what makes it interesting is the tragic downfall of the king and all the palace intrigue going on around him. it reminded me a bit of "king lear" and some of the other shakespeare plays.the king starts out with noble ambitions, to unify the kingdoms under one ruler and to stop all the quarrelling so that the people can prosper and lead better lives. he and his childhood sweetheart, played beautifully by li gong, concoct a scheme whereby she pretends to go into exile in a rival kingdom in order to recruit an assassin to kill the king, thus giving him a pretext to go to war. but while she's away, the king becomes sadistic in his lust for power and goes on a killing spree.there are numerous side plots that keep the action going. there is the marquis, who pretends to be stupid and foppish but who's really very clever and wants to become king himself. he fathers two children with the king's mother and manages to keep it secret for years. then there is the prime minister, a political rival to the king, who turns out to really be his father. the assassin is a complex character himself. an adept swordsman and killer, he is undergoing a reformation when the king's lover comes to recruit him. he wants nothing more with killing, but is eventually won over by li gong (who wouldn't be?) when he sees how cruel and vicious the king has become.some spectacular cinematography, especially the battle scenes that are carried out on a grand scale - like they used to say, a cast of thousands, literally. the acting is ok, nothing special. it's the story that's interesting, though at over two and a half hours, it pushes the limit.definitely worth viewing.

i will admit my ignorance of this film's existence, until i saw it advertised on a cable outlet. i was very impressed with the novelistic structure of the film. the film, which is in a language i do not understand, shone with intelligence and nuance for me. i think this speaks to the film's quality. it was visually stunning. the acting was visually entrancing. the chinese theater traditions of movement, used to enhance the delivery of dialogue, is so compelling after watching western film, where actors traditionally focus more heavily on the dialogue. the action in this film comes right at you, without a lot of explosions to get your attention. it is human action that is so affective here. the added advantage that the film taught me history about one of the world's greatest tourist attractions, the funereal clay army of china's first qin emporer, was very impressive. it seemed to give the film an international relevance beyond the film's great ethical themes. this is a film i can comfortably recommend to a wide variety of friends and acquaintances.

when i first got wind of this picture, it was just called "shepherd" and was supposed to be the film that would put jcvd back into chances of doing theatrical shtuff. i was very well excited about the whole piece.by the time it was titled "the shepherd: border patrol," i was tap-dancing in excitement for this flick. with isaac fluorentine at the helm of directing, and jj perry pulling stunt coordination, i almost peed me pants in anticipation. pics were released of jcvd kicking 8 different kinds of arse as well as scott adkins playing what i thought was the villain, and i was mind-blown in excitement. i thought it was going to be another epic martial arts situation like lone wolf mcquade.then it came out. i ordered it off blockbuster online for $20 and was ready for anything. the reviews from vandammefan.net kinda had my ideas alittle altered, but i braced myself. the mail came on day 4 and i ripped open the package. my initial plan was to rush upstairs, rip the face off the cardboard packaging, then smash the case in the proper dynamics so the disc would land in my dvd player. however, i stared at the case for 10 minutes then placed the disc in my player and watched the film.by the time it was over, i was cool as a fool in the pool. the shepherd is certainly one of my all-time favorite direct-to-video films ever and makes derailed look like even more of the toilet mess that it is. sure, some of the fights ran a twee bit short, but they were still very awesome. the shootouts were superb, as was scott adkins, who should have been the villain, unlike the forgettable steven lord.i highly recommend this flick. seriously.

i've read some grumbles about the court scenes. these people betray their ignorance. this production went to simply amazing lengths to recreate all aspects of the period in which the story occurred. courtly manners are something few people outside the court ever see. while the acting may appear highly stylized, it is, in fact, as close a replication as possible of the behavior of individuals in their particular stations as the director could create. the actor's facial expressions are a marvel, particularly the duplicitous marquis changxin and the king's mother.there are, of course, reflections of both greek and shakespearian tragedy in the relationship between the king, his parents and his love. the juxtaposition of the king transforming from good to bad and the assassin from bad to good provides much food for thought on the evolution of an individual's nature. this movie would provide much to ponder in a college course on the humanities.at the same time, it almost rushes along, even in the slowest scenes heading towards an inexorable denouement. one suspects the involvement of large portions of the troop movements, which were quite awesome. it makes the lord of the rings battle scenes pale by comparison. few directors have the ability to literally field thousands of humans on the field of battle just for art's sake. i recall one scene in which at least 30,000 troops can be seen moving across a huge plain. the logistics for such a shot would have been staggering.i could go on... but simply, i can't recommend this film highly enough.

angela (sandra bullock) is a computer expert but, being shy and somewhat of a recluse, she does all of her work from the confines of her condo. just as she is about to take a vacation in mexico, a co-worker sends her a computer disc with disturbing information on it. angela agrees to meet with her fellow employee but he mysteriously dies in a plane crash. angela heads to mexico but takes the disc with her. while she is sunning on the beach, a terrific looking gentleman named jack (jeremy northam) makes overtures to her. she falls for them and the two end up on a boat to cozumel. however, jack works for the folks who generated the secret information on the disc and he is out to get it. even after angela escapes from his clutches and lands back in the usa, jack makes things difficult. he changes angela's identity on every computer across the nation, making her lose her condo, her bank account, everything. can angela, a computer whiz, beat jack at his own game? this very exciting movie has many assets. first, bullock and northam are two very beautiful, interesting actors and their presence adds immediate captivation. the script is very clever and sure in its knowledge of the capabilities of computers and their relevance in today's world. the costumes, sets, production, and direction of the movie are also quite wonderful. and, despite how it sounds, there is a great deal of exciting action as angela goes on the run to defeat her enemy. if you love thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence, this is a great choice. it delivers twists and turns with great frequency, making it possible for the viewer to "net" a very good evening of entertainment.

it was a movie that made ya think a little. some parts a little cheesy, some parts pretty good. plot did thicken at times and just when you thought angella (sandra) found a friend the friend was fraud or dead. all i got to say is that dennis miller should have been in the whole movie. his character was the best, very refreshing after all the crap angella went through. he would have lifted me and angella through the dumps.

when "the net" was first being advertised, the ads made it look ridiculous. then, when i saw it, it was actually quite good. angela bennett (sandra bullock) spends her days working on the computer and has never gotten to know her neighbors. then, through a series of events, her identity gets erased by a cabal of shadowy people, and she can't prove that she exists.some parts of the movie are a little bit far-fetched; you'd probably know which parts if you saw the movie. still, it's a good look into what the existence of the internet may have wrought on unsuspecting people. i do recommend it.

you could get into the nitty gritty of this film, and say how it couldn't happen, or how could the main character just walk into offices and start using computers etc without someone noticing and really pick the movie to bits...or you could just sit back with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and the acting. personally, i prefer the latter, i live real life and watch the news with all it's doom and gloom, and so would much rather be entertained by my movies, and see the bad guys get their just rewards. don't take it too seriously, and you can thoroughly enjoy this film.

this movie is a warning to all people sat surfing the internet on a typical day at the office. my warning is ,do not reveal too much about yourself, 2 be careful who you cross!! ,there are spies on this internet thing. i thought that it was so scary what that man and woman combination did to poor angela bennett, i did not realise that somebody could take ones life away in one click of this mouse angela i thought did a sterling job of outwitting jack delvin and that awful girl my question is, why does that computer make that noise when it works? like a clicking sound mine does not do this or this one. this film also tells you that there is fraud on this internet also why couldn't angela do the virus destroyer programme at a cybercafe? i also thought that like all computers the transfer rate to disk was slow that is correctly portrayed in this film when you save the programme to your floppy disk the bar only moved slowly!!! i quite liked angela's house at the beginning of the film as well why did no one believe angela???

wow! in my opinion, the net is an excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller that will leave you feeling good all over. when i first saw it, i was feeling good all over for days. when angela (sandra bullock) went to mexico, i thought to myself, "that is a really nice place to vacation." from the moment jack (jermey northam) and ruth (wendy gazelle) began chasing her, i thought to myself, "don't let anything bad happen to her! please!" i also took quite a few deep breaths to prevent myself from screaming any more than i already had. on the bright side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. in conclusion, i give this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller four stars.

this is a solid underrated little thriller, that has thrills-a plenty, with a cool story, sandra bullock is terrific!. all the characters are great, and i was surprised by how unpredictable it was as there were only a few predictable moments, plus sandra bullock is simply amazing in this!. jeremy northam played an awesome villain, and i know what bullock's character in this is all about, because i'm kind of the same type of person(i hardly ever go out), plus this is pretty well made and written for the most part. this should be higher then 5.5 in my opinion, plus denis miller was surprisingly better then expected in his small role. the scene where northam terrorizes bullock on his boat was quite suspenseful, and was one of my favorite moments, and i also liked the chase scene in the carnival, plus i liked the ending too, as it was quite well done, even if i did think northam was defeated too quickly. there are lots of other good chase scenes as well, and it's also clever at times too, plus there are quite a few shocking moments as well, this is a solid underrated little thriller, that has thrills a-plenty, with a cool story, sandra bullock is terrific, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is great!. irwin winkler does a great! job here with excellent camera work, adding good atmosphere, good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace. the acting is fantastic!. sandra bullock is amazing as always and is amazing here, she is extremely likable, tough as nails yet quite vulnerable, and i was able to feel for her because as i said i'm sort of like angela,i hardly ever go out, i really enjoyed her work in this movie! (bullock rules!!!!!!!). jeremy northam is excellent as the villain, he was sneaky, unpredictable and very menacing, he was great. dennis miller is surprisingly ok and non annoying in his small role, and managed to bring some comic relief. rest of the cast are fine. overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5

following the advice of a friend, i got myself this movie. i'm very fond of computers in general - hence why a 1995 film about identity theft on the internet could not be left unseen. i had some bad echoes about it, but in the end, i wasn't so disappointed : the story, though classical, is kind of interesting and must have been really new back in the days when it was released in theatres. i was gladly surprised when i figured out that contrary to what we usually see, computer-performed actions are somehow realistic, as they use windows 3.x and normal computers. the storytelling is median and not bothering the viewer. the end is typically american. the actors' performance is globally ok, sandra bullock usually annoys me with her "oh my god why me" way to behave, but this time she seems to have controlled herself. i'd recommend that movie.

i loved this movie!movies and plays fulfill their purpose when they expose social, political, and other problems that affect the majority. this movie served that purpose.i identify with the plot and know people to whom this has happened. at the time this movie was made, concepts presented in this flick were advanced for the public, yet had already happened to friends of mine by way of people in powerful positions. and, i know what it is like when people do to you what they did to angela bennett, because they have done it to me.i greatly enjoyed sandra bullock's portrayal of angela bennett/ruth marx. she portrays a pretty, intelligent, and witty young woman who has the courage to avoid giving up to overwhelming odds, fight hard to keep her sanity and restore her life, and try to protect those whom she loves. losing her self-concept and succumbing to that age-old attempt to bolster a sagging self esteem by indulging in sex with a stranger added a poignant touch of reality.the climax of the plot reveals the only real solution to this kind problem.

van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books. from the setting of mexico to the five star fight scenes, this movie was amazing. the film is all about border patrol officers protecting there territory which is the border of mexico. ex navy seals are smuggling drugs out of mexico into the united states of america (usa), van damme and scott atkins give stunning performances as the cop and the villain. although this film wasn't as good as until death but it still gave the action,acting and the film a five star look. i always look forward to these b grade action films and they keep getting better. keep them coming van damme.watch this film if you enjoyed films like - until death, the hard corps and second in command.

why all the negative reviews??? you didn't expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece did you??? what we have is a movie that tried to entertain us and it worked for me. not an oscar contender, just entertainment. you can really see how the movie has aged, especially with everything the internet has to offer nowadays. i still remember when this was first released and the net was still so new. crazy and scary thoughts when i saw this for the first time; i was 15 and seriously thought anyone could get a hold of your information on a computer and destroy you. but, who's to say it can't happen??? i'm not the type of person to nitpick a movie to death, analyzing it until i'm blue in the face. that's not my style. average acting, suspensful and once again, very entertaining. sandra bullock as angela bennett is so cute. this is my favorite movie with her in it because she's like the computer genius, which i find very attractive. of all the movies that were released in 1995, this would have to be my favorite, although, i didn't see it until 1996. my rating, 9/10 because it did slow down a little.

all the comments so far about this movie are negative but i have to say i found "the net" engaging. few movies can keep me on the edge of my seat but this one did. another plus for it is that most action/suspense films are full of language but this one had little profanity. i found it an enjoyable movie to watch. i am slightly biased though, being a big sandra bullock fan. *wink*

when this movie firt came out in 1995, i found it amazingly great. especially with sandra bullock.after having watched her brilliant performance in speed , i was ready to enjoy any of her movies.back to the net, it was a movie that keeps you in suspence.all in all, i enjoyed it so i give it a **** out of *****.

at last!! sandra bullock is indeed a beautiful woman, but i've finally found a film that she gets to be an actress! forget the predictable keanu-fodder of speed, forget the predictable kleenex-fodder of while you were sleeping - this tests her!and she is great! a techno-feminist role that really works well on screen, on a subject that is very close to the bone. the issues raised don't seem far-fetched at all and the whole experience, helped along by a fine supporting cast, makes for quite an un-nerving couple of hours.you may never enter another chat-room again, in fact i'm getting quite nervous just writing this review...er...bye!

this is one of the many techno-phobic movies that sprouted like mushrooms in the mid-90s, after the internet went mainstream.hollywood movies have always had their way in "beautifying" the depicted ongoings, to make them look better and more appealing. the same happens when hollywood tries to show us some hi-tech. the outcome of such attempts varies from being very far-fetched and ridiculous (see hackers (1995), johnny mnemonic (1995), etc.) to being quite realistic (see sneakers (1992))."the net" lies somewhere between those extremes. by nitpicking, one can end up with quite a lot of technical inconsistencies, and a lot of cases where the ongoings seem to be much more "sexy" and graphical than the way things are in real life (as usually happens in movies).however, by simply overlooking those, the viewer ends up with a quite solid, entertaining movie. the characters and acting are convincing, and the movie does a good job in keeping you in your seat till the end of it. the plot is okay (a fairly standard one, really -- based on the good ol' paranoiac design, but with a hi-tech edge this time), and quite convincing (again, when disregarding technical issues). the development of the plot is a bit sluggish, though, and occasionally you can anticipate some supposedly surprising turns in the plot.the bonus here is cutie-pie sandra bullock, which besides being cute (something she does quite easily, apparently), also portrays a solid act. you can really feel her character -- her despair, her emotions.in the bottom line, the movie is entertaining and interesting, rates about 7 from 10 in my scale. it's worth renting from the video library, or even watching in the cinema. whether to buy it or not is up to you.

just a short comment! i want to say that i like this movie very much! sandra bullock is my favourite actress. i like the whole story, from the beginning until the end! i have it on tape and i can watch it a 100 times, it doesn't matter!!!

this movie was suspenseful and fun to view. as i am a fan of these type of movies, i did enjoy this. the premise is kind of scary but the fact that i didn't rate this a 10 was because the movie was a little over the top in some areas.spoilers:cmon:nobody could identify this girl? i understand the concept of isolating oneself but i find it hard to believe that somebody-anybody wouldn't have been able to id this girl as angela bennet. that was over the top and so was the scene where she walked over to somebody's desk and started typing. this was overall a really good movie, suspenseful and keeps your interest. dennis miller was great as allen, really believable, bullock was good as the lonely reserved computer worker the bad guys all underestimated.i think the premise of the movie was really different-and scary. in today's times who knows what could happen? but some of the over the top scenes prevented this movie from being a 10. 8 of 10.

the net is an excellent movie! it's about angela bennett(in a great performance of sandra bullock) who is a computer expert who works for the cathedral company, cleaning virus and testing games for the clients. angela is a typical nerd who doesn't have friends outside of the cyberspace,almost doesn't take vacations and go out, and stays almost all the time connected. one day her friend dale hessman(ray mckinnon) asks her to help him,sending angela a disk with a strange program that has many confidential informations. at the same night, when dale was going to meet her, he is suddenly killed in a plane crash.going to mexico in her vacation,angela meets a beautiful guy called jack devlin (jeremy northam)who shows to be a cold blood killer bastard and one of the guys behind all the secret of the diskette.her life then turns into a nightmare: all her records are erased and she is given the new identity of ruth marx, a woman with serious problems with the police.this movie is great because it shows how we, humans,depend a lot of the computers and machines(sometimes more that we should) and how vulnerable we are if someday ,someone decides to control and change our personal records,without letting us the chance to prove the error.

if you're actually reading this review, i give you a lot of credit. you care enough to actually look up this movie, which most people have forgotten about and then cared to read beyond the first review! so for your reading pleasure...i'm assuming you know the plot line already so i won't waste time typing that out. i will mention that sandra bullock did an amazing job with this movie. she really brought a lot of sympathy to the role of a computer programmer, often difficult to do. i can say this because i happen to be a computer programmer.anyway, i thought the basic plot was a very good one. you can easily build sub-plots upon its mainframe and turn it into a very enjoyable movie. the premise is also scarily realistic in that this can all really happen if the right precauctions aren't taken.to make a long review short...oops! too late! if you enjoy sandra bullock bringing a role to life and want to see a very well made movie for the time, take a look at this little gem. you won't be disappointed. :-)

this is a typical sandra bullock movie in which she plays a mousy (but profane) woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero. sound familiar? there are plenty of holes in this story. things just don't add up and some of the suspense is a little corny. but - that suspense is very good. there is a lot of tension in this story which has strong paranoia running through it. the story starts off slow but kicks in pretty soon and stays that way, making it an involving movie for the viewer. that's why i give it a pretty good rating - the movie gets you involved in it. bullock is more cute than annoying, which she normally is to me, so this is my highest-rated movie with her in it.

this movie was made on a relatively small budget (10-20 million dollars?) with almost no promotion at all from its distributors. i only knew about it because i am a long time jean-claude van damme fan and i always check out his latest films in hope that they will be at least watchable and aside from some real turkeys (derailed, second in command), they are. this movie has an easy enough plot to follow and van damme gives a good, humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving van damme, scott adkins and the final one of them together. the editing and camera work for most of the film is pretty terrible but isaac florentine can definitely film a good fight scene. i too am happy that van damme has been acting better lately (in hell, wake of death, until death) but with the good acting came less martial arts. in the shepherd, van damme proves that he still has it.

i saw this stage show when it was broadcast on pbs in 1983. i was involved in local theatre at the time and had seen some pretty incredible stuff out of the dell arte players, but bill irwin floored me.i was most impressed at how a man of his size (he's quite tall and beefy) could fold himself up into a small box without so much as a pause for adjustment and move across the stage at a dead run without even a whisper of sound from his feet if he chose not to make any noise.most amazing for me, though, in this performance, was the way he rose to his feet during the jack-in-the-box / marionette piece. those who saw this show will recall that when he climbed from the box and collapsed to the floor with his body limp and limbs akimbo, he "pulled" himself up by the top of his head as if by a string, and rose not just to his feet, but to a full ballet pointand did it in one fluid, seemingly effortless motion. just consider the strength, grace, balance and focus such a series of movements must take in order to accomplish them the way he did! add to his physical prowess his strong and believable characterization skills, and there lies a consummate actor / performer. my jaw dropped at the movement and my heart broke at the portrayal of a puppet who is determined to be more than just a lifeless thing in a box.as to the unfortunate (yes"tragic" would be a better word) unavailability of this piece in home media form, i have noticed that much of pbs' works are not available on tape or dvd. sometimes, pbs shows will be available for direct purchase from them for a limited time immediately following a broadcast, but they seldom stay on the market for long. there are exceptions, of course, but these are mainly the science and history documentaries; rarely does an arts piece remain in print for longassuming it ever made it into vhs / dvd to begin with. i don't know why this should be so; certainly, pbs could use the income from home media marketing of their shows, but they don't take advantage of it much. this is a shame. there are many things i've watched on pbs that i wish to own, but pieces such as "the regard of flight" are, i'm afraid, a one-shot, once in a lifetime treat, never to be repeated on pbs again and never to be available for home media purchase. that really sucks. i'm lucky to have caught it when i did.oh, yeahour local library did get a copy of "the regard of flight." and yesit was stolen.

i saw this performance on tv and taped it. my daughter played it over and over again. i loaned out at work and everyone just loved it. it is just brilliant physical comedy. bill made an appearance here in california, (he was working and living in new york) and performed the regard of flight on stage. i was able to take my daughter and her girlfriend to see this brilliant performance.bill was awarded a federal endowment, and my daughter wrote him a letter of congratulations, and bill was so kind to write her a note back and enclose a photograph.people ask me, and i can't decide if he is a comedian, and actor, or a clown. actually he is all three. i really wish this was on dvd, my tape is lost.

this adaptation for tv was a wonderful vehicle for bill irwin to show his ability to perform physical humor. with the backdrop of a struggle between an actor and his writer/director, bill uses his clowning antics to showcase a variety of skills including hat tricks, pantomime, dance and various physical devices.although it takes a big swipe at the entertainment industry and his craft, it is engrossing for people of all walks and ages.this work was televised as a pbs special. bill performed a piece of it on the tonight show, but out of context it did not go over well.

i like the shepherd! sure the acting wasn't good but the fight scenes were nice. van damme throws some nice kicks and so does adkins. the story was average. a texas cop battles smugglers. this movie did everything a van damme movie should do which is martial arts and action. van damme was never a good actor. i think this movie is better than van dammmes last 2. if you're looking for an oscar winning performance you're not gonna get it here but if you're looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you. scott adkins is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately the public has gotten tired of martial art superstars but his movies in this movie are great. van damme delivers strong kicks and it's good to see him performing martial arts again since he has not in his last 4 or 5 movies. this movie is definitely worth watching if you're a van damme fan.

i have not seen a van damme flick for a while, pleasantly surprised, he still has it, looking older, but tougher, kind of like sly, becomes more rugged with age. this is a good flick and has prompted me to take a look at all the van damme movies i have missed over the last ten years. i would like to see a good director put van damme on the big screen with a good plot. van damme still has the moves to amaze the audiences, the last movie viewed with van damme was legionnaire, that was a good flick as well. in addition, i looked in to van damme's early fighting history, i too my amazement i realized he is the real deal, very accomplished martial artist in his younger years.

after 10 years, it is finally save to say that our belgian action star is back again. i personally found this one to be even better than wake of death, which makes it his best movie in... 10 years!! okay, it is not like his highlight years as timecop, universal soldier, sudden death or even his best effort to date: hard target (one of the best action movies ever made by one of the best action directors john woo.) the action is good, the story is exciting, the dialogue is quite funny, this one is better than expected.the bad guys are awesome like in hard target, and the fight scenes are "old school". real fans know what to expect. i must say, i gave up on him, but van damme is finally back. more please....

like steven seagal i also am a big van damme fan and have followed most of his movies since the start of his acting career.in this flick van damme assumes the role of jack robideaux whom is a cop that just moved to new mexico from new orleans to work as part of the border patrol. haunted by memories of his past, it is up to jack to put an end to a group of ex-navy seals from smuggling illegal drugs into the u.s. that killed his daughter.overall i found this film to be very good, van damme is in very good shape for 48 years old and can really move. the action scenes are very intense and the movie even throws a couple of plot twists in to keep you guessing. unfortunately van damme does not have the same intensity as he did say 10 years ago, regardless the shepherd: border control is the 3rd straight solid film that van damme has made possibly opening the door for a larger project.i definitely recommend this movie to a van damme fan or fan of action movies in general; the shepherd: border control is a great movie, not as good as until death but better than the hard corps. be sure to give this one a try, you will not be disappointed.

i thought that this was the most interesting film that jcvd has done in a very long time. i loved his character and the whole thing with the rabbit set a different tone for this film. imho, jcdv may really be on to something going forward. a little more light heartedness, some obvious homages to other films, mixed in with some great fights...i would like to see more this style of film-making from him. one of the other posters thought that the bar scene was a desperado rip off. i immediately saw the r. rodriguez connection also, but thought it was very clever and made me want to see the film again to look for more subtle cues from other films. jcvd rocks!!other stuff after reading other comments:no music in the dungeon fight? at first i didn't like that at first either, but then i thought it was interesting because it threw me off balance a bit by giving us something that we didn't expect. made it seem more real.i also always get a laugh when directors cry like 2 year olds that their film was "stolen" from the studio. directors are paid to do a job. the studio is the boss and they want the product that they want. very few directors have absolute final cut on a film. in this case, jcvd is the talent and the only reason anyone is watching this film. i am sure he got a film that he was happy with. i have a relative who works at a post house who knew a little of the story. presumably, the director worked on and delivered his cut of the film. everyone who saw it said it was a disaster...then jcvd and the studio re edited the movie. this stuff happens all the time. he also did see the final cut (which he claims he didn't) and his "delicate genius" ego was severely bruised because they hated his delivered cut. if this director was smart, he should have taken credit for this one as it would have been his best.

it's really good to see van damme's film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to c-grade flops "derailed" and "second in command" which were both tragic and not in a good way. the sheperd: border patrol is a good action flick with some really great action/fight sequences. it's good to know that van damme still knows how to kick seeing as his last film "until death" had no martial arts in it at all!!!that being said, this film is significantly inferior to "until death" which was a really good turn for van damme. "until death" lacked the over-the-top action of most van damme films but was dark and gritty and van damme's performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film. still, the shepherd is definitely a film worth checking out especially for van damme fans or just action movie fans in general but if you're looking for a film with a bit more story line.....you may want to skip this one!i do believe that this film was done well enough especially on what little budget it would have been shot on. the only real problem i have with this film is the title; "the shepherd"? i don't get it! i suppose "border patrol" just doesn't have the same ring to it without the word "shepherd" in front of it!!!my rating for this film is 7 out of 10 but that's by van damme movie standards not in any other film category.i.e. it's good for a van damme film.

this is certainly a good film, beautifully photographed and evocatively acted. yet one should certainly criticize it, and mizoguchi, for it is not without flaws and weaknesses. mizoguchi really cared for women, and wanted to make statements on man's lack of sympathy and total cruelty, yet he sometimes gets ahead of himself in trying to make this statement by adopting the wrong means. this is certainly a case in 'the crucified lovers', 'princess yang kwei fei' and 'zankiku monogatari'. he sets the scenario in feudal japan, which leaves the viewer at the end with the partially right exclamation: "boy, does feudalism suck, i'm glad that it is over...". and true, some of the scenarios such weaker films of mizoguchi present would be literary impossible today. also, his women characters sometimes become archetypes of unrealistic self-sacrifice, which also simplifies the scenario less appealing. saying that, "crucified lovers" is a good film, with such few relative weaknesses, though the sometimes chilly, cynical prose by ueda, the screenwriter helps this film allot. i still highly prefer and recommend mizoguchi's 'realistic, 'contemprary' films of 1936: 'osaka elegy' and 'sisters of the gion', as well as his late masterpieces, in which he showed more restraint and subtlety: 'ugetsu', 'sansho dayu', and 'the life of oharu'.

the only print of chikamatus monogatari i've been able to find was abysmal - i almost couldn't watch it. which is a shame as this is among the greatest mizoguchi films. the story - which i believe had been done before and since by other japanese directors - is a bit straighter than my favorite mizoguchi films (sansho the bailiff and ugetsu monogatari), and is essentially a tale of tragic romance, in this case a transgressive romance that crosses strict class boundaries. as always with mizoguchi, there is an exquisitely expressed tone of defiance, and - bad print aside - i was very pleased. as with all of mizoguchi's films, i'm eagerly awaiting a restored dvd release - whenever that may come...

agreeable "boy's own paper" nonsense with a sprightly performance from cushing, some amusing rubber monsters, colourful jungle sets, & the ever-welcome appearance of caroline munro in animal skins.

nice way to relax. i am packing my suitcase now so i can go and be with caroline munroe. phony monsters and scenery make for 89 minutes of harmless fun. something you can enjoy with your family and not be offended.

this is a true gem of corny sci-fi! peter cushing adds a great personality to this midnite movie classic.i particularly like the sound design. the weird choppy voices of the creatures and the rhino creatures all provide a bizarre backdrop (of course the scantily clad babe doesn't hurt either!)

i think this is a great, classic monster film for the family. the mole, what a machine! the tall creature with the beak, the flying green lizards, ranthorincus/mayas or whatever they are and the ape men things the speak telepathically with them. the battle of the men in rubber suits fighting for a doll for breakfast umm! yummy! class, what else can i say? how would they make a 2002 remake of this one?

i have fond memories of watching this when it came out. it's one of those films that you know is rubbish, even when you're a kid, but at that age you overlook the ludicrous acting, special effects and plot (so there's a race of big-busted nymphets living underground, huh?) and just enjoy the campy monsters for all they're worth.

shazam was okay, but hero high was my favorite when i was a kid, i mean before there was sky high(2005) and zoom(2006), there was hero high, a school for super hero's in training, teenagers with super powers would help police capture bad guys, and other times they would get in embarrassing situations like the greatest american hero(1981). it was a fun cartoon to watch, what was also fun, was the live action stage show called the kid superpower hour with shazam. the actors who voiced the characters, also dressed has there characters in the show. rex ruthless(john berwick), misty magic(jere fields), weatherman(jim greenleaf), captain california(chris hensel, who also sang the theme song), dirty trixie(maylo mccaslin), glorious gal(becky perle, who looks like the love child of superman and wonder woman), and punk rock(johnny venocour). the whole cast just went with anything, when it came to the jokes. the cartoon was a fun superhero comedy, i shore up it will come back in live action like fat albert(2004)

i'm a fan of zhang yimou and finally found this dvd title from the shelves of a shenzhen bookstore after a long search at many places.this is a huge departure from previous zhang yimou work, esp in terms of style and locale. the director himself has said that this is the first and only time he'll ever attempt to make a black comedy set in contemporary china. you may even say this work is experimental in nature, compared to his other well known big budget and formal pieces.filmed with a hand-held camera and wide angle lens throughout the duration of the whole film, the quick pace editing and high energy performance & naturalistic tone never let you go once it grips you from the start. it presents a very realistic account of modern chinese urban sensibilities, which in this case is set in beijing. if you appreciate and love this kind of black humor, you will love this film totally. also look out for hilarious cameos by zhao benshan (happy times)and the director zhang yimou himself.a last point of note: i find the characters in this film, as in all other zhang yimou films, exhibiting similar personality traits - stubbornness, always trying to beat the odds & up the ante. do let me know your thoughts on this.david lee

shuai is a burly and uncouth young beijinger with a punkish haircut, who ekes out a living selling cheap books from a stall in an indoor market. he wouldn't appear to have anything in common with the wiry, middle-aged, would-be intellectual, zhang - and yet the two of them wind up in a restaurant together discussing the pro's and con's of murder (the chinese title would perhaps be better translated as 'talk it over'). if that makes it sound kind of pedestrian, don't be misled: this film is profusely inventive in its plot, and mostly races along at breakneck speed (although the pace does flag quite badly towards the end).if you only know zhang yimou's worthy historical dramas like raise the red lantern and shanghai triad, or his more recent martial arts epics, hero and house of flying daggers, you'll be amazed; in fact, whichever of his other films you've seen, you'll be surprised, pleasantly surprised - this is far and away his most original, most quirky, most experimental work. it was shot within a couple of weeks on a minimal budget, almost entirely on location in beijing (and making use of many ordinary beijingers in the smaller supporting roles - there's even a fleeting cameo by the director himself), and mostly with a hand-held camera, in a jerky, hyper-kinetic style which is a million miles from the elegant formalism of his best-known films.ok, i live in beijing, so i find an additional delight in all the bizarre little details of everyday life that i am coming to recognise and relish (even though it was shot in '97, and things are changing so rapidly here), but i really think this film can be appreciated by anyone. i saw it, as i have so many other chinese 'comedies', at a movie club that screens sub-titled versions of recent chinese films for an almost exclusively expat audience; and it is the only one i can recall where the audience was laughing out loud. some non-chinese audiences might find it a little too strange, a little uncomfortable at times, in that it does include some violence, and, after opening as a breezy, offbeat romantic comedy, mutates into something much darker in its second half. it is, however, very, very funny.it's also superbly acted by the two leads, especially long-time zhang yimou collaborator jiang wen, who is probably mainland china's foremost film star, and has a brooding screen presence reminiscent of a young depardieu or de niro.watch this film - for proof that the chinese have a sense of humour that can translate to other cultures, for proof that zhang yimou is far, far more than a one-trick pony...... and for a thoroughly good time.

i could never imagine i would start loving movies like this. after seeing yimou zhang's 'hero', i decided to check his other movies, perhaps looking for something similar. the second yimou zhang's movie i watched was 'no one less' after which i realized what kind of cinema i'm now in. no wonder why i got 'keep cool' immediately. it is a simple, touching and brilliant piece of cinema, i pay my respect to the director.this movie shows that it's not the amount of money makes film good. it's all about what the director wants to show and how successful he is in doing this. the story is very simple, a typical extract of a typical daily life, moreover shown in a very simple way, the movements of camera also strengthen the impression and the feeling of the movie. i give a top rating to this film and impatiently waiting to see other yimou zhang's films.

i was born in beijing, china and moved to the united states at the age of 9. been home to beijing several times since and loved it each time. one of the many things i love about beijing is the people and the ambiance they bring to the city. "you hau hao hao shuo" (which translate more accurately to "if you have something to say, say it nicely") delightfully and truthfully captures that feeling of beijing. i suppose you would have to have lived in and kinda understood beijing and its people to get the most out of this movie, though you might enjoy it regardless.> the story is not complicated, intentionally kinda quirky, and captivating. i will leave it to unfold by itself and not tell you too much except some comments. each detail, from the pictures on the wall, to the decorations, the streets, and restaurants feels like home. (zhang yimou most likely shot everything "on location") but more importantly, the characters - our "hero", the girl, the kind-hearted but unfortunate "laptop man", and the night club owner are each native to beijing and lovable in their distinct ways. their conversations really capture the essence of each character. the story, mostly driven by situations and conversation (save the brilliant bafoonery near the end) is intriguing and always interesting.> i am 21 now. my parents and i love this movie. we are always so amazed by zhang yimou's ability to transform ordinary people into believable screen characters, and everyday life into extraordinary situations."keep cool" - different. hilarious. meaningful.

this is not the best movie you might ever see, but it still is very refreshing. of course, it has it's flaws, it has it's humbling moments and yet at the same time it's different from all the sh*t you're used to and is funny in a way only the french can give you this. you might recognize a little from the masterpiece amelie, when you see the opening. i give it 7 out of 10, but still reccomend it to you if you're tired of the usual bore you can rent in the videostore.

the claude lelouch's movie is a pretty good moment of cinema. one of the most touching films about family and loneliness, and surely the best interpretation of french actor jean-paul belmondo.

surely the best film directed by claude lelouch after "l'aventure c'est l'aventure". the jacques brel's life inspiration is really present. richard anconina and jean-paul belmondo played a really amazing duo and are really great in the psychological discovery of the two characters they are playing.

sam lion (jean paul belmondo) discovers he needs to take some time off as everybody around him relies to much on him and stages his own death. when he discovers those he loved ans still loves are in need, he gets albert duvivier (richard anconina) to help them. in search of his own past, of his own desires, this fabulous film by claude lelouch is a man's quest for himself at a ripe age.built like all lelouch films, the film's beginning with constant flashbacks may be puzzling, especially scenes where paul belmondo (who looks a huge lot like his father) is playing a young sam lion while sam lion stands in the same room - a flashback sequence which takes a second to grasp.one of lelouch's most elaborate works, l'itineraire d'un infant gate is a must-see tale of self fulfilment.

the only reason the duke is tops, one of several "race movies" made during the times of segregation, would be worth noting today is because it made the film debut of a 21-year-old singer named lena horne. she plays ethel andrews, a singer who has to leave her producer mentor duke davis (ralph cooper) in order to branch into the big time. davis, however, has to fake having taken the money for her services in front of her so she won't feel sorry for having done so. he then teams up with doc dorando (lawrence criner) for a series of medicine shows throughout the south. meanwhile, in new york, her new producers have bombed big time because they made her the whole show instead of simply the specialty act. davis finds out from the radio and offers his services as producer and band leader to bring his lineup of other specialty acts, many of whom make their one of their few or only film appearances here, for his chance at the big time with ethel next to him. guess what happens? while the plot is the kind you've seen in thousands of other movie musicals during this time, the fact this was made for a certain audience makes this one of the more fascinating features i've seen during this black history month. ms. horne's singing is on good display here and it's interesting seeing her so young before her professionalism takes full hold later in her career. among other supporting players there's an unconfirmed, according to imdb, appearance by lillian randolph, annie in my favorite movie it's a wonderful life and sister of amanda randolph who i just saw in the musical short the black network, as the woman with sciatica who complains of not being cured after taking the doc's medicine before duke explains it's for the feet! and as a longtime louisiana resident, i'd like to take note of two players from here in this movie: joel fluellen from monroe as a tonic customer and marie bryant from new orleans as the sexy dancer who appears near the musical climax. so for just lena horne alone, the duke is tops is worth seeing at least once.

an unusual film for an audience outside the usa. lena horne looks fabulous and so does ralph cooper. there is not added background of tap steps as in other musicals so you do not hear the beat of the taps which is great realism. music is muted to hear what dancing steps there are. acting is a little stilted and the casts speak slowly so that you think the movie is older than it is. costumes are daring for the time in the dance routines at the end. often feels like you are part of an audience at a stage show. what furniture you see is very modern which adds to the movies feeling of other worldliness. a must for all film buffs.

its a good film set in vienna about a cab driver, toni (donald buka), who steals a passenger's identity when the passenger is shot whilst sitting in the back of his cab. this gives him an identity as he is an illegal immigrant, but he needs to play out the role of the victim until he catches a flight to the u.s. with a ticket in the victim's name. mrs manelli (joan camden) rumbles him but she is accused of having mental problems by her husband, claude (francis lederer), a concert pianist. as a result, toni is let off the hook. claude does not want to part from his wife, but she runs away from him. there are several plot twists and eventually both toni and mrs manelli make a run for it together - they are both trying to escape from their lives in vienna. there is a tense, exciting build-up to the finale. are they going to get away.....??...unfortunately, the picture quality isn't fantastic and there is a line that runs down the middle of the picture for a while. the cast are all very good in their roles, especially francis lederer's portrayal of claude. also important to the story are heinth (manfred inger) as the cab company owner, marie (inge konradi) as toni's hometown girlfriend and the inspector (hermann erhardt). its a good film.

previous commentators have noted the similarity in appearance between this film and the third man, director carol reed's classic film noir starring orson welles and joseph cotten. this similarity strikes the viewer almost immediately. it is, indeed, high praise to be compared to robert krasker's academy award- winning cinematography in the third man. the plot of stolen identity also has been delineated fairly accurately but in rather ordinary terms. i found it highly creative and entertaining. as common as the "mistaken - or stolen - identity" device is in both theater and cinema, it is only a device and not to be mistaken for the plot, itself. consequently, while the viewer may have seen this device "a thousand" times, the plot of stolen identity is full of surprises and twists based upon this device. it is the unexpected turns that make this film much fresher, more original and engrossing than a plot synopsis might convey. stolen identity doesn't rely on the kind of suspense that characterizes most film noire, because there is no real mystery here. instead, it relies on constant, smaller surprises. in short, the mistaken identity device is rather common; but this plot is not.finally, although i was not familiar with the cast, i found the acting to be uniformly good, occasionally outstanding. i easily could have imagined other actors turning this film into a melodrama, with bombast, overblown gestures and obvious facial expressions. the acting is always more restrained and subtle. donald buka is especially restrained and credible, never "blowing his cover" with an obvious facial expression as we see too often in films that depend on the maintenance of subterfuge to sustain dramatic tension.the only disappointment in this otherwise fine film was the very weak development of the love story sub-plot. as it stands, it seems like an afterthought - a mild surprise, in fact - tacked on to the end. or perhaps during their shared ordeal, the actors simply couldn't convey a palpable level of chemistry that i could appreciate. this sub-plot should have been made more apparent as the story unfolded. all in all, i thought this film was a fine little gem, and i wondered why i had not seen it before. try it, you'll like it.

a quick paced and entertaining noir set in vienna just after w.w.11. donald buka is a refugee who can't find legal work because he does not have any papers. no papers means no work permit, which means no way to get a passport. he survives by driving a friend's cab at night. if he gets caught it means three months in jail. one night he picks up a fare at a big hotel and drives the man to an airline office. buka takes the man's luggage in and returns to the car. there he finds his customer has acquired an unneeded hole in the back of his head. what to do? call the police? without a work permit they will put the grab on him real quick. no, he needs time to think this out. he drives to a secluded spot, empties the man's pockets and hides the body. he now has an american passport and plenty of cash! he drops by an underworld contact to have the passport photo changed. now he just needs to go to the man's hotel and collect the man's plane ticket. his ticket to freedom! needless to say that would be too simple. waiting at the hotel is the dead man's mistress, joan camden. camden is on the run from her rather nasty husband, francis lederer, lederer is of course the swine who had bumped off the man in buka's cab. camden calls the police since she believes buka has robbed her lover. buka shows his new passport and manages to talk his way out of the mess. camden breaks down when hubby lederer shows up at the police station. lederer convinces the police camden has suffered a mental breakdown and she is released to him. she escapes again, finds buka, and the two decide to flee the country together. lederer again puts in an appearance and buka must decide if helping camden is worth his freedom. this film is much better than i'm making it sound. buka is best known as the low-life cop killer in 1950's "between midnight and dawn". the film was produced by actor turhan bey.

there's a "third man" look to the shadowy b&w photography of stolen identity, a thriller produced by turhan bey, ex-star of universal pictures during the '40s. it's an expertly filmed tale of jealousy that leads to murder when a famous pianist (francis lederer) becomes overly possessive of his wife (joan camden) and is soon intent on carrying out a scheme to murder a man she's having an affair with.a taxi-driver (donald buka) happens to be giving the woman's lover a lift to the hotel when he steps outside a moment to chat with a worker digging up the street. lederer uses the sound of the drill to muffle the sound of the bullet he puts in the head of the passenger from outside the back of the car. when buka returns to his cab, he finds a dead man in the passenger seat.enroute to report the murder to the police, he changes his mind and decides to switch identities with the dead man who has an american passport which means buka could realize his ambition to return to the united states. the stolen identity plot becomes thicker when the man's girlfriend (lederer's wife) shows up at the hotel to accuse buka of impersonating the dead man.it's the sort of plot movie-goers have probably seen countless times, but it gets a nice workout here, with plenty of tense scenes as buka and lederer's wife plan how to run from the authorities until a final confrontation with the murderer and the police.it's extremely absorbing, well done and holds the interest throughout with some excellent atmospheric photography of vienna that will remind most movie-goers of "the third man".well worth viewing.

hong kong, the 1920s. a young man from poor beginnings dreams of being a hero, and spends most of his time training and learning about kung fu and bodybuilding, much against his father's will. he helps a servant girl escape from a ruthless businessman, whose goons then come after them, and terrorizes the young man's uncle's noodle restaurant. the uncle turns out to be an old, reformed triad assassin, who now helps the young guy become proficient in martial arts. it's all-out karate kid style with "wash the wok" instead of "wax on, wax off". the kung fu villain is the ruthless businessman's son, who has a trademark scorpion style that looks cool although it is quite silly and surely completely unrealistic.but the story, which develops over time, has an epic feel, good characterization, great kung fu and is generally very entertaining. the young hero is very sympathetic and provides a good protagonist to root for. the romance dimension remains undeveloped, though, which is a bit disappointing. otherwise a great movie.my rating: 8 out of 10.

operation scorpio (akathe scorpion king) doesn't slip into top gear until the last 25 minutes or so, but when the action does hit top speed, it delivers some truly amazing martial arts scenes that demand the viewer's attention. that is not to say that the first hour is worthless just that compared to the final fight-fest, it seems a bit underwhelming.the plot revolves around yuk-su, a talented comic artist who dreams of being a herojust like those he depicts in his drawings. when yuk-su rescues a young maid, siu-yu, who is being sold into prostitution, he incurs the wrath of her evil boss, wa. led by sonny, master of scorpion style kung fu, wa's henchmen give chase to yuk-su and the maid. yuk-su's father intervenes but he is injured. after being rescued by some friendly bodybuilders, the three eventually hide out at a noodle restaurant, owned by their friend, master yat.yuk-su learns to cooks noodles, but also regularly sneaks out in order to secretly build his strength and learn kung fu under the tutelage of jean, the teacher of the musclebound hulks who rescued them. when master yat must leave on business, yuk-su is left in charge of the kitchen; however, he pops out to practise his skills with jean, leaving siu-yu to serve the customers. sonny and his men visit the restaurant and, disgusted by the noodles they are served, trash the restaurant.when master yat learns that yuk-su has been sneaking out, he tells him that he should have learnt kung fu from him; it transpires that master yat used to be a top triad assassin, until he decided to try and change his ways. under the guidance of master yat, yuk-su improves his skills, even learning the art of the shadowless kick! yuk-su eventually gets a chance to try and become a real hero when his friend, fatty, announces that his maid has also been sold into prostitution. with jean, they visit wa posing as french brothel keepers looking for new women. when fatty's maid is presented to them, she accidentally blows their ruse and at last the action kicks off big style. despite his best efforts, jean is badly beaten by sonny and he and yuk-su are forced to flee. on returning to the restaurant, yuk-su finds it ablaze; and worst of all, the bad guys have found siu-yu! yuk su, accompanied by master yat, returns to wa's place to try and rescue siu-yu...despite some fairly entertaining training scenes, the slow build up to the final action at wa's house is rather too drawn out and devoid of any serious fight scenes. it is a shame that the tedium wasn't broken up by a decent scrap midway, rather than saving all of the juicy stuff until the end.the last fight, however, is worth the wait in the end; won jin gives a jaw dropping performance as the high kicking sonny who scuttles, flips and spins with amazing skill and dexterity, and chin kar-lok gives a solid performance as yuk-su, the artist-turned-fighter. also particularly good is old-school kung fu star lau kar-leung (aka liu chia liang) as master yat, proving that this old-timer has still got what it takes to kick ass! although not a perfect film, operation scorpio has enough standout action in its finale to definitely warrant a viewing.nb. i may have got some of the names wrong. my dvd calls characters by different names than those listed on imdb.

i have been feeling a little disappointed by tarantino ever since death proof. but i insist it was only a little, because i can appreciate the amount of work in producing such an homage to stunts people. inglorious basterds has definitely propelled tarantino to the top ranks in my universe. this movie can be summed up (albeit inadequately) in one word : "raw". there is an intense emotion in every scene. revenge and justice seem to be the main themes, from the start of the movie one feels compassion towards the victims of the nazis, and is placed in tarantino's fictional dimension of the ww2 historical context. characters are unpredictiable, fun, scary, brutal, sexy, and other adjectives i am sure are escaping my mind that are just as fitting and positive. i won't go in to an appreciation of each character, but the other comments by fellow users sum up the appreciation of the various performances. dialogue has evolved from the classic tarantino "bad ass" provocative style as seen in pulp fiction and death proof. one can feel in the dialogues that tarantino is making more open references to other movies. indeed, many dialogues were near lessons in cinema to the audience, the setting partly takes place at a movie premiere ; a reference to a movie is close around every corner. it is nice to see that each language presented (german, french, and english) is employed rather equally and naturally. i speak both french and english very fluently, and am frequently disappointed in how english speaking characters in french movies act poorly, and how french speaking characters in english/american movies act poorly. amazingly enough, tarantino managed to make his actors pull off a natural and graceful performance from his actors. it helps put the audience in context of the historical context. indeed ; soldiers, spies and civilans rarely understood soldiers/spies/civilians from other countries.the visuals/photography are beautiful, with sceneries convincingly conveying a 1940s wwii europe. the outfits are perfect, and the violence orgasmically/realistically conveyed. no punches are held back, and the nazis are often shown being tortured. this makes the movie not open to all audiences ; the graphic violence can shock the more sensitive demographic. volumes can be written about this movie. but the movie is so good, that during the north american inglorious basterds premiere at the fantasia festival in montreal, i had to pee, but refused to go so as to not miss one single scene. i hope that image conveys how strongly i feel about this movie, and i'm a hard audience to please.

brad pitt sticks his index finger in diane kruger's leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants. funny, horribly so. the invented yarn takes "the dirty dozen" for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies. lots of fun. even "paris when it sizzles" is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog. i was thrilled by christoph waltzer's character and by his sensational performance. brad pitt creates a true original. i love the actor's lack of vanity. there's a quirk in the character that is pure brad pitt. tarantino visits a new universe but. fortunately, his hand. his brain and his heart are visible all over the place.

i must admit when i saw the preview for "inglorious basterds" i gave myself big expectations. this film did not disappoint.rarely when i watch a movie with such high-expectations do i have those expectations met or exceeded; this film did that and more. even more rarely do i clap at the end of a movie, this i and everyone else in the theater did.i have to say i am a little biased towards quentin, i grew up with "pulp fiction." i watched it when i was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film.however, since then quentin has not really lived up to his billing. his style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar, the quality honestly wasn't there (i never watched jackie brown, and then there's grindhouse). that is until "inglorious basterds." what quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by tarantino or sergio leone, but seeing how leone is dead, tarantino's the self appointed guy on this masterpiece.so let's look at the movie which i won't give away. the writing was spot on, a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie. not to mention this movie was set up in the classic tarantino mold, great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking action.the acting was superb!! christopher waltz deserves an oscar, seriously. i don't say that often, but honestly the man should get one for this movie, he spoke every language in this movie, and delivered with such amazing touch and poise. he stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressive.i have no problem building this movie up, because this movie is the best film i've seen all year, and probably all of next year. quite frankly the more i think about it, this movie may crack my top films of all time, and is quentin's best movie since "pulp fiction." take it from me, watch this film. i loved it doesn't do this movie enough justice.i watched it yesterday and i'm still blown away. thank you quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie. you're back on top again buddy. i can't say enough for "inglorious basterds!"

that's what i thought, when i heard about the cast of inglorious basterds. and i'm both from germany and into movies.that guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre tv series - and even there he didn't play the main parts. obviously nobody ever noticed, what he's capable of. now, thanks to qt, he got one shot to change that - and - let's put it this way - that was a bingo! he is the living proof of what a great caster tarrantino is.by the way: i think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a german - being able to understand everything. and the german dialog is written almost as good as the english.now i could repeat, what many others have written here before. i'll put it short: finally, qt is back.

..."inglorious" as our local theater decided to display its title on their marquee, minus the second word. it is terrific cinema.i don't hesitate to recommend this film to all but the over-squeamish. let them never know what they're missing.i did hesitate to give it ten stars because of my experience of tarantino's previous films. in every case, save "reservoir dogs," they have improved with additional watching.so although i gave it ten stars, i did so reluctantly. it leaves me no "up" to go to.yes christoph waltz is the nazi we've all imagined the worst to be. he is cultured, sophisticated, suave and most sadistic, the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who puts out his cigarette abruptly in a strudel, grinding it into the whipped cream as if he were grinding his heel into a victim.to understand tarantino's films, you need only have a sense of dialogue, color and pacing. the colors are as bright as necessary and when necessary, brighter yet. in the french farmhouse of the opening scene, they are muted and dark, but excessively so. outside a brilliant sun is shining, but in the one room of the house, everything is bathed in shadows and black.it is a brilliant setting for an interrogation by waltz, as the "jew hunter" of the ss, who dangles his host french farmer over the precipice of revealing what he cannot reveal numerous times, then pulls him back with obsequious lines of friendship and understanding.a second sadistic german, well-played by august diehl, later functions as important actor in the final plot twist. diehl's nazi major, who has an ear for german accents, is almost as good as waltz....almost.film classes will study much from this movie. they should look lovingly at the superb pacing. tarantino knows just how long to draw out a scene, building suspense in the manner of hitchcock, then at just the breaking point, suddenly coming to a resolution.for color, look for a final shot at a french theater, where its secretly jewish proprietor is staging a surprise for the upper reaches of nazi leadership.we see her, played by melanie laurent, awaiting the hated german dignataries who will arrive for a film preview of the latest deutsch film masterpiece, a propaganda piece about a german hero and his dubious accomplishments.laurent is framed on a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the gorgeous theater, her red lips and low cut dress reflecting everywhere the intensity of her designs on her guests. it is a single shot that would be worth an entire film.there are thankfully many more such images, many more paced scenes of exquisite dialog and suspense.in short, see it. i'm sure you'll see it again and again.

here is one of jane austen's movies that i found very delightful. i read the book first then listened to it on cd and was captivated by how a young victorian girl could be persuaded against marrying the man she loved due to his lack of a fortune or education. the joy of knowing that anne is evidently reunited with a lost love. the fact that her godmother tries to marry her off to a good for nothing cousin who's only out for money. looking at the snobbery that comes from the upper classes and how class distinctions can divide couples from following their hearts. captain wentworth realization that he still loves anne after seven years. his final understanding that anne's love was constant all that time and they she wasn't going to let her family interfere with her true happiness and eventual marriage to one she truly loved.

i finally found a version of persuasion that i like! anne doesn't look like a scullery maid in this version, just a very thin, aging, pretty woman, quite like she's described in the book. captain wentworth doesn't look like he's 50, nor does he look perpetually angry but rather, as he's described in the book, he hasn't aged as much as anne and is quite handsome. and they play their parts with such conviction and realism...that's what acting is all about. they were believable. they created real characters, and it was like the characters in the book came to life. if you haven't seen this version, i urge you to find it, order it or request it from either a bookstore, or a library if you must. it's worth the price and worth the wait. i watched the 1995 version, and the 2007 version and this one towers over the other two. why it isn't rated higher is beyond my comprehension. the book conveys the tenderness of their relationship and this movie makes the book come to life.

i'm just getting the chance to dig into past austen films, and i picked this up because persuasion is, has been, and always will be, my favorite work by jane austen, and anne elliot my favorite austen heroine. so it was with great anticipation that i popped the disc into my player.i wasn't disappointed, either. i knew there were bound to be some draw-backs, so i'll state them, and try not to be too thick about them. anne elliot is the most introverted of austen's characters; she is the least talkative and the least witty. there are passages in the book where anne says nothing - only her feelings are described. this works fine in print, but how to successfully transfer this to the big screen? short of doing thoughtful voice overs (which would grow tedious over four hours) you're left with a long succession of shots where the heroine says little or nothing, and must communicate all by her facial expression. this can leave the feeling that the film is slow, and lacking in purpose. if you need a more overt style of austen, then certainly this film is not for you; but if subdued is more your style, and you tend to pick up on unspoken 'vibes', this will fulfill all expectations.anne firbank (as anne elliot), is, thankfully, an actress whose face can convey much. she looked as i had always imagined anne elliot would look: not a knockout - anne wasn't supposed to be the elegant one of the family - nor in her first youth - which is also highlighted occasionally by the lighting and make-up. what you see is someone who is very like austen's character: someone whose appearance you might pass over once; but hear her speak, and look more closely, and she grows more attractive the better you know her. this is anne elliot, as brought to life by anne firbank.captain wentworth's portrayal is ably handled by bryan marshall. the bitterness is never apparently obvious (save at the concert scene); and, yes, i found it hard to believe he wound find louisa musgrove interesting as she was shown. but that is another point of austen's book: he did not find her interesting, he tried to find her interesting, and, ultimately, failed (sigh of relief). so this, too, fits with austen's original story.i especially liked the portrayal of lady russell, who i thought in the book was not portrayed as truly bad; this also comes out in this adaptation.so this is one film which closely followed the book; i could write much more about how faithfully everything was reproduced, but i'd run out of space here. charles musgrove remained one of the most buoyant characters (good fun), mary the most annoying (i was dying to have her just shut up - but i had that feeling when i read the book, too), captains and the admiral i thought charming.the cinematography i thought a trifle stiff. there was little or practically no fade from one screen to another - perhaps this is due to it being a tv movie. one scene - chop! - the next scene, the actors enter from right, proceed left, and - chop! - another scene, where the same thing happens. this was the only part of the movie which i felt cheated me a little. a low budget has to show itself somewhere, i suppose.and, as i said earlier, if you like some pace to go with jane austen, don't bother with this one, as you'll find it way too slow. i enjoyed it enormously, though, as it brought a wealth of detail (the sets were richly elegant!) to an excellent adaptation of my favorite austen novel. i highly recommend it!

one of the best and most exciting of all conspiracy thrillers, (there were a number of such film in the 1970's). this one is about an accident at a neuclear reactor and of the attempts to cover it up. jack lemmon is the employee who realizes just how dangerous the plant is and jane fonda is the crusading television reporter who takes the story on board and both players are at their best.the events portrayed in the film are, of course, terrifying and not in the least bit far-fetched, (much of what happens here happened in real life at three mile island), and although it now looks like something a period piece it, nevertheless, highlights just how fragile and dangerous a world we have created for ourselves. expect a number of similar films about the effects of global warming any time soon, (and not rubbish like "the day after tomorrow" either).

i thoroughly enjoyed this film when it was first released, and on each occasion i've seen it since. the political drama is effective, if not especially new or inspired. the decades since the release of the film have demonstrated that the willingness to cut costs at the expense of public safety is definitely not just something imagined by a screenwriter.however, i think the most impressive element of this film is jack lemmon's performance. it is absolutely astonishing to watch him at work. he has the gift to be able to communicate so much, at times without saying a word. next time you watch this film, check out jack's face at the times he is not saying anything. he does not need to speak (or worse yet, to mug) to let you know what's going through his mind.i am calling this a spoiler, because of the impression it made on me when i first saw the film: in lemmon's last scene in the film, as he is lying on the floor, he feels a slight vibration. the terror in his eyes is one of the most frightening images i have seen in any film. it is perfect acting, because it conveys instantly the threat about to occur--if jack's character is so terrified, there is certainly something awful about to happen. and it does.

tv newscaster kimberly wells (jane fonda) and her radical camerman richard adams (michael douglas) are at a nuclear power plant when a serious accident happens. the plants managers play it down but adams has filmed it all. wells and adams try to get it on the air but the corporation that runs the plant prevents it. plant executive jack godell (jack lemmon) realizes there are serious problems and tests have been falsified. he tries to get executives to believe him--only they know it. wells, adams and godell find all their lives are in danger.i saw this in a movie theatre in 1979. i was only 17 and it scared me silly. to make matters worse the three mile island accident happened around this time making the movie all that more real. seeing it over 20 years later it doesn't scare me but it still is an excellent film--it works as a mystery, a gripping drama and an expose on the nuclear power industry. fonda (with red hair) has one of her best roles as wells--she perfectly conveys her character's growing suspicion and horror when she realizes a nuclear disaster could happen. lemmon is (as always) excellent. he starts out believing in his company and the job and slowly starts to unravel when he starts finding things out. he was rightfully nominated for an academy award for this. douglas is good but he has a small part and is completely overshadowed by lemmon and fonda.a really great film--one of the best of the 70s. don't miss this one!

bridges's drama about a reporter who discovers some flaws in the safety precautions taken at a nuclear powerplant is directed well and a pretty interesting film from the late 70s. its not amazing, but its solid, the acting is pretty good especially jack lemmon, but douglas and fonda were good too. it was a pretty good screenplay and bridges's direction was solid and suitable. this is definitely not one of the best films of the 70s, but its one of the better ones. a good early michael douglas film and lemmon in his prime.--- imdb rating: 7.2, my rating:, so in simple words, solid but not amazing... thats what this film is, solid but not amazing 8/10

all the right elements seemed to conspire here to make this a memorable thriller for years to come. you have the stellar cast - michael douglas in an uncharacteristic 'free-spirit' role that pretty much launched his movie career, fonda playing her typical forthright female doing her bit for womens lib, and jack lemmon as assured as ever showing us a man with a crisis of confidence. give them a hot-button topic about big business being duplicitous, and that's encouraging for a kickoff, but to have life imitating art so soon after is a marketing man's dream.the script is impressively taut, intelligent but mercifully keeping the jargon to a minimum, and there is a genuine sense of sustained tension brought in play by the director as our three protagonists race to beat the clock. if you like 'whistle blowing' dramas, then this is not quite as good as "the insider", but the whole thing is more than nervy enough.

when the china syndrome was released, plenty of right-wing critics and pro-nuke supporters blasted this film, particularly since its three leading stars were all known for their liberal politics and their overt distrust of nuclear power. but it only took two weeks and a near-catastrophic accident at three mile island to shut those critics up.fonda and douglas are the l.a. news crew that witness a potentially nasty accident at the ventana nuclear power plant. douglas films the event through the plant's soundproof glass; but the tv station will not air the footage, fearing a massive lawsuit. it is thus up to fonda and douglas to get at the truth, despite a massive attempt by the plant's owners to cover up the accident.but a conscientious shift supervisor (jack lemmon) has uncovered certain defects in the plant's pump support structure. he believes that these defects were the cause of the accident and that, though it would be extremely costly and lengthy, if repairs aren't made, the next accident could be apocalyptic. but he can't get anyone who works with him to believe his story. the result is a nightmarish climax that pulls various political, technological, and human interest stories together in one disturbing package.while obviously quite politically liberal in nature, the china syndrome, well directed and co-written by james bridges (the paper chase), is also fundamentally a message movie about the inherent dangers of putting technology and nuclear power together. fundamentally, nuclear power can never be made safe because people can never be perfect. that is what the film is saying; and in a highly entertaining and suspenseful way, it says it brilliantly.

the first thing you see in this film is a static angle(one which will be repeated later in the film), depicting the chaos going on(unseen to the audience) in a studio that airs news. soon after, fonda's character's typical story is shown, in that same angle. don't let this mislead you; the film is not about a female reporter, a woman struggling to succeed in a male-dominated profession. that is merely a lead-in, a way of starting the film(though it's used later). the actual point to this production is revealed gradually, and the first we see of it is in a deliberately long scene early on. the entire film has that pace; not slow or drawn-out, but deliberate. it's never really fast, even in the few sequences that one would normally expect to be so. this pacing(especially because it seems to slow down further as the plot is revealed, as the disturbing, unsettling nature of the film is unraveled) is strong, almost painful to the viewer. it inspires you to, if it had been possible, jump into the screen, grab the people responsible by the collar and yell at them to *do* something about it, to remedy the situation. never once did i feel like getting up or even taking my eyes off the screen for a moment. the subject is extremely important to be aware of, and it's handled perfectly here. no over-dramatization(well... very little, anyway), just an accurate presentation of the issue. the direction is astounding. the empathy felt for lemmon's character is profound. the editing is masterful... one scene near the very end illustrates that perfectly. the editor, judging from his filmography, is vastly underrated. the writing was excellent. the acting was great, in particular by lemmon, fonda and douglas(who also produced it). the lack of a score is perfect; no music is needed to enhance. the ending is sublime and effective. the movie does have a few negative points... among them, some of the dialog is obviously and undeniably mainly exposition, one particular part of the film, whilst dramatic, doesn't seem to mesh with something that follows it. not everyone will watch the film because of two features of it which are commonly (and rightfully so) attributed to bad movies; the pacing(which can be mistaken as being slow) and the (lack of) score. one could argue that to be a negative thing, as everyone ought to consider the points it presents, but maybe it's better this way; handling the heavy subject with the intelligence and respect(for the topic as well as the viewer)... something like this, maybe it shouldn't be spoon-fed. i was mesmerized with the film, and left very taken aback. i recommend this to anyone who believe themselves strong enough to handle it. 9/10

intelligent, nail-biting drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and soon was on the cover of every newspaper in america (when life imitated the film). a nuclear power plant employee in southern california is threatened by superiors when he decides to go public with the real story behind an accident at the plant. ostensibly a stuck valve problem, a tv news-crew's film shows that it was an accident verging on disastrous proportions--and worse, that safety conditions are being scrubbed to save millions of dollars, a cover-up that endangers everyone's lives. the movie occasionally gets too technical (especially in the second-half) and could use more human interplay, however the performances by jack lemmon, jane fonda (as a puff-piece news-woman in the right place at the right time), and michael douglas (as a freelance cameraman) are superb. the throwaway bits involving nuclear protesters is both entirely accurate and bitterly satirical, and the news-biz (with its corporate structure and vapid yes-men) is vividly captured. ***1/2 from ****

i normally don't comment on movies on imdb, but in this case i feel like i should. i love movies, and i want to make them, and this movie is a perfect example of fine filmmaking.this is one of the few movies that i have seen on the small screen (originally seeing it air on amc, i believe, and then on the dvd i just watched) that made me get that feeling in the pit of my stomach. that little gnawing sensation that the director would hope you feel while watching his thriller.jack lemmon's performance is a fine one, and jane fonda and michael douglas follow. i felt so much empathy of lemmon, who's character jack godell, only wanted people to listen to his warning.but what impresses me most about this film is the lack of a score, and this is also what makes it beautiful to me. apart from the opening titles there are no background music to increase the tension, because none is needed. and while the credits run, white on black, in silence it drives the point home.i use the movie as an example to anyone who says music makes the movie. i think the movie should make the movie and the music should only amplify that. but for the china syndrome music is not necessary to get across the realism and the urgency depicted here. the characters portray all of this far better than the music ever could.i highly recommend this movie, it is one of my favorites. if you like movies, you won't be disappointed. if you like movie soundtracks more, you might not want to give this one a go.

although the premise of the movie involves a major "coincidence," the actors all do a creditable job and look great bringing the story to life. i found myself rooting for the characters played by mary tyler moore and christine lahti, empathizing with both, and wanting them to reconcile. sam waterston and ted danson are fine in their roles as well, doing a decent job with the stereotypical buddy relationship. while the story tends to leap through time, occasionally leaving the audience perhaps a little hungry for missing detail, it still flows and avoids any real confusion. this interesting storyline has all the elements for a good "chick flick."

christine lahti (sandy dunlap) and mary tyler moore (holly davis) worked well with soapish material, ted danson did his best with a thankless role of chip davis the premise of this that the two ladies' friendship, one a seemingly happily married woman and the other a career woman who is aware of her biological clock ticking. i found the relationship that ted danson's character had with the single woman played by christine lahti's rather sordid. he behaved in a caddish way, yet he left two "widows" pining over him, bawling. i found it revolting when when sandy told him she wanted to break it off after meeting his wife, he calls her saying he misses her (did he call his wife? there was no sign of that). he behaved like a heel. it perhaps would have made a more interesting film had he not been killed off. perhaps both ladies would have wised up and dumped him. i liked the friendship between the two ladies but it was spoiled by what they had in common: the cad of a husband.

saw this movie when it came out and then a couple more times years later. i'm watching it now 20 years later and it's still a very good story. does it wreak of "lifetime movie network"? yes, but alas lifetime was not even in existence back then so it needed somehwere to air.the cast was excellent. the story was a little schmaltzy; two women become close friends and unbeknownst to either one friend is having an affair with he other friends husband. she's invited over to the house for a dinner party which is how she discovers that her lover is the husband of her best friend. she is horrified and tries to break off the affair. shortly afterwards he is tragically killed in a car accident which is devatating for both women. of course the wife finds out by accident about this affair and wants holly out of her life now, but their friendship is able to prevail because they need each other.i thought it was a very good story a great cast and perfomrances. i really enjoyed it.

ever wonder where that episode, "tuttle," came from in the middle of the first season of m*a*s*h? well now the cat's out of the bag: they got it from this soviet film, a satire on how dumb the tsar is, due to the slip of a pen (rendering the phrase "the lieutenants, though ..." into "lieutenant kizhe" which has no meaning) and nobody being honest or gutsy enough to contradict him and just tell him the truth -- kizhe doesn't exist and never did. so they make up an imaginary life for him and eventually kill him off. and 40 years later, david ketchum and bruce shelly borrowed this zany plot and gave us essentially the same story, only on the other side of what had become the cold war, proving that people in high positions can be equally dumb no matter what their loyalties may be!

i went to see this film out of curiosity, and to settle an argument. the film is now best known from the suite of music sergei prokofiev extracted from his incidental music to the film, the troika movement even turning up in pop arrangements. the general outline of the plot is well known from the sleeve notes on various recordings. a clerk accidentally generates a non-existent lieutenant kizhe in a list to be presented to the tsar. the tsar is interested in this person, and rather than tell him he doesn't exist, the courtiers and officers maintain the pretence that he is real. kizhe is exiled to siberia, recalled, promoted, married, promoted again, dies, is given a state funeral, revealed as an embezzler and posthumously demoted to the ranks.i had heard conflicting stories about how the clerk invented kizhe, involving ink blots and sneezes, but i'd heard the film was lost, so there was no way to find out what happens. then the film turned up at the barbican in london as part of their prokofiev festival. for the record, it turned out that all that happens is that the clerk confuses two words whilst writing an order and turns kuzhe into kizhe. as the tsar is in a hurry to see the order, there's no time to correct the mistake.having gone expecting an historical curiosity, i was pleasantly surprised. the film is very funny, and the audience, myself included, laughed continuously. although most of it is filmed straight, set mostly in the palace, there are a few "trick" shots where multiple images appear on the screen. for instance, the tsar's army is represented by a small group, repeated across the screen. four identical guards perform perfect drill in perfect unison. two identical servants scrub the floor.one slight drawback was it was very difficult to work out who everyone was. there were two women who might have been the tsar's daughters, or a daughter and a servant or something else. and very few people were named. but all in all, an enjoyable film and i'm surprised it's not seen more often.

it was on a day in 1891 when scottish inventor william k.l. dickson surprised his boss, thomas alva edison with his remarkable work in the development of motion pictures. after many experiments, dickson was now able to capture scenes of real life with his camera, and reproduce them through his invention, the kinetoscope, as if a fragment of time were preserved in celluloid. soon, dickson's kinetoscope would become an enormous success as a new way of entertainment, with many people eager to pay the nickel that was charged to be able to watch people dancing, or acrobats performing stunts through the "peepshow" of the kinetoscope. however, the invention wasn't complete, in order for it to capture on film the real life as we know it, sound was needed on the movies. so dickson kept experimenting and this short experiment, kinetophone's first film, was the result.in this experiment, codenamed simply as "dickson experimental sound film", director william k.l. dickson stands in front of a recording cone for a wax cylinder (earliest method of recording sound), with his violin on hands, playing a song named "song of the cabin boy". the idea was to record the song into the cylinder at the same time that the camera was recording his movements. in order to show that this was a motion picture, two of edison's "black maria" laboratory decided to do a little dance in front of the camera. unlike what author vito russo claimed in his book, "the celluloid closet", this little dance had nothing to do with homosexuality as it obviously is a reference to the environment of loneliness of the lab, akin to the lonely sailors to whom the "song of the cabin boy" was dedicated to (the title russo suggests, "the gay brothers", is actually anachronistic as "gay" had no homosexual connotation in the late 1890s).sadly, dickson was unable to achieve the desired effect, and the kinetophone never could really produce the synchronized audio with images. while he had the cylinder with the sound and the celluloid with the images, the synchronization of the two elements was not exactly effective, and the sudden appearance of auguste and louis lumière's cinématographe prompted edison's team to focus on projecting systems and eventually dickson left the company. fortunately, in 1998 dickson's cylinder with the movie's sound was rebuilt and film editor walter murch made a restoration of the experiment as it was intended. finally, "dickson experimental sound film" could be heard with synchronized sound, just as its creative inventor had intended. while it was not a successful attempt, this outstanding film is a testament of the enormous genius of the father of kinetoscope. 8/10

the very first talking picture has returned from oblivion, and now you can hear it and see it! in autumn of 1894, at the edison lab complex in west orange, new jersey, thomas edison's associate william dickson tried to combine two existing technologies (the phonograph and the kinetoscope) to record sound and image together. in the event, dickson was unable to synchronise the playback of sound and image, so this experimental film was never released to paying audiences ... and consequently (unlike many silent films which dickson made for edison at this time) it has no official title. the silent image (recorded at 40 fps) has been in the library of congress for years, known to film historians as a mute curiosity. it was also known that the 'soundtrack' had been recorded on one of the crude wax cylinders languishing at the edison national historic site ... although nobody knew which one.but now that's changed. recently, curators located the wax cylinder, which had broken into several pieces. these were reassembled: a playback was obtained, and the sound was digitised. hollywood's veteran soundtrack editor walter murch cleaned up the background noise and tweaked the digitisation to make it synch with the film image, which murch had digitally compressed to 30 fps. sound and image are synchronised at last!the film begins with an offscreen man's voice calling: 'the rest of you fellows ready? go ahead!' (the unseen speaker remains unidentified, but was probably dickson's assistant fred ott.) on screen, dickson plays a violin into an immense funnel mounted on a tripod (one of edison's sound-recording devices) while alongside him, in full view of the camera, two male lab assistants embrace each other for some quick ballroom dancing to the tempo of dickson's music.the film lasts barely 17 seconds: just long enough for us to marvel at this crude technology before being provoked to laughter at the sight of two men waltzing in each other's arms. speaking of which, here's a warning: a well-known but extremely inaccurate reference book ('the celluloid closet', by the late vito russo) includes a frame enlargement from this movie and identifies it as 'the gay brothers'. that's incorrect. 'the gay brothers' is an entirely different movie, made by dickson at the edison lab during this same period. 'the gay brothers' never had a soundtrack: it's a brief fiction film about two brothers who are not 'gay' in the sense russo meant it. the deceased mr russo, for his own reasons, wanted us to perceive dickson's experimental sound film (arguably the first movie musical!) as an artefact of 19th-century homoeroticism. (hmm, what is it about gay men and musicals?) sorry, but there's just no such content here.this vitally important film deserves a rating of 10 out of 10. i've often maintained that no 'lost' movie should ever be considered irretrievable unless it was deliberately destroyed: i'm delighted to report that this film is finally available to audiences as its producer intended it, more than a century after it was filmed!

i'm not saying anything new when i say that "ray" was magnificent. as i proceed to laud this movie i have to mention something that sets it apart from other films. very rarely is a film made entirely by the actor(s). "ray" quite simply was made by jamie foxx. without the wonderful performance of jamie foxx, "ray" would just be another interesting and informative biopic. i always thought foxx was funny, stemming from his days with "in livin' color" and "the jamie foxx show", and i also knew that he was talented, as he used his own show ("the jamie foxx show") to show off his musical talents. but never did i imagine that he could pull off a role like this. i don't know much about acting and what they go through to get into character or other things like that, but what i saw from jamie foxx was extremely impressive. he wrapped himself into that role and made us see ray charles rather than an actor portraying ray charles. the story of "ray" was great yes, but it was given life by jamie foxx.

the famous french detective henri cassin takes his first vacation in 11 years in st. margot where he meets nanette, the daughter of the vacation spot proprietors. despite nanette being promised to childhood sweetheart leon, henri and nanette fall in love and decide to marry, despite nanette's father objecting due to henri's age. on the day of their wedding, leon returns and nanette runs after him. nothing is heard of the two until both are found dead, and henri swears he won't rest until he can find the killer. the only clue henri has to work with is a footprint found by leon, but he is also getting written warnings that others will die soon. soon nanette's mother is found dead and henri has no idea as to the identity of the killer. thinking himself a failure he returns to paris, then he realizes (and fears) that the killer can be only one person, even though none of his colleagues can believe his explanation. out of the ordinary murder mystery that doesn't really follow the formula in other of the genre by columbia or other b studios. credit to that certainly goes to director lewis who does manage to turn this into a noirish film despite the setting of the film, also aided by the use of good camera-work and lighting. geray turns in a very good performance in probably his only lead and the rest of the cast is able to carry their performance. rating, 8.

i first saw this one when it was first shown, so i'm not too objective about it. it really managed to scare me, partly because it was so late at night, but partly because of that whole feeling from a videotaped suspense story (the same thing that helped dark shadows itself). and the casting was so right. i hardly know shane briant from anything else, so it might not be so right to call him "well-cast," but to me, he is dorian gray. and as far as the other male actors, the one who fit his part so well was nigel davenport (who's so good at "larger than life" characters) as sir henry. and john karlen, a sort of dan curtis "repertory player" at the time, because of dark shadows. as one poster points out, this version manages to include the involvements with men, in a fairly subtle way. the scene where dorian recites a list of men's names to john karlen's character, as a way of blackmailing him, and the look on karlen's face, were very well-done. (if that scene were done now, it would probably be done in a too obvious way, and be bad by comparison.) i saw it when "dorian gray" was barely a name to me, let alone more, so even more than the famous 1945 version (which is rightly famous), this is the version to me.

i like both this version of dorian gray and the mgm version. both add a little girl early in the story who grows up to have an association with dorian (this is not in the original book), and that is my only complaint. i especially like angela lansbury as sybil vane and george sanders as harry in the mgm version, but shane briant as dorian in the tv-version is much better looking (i think) and far more ruthless than hurd hatfield in the mgm version: i think briant is more true to the novel's dorian. in the end, this is a very good adaptation of the novel (it even hints at dorian's liaison's with men, as does wylde, which could not be done in the mgm version).

i've seen 'nsna' just after i've seen all roger moore-films and i must say that it felt so good to see connery again. he proves for all times that he is the one and only bond.the film itself isn't really a masterpiece but it is really worth watching. the jokes sit much better here, the effects are funny and interesting, connery is connery and brandauer is really a good villain. but von sydow is just wasted and the score is not often good and there are a few scenes that seem pretty unnecessary.7/10 \ 2.5/4 \ 3+ (1+ - 6-)

the filming is cheesy. some of the actors overact. some of the actions are unexplained and unexplainable. but...this movie is in the mode of the psychological dramas of the 50s.it is a morality play. similar to the movie in which a "method" actor becomes the evil character he portrays on stage, ed is forced to watch slasher movies because he is the film editor. it gives him a nervous breakdown which leads to a complete psychotic break.

on monday, earlier this week, sometime in july, i happened to be under the influence of the sweet leaf, and me being a horror fan, wanted to see something scary. i was thinking of the ammityville horror 2, but i got something way better. i was at my friend's house, and he had the vhs evil ed. no cover or anything, he didn't even see the whole thing himself, but he told me it was about "a guy who goes crazy and kills a lot of people." well, this movie was very shocking,i've never seen the actual brutal nature of sadistic violence until this movie, it buries ted bundy and ed gein both! it is pretty funny too, with references to the evil dead trilogy( and plus the evil dead 2 poster is everywhere in the movie!) the movie is about edward, a obsessive-compulsive, nice guy, who happens to be a film editor. he is then lent to another department in the building, and he is sent to the posh yet violent world of sam campbell, the splatter and gore department. sam campbell, eddy's new boss, is telling eddy about the big break on his movies, the gruesome loose limbs series, and he needs eddy to make the movie somewhat less violent so they can be shown all over europe. eddy has his regrets soon, as the images and scenes that are displayed to him from the lonely suburban house he is sent to work in, and then, what happens from there is truly nightmarish. imagine yourself in his place! the acting is great, the overdubbing is little funny (sam campbell's voice is often found funny, same with the other actors). however, the overdubbing job was done pretty good, i give this movie a 10/10, and it's a good introduction to the gore sub-genre to horror. very good, nightmarish, bloody.......you just have to see it for yourself.quote from movie: "where in the f**k is my beaver rape scene?!"

i wanted to love this movie. everything seemed to be in place for an enjoyable, if not groundbreaking, film. it was set in southern france, good-looking and recognizable actors led the cast, and i really admired the vibrant african costumes, the proverbs and music. despite all this, i didn't love it. movies are supposed to convey their meaning at the first viewing, but "secret laughter" doesn't do that. nimi and matthew, as played by long and firth (both of whom have played romantic leads before and should have known better), radiate as much warmth and passion as dried fish. i used 'dried fish' deliberately, because it was one of a few - too few - strong lines and moments sprinkled throughout the film. another winner was when nimi catches matthew snooping around her apartment. he finds a book of hers with her first name written on it and says: "your name is nimi. i never knew." then he insists that she call him by his christian name. i watched this scene intently as matthew asked nimi over and over to "say my name", realizing that up until that moment, they always called each other by their last names. i thought this was a turning point for the film, and expected that it get better. it didn't. why do nimi and matthew always seem to stand at ten paces, even in that "say my name" scene? what does matthew like about nimi, aside from her obvious beauty? and why would a sensible woman like nimi fall for a comic book writer who regards his marriage as something he can put on hold when a beautiful exotic 'adventure' comes along? and i'd like to add that it was a little hard for me to get behind a romance built on adultery. yes, jenny is a vicious harpy, but if i were in her shoes, but i'd probably match her cruella tactics to stop my husband from straying. believe it. the story hints at nimi's painful past, but never fully explores it. some critics say firth seemed a little awkward here, and i agree. for goodness sake, the actor summoned more palpable longing and passion as that early 19th-century snob mr. darcy (and while wearing those hideous britches)! as for long, who did shine in 'love jones', there were times when she seemed to concentrate more on her accent than playing her character. even so, there were many moments  the 'say my name' scene among them  when she was in total control and came across really well. yet, 'secret laughter' is not without its redeeming qualities, and i've found that it grew on me with more viewings. nene was well portrayed as supportive and well-meaning, even if she doesn't fully understand nimi's attraction to matthew. i absolutely loved it when nene faced off with mama fola in those dueling proverbs scenes. my husband liked it, and usually he's the first to sigh and throw insults at the screen if he doesn't like what is going on. he even chuckled at the scene when sammy asked matthew some very frank questions about sex. so there you have it. 'secret laughter' was good enough to entertain an avowed curmudgeon like my hubby, but an avid moviegoer like myself will need more than one viewing to appreciate what the director and writer were trying to convey.

i've seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it.the conversations between nimi and her mother plus nimi and matthew are very touching. the nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colourfully as it usually is.although certain things could have done with a bit more explanation; if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place, the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandable.luckily, optimum releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understand.i would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see. i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it.

personally, i think the movie is pretty good. it almost rates an 8. i liked the ethnography aspect as well as the gorgeous photography. colin firth's character isn't the most likable but he does a better than decent job with the role. the heroine, played by the beautiful nia long, is a familiar film heroine in that she's trying to do what she thinks is the best for her child -- marrying a respected member of her expatriate community -- while fighting her attraction for the "bad" man -- one who's not a member of her community (the "outsider"). most of the film is about this mother's struggle: should she do what's expected of her, what she thinks is best for her son or should she follow her heart? i don't want to give away the ending. let me just say that it's a feel-good movie with gorgeous location shots, exquisite african dress (it's worth seeing the film just for the women's brilliantly colored african clothing and headdresses), and likable characters overall. the actor who plays nia long's son is bright and adorable. the plot is a bit formulaic, but i liked the movie nonetheless. if you're a colin firth fan you must see this film. if you like chic flicks, see it. i think i'll watch it again tonight!

i love this film. there is something for everyone. it if funny, saddening, passionate and dramatic. the mixture of two completely different cultures creates a whole new world that the viewer cannot help but want to be a part of. i must admit that i am slightly biased, as colin firth is my favourite actor and so nothing that he does is wrong in my eyes (!), but in this film his tremendous acting talent is apparent and it is furthered even more by the beautiful acting of his co-star nia long. the problems that their love affair suffers makes it, ironically, more believable and the simple features like the contrast between the colours of matthew's and nimi's clothes alone, makes this film all the more enchanting. i defy anyone that cannot be moved by this story. i find it enchanting and have watched it at least ten times since i bought the film a week ago!

this is a great movie. when two people from different backgrounds and social status think that they have nothing to offer each other and in the end they what each other needs it a testament to what the heart knows. sometimes we wonder why one man is with a woman or vise versa and the outward appearances say one thing to our eye, but what they offer each other from within that we cannot see is amazing and unexplainable. when nimi thought that matthew had nothing to offer her and when matthew was only looking for a fling (because he had an open marriage w/his wife jenny), in the end they realized that they could not and did not want to exist without the other. it was worth it to them to resist what family and friends thought and what society said was right to be with each other. this movie kind of restores my faith in love.

*warning! some spoilers!*matt, a rich writer, is in fact still just a boy in his behaviour. he doesn't care about anyone's but his own needs and couldn't care less about the consequences of any of his actions. just as he gets to know nimi and her bonds with her familiy and her communitiy he starts to feel that something is missing in his live.he starts to realize that he is in fact lonely and stuck in impersonal structures that are just convenient but lack heart and commitment. nevertheless he shies away from any responsibilties and is reluctant to change his live. but will he be able to settle again in his old life and ignore the bonds he's already - unconsciously - formed?nimi's situation is the absolute opposite. she is pressed into the regulations of her nigerian community, its prejudices and its medieval values. being a single mother her position is difficult and it gets even worse when she falls in love with matt, a white devil (as the referend would say), a man who cannot commit. the women of the community plan to marry her to the referend to end her single status and give sammy "a name". but that would mean for nimi to give up all independence and self-determination. but is there an alternative for her if she wants sammy to be accepted and herself to become a respected member of the community?this movie has it all: a very sensitive and sensual love story (with very sexy scenes of matt and nimi) and an endearing child who is eagerly matchmaking, a beautiful scenery in lively colours.colin firth (*swoon*) and nia long show a great chemistry. it's just fantastic to watch them. and fissy roberts as sammy is just to die for. you simply want to adopt him. i just love the way sammy and matthew talk to each other. they are both on the same level in many ways. especially when sammy asks matt about sex. this scene is absolutely adorable!!almost nothing to complain about.... wait! that's not true. one thing is not good: that the movie is not long enough! (well, and maybe that the referend is too bad and too silly to be convincing....)10 of 10, by all means!

i've seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it.the conversations between nimi and her mother plus nimi and matthew are very touching. the nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colourfully as it usually is.although certain things could have done with a bit more explanation; if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place, the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandable.luckily, optimum releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understand.i would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see. i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it.

a fabulous film,which i have now watched several times over since buying the video only four days ago.yes i am a colin firth fan and colin was his usual talented, natural gorgeous self.the interaction between colin (matthew field)and fissy(sammy, nimi's 7 year old son) was very special and so natural to watch. they were hilariously funny together and also touched my heart strings. the scenes which i loved the most was sammy and matt sitting on the wall chatting and matt then falling backwards off the wall in an hilarious fashion (i won't reveal the content of their discussion so as not to spoil the plot). also very hilarious was sammy quizzing matt about sex, colin and fissy were perfect in this scene and making what can be an awkward subject between adult and child just so natural. colins words and face at the end of that scene were so delightful and said it all! just brilliant. credit, of course, must also go to fissy roberts for his delightful portrayal of sammy. he played such a lovable and cheeky child character. the two actors were just perfect together.the interaction between colin (matt) and nia (nimi)was perfectly balanced and i couldn't agree more that the chemistry between them was wonderful to watch, displaying love,tension and of course passion. it was exciting to see how their delicate blossoming romance gradually unfolded, also showing how their cultural and social divides affected their relationship and was good to see how colin and nia sensitively portrayed matt and nimi discovering, accepting and overcoming these differences. it kept me fixed to the tv and guessing right until the end of the film. colins portrayal of matt's vulnerable and juvenile side was also perfectly portrayed, so much so, that i found it was difficult to watch when matt was so mean and childish towards sammy because he (matt) felt that sammy was getting in the way of his romance/relationship with sams mother nimi.one couldn't help feeling very disappointed, angry and frustrated with matt for treating sammy this way and this in turn threatening to spoil matts special relationship with sammy and nimi. colins special talent of 'getting inside a character's head' and displaying to the audience the different sides of a character, was very much in evidence here and pure magic to watch. i must also mention that colin also has such a good rapport with young actors (see also 'my life so far'a wonderful and not to be missed film).i also loved the relationship between matthew and his wife jenny, both were excellent in displaying to the audience the dark side and tensions within their marriage and that not all seemingly 'happy marriages' are quite what they may seem from the outside. i mustn't forget to mention the reverend whom i thought was very funny, in a serious sort of way! also nimi's mother and family were hilarious as well as bringing across the importance of nimi's culture and her situation.the downside, i can't really find a downside,but to be objective about the film and to give credibility to my review, the only negative comment that i would make is that the script writers didn't explain in enough detail as to why matt collapsed in the car, there was only a vague suggestion, from nimi, of something being wrong with his heart. however, this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film, far from it.i just needed to rewind the tape a little for a 2nd take.i felt that this film had it all, entertaining, uplifting and i loved the rich colours and sunny scenery.the film warmed up a cold winters day and made me smile :-)) all the essential elements were there,laughter,love,tension,sadness,anger,drama and a warm feel good factor, with, yes plenty of those delicious colin firth moments including a very soaked colin in a 'wet shirt scene',not to be missed by any fan, what more could a girl want;-)) i would strongly recommend this film, specially to any colin firth fans ;-)

it is always great to see a movie that teaches us about history in africa as they are definitely too few. however, the movie depicts lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonialist one..., i felt it hard to sympathise with this kind of leadership, yet the movie is somewhat like a homage to the man. there was too little content, explaining how the man got to rise in the first place, and the whole context of belgium "letting them go". so it is certainly worth going to see as the acting and photography are excellent, especially mobutu himself. i would just have liked a better political analysis.

in the film, lumumba, we see the faces behind the monumental shift in the congo's history after it is reclaimed from the belgians, and we see the motives behind those men into whose hands the raped and starving country fell. lumumba is not a movie for the hyper masses; it demands the attention of its viewers with raw, truthful acting and intricate, packed dialogue. little of the main plot is shown through action, it relies almost solely on words, but there is a recurring strand that is only action, and it is the stroke of genius that makes the film an enlightening and powerful panorama of the tense political struggle that the congo's independence gave birth to. this film is real. it is raw inits depiction of those in power, and those on the streets. it is eye-opening in its content. and it is moving in the passions and emotions of its superbly portrayed characters. whether you are a history fan, a film buff, or simply like good stories, lumumba is a must-see.

first of all, it is interesting to note that one of the users here who commented on this film (from belgium) had to add that lumumba was "communist." if this user indeed watched the film, the message was that he was not communist but pigeonholed (by none other than belgium, the u.s., the un, etc.) as a "communist" leader for other individuals', corporations', and country's political and economic gains. even if one decides to accept that the film partakes in "revisionist history" it would be naive to assume that lumumba was communist, especially coming from the country which "granted" the congo independence, and since lumumba was elected democratically to his seat as prime minister.onto the film...this is one of the most important and powerful films i have seen in quite some time. depicting the struggles of the african freedom fighter, and elected prime minister's struggles as its first leader, mr. peck, does a quite commendable job of putting together all of the pieces into one work. and this must have been quite some task. due to the fact that most people outside of the congo and belgium likely do not know the history of lumumba and the congo, outside of some light coverage of african imperialism (hopefully) in one of their high school/secondary school (or maybe university/college level) history classes, he had his work cut out for him.and to to think that oliver stone's "jfk" took over 3 hours, "lumumba" runs under 2 hours. and a most engaging 115 minutes it was, as we find that his desire to not compromise with western powers (whom he holds responsible for the atrocities to his people, particularly belgium), while trying to deal with power struggles within his own borders, apparently even with some of his friends, it is amazing that the man lived as long as he did.this is a must see for anyone interested in equality, justice, humanity, history, politics, and true freedom. you will not be disappointed.

good movie, acting was terrific especially from eriq ebouaney(lumumba)and very well directed.it also shows how lumumba was cornered by the belgians, u s a and united nations and how they labelled him a `communist' to scare people as they did to all the honest true african leaders like nkrumah, kenyatta, nyerere and many others. it shows how western countries preach democracy while they have something else on the back of their minds. it is a story of injustice, struggle and brutality.it shows how lumumba couldn't control his people, yes they were his people, but before we put the blame on him, was he getting enough if any from the people he appointed in his government like mobutu? or his colleague had other things in their minds, to find out go and see the movie! certainly mobutu did, went on to loot the country for the next 35 yrs, before he was overthrown and fled the country. died a billionaire.some flaws: there was too little explanation how the man (lumumba) got to rise in the first place. also there should have been more explanation about the country, congo kinshasa (after independence), now known as democratic republic of congo formerly known as zaire when it was under mobutu. there should have been an explanation why he (lumumba) couldn't keep the second largest country in africa in one piece. and also what was going on with tshombe and katanga . just heads up if you gonna watch the movie tshombe was controlling the katanga region which (if i am not mistaken) is the number one copper producer in the world.in all it is a good movie to see. you will learn something new about africa, it's leaders and it's people and probably will open your eyes why this continent is ridden with wars.

the story of how the (communist) leader who freed the congo from belgium imperialism was eliminated by the western powers through the hand of mobutu. a story of struggle and injustice, of hope and the search of freedom. the story could be the one of any african country. a very moving film with images full of symbolism and beauty. if you have to see only one foreign film this year, see this one.

an excellent, thoughtfully produced historical drama--well played, artfully written, shot in ways that convey accurate visual images of the congo, and with more than a few moving moments, especially for those who care about the history of africa and imperialism. however, a fair amount of worthwhile content gets lost in translation, and because names, acronyms, and so forth are hard to follow. so i would strongly recommend checking a neutral source such as wikipedia to get a basic sense of the story being depicted (and the subsequent history) before enjoying the film. if you have the dvd version, there is also some useful historical background. there is a point towards the end of the film where the name of a character who then speaks with an american accent is actually beeped out--a simple google search of "lumumba film censor" or something similar will reveal a truly fascinating (and perhaps disturbing) twist regarding the production of this important film. this film, if coupled with a little outside research, helps contextualize dozens of other films relating to central/east africa and/or imperialism, e.g. hotel rwanda, shake hands with the devil, various adaptations of conrad's heart of darkness, and even "ali" when mohammed ali visits kinshasa.

when it comes to political movies i usually come out feeling empty. they generally take up some moralistic stance and you have a clear good vs bad story line as if it is some sort of batman movie.but with lumumba it is the first movie i've seen that showed politics for what it is, and the real issues of trying to rule a country of broken people who have known no other rule but violence. there were no good or bad there were just interests and conflicts of interest. this is the only political movie in my opinion that one can come out of it truly learning something. especially for anyone with their eye on politics as a career this movie shows you, you cannot rule on what you want for a country, but what the country wants from you.that's why i disagree with a lot of reviews that say everyone comes of bad, i think they come of too idealistic, (the belgians want the perfect colony, lumumba wants a perfect unity congo, tshombe wants wealth and riches, america wants the perfect ally against communism, russia wants the perfect aide for communism). and the congolese? they come off used and abused, ( best example in the movie when général janssens tells his black troops your government lied to you and it leaves them all in an uproar) they are always being pulled and pushed into supporting this person or another.this movie shows in politics a mistake can cost you dearly and this movie everyone makes mistake after mistake until it escalates and ends up destroying the country. their intentions might be good (or at least in the characters opinion), but it's everyone's mistakes that lead to the downfall of congo. i don't think anyone is bad in this film, i just think they want too much from people sick of giving and want to start taking.overall, it's not just the best political film, it is a great film in general. acting is fabulous (eriq ebouaney as lumumba was perfect casting i really believe him) script flawless, editing perfect pace, and production value higher than i expected for a central african film. a must watch.

to answer the question of a previous reviewer who asked the name of the u.s. official mentioned in "lumumba", the name of the character is "mr. carlucci." frank carlucci is reported as having been at that time second secretary at the u.s. embassy in the congo. subsequently, among other assignments, he was appointed u.s. ambassador to portugal, deputy director of the central intelligence agency, secretary of defense, and is now the chairman of the carlyle group. it's hardly surprising that carlucci's biographical sketch on his www.carlylegroup.com web site fails to credit his service in the belgian congo. if his name was deliberately censored from the hbo version of "lumumba" it may have been to avoid the possibility of hbo's being sued in u.s. courts. carlucci's name, however, is clearly mentioned in the theatre version of "lumumba" that i saw recently. in the event, i expect that he would deny any involvement in lumumba's murder.others have commented on the evenhandedness with which the film "lumumba" treats the parties concerned: lumumba-supporters, other congolese, even belgians. a somewhat more sinister view emerges, i think, from the bbc documentary entitled "who killed lumumba?", based on the book "the murder of lumumba" by belgian historian ludo de witte. when examined closely, these films demonstrate that the fate of lumumba and the history of the congo is not just a matter of black and white. only lumumba's murderers believe that.

i feel very fortunate to have the chance to not only watch this film, but also learn more about this fascinating person and time. lumumba is an outstanding portrayal, giving a full sense of the story without falling into the usual hollywood trappings - yes, he is shown with his wife and children, but the essence of the story is his politics and those of the still-emerging independent congo. the film is brilliantly made, moving along at a pace that is consistently engaging. i look forward to seeing other raoul peck films, as well as more from eric ebouaney!

this movie is the best movie i have seen in a long time. it is also the best movie seen that uses a drama to tell history, without going to speculation such as with jfk,nixon or hoffa. it deftly depicts the clutches that belgium had on the congo. it also teases out easily for us the european and american forces that were behind the power the inflict the congo today. the film was sure to specifically implicate the u.s., rightly so, in the murder of lumumba. this film could never be made in the u.s. for u.s. film rarely criticizes itself in acts of imperialism and murder. (save stone's jfk) it also lets us in on the problems that were present with the inner conflict of the congo, between lumumba, mobutu and katanga. we can see how precarious countries sit in establishing new governments when their history is one of colonization and those who were the colonizers continue to pull the strings of power and force. the film is excellently shot with eriq ebouaney an excellent lumumba. the cast is great and they really draw you into the feeling of the climate in the congo during that time.again, this is a must see for those who love drama with a correct historical background. see my notes on quilombo.

i have never read a jacqueline susann novel, but i have also seen valley of the dolls, based on another of her books. on both occasions i thought the movie is probably better than the book and will further improve with age (certainly contrary to the books). the reason being that a movie focuses more on a specific style in fashion, design and behavior patterns. and in this aspect the love machine offers quite a lot. the set design fits the story perfectly. and all the characters fit in, too. they're perfect in the way that they complete a well balanced general picture. they are superficial and do not develop, it is true, but in this movie i wouldn't want it any different.david hemmings reprises the role he played in antonioni's blow up. and it's more than a rip-off. he's a fashion photographer, looks visibly aged and seems to start going slightly to seed. robert ryan reprises the role he played in max ophül's caught, he is smith ohlrig all over again, greedy, bored and boring, uninspired and uninspiring. it's possible ryan did not want to be in this picture and acted accordingly, on the other hand he might have thought a lot about his part and then given a carefully studied performance. whatever happened, it fits the picture. dyan cannon is great (fantastic wardrobe!), she dominates every scene she's in and is involved in the two highlights of the movie: the burning of a luxurious bed and the knocking down of the hemmings character with a academy award statuette.the title, the love machine, is, of course, meant ironically. robin stone is a kind of a barry lyndon of the pop era (incidentally, the movie is slightly kubrickysh). that he chooses a tv station to work his way up to the top seems to be a mere coincidence. he sees love (meaning sexual favors) merely as a means for personal advancement. there are rather scary hints of a troubled sexuality which are not explored in the movie. homosexuality is treated very casually, probably not the standard for mayor movies of the period. the open cynicism of the tv executives need not fear comparison with other good movies about the subject like a face in the crowd or network or truman show. they are producing crap, they agree among themselves it's crap and they know they will make a lot of dough with it.i did not regret spending the odd 108 minutes with this movie and would not be surprised if it picked up a cult following, provided it's given the chance (meaning a dvd release).

why is there so much angst among the imdb reviewers who hate this film? it isn't a masterpiece, but having viewed it twice it does come across as compelling drama set in the world of network tv. robin stone is the epitome of every dan rather, phillip stone, and brian what's-his-name on nbc. a mannequin of a man incapable of love who succeeds professionally, but fails miserably in his personal life. i worked for eight (8) years in network news and robin stone's do exist!the supporting cast works for me from cannon (who can be annoying, but isn't in this film) to greene (who plays pathos just right) to wexler (who scores as the young model in love w/ the image of prince charming and can't reconcile that image w/ the true ugliness inside). also of note is the ending which some imdb reviewers claim is a cop-out. it's not! listen to the song "he's moving on" for clues as to the arc the robin stone character travels that brings him to finally face his issues. he realizes the answers don't lay w/ the life he's lived and the symbolic walk away from those he's associated himself with, at the end is perfect.

well, where to start? i stumbled across this one in 1993 and just hit "record" on the vcr out of habit, more than anything else. "citizen kane" it sure isn't...but if you've had a bad day and are in the mood for crashing out in front of something not too intellectually stimulating, then i tentatively suggest this might just be your "thing".we have the lot here - great title track, more stereotypes than you could shake a stick at, unconscious comedy, the bitchiest fight scene of all time and more, more, more! david hemmings plays the diametric opposite of his role in the 60s classic "blow up" - still a photographer, still hormonally stimulated but not "quite" the same.john philip law is easy to slam as an actor who makes a log appear unwooden but that wouldn;t be fair seeing as how he had about 5 minutes notice before accepting the role.wexler as "amanda"? suffice to say it was her one and only film role! the real star of this movie, though, is ethel evans who plays a, shall we say secretary (?), with the morals of an alley cat and an ambition to match. the way she manages to reconcile her present life with that of a future with her comedian husband-to-be is actually quite touching in an earthy, gritty, what-is-to-be-will-be way.i actually love this movie when i'm in the mood for it.......and wouldn't touch it with the proverbial bargepole when i'm not.kudos to the cast for keeping a (relatively) straight face when filming.a "classic" in the edward d wood school of cinematic endeavours!

nothing is worse than the genocides of our world's history. this film attempts to describe the horror faced by one particular family - a common narrative device - in the atomic bomb world of hiroshima. the most memorable parts are the graphic and saddening images that the people of hiroshima face in the aftermath of war. the story, however, becomes more concerned with the effect on a specific group of people and how they cope with getting on with their lives; in other words, if you don't really care about them, the film grows boring. it's hard not to care, though, when a family's homeland is wrecked. i'm not sure if i would recommend this film, because it says very little politically and, honestly, did not keep my interest in the family's troubles.

in the light of the recent typhoon that hit the country hard (that is, typhoon ondoy), i thought it upon myself to re-watch "black rain" (1988, japan), shohei imamura's haunting black-and-white masterpiece on the destruction and after-effects of the atomic bomb that hit hiroshima in the closing period of the second world war. the destruction and impact of both catastrophes (war and typhoon) may differ in degree and quality, but the trauma and scar (physically and psychologically) nevertheless are still there. it is a testament to a film's power that its images remain as potent and as indelible as when they were first seen. it is only that the difference now, in my case, is that watching those images has assumed a greater sense of poignancy and potency due to a first-hand experience of a near-monumental weather calamity. there is a sense of kinship, so to speak. imamura has always been one of my favorite japanese filmmakers. his films are always a pleasure to watch because of their anarchy, sensuality and earthiness:"the pornographers:introduction to anthropology" (1966), "eijanaika" (1981), "warm water under a red bridge" (2001), his two palme d'or-winners "ballad of narayama" (1983) and "the eel" (1997), to name some. given the mood of his films, who would have thought that he once served as an assistant director to yasujiro ozu, japanese cinema's most austere and minimalist filmmaker? but then, it is ozu's rigorous formality and domesticity that imamura was rebelling against. but then again, with "black rain" one can unmistakably sense ozu's imprints. the father (or the father-figure) being intent on seeing his daughter get married before time runs out on both of them, and the stillness and calmness of the scenes showing all members of the family together (notably, the dinner scenes or in ozu's film lexicon, the tatami) are something that the revered master filmmaker would perennially explore in his works ("tokyo story", "late spring"). essentially, the over-all subdued and deliberate quality of "black rain" is a remarkable contrast to the bacchanalian chaos and instinctual drive of imamura's entire filmography.still, this is not to say that watching the film would not be an altogether unsettling experience. "black rain", as aptly described by american film reviewer leonard maltin, is "filled with haunting black-and-white images." in the film's first 15 minutes, imamura pulls no punches in showing the immediate and graphic horrors of the nuclear bombing, one after another (stiffly-burnt bodies, hanging flesh, walking dead, fires and debris everywhere, madness all over). an assault to the viewers' senses, definitely it is, coupled with takashi kawamata's somber b/w photography (he did the lensing in yoshitaru nomura's crime drama "the incident") and toru takemitsu's chilling score (he did the music in such classics as akira kurosawa's "ran" and masahiro shinoda's "double suicide"). even during the film's supposed "tranquil" phase (that is, five years after the atomic bombing), one can still never have a sense of contentment and order, with the uneasiness and pain still being strongly felt by the survivors, not only in terms of failing physical health, but more so in terms of psychological trauma and social stigma. the human race, it now indisputably appears, has been destined to bear the legacy of the bomb, for as long as it lives. i already wrote a piece about "black rain" some years earlier (posted in imdb.com), but only in comparison to volker schlondorff's magnificent "tin drum", another film dealing with monumental human folly and global catastrophe. moreover, it has never been my practice to write twice about a film that i already wrote something about before. it is in the light of the recent weather calamity that devastated our country that i was prompted to re-visit and write something again about this remarkable imamura film, as there is a wealth of lessons to be learned from both the film and the recent event in regards the imperfections and dangers of scientific knowledge and action, and the long-term scars and wounds inflicted by a wide- scale destruction (whether human- or nature-induced).there have been a number of films dealing with nuclear holocaust and destruction ("testament", "threads", "the war game", each situated within their own respective countries);and "black rain" stands among them, if not more so, for both its unapologetic and somber portrayal of individual and communal disintegration brought about by atomic devastation and the fact that it has a historical event as its basis.few weeks from now, another disaster film from hollywood, roland emmerich's "2012", will finally hit (no pun intended) the big screen. as we all know, this american director's bunch of "disaster/apocalypse" films--"independence day", "godzilla", "the day after tomorrow"-- serves no other purpose than to be of mere entertainment value, with no real insight into the nature and wisdom of apocalyptic disaster and the human condition being affected. i wonder how this "gigantic" movie would exploit the trauma, disorientation and apprehensions still being experienced by our people because of the recent weather calamity. to say that this flick is a precautionary tale would probably be no more than an overstatement. but yes, i will still watch "2012".

i like breillat's movies, but this one is the best i've seen at balancing animal warmth with sexual intelligence. anne parillaud is electric, and the script is amazing - especially considering it's supposed to take place on the set of another of breillat's movies. you don't have to agree with her take on everything to get a lot out of this. it made me think a lot about vulnerability and power. try to imagine a male director with jeanne's openness - not impossible, but a little mind-bending. the unannounced sexual undercurrents that are always present when humans get together to make anything is held up to bright light here, but not a cold light.

this film was very interesting to me, virtually a film within a film, which is about a very whimsical director who cleverly persuades an actress and and actor (who happen to dislike each other) in producing sexual chemistry on film. the director is faced with a fusillade of obstacles as she tries to get the two individuals to perform beautifully on film. sex is comedy is much more than a comedy, packed with uncomfortable quirky moments the movie also addresses the psychological and innate instinctual behavior of men and women in regards to the sometimes controversial act of sex. i loved this film, the character jeanne played by the beautiful anne parillaud performs wonderfully on screen as you share in her struggle to produce a motion picture work of art.

catherine brreillat is a french director who loves to provoke her audience. she takes us along to witness how a film is done on location. the movie in production seems to be based on herself, since the person at the center of the story is jeanne, a woman director, much like ms. breillat. jeanne acts as the alter ego of the real director.jeanne reaches an impasse at the start of filming. not only has she picked the wrong time to photograph this movie during a cold spell, as it involves beach locations that are obviously too cold for the actors and extras. jeanne has problems with the two principal actors, especially, the male lead who has problems accepting the way the director has decided to show him in the movie; the lead actress is no angel either.movie making, ms. breillat tells us is a process like no other in a creative work of art. first, there is the writing period, in which, in this case, jeanne, has written a screen play, that when it goes into production reveals problems the writer/director didn't think about. there is the problem of how she wants to photograph a love scene in which the young woman of the story has her first sex contact. what appeared clever in the written page, doesn't necessarily translate into an easy time in front of the camera. the actor is made to wear a false penis and has a lot of problems accepting the fact that a make up has to touch him in ways he never thought he would ever be touched by another man.the luminous anne parillaud is marvelous as jeanne, the director. she makes observations about the production, the actors, and the crew that fit well into the story being told. gregoire colin and roxane mesquide play the lead actors, with all the insecurity that some actors bring to a movie set. jeanne has to massage their egos in order to get what she wants in the end. ashley waninnger plays leo, jeanne's assistant."sex is comedy" allows ms. breillet to give us her own take on films in general. this is a great look at the way movies are done in a typical breillat style.

another fabulous movie from catherine breillat, this time about the difficulties of shooting a sex scene in a movie. using comedy  a new genre for breillat  we get a backstage view of filmmaking but in documentary style. the character who plays the director in the movie is based on breillat, the sex scene in question is taken from her earlier film a ma soeur' as is the main teenage actress. but the film, like all of breillat's work, is not entertainment alone. it is peppered with philosophical observations on the nature of sexuality as well as demonstrating a devotion to purity' (as opposed to pornography) that is a cornerstone of breillat's work and a devotion to real emotion. we see the director character harangue the young lead actress and actor to bring the best out in them, hypnotising them into the parts they need to play, bringing out part of themselves that the director can see in them but they cannot see in themselves until they achieve the heights of acting that she demands of them. she makes meaningful movies, not titillation, but she shows the work that is needed to produce this, and so gives us insights both into the (decidedly french) film making process and the psychology of male  female sexuality.

the accounts seem real with a human factor added to the mix. a lot of sadness. i'm sure glad that i wasn't him....another thing to add is that all the women in this show were not really pretty accounts of the real women. but, i don't think that it was about the women, although it was to jfk jr's passion. what a shame. any loss of life is a real shame.seemed like a good account of his life. i recommend it if you are into biographies and melodrama!

i must say this is the best movie i have ever seen. i know that on this website it's received only negative reviews, but for once i'd like to be the good person who gives the worlds best movie a good review. i find the movie to be extremely funny, and it has the perfect mix of everything. it makes me feel all sorts of emotions when i watch it, and i can't get enough of it. the soundtracks brilliant. i love it, i understand why people may not love it as much as i do, but i don't understand how people could hate it. the movie is 100% brilliance. blurred is amazing. i never realised that aussie movies could be so good, and i also never realised i could watch one movie, so many times in a single day without getting sick of it. i think that everybody should watch it, whether its to get a feel of what life was like in the younger days, or if its to see what your in for when you reach the end of year 12.

for pure gothic vampire cheese nothing can compare to the subspecies films. i highly recommend each and every one of them.

king vladislav (angus scrimm) of romania is a vampire, but a vampire of light who wants nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with mankind. but his son, radu (anders hove), is a cruel creature to his very heart (which is pretty obvious as soon as you see him). three female students have come to study local folklore, but find themselves drawn into the vampires legends at just the wrong time: vladislav has been killed.who can say anything bad about a film featuring a cameo from angus scrimm? i can't. i mean, i had some low expectations after seeing other full moon pictures ("puppet master" in particular, and "demonic toys"). but despite the really bad animated effects of the demons, this film was actually really well done and very fun to watch. plenty of blood, a good plot and backstory (the bloodstone story was surprisingly refreshing) and even some new angles on the vampire mythos, which you'd think would be dead by now. (maybe i'm wrong, but this is probably the first film to feature rosary beads being fired from a gun.) aside from vampires and blood, you get a share of nudity (gratuitous, but welcome) and i had to notice the excellent score from the composers (not sure who deserves credit, but those involved include stuart brotman, richard kosinski, william levine, michael portis and john zeretzka). this is horror 101 all the way. heck, you even get two sequels, which is the sign of a true horror film. (of course, some bad films get sequels, too -- did i mention "puppet master"?) the romanian theme was well-done, and the film even seems to have been made by romanians if i am guessing their name origins correctly. and the score -- the music -- really stood out for me as a nice change of pace, very mood-setting. i like richard band, but i'm glad another composer was given a shot because he nailed the atmosphere on the head. if you like vampire films and want a slight variation (one of the eastern european variety), this is worth seeing.

the subspecies series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever. there is something about them that makes them special i think it`s the feeling you get when you watch them .they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the 1700`s or 1800`s i think it has some thing to do with the set`s that are used if so then it`s working keep it up guy`s :).in a quick round up of what`s happened in the first part - radu was supposedly bannished from his home land years ago by his father and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birth rite. the blood stone and all his father has so he kill`s his father who is played by angus scrimm (the tall man from the phantasm movies). and takes the blood stone which has emense power to who ever has it because who has it need never kil anyone again because the stone is supposedly meant to drip the bloody of the saints and every time the radu takes a drop from it he is slowly going insane. (thats all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire aint bad enough). well radu`s brother stephan try`s to put a stop to his evil ways all while trying to stop himself falling inlve with a tourist who is staying at a house/fort which belongs to a friend of his.well one thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well you will have to see the movie to see what goes on from here on in.i will review/comment on the other sequels soon .the difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and this is not so this will not appeal to everyone but this has an atmosphere far superior to that of buffy although radu does not look as good as the wonder full sarah michelle gellar :).rating for this movie 10/10 a fine example of how a vampire movie should be done :).

first watched this film years ago with my daughter who is now 13 and fell in love with the vampire. we both thought it was a top film, then watched sub 11 then sub 111 now i find there is sub 1v which i cannot wait to get my fangs on, and also there is a fifth in the pipe line. if no one has seen the movies. these are the best of the best. i think it deserver's a thousands oscar's. i could watch these from morning to night.i would love to have a set of nails like he has, watch out girls. i love it as all the story lines continues from film to film. these ant typical vampire movies they are better. i would love to live in the life that is protruded in the films. it would make all my dreams come true

i was ten years old when i saw subspecies, i instantly had the hots for michael watson and laura tate, they really do have some great on-screen chemistry in the earlier parts of the movie. i ordered a copy back in 1993 from full moon and i learned this: ion and rosa, the servants, have much bigger roles in the screenplay along with the king. what most people don't know is that there was an alternate sequence that was supposed to occur in the ending scene: michelle and stefan get cornered into a room and michelle has the idea for stefan to make her a vampire to help fight off radu and her demonic controlled ex-friends. however, for some reason or another that scenario never made it on camera. another scene in the script, that can be confirmed from the original trailer shows stefan drinking blood from a wolf, or actually in the trailer you see him coming up with blood on his chin.this movie gets a 9 because it's one from my childhood and i have fond memories attached to the characters; even though my favorite characters were stefan and michelle i think anders hove's radu is pure feeling-evocative acting, so much feeling in his work there.

i have seen a number of horror movies to know that this one was one of kind. full moon pictures has a knack of giving this fan an entertaining night. for all the cheesiness of most vampire films, this is the one that has not only a good premise but has two good sequels. a must see.

i watched this on sky tv late one night, as i am a vampire fan. i must admit i half expected it to be a b-movie disaster but i was pleasantly wrong.subspecies is about a family of vampires. when a vampire lord dies, his two sons, the handsome and noble stefan, and his brother, the evil, hideous radu start a war with each other over their birth right, the bloodstone. the bloodstone is a holy grail of sorts for vampires and it bleeds the blood of saints, which give the vampire who drinks it an ultimate high.the fight for the bloodstone takes an unexpected turn when 3 college students turn up in the brothers' territory on a school trip and stefan has to protect them from his brothers lusts.like, i said, i went into this film not expecting much at all but it was one of the best low budget movies i have ever seen. the sets and locations (romania i think, been a while since i've seen it) are very nice and the music score did the film justice.most of the acting was adequate, but its anders hove as the evil radu that steals the movie (and all the subsequent sequels). hove's performance as the twisted vamp is truly breathtaking and bumps the film simply from okay, to pretty d@mn good!

"subspecies," like many other horror films, gets a raw deal on imdb. the majority of movie-watchers have a hearty contempt for horror, and when they occasionally rent horror films, they either want to laugh at them or cringe at excessively gory scenes. unfortunately, "subspecies" is not particularly laughable, and not that bloody, so it gets a low rating. that's too bad.of course, there's plenty to criticize here. the non-actors are flat, the subspecies are a poor special effect, and the nighttime scenes are too brightly lit. but what do you expect? for a straight-to-video horror film, "subspecies" boasts decent production values and more integrity than you might anticipate. the film's romanian setting is virtually unique (i believe it was the first american movie made in that country, post-communism), and the locations, both interior and exterior, are beautiful. the script has moments of intelligence, especially when it delves into local folklore (all bogus, i'm sure). somehow, the location filming and smartish script work well together - "subspecies" has its own very distinctive world. to risk damning with faint praise...it could be a lot dumber.fans of the more gruesome aspects of horror will no doubt get a kick out of the blood-drooling vampire villain, radu. he's pretty effective in this movie - powerful, with a memorable raspy voice - but i like him better in the sequels, when actor anders hove gives a more self-parodying, campy performance. a totally sincere radu is somewhat silly. other silly aspects include gratuitous nudity and the subspecies themselves, who are clearly only in the movie because producer charles band has a fetish for evil little creatures (see also puppetmaster and demonic toys).but i linger too much on the movie's flaws. for what it is - straight-to-video vampire horror - "subspecies" is perfectly fine. the sequels boast better production values, more violence, and somewhat more thoughtful story lines, so i recommend them even more highly. still, this isn't a bad start for the series.

this is a perfect example of a classic full moon pictures movie. any fan of horror/vampire flicks should definitely check this one out. original plot and good, easy to follow story. also, this movie has some heart-racing scenes that combine horror with action. as of now, the only sequel i have seen to this movie is part iv, which i have to say is almost better than this original.i give it 10 / 10fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master, slumber party massacre, skinned alive, sleep away camp, and other full moon pictures flicks. for other recommendations, check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section.

i just adore this film! i love all characters and i can watch it againand again...and i use to listen to the soundtrack again and again.although i have seen it about two years after it was made and ihave never been such youngster as jip and company i canunderstand them and i love their stories. and if somebody thinks this film is crap, i disagree and i say it isfull of positive energy and friendship and love...and full of youth!the weekend has landed...enjoy it!

well, i should say, "the only film related to club/dj/electronic music and raves...that ravers respect".seriously now. it's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver. albeit, its in a club, its in wales and its somewhat dated. the film leaves out some of the sketchier elements of club life, but doesn't disassociate from them altogether. it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.at the core of the film, and the best element of justin kerrigan's script, is the characters, eccentric, unique yet completely understandable and accessible. this film simple would not work and be infinitely less entertaining were it not for jip, koop, nina, moff and lulu. viewers can deny the political and social implications of the subtext of human traffic as a drug film, trainspotting wannabe, important peg in british youth culture circa 90's, but....they can't deny that these are engaging characters.it's frantic, its brutally honest, it's sobering, it's over the top, but its a great comedy. raves are a complex thing, so are the drugs that are taken at these events, so are the people you will encounter. but from someone who has gone to parties, become jaded and still goes...human traffic is the best snapshot that could be taken of the subculture. just whatever you do, avoid "groove" as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic.

this film is too good for words. its so unbelievably great and funny and true to life. you just know from watching this that the person who wrote this has defiantly felt the way that jip and his friends do through the film. it was my life at one point and i would rely on coming home to watch human traffic ever night before i could even think of going to bed. i think you just get so loved up with the characters and their life style. of course, this film wouldn't be for old people more around the age of 16 to 22 i guess. there is defiantly nothing wrong with this film and it will have you in stitches all the way through. it doesn't have a particular story line to it. the general idea is a weekend in the life of older teens in london and what they get up to. the places they go, the people they meet, the drugs they take and the experiences they have. you have to get this movie on dvd never mind just watching it, you have to have it!!!

this story focuses on the birth defect known as fas, or fetal alcohol syndrome, a disease diagnosed too often among native americans. in spite of the down-beat nature of this drama, the great script and the characterizations move the story along very well. this is arguably smits best performance.

a wonderful little production. the filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-bbc fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. the actors are extremely well chosen- michael sheen not only "has got all the polari" but he has all the voices down pat too! you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. a masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. the realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears. it plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with halliwell's murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.

michael sheen shines like the afternoon sun in this brilliant portrayal of a comic genius. if you are familiar with kenneth williams' mannerisms and diaries then this drama captures the essence of them perfectly. when i read about kenneth hoovering in his swimming trunks i laughed and then it was brought to life on the screen, but this time i didn't laugh as it was put into perspective as the actions of a repressed and tortured man. it must have been such a lonely existence being in kenneth's skin, craving attention but shunning it when it truly mattered! the last 20 minutes are heart-breaking as you see kenneth gradually sink to the depths of despair and consider suicide as the only alternative. i have seen it a dozen times and still cry uncontrollably at the point where he bids goodnight to louie. i cannot recommend this drama enough. sexually explicit but it drives home the fact that kenneth couldn't let anyone invade his world and this is where the sadness of the man lies. for a genius who brought happiness to so many, it's such a shame that his private life was filled with such despair and sadness. pauly.

this is a "docu-drama" of (mostly) the later years of kw's life, with nearly all the parts played by actors (but spot which tv quartermaster plays himself!). it was made for the bbc4 arts channel but my guess is there will be syndication and dvd releases soon. kw is ably played by the excellent michael sheen, here repeating his previous stage role with great success. most of the supporting cast are also very good, and a nice touch is the recreation of period tv appearances with the new actors. this is not, however, light viewing - anyone familiar with kw's diaries and general unhappy demeanour will already know how twisted he could be in later life - so don't expect 80 minutes of carry on styled buffoonery, since the emphasis is decidedly downbeat throughout. recommended, but it's tragi-comic, indeed.

well, sword in the moon finally got a dvd release in korea, and despite the mostly negative responses i've heard to it, and the suspiciously tardy dvd release, i couldn't help but pick it up - any wu xia film is better than most non-wu xia films in my eyes :d perhaps low expectations were an advantage, because i was quite pleasantly surprised to find the film pretty enjoyable.an assassin is killing a number of ministers who were involved in a revolution that usurped the throne, and the government's top swordsman is tasked with identifying the culprit. this doesn't take particularly long, but the answer is not one he wanted to hear. through prolonged flashbacks we learn why, and the history of the swordsman and the assassin, and of the revolution.the film is typically melodramatic for a korean film, and resolutely serious in tone - no hk style comedy moments to be found here. the story can be a little difficult to follow at first, but all makes sense eventually. the film goes a bit wobbly at the end, but no worse than a chang cheh film might do, and for the most part i found it enjoyable. the production values are high, with some good cinematography to capture it. the fight scenes aren't up to the calibre of the better hk wu xia films, but perhaps they're not meant to be - the fights are more "realistic", in that they're less like choreographed dance routines, but there's some wirework and occasional cgi that put the film in "wu xia" mode. the film doesn't have the best cast, unfortunately, with the leads being a tad lacking in charm and occasionally difficult to distinguish from each other. there's a young lady in the film that i don't think i've seen before, but makes the best impression of any of the principle cast - not just because you see her nekkid... or perhaps it is :p the film lacks the charm and grace of the better hk wu xia films, and perhaps the beauty too, but i only wish hk would make them half this good anymore - twins effect 2 does not give me hope that *that's* about to happen any time soon, though tsui hark surely still has it in him if he can get the funding and cast. sword in the moon is not going to go onto my list of favourite wu xia by any means, but it's a whole heap better than romantic warriors or legend of the evil lake - perhaps better than bichunmoo too, though i did like that film quite a bit more on a second viewing. obviously it's nowhere near the wonderful musa, but it's a different affair altogether really. sitm will probably get a second viewing within three years, which is perhaps the best indicator of how much i liked it :) 7/10

spawned by the same monty berman / dennis spooner partnership which produced the champions and randall & hopkirk (deceased) - the latter retitled my partner the ghost for the us market - department s remains a classic example of the action-adventure series which the uk produced in bulk during the late 1960s. like those two shows, its internal dynamic of two guys and a girl might seem to indicate a progressive attitude towards equality (dept s also has a black superior), but it's mostly facade: the launch episode, "six days", is barely halfway through before rosemary nichols is called upon to parade around in bra, panties and one (yes, one) stocking in order to extricate herself from a dodgy situation. still, it's an interesting time capsule, even if the appalling fashion sense of peter wyngarde's character (which, amazingly, degenerated even further in the spin-off series jason king) should definitely have remained buried.

this is a piece of cinematic beauty, and it shows more of quebec culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle province. it takes everybody into a first-person experience of the culture, to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived, breathed, and ate everything maurice richard. the book does this as well as the short, and i'm glad that in all the time i did spend studying french in high school, this was required reading in both languages.i thought it was brilliant to have roch carrier narrate this story. his molasses-thick accent brought a lot of realism to the story. the animation was good, as well, very surrealist, which brings attention to the idea of this being a whimsical daydream, fancying over better days gone by.again, as a symbol of culture quebecoise, this is unsurpassed. one can almost smell the tourtiere being cooked slowly over a wood stove. this whole film deserves endless praise for making people proud to be canadian, and encourage us all to appreciate the finer things of family and our roots. i'm from ontario, and this film made me fall in love with quebec. maurice richard va toujours vivre dans nos coeurs.

with all due respect to joel fabiani and rosemary nicolls and their characters, department s will be forever associated with peter wyngarde's jason king.most people remember him as this camp, flamboyant and debonair womaniser cum detective in the mould of austin powers but that will do a disservice to the character: he's far more nuanced than that.jason king is lazy (he often lets stewart fight all the bad guys and only chips in at the end), he is egotistical (his appreciation of people is based on whether they've read his novels or not), a lot of his detective work is speculation without facts to back them up and he sulks whenever annabelle is right...and she often is. he's clearly a man having a mid-life crisis and drink drives but.......jason king is brilliant. if wyngarde had played him purely as a dashing hero, it wouldn't have worked but he shows king often as a paper tiger, led by his libido, love of finery and prone to grandstanding (and it gets in the way of his detective work at times) but he has some of the best lines and put downs in tv history. and by not playing him as whiter-than-white, the chemistry and interactions between the three lead characters is all the better for it.watching it again on dvd recently, you get to see just how much depth wyngarde put into jason king.

created by dennis spooner, 'department s' was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of interpol, based in geneva, created to solve baffling mysteries the police could not handle. if a plane landed at heathrow with no-one aboard, if a man was found wandering around london in a space-suit, if the passenger of a rolls royce suddenly transmogrified into a skeleton, if a train pulling into a tube station turned out to contain dead commuters, you called on 'department s' to sort things out.peter wyngarde played 'jason king', a flamboyantly dressed crime novelist whose fertile imagination helped crack many of the bizarre cases. king caught the public's fancy and was later awarded a spin-off show. he was ably assisted by american 'stuart sullivan' ( joel fabiani ) and the delectable 'annabelle hurst' ( rosemary nicols ). unusually for a '60's show, the department was headed by a black man - 'sir curtis seretse' ( dennis alaba peters ) if the show looked and felt a lot like 'the avengers', it was hardly surprising. it shared many of the same writers and directors! the colourful titles were designed by chambers & partners, and are worth tuning in for alone. as was the case with so many i.t.c. series, the music was composed by edwin astley. his theme for 'department s' has got to rank as one of the best television themes of all time.predictably, the show looks a little sexist and dated now, but don't let that dissuade you from tuning in. imagine a hybrid of 'jonathan creek' and the 'austin powers' movies and you've got 'department s'!trivia note: the episode 'a small war of nerves' features a young sir anthony hopkins in a major role!

like night stalker and then x-files, the show set up a fantastic situation and the main characters had to sort it out. unlike these, the hero(es) weren't left holding an empty bag at the end. they had usually tangible results. it was also made clear that the 'good guys' were in a dirty profession where they occasionally had to pull some nasty things. imagination, wit, acting which didn't always take itself too seriously ... i miss it. one reason being, i'm hard pressed to think of too many shows - banacek aside - which did as good a job of taking the viewer and grabbing their attention right off the bat. the writers excelled at setting up hugely improbable, if not downright impossible situations which the characters then had to find an explanation to. explanations which often took 90 degree turns into the clearly unexpected yet, for all that, still made sense. too, i agree with another reviewer that the anabelle character was somewhat underused, but when she was on screen, it wasn't just for eye candy. she was quite competent in her own right and stood up to the two male leads when she felt the point she was making warranted it. a rarity in those days. sullivan? if he wasn't in the department, he'd be working for the kgb or cia. he's that sort of coldly efficient, ruthless type. he knows how the world works and realizes what it can take to get the job done. king? it's clearly a game to him. one he excels at and which he parleys into ideas for the detective/spy novels he writes as his ostensible 'real' job. he's probably the most fun to watch of the three, although they all have their moments and often, too. i do agree that the eventual spin-off series featuring only his character lacked the interest of the original, however.

the incomparable laura gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the french "emmanuelle 2." this amazing woman did not go unnoticed, and was soon cast as the lead in this all new italian series, where she is the centerpiece; a beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism that the world had to offer. in this first installment, mae jordan/emanuelle is sent to africa to photograph the people as well as the stunning landscape and wild exotic animals. much like sylvia kristels character, emanuelle has not come into her own when it comes to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality. this first film is basically about how she becomes the "emanuelle" that most exploitation cinema fans are familiar with. filled with gorgeous cinematography, beautiful people, and an intoxicating 70's score from the legendary nico fidenco, this one is sure to please. those who enjoy the more story-driven style of the original french "emmanuelle" should definitely like this as well. the main story here being an interesting cat and mouse tale of a womanizing playboy who comes to the realization that he has fallen in love with a woman who is the female version of him! sexy, fun and totally entertaining throughout; a soap opera to be sure, but one with enough skin and general eye candy to keep the male viewers entertained. for some reason this is the hardest one in the series to find on dvd. there has never been a legitimate dvd for this, which is very strange. the bootlegs that sometimes appear online will have to do until someone gives this diamond of a film a proper release.

you know you're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you. i'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too. every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator. either way, this is pretty much the purgatory between boring french professionalism and the heavenly campy joe d'amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot. don't get me wrong, there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one, but there's always room for more. laura gemser stars, and that's good because she's hot. it's a bit freaky how at times you can see her bone structure, but she still rules over her white counterpart. you can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her kit of. often. every reason is good. every person is good. every location is good. one scene even involves an entire hockey team, whatever they are doing in africa. sometimes the plot gets in the way, and the supporting cast consists of some really vile looking people, but there's enough laura gemser for all.

this movie has made me a rugby -- and coach larry gelwix -- fan. the story's characters slipped and fell before they begin to grow as they struggled through incredibly strong conflicts. those were understandable and completely believable. like life, there were no easy answers for the problems facing them all. superb actors and an excellent script brought this true story to life. i wish there were more movies like this one. these days, i watch almost exclusively, worthwhile true stories because they are typically far more interesting than fiction. additionally, this one is inspirational and it teaches us to not to give up on anyone too quickly.

first, let's call this movie what it is:1. it's a feel-good movie with a message.2. the acting is just okay, dialog slightly better, production value pretty good.3. rugby scenes...just barely passable.but here's the trick: this isn't something hollywood contrived, and it isn't trying to be a ferociously accurate portrayal of the sport. it is instead a pretty good representation of mostly real people, in real circumstances, and a real storyline. sure, they could have done a better job actually rep'ing the sport, but my vote: it does a pretty good job at what it sets out to do.(and fwiw, i can't think of many football, baseball, hockey or soccer movies that are true to the sport either. c'mon...bull durham?)i'm not a rugby player (i was a wrestler) but i graduated from highland, attended '86-'90, and occasionally trained with the rugby guys. my brother-in-law david, however, was one of the original founding members of the highland rugby club in 1976. (his younger brother, billy, played the next year, as i recall. if you're interested, there's a highland rugby site at highlandrugby.net that addresses the history of the team.) by the time i was there the club had been in existence for about a decade, and had long since built a reputation for excellence. it's a fact that they focused on "broad" training topics: devotion, honor, discipline, effort, not tactics. i thought the rugby guys i knew were a little 'off' in the head, but i think i might have just been a little jealous. they were hard-core dedicated to the belief system that gelwix promoted.with regard to the "cultural mixing" issues that have been brought up, it might be interesting to note that while i was there in the 80's, one of the larger schools in the city was shut down - south high school - and its students distributed among the other 3 primary slc schools. to be honest, highland pre-80's was pretty whitebread...i've got a picture of the team from (i think) 1977 that shows an *all* white club. south high, on the other hand, was a much more racially integrated school before it closed: i had a pair of friends from south who joined the team, one tongan, one samoan, and as i recall there were a bunch of island-nation players that joined up '88-'90. i don't think anyone questioned the credibility of the team in adopting maori (or other cultural) traditions: if there was one thing that was obvious about these guys, it's that they walked the walk. and as to the strength of the team when compared to the best highschool-age teams in the world: yeah, it's true that us-rugby, on average when taken as a whole, does not represent particularly well against the best elsewhere. there are exceptions, but hey - it's a simple fact that rugby doesn't have the prominence or exposure needed to develop the multiple traditions of excellence in the us that arise in other countries.with that said, judge highland on its merits: - the *only* team to qualify for the usa rugby national championships every year of that organizations' 25-yr history.- a win record of 392 wins, 9 losses. read that again...winningest coach in any us sport in history.- regular international tours. - some compelling wins against some legitimate international teams.are they the world best? maybe some years, probably not most...but they're pretty good on a consistent basis. and it's disrespectful to the game to blow them off, when highland rugby may be the best ambassador to the sport in the us.

i think a several of america's baseball movies are among the best movies ever made. when this movie was in production and heard it described as a rugby movie. i'd read about the highland team in the newspapers, but didn't have high expectations for this film about a sport that didn't interest me.last night i viewed it "on-demand" and loved it almost as much as my favorite baseball movies. ryan little and the cast and crew did an amazing job. neil mcdonough was especially convincing. as the "bad dad" he displayed fine range and a subtle, but moving character arc.i also enjoyed the pacific islander actors. i've been fortunate to know many of these fine people and this film captures their wonderful spirit and culture. a flashback showing how the islander culture became such a key element of highland's team would have been a excellent addition to the film.some pretty tacky movies have been shot in utah recently. it's good to see a quality film like this from the beehive state.

i throughly enjoyed this short, even as a toronto maple leafs fan. director sheldon cohen and narrator roch carrier captured all of the boy's emotions perfectly. from the feelings he had for his hero, maurice "rocket" richard, to the excitement, anticipation and hope of getting a new montreal canadiens sweater soon, to the look of horror on his face when he got his sweater from his mother; a toronto maple leafs sweater was priceless and the shame of having to wear this dreadful (in his eyes) blue and white toronto maple leafs sweater; not the rouge, bleu and blanc of the montreal canadiens with richard's number nine, like his old sweater. and worst of all, his mum made him wear this maple leafs sweater out of the house. you could envision and anticipate the ridicule he would get from his friends when he hit the ice wearing that sweater before he got there.i was laughing the whole time and this is one of the best animated shorts i've seen.

i just watched it last night and it was great.i can see why some ppl have ill feelings towards it from a rugby fan and maori culture point of view but other than that i have no idea what's so negative about it. the movie is great. it has a lot of heart. very inspiring and encouraging to all ages. great family movie! they did a pretty good job considering that it was a budget movie. i love movies based on true stories/events. i was raised around rugby all my life, it is a great game but i was never really taken to it because (please forgive me if i offend anyone, nothing personal this is just how i saw it) i thought, their trainings are not as ruthless or hard, the players are not as disciplined and don't seemed as serious like other sportmen and it looked like it's all just muscle and blooming tackling each other etc. but after watching forever strong, i was like, wow! i was proud! it did good things for rugby (well it changed my view of rugby) and also the new zealnd haka. i actually cried. i am not even new zealander and i was proud of their culture. didn't even know what the chant meant until this movie. the movie is not about rugby techniques or rugby, it's not even about new zealand all blacks or the haka or etc......mother of pearls!!!!! hahaha shux!so to all you beautiful negative ppl, you are missing the point! i am sure if they had the means, it would have been better, the haka is in there because that was part of highland rugby culture, tradition or what ever you want to call it. so any new members on this site such as myself, please don't be put off by those negative comments. see it for yourself! must see movie! there is a lot you can learn from this movie, ppl of all ages. it definitely makes you want to be a better person and be humble! this movie reminded me of a lot of things that i already know and was raised with but i kinda lost along the way! loved it! happy reading ppls and all the best!muawha!

nostalgia isn't always the best reason to watch a movie. more often than not, the movies you loved as a kid will disappoint you as an adult. while there are exceptions to this rule, it's hard to justify owning a dvd of krull, regardless of how many insightful the director's commentary may be. but stay sharp gen x/y'ers, because the dozens of disappointments dominating your trip down memory lane, might stop you from stumbling across one worth revisiting.one surprise film worth another look is joel schumacher's flatliners, the supernatural thriller starring 80's popcorn heavyweights keifer sutherland, kevin bacon, julia roberts and billy baldwin. you would think that a stew comprised of this cast, the flamboyant flair of schumacher and the über slick eye of cinematographer jan de bont would result in something sickeningly stodgy, but calories aside... flatliners ain't half bad. even though it's production design is inexplicably over-the-top and the photography is achingly over- stylized (replete with neon soaked streets spewing endless billows of steam), flatliners still manages to be an effectively dark and compelling thriller. if there's an explanation why flatliners was forgotten, it might be because 1990 saw the release of another, far superior, supernatural thriller: jacob's ladder.had flatliners been released a year or two after jacob's ladder, it's likely schumacher's flashy thriller would have been dismissed as a toned down, commercialized rip-off of adrian lyne's nightmarish masterpiece. but with these films being released in the same year, flatliners enjoyed a different fate, tripling jl's take at the box office despite being a watered down version of a similar premise. the passage of time hasn't been as kind to flatliners, it has been lost atop a dated heap of throwaway 80's brat pack dreck, while jl has cemented its reputation as a timeless classic. fates aside, jl is seamlessly terrifying and it manages to keep audiences guessing right up until the last frame, whereas flatliners falls victim to over- simplification and hollywood conveniences that drag down the final act into a predictably tidy denouement. comparisons between the two movies is unfair, and ultimately overlooks flatliners ability to represent the 80's at its quintessential best. released at the end of a decade of shallow excess, flatliners will always be dated by its hairstyles and clothing styles, but in fairness, it should also be remembered as a well executed movie at (or at least near) the top of its particular heap of dreck. for intents and purposes, it's an entertaining walk down memory lane.

i just watch this move recently on encore channel. what a great film, a great cast as well. flatliners is very suspenseful and unpredictable. the movie has a great opening scene by the ocean then to a series of scene establishing the questions about life after death which provide a very strong upfront story involvement. therefore nelson played by kiefer sutherland was the first to go through the test to die and come back to life. then it's gets very dramatic by bringing back his wrong doing from the past to life. then all of the above mentioned characters went through the same experience except for randy steckle played by olliver platt. then the story unfold into a resolution and basic understanding about life and the presence and meaning of god. david labraccio played by kevin bacon an atheist end up questioning his own belief about god. it's amazing to watch julia roberts along with kevin bacon, oliver platt, william baldwin and kiefer sutherland at such a prime time of their careers. one can ask how come we don't have such great movie produced anymore. this is one of the best productions from joel schumacher. i really enjoy this movie.

although flatliners is 15 years old, tonight was my first time ever seeing it. i had heard about the movie flatliners, but there was never a buzz about it to make me go out and rent it or make a point to see it period. well, i caught it on one of the premium channels and i must say that it was very good.this movie was about some brilliant young medical students deciding to explore death. they have figured out a way to cause a person to die briefly and bring him/her back to life. besides the all-star cast, this movie had some serious bite to it. just the very thought of exploring death is riveting enough, but i really thought the writer & director did an excellent job in giving a different yet hair raising view. this was no generic attempt to thrill, frighten, and make one's mind race... this was the real deal.instead of making it an empty, superficial, star-studded thriller, this movie had substance. a nail-biter, white knuckle, edge-of-the-seat, hard nose thriller. i give it an 8/10.

this movie is great from start to finish about a group of med students that get together and literally kill each other by stopping their hearts and then revive themselves. they then research what happens from the "near death" experiences. as each one goes through the experience, they become haunted by their deepest fears that seem to materialize as reality. this ranges from dead kids with hockey sticks to dead fathers that seem to be upstairs.the cast is first rate and oliver platt is hilarious in one of the best roles of his career. i am not a big keifer sutherland fan but even he does an excellent job. this is a movie that i can watch over and over!

a film that reveals the unease of modern men and women in life when confronted to death. we are beyond the simple religious belief in the afterlife, and what's more in any kind of hell or heaven. religion is declared dead. yet human beings are more obsessed than ever by death, especially since we can push it away for quite a long time. what's more the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. that was quite typical of the end of the 20th century. today things are changing, especially when the president of the united states himself, barack obama, in a public speech to journalists speaks of their search for truth and qualifies that truth as being of course relative because it is more a quest than a final end, objective or achievement. the film shows the end of the good old metaphysical thinking that was starting to evolve into a truth obsession, an obsessive conception that truth was unique and irreversibly reachable. post modernism had not reached hollywood yet, though today it seems to have reached the white house. so some young doctors and medical students decide to go into death and come back. technically it is possible but the result is not surprising. it reactivates old guilty feelings and frustrations that had been buried into the unconscious. one has to do with a drug addicted father of a vietnam veteran who commits suicide, another with a young boy who was stoned to death by some others the death tripper included, another still with a young black girl who was victimized and bullied in grade school out of racism, sexism and hatred if not fear in front of her shyness. it is so naïve that you could cry out of shame for these young adults who are highly qualified and behave like babies who are crying for their bottles of edulcorated fruit juice. the film though is interesting but in something quite different. the setting and the shooting and every single detail or treatment of any detail is baroque, morbid, decadent, quite in the style of "death in venice" or greenaway, or some other works of art that deal with making friends with the basic enemy that death is. of course that does not save the film but at least that makes it worth watching.dr jacques coulardeau, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne, university versailles saint quentin en yvelines, cegid

nelson is a medical professor who wants his four students to put him to death and then bring him back to life so that he can prove that there is an afterlife. so they do and soon enough all of the medical students want to know if there is life after death. the afterlife isn't about pearly gates and lights at the end of the tunnel but something more sinister.past ghosts come back to haunt them and surely this movie will haunt anyone. it has some pretty scary moments that could translate into real life and it makes people wonder somewhat about what happens when you die. it's a good movie to see when it's raining and you're feeling down. it's also a little weird.see it with a haunted past.

can't get much eerier than flatliners. this deep, dark film had my heart pumping throughout. the lighting is dark and will get you in the mood for a death defying experience, literally. keifer is in top form as he is today in 24. he's a great actor and he plays a very convincing and shocking role you won't forget for years to come. and what can you say for the rest of the cast? an all-star lineup, julia is hotter than ever, will, oliver, and kevin light up the stage in this thriller that will keep you gripping your seats. it's a refreshing sight to see a true thriller, with top notch professional actors. you won't regret seeing this 2 hour seat bender. -jl

this movie made by the nfbc was made in honor of the montreal canadians dynasty years in the 50's,60's and 70's. my 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986. i have been a canadians fan for 29 of my 30 years of life. on a scale of 1-10, i give this film a 117. all hockey fans should see this as i hope it will be placed in the hockey hall of fame in toronto and shown at the bell centre in montreal or here in edmonton at rexall place. watch this film with your family it is a great movie. i also recommend the book in both french and english. go habs go.

this show is sheer entertainment and doesn't try to be a greek drama. it certainly contains elements of one what with all the plot twists, but it's immensely engaging and fun. las vegas is the perfect setting for a show and they will certainly never have a lack of material to work with! anything and everything does happen there! the actors in this show are extremely personable and you really do want to see what they are up to and into each week. the show is also very funny. the humor arises from the characters and situations. not just thrown in gratuitously. it's a well-crafted show in that regard. it certainly makes me look forward to friday nights and i'm glad i now own the first two seasons on dvd!

i would assume that this film would get rave reviews in canada--particularly in quebec. that's because the canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the montreal canadians were like gods in canada for decades. as an american, the closest thing we have to them are the new york yankees. if you are a fan, then they are the greatest and winningest team in history. if you are not a fan, then they are satan's team!! well, at least that's how it was as i grew up in washington, dc in regard to the dallas cowboys. so i am pretty sure when this film was shown up north that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction--their national sport and the closest thing they have to a national team in the nhl.now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it begins and the main character talks about growing up around ottawa and rooting for the canadians and maurice "the rocket" richard. however, when his mother accidentally buys him a toronto maple leafs jersey and forces him to wear it, i knew right away what a horrible and shameful thing this would be to a little boy. this ability to connect to the character--even though he lives in a far off land is what made this a very special short film. the way the other kids treated him and his conversation with god at the end make this a lovely nostalgic film. very clever and memorable.

i don't usually comment on films or tv shows but had to post a comment about las vegas.naturally here in the uk we are about 2/3rd's through the 3rd season and though i have managed to watch the last series of season 3 ( via other means ) i'm still glued every friday at 9pm.from the very first episode of season 1 i have been a big big fan of this show and own all 3 seasons on dvd, yes i cannot wait for season 4 to start in october.so why do i love this show so much, well i have to agree with the last poster.... james caan, i know one person cannot make a team but big ed deline was made for caan or maybe it was the other way around, i read that the producers were considering martin sheen for ed deline.... do'h no way!!! i also agree that caan's character is getting very soft, i also preferred the tough take no sh*t big bad eddy d that we saw in season 1 & 2, he seems to have mellowed out.as i said no one person makes the team by themselves's and of course the other cast members josh duhamel/danny, james lesure/mike, vanessa marcil/sam, nikki cox/mary, molly sims/delinda all contribute well, even outside cast members such as cheryl ladd as jillian deline, harry groener as gunther, dean caine as casey, mitchell longley as mitch who may feature 6 or 7 times during a season can fit in just as well as if they've been in every single episode from day one.this show has everything, drama, action, suspense, laughs, romance, glitz's, glamour and big time celebrity's who often play themselves's.many may disagree but this is one of the best shows on digital tv and i hope it may long continue after season 4.

i adored this, but i am an 80's kid. i loved rainbow bright my whole childhood. i don't know if little ones these days would be very interested in the show, mine wasn't. (but thats okay, i bought it for me anyway. i just brought the little one so the guy at the checkout stand wouldn't look at me funny.)i love the non violent drama, and the colorful scenery. it just reminds me of a simpler time before cartoons had more violence than our local news can legally show. :) although i may be just a little biased on the subject. afterall i was rainbow bright 6 years in a row for halloween........i wonder if they make a rainbow bright costume for adults. lol.

when i was a child this was the movie i watched. i think it is a great movie for the kids to watch and parents don't have to be afraid of any violence or obscene images. rainbow brite is a cheerful young girl and she is trying to make the winter go away. she finds that something or someone is trying to steal the source of life and keep it for themselves. i love this movie and i think that even adults can enjoy this movie.

i first saw this movie when i was very little. i was born in 1985, so it was around the age when 80s cartoons were big. my mother taped it one day thinking i might like it. i had never even heard of the rainbow bright tv show before i was introduced to the movie. when i saw it (on one of those old beta tapes...) i loved it. i became addicted to it. there are people who say it's badly written and all that, but it's a kid's movie, and things like that don't matter much to children. i loved the story, and especially liked the songs and all the female characters. of course i pretended to be them, and in the scene where rainbow first met krys and they were repulsed they had to work with the opposite sex, i could totally relate. the story was the basic good vs. evil that children enjoy, and there were enough happy moments to balance out the scary ones. the world is a fantastic place that would stimulate the imagination of any young child. i am very glad i had an opportunity to see this movie when i was little. it made a big impact, and watching it now brings back happy memories of childhood. i would recommend to any parent with young children to rent this movie. it will trigger their imagination and provide plenty of entertainment. you're only a child once, so don't let them miss out on this one!

after watching "a texas tale of treason" you feel a renewed disgust for the nature of the hollywood beast. inside the interviews and conversations of all involved with the project there is a common sense of comradery and rebelliousness that spans backgrounds, social classifications, and even geography. this can be attributed to hard work on the entire production's undying commitment to the project and the love the of the story from the original film, and the complete creation of vacuum that is it's creator. the scale of people involved in "waldo's hawaiian holiday" was amazing to me, at a no budget, no glory production. there were no trailers or craft services, no amenities at all, and yet everyone involved stuck right there with it. if nothing ever comes of this project, antstuie productions have laid their foundation for being a serious, honest company that's never going to lay down and take it or sell out and make a movie just for the money. i'd like to see any l.a. director go through the guerrilla process to get a shot. more realistic true to life cinema is lacking in this time of cg and green screens. the masses may enjoy their entertainment spoon fed to them in nice bite sized censored calm bits, but there is a large group of people out here in the world that share the opinions and insights of the filmmakers that still make films for the love of the material or love of storytelling, not dvd sales or box office. i loved this documentary, and i hope that ifc has the cahones to pick it up and air it so that maybe, just maybe, one more person will decide to pick up a camera and film some real life so we the viewer can have even a temporary understanding that everyone everywhere is the same, and anyone anywhere can be a true storyteller.

this film would be particularly fun for anyone who has been in the film industry, especially in any indie capacity... those whose inheritance includes a film introduction may not appreciate it quite as much. i am hard to please in the documentary category. this doc is different though- its pleasure comes from an earthy realism of indie filmmaker punks who are a hoot to be around and watch. whether you've ever wondered what it is like to be in films, in front of or behind the camera, or whether you have worked your way through the sometimes painful and hard but rewarding indie world, you'll certainly get a kick out of this film.

watch this movie. it's truly a good ride through the difficulties of making a indie movie, and what happens when it blows up in the film maker's face. there's a lot of stuff about punk rock, and the philosophy behind that movement and it's relationship to this project. so if you're into old punk, american punk, you'll dig it.... but, beware, there's a ton of bad acting bits from the failed project that are incorporated... yet they do come off funny at times. and, actually, some of the best parts are listening to people who have never been involved in movie making pontificate and what they went through in the three year period that it took to put this together. so anyone out there that's about to make a film, especially if you haven't been to film school or worked in the field, you should watch this and learn from the film maker's mistakes.

after seeing a texas tale of treason, the measly correspondence efforts by cox could not even afford the massive collusion stu directed with no budget. it tells a story about dedication, sweat, whiz, fire and punk rock. i love it! my favorite parts are the interviews with marci (she's such a hot baby babe and she digs me but she just doesn't know it yet). the japanese clerk muffing his lines, that cracked me up. the sex scene was really cool. i am going to see if stu will come over sometime and do the box light wave thing when i'm doing it with my woman. the intro and of course my 5 seconds during closing credits. i know thats going to get me some chicks. i hope to see more from antstuie because i know i can expect the unexpected.

i too must apologize for a somewhat biased opinion of this endeavor as i contributed to the soundtrack. still i received my copy, sat back and enjoyed the rolling cast of characters who were perhaps more colorful than the characters they were creating in this tale of a film sequel shanghai. for those who feel george bush is a "credible texan", one need look no further than this film to shatter the image that texas is full of truck driving, one-dimensional rednecks. the cast contains some of the most intelligent, peculiar and humorous folks you'll find anywhere as they spin their tales of agony, bliss and disappointment in going for a great film sequel, no budget, guerilla style (i.e. "punk rock style" as each person helps define).this is a great documentary made with passion and guts and all the venom you'll need to break through to the other side of whatever industry b.s. and doublespeak you're dealing with (take note authors, painters, musicians and fellow filmmakers). it hearkens back to the credibility of the first wave of american hardcore music when the term "d.i.y." was the standard, a period where courage, passion and commitment mattered way more than technique, style or precious calculations. not that there isn't plenty of technique or style to this...the tone of the documentary is quite refreshing. the editing cuts provide as much drama as the dialog therein.the idea of creating a documentary out of the sad demise of the cast, crew and director's initial intent is brilliant, totally texas and absolutely punk rock. in the truest sense of the term.

everyone who has ever wondered how to make a film on no budget should see this documentary. the determination of everybody portrayed in this project was very moving to me, and should connect to those of us who have ever ventured into any part of show business, be it film, music, or writing. i think the film makers could have done a better job with foreshadowing the events that led up to this film becoming a documentary, perhaps by use of a narrator; other than that, the film comes off as a real example of how show business isn't about "the show", but rather "the business".i hope that the actual intended project, "repo man ii", gets to see the light of day. i think the film makers did a fine job on it with what little they had to work with, and all that they had to overcome to complete it.

i viewed this movie at the magnolia theater in dallas a couple of days ago. punk! everyone and everything involved in the movie added to the punkiness of it. the music, well of course. but the movie itself captured the whole punk genre. even a grandmother and school teacher (me) can appreciate artists who are able to turn their ideas into reality (well, reality, film-wise). this movie takes a handful of ticked-off young film makers and clearly and cleverly shows the "why" of their angst over not being given the green light on finishing the waldo film. the (relatively) happy girl gave good comic relief, a nice respite from the continual (but understandable) ragging on the dude who left them in a lurch. gotta love stu, though. and be sure to watch/read the credits - they're the icing on the cake!

fascinating look behind the scenes about how a really good movie can get made if the producers, director, & cast simply "refuse to quit." these guys encountered serious obstacles throughout the two years of the project (miniscule budget, trouble with the script and with the script writer) so the finished product wasn't what was first envisioned, but probably turned out to be more interesting than the movie they set out to make, which goes to show that the punk mentality of "just do it" ...with or without any backing, money, or help...figure it out on the fly and do what you want to do. i really liked this documentary movie and know that viewers will see and learn things they didn't know before. this movie is truly "one of a kind...it's hard to classify because it has pieces of "sci fi" and "suspense" and also "how to make a movie." it tells the truth about how films get made, what can go wrong, and how to overcome. i especially liked the music written by ed ivey. these guys know how to produce a good movie on a shoe string because they're creative and know how to build props, dollys, staging, lighting with what they can scavenge up...pretty amazing stuff.

i don't particularly care from michael jackson. aside from being a pedophile, i really do not like his music, with the exceptions of a few songs from his landmark album, thriller. this is one of them. i do like this video because it is one of the first and most important music videos ever made.this was directed by john landis, best known to horror fans as the director of an american werewolf in london. this music video is not so much a music video but more or less, a short horror film. m.j. and his date are at a werewolf movie. when they leave the movie, they are attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty zombies, when michael jackson does his famous "thriller" dance.you know, this actually is a pretty good song with good synthesized beats. this and "beat it" are probably the only two michael jackson songs i can tolerate over and over. i especially love vincent price's cameo as the narrator. his distinctive voice is perfect for a horror-themed music video. even if you don't like m.j.'s music, you need to see this video at least once. by the way, he was good before becoming a creepy white woman with a fake nose.

some people don't like led zeppelin, but luckily the number of people who versus the number of people who don't is way unbalanced. i am the proud converter of 2 or 3 led zeppelin fans and the only reason i was able to do this is because of this dvd.for one, how someone can listen to "stairway to heaven" or "immigrant song" without falling in love with zeppelin is beyond me, but to play the guitar and not like page... that is like being christian and not liking jesus. my friend was like "led zeppelin sucks!" and i was like, "oh yeah, watch this!" after about 2 mins of watching page pick through "white summer/black mountain side" he was glued to the screen and has never said a bad thing about zeppelin since.incase you haven't been following the running metaphor i am calling this dvd the bible of led zeppelin. held high by the followers and used as a converter for the unwashed heathens.course there are some things missing like "over the hills and far away," a good version of "immigrant song" and i really didn't need 2 version of "whole lotta love," but what the hell, i'll take 'em.because there is nothing besides "the song remains the same" to compare this too i gave it a 10 and even if there were more to compare it too i still would have given it a 10.

i just re-watched a few episodes of this series on very poor vhs tapes that i recorded the series on. i'm glad i did, though.ramona is based on the children's books by beverly cleary and follows the adventures of the title eight-year-old (sarah polley). she has fun with friends and family and gets into trouble much like many eight-year-olds. all ten episodes are pretty good. "mystery meal" kind of grosses me out as a vegan, but it's funny seeing the parents trying to get their kids to eat cow's tongue! and any episode that mentions godzilla versus the smog monster twice can't be all bad. i like "ramona's bad day" even more. although it's disheartening to see ramona going through a rough day, she does imagine herself getting revenge on her friend howie's uncle (a pre-psi factor barclay hope), who always teases her. "the perfect day" is also good.lori chodos plays beezus, ramona's sister. i swear i've seen her on something else, but imdb doesn't list anything besides this show. unfortunately, this series is not on dvd. why is every crappy show made these days on dvd except something i'd actually like to buy? an injustice if there ever was one!

"don't change your husband" is another soap opera comedy from producer/director cecil b. de mille. it is notable as the first of several films he made starring gloria swanson. i guess you could also call it a sequel of sorts to his "old wives for new" (1918).james (elliot dexter) and leila (swanson) porter are a forty-ish couple where james has gone to seed and become slovenly and lazy. he has a penchant for smelly cigars and eating raw onions. he takes his wife for granted. leila tries to get him to straighten out to no avail.one night at a dinner party at the porters, leila meets the dashing schyler van sutphen (now there's a moniker), the playboy nephew of socialite mrs. huckney (sylvia ashton). she invites leila to her home for the weekend to make james "miss her". once there schyler begins to put the moves on her, promising her pleasure, wealth and love, if she will leave her husband and go with him. the sequences involving leila's imagining this promised new life are lavishly staged and forecast de mille's epic costume drams later in his career.leila, bored with her marriage and her disinterested husband, divorces james and marries the playboy. james ultimately realizes that he has lost the only thing that mattered to him and begins to mend his ways. he shaves off his mustache, works out, shuns onions and re-acquires some manners.meanwhile, all is not rosy with leila's new marriage. schyler it seems likes to gamble and has taken up with the gold digging nanette (aka tootsie, or some such name) (julia faye). schyler loses all of his money and steals leila's diamond ring to cover his losses.one fateful day, leila meets the "new" james and is taken by the changes in him. james drives her home and becomes aware of her situation and.................................................this film marked the beginning of gloria swanson's rise to super stardom in a career that would rival that of mary pickford. barely 20 years of age, she had begun her career in mack sennett two reel comedies as a teen ager. elliot dexter was almost 50 at this time but he and swanson make a good team, although it's hard to imagine anyone tiring of the lovely miss swanson as is the case in this film.dexter and sylvia ashton had appeared in the similar "old wives for new" where the wife had gone to seed and the husband was wronged.also in the cast are de mille regulars theodore roberts as a bishop and raymond hatton as a gambler.

i loved this film. it manages to make the characters sympathetic (well, most of them) concerning the problems they have with their relationship.gloria swanson, as leila, is in a dusty marriage with a husband who barely notices her presence (though he does notice her absence). the film shows very well why she is tired of married life, and why she is susceptible to a sweet-talking con man, without making her selfish or demanding. the reaction shots of leila at the dinner table on her anniversary, while her workaholic husband (late to dinner again) eats salted scallions with gusto and pushes bride-and-groom dolls out of the way of his plate, are perfect.the show is stolen - and stolen effortlessly - by elliott dexter as jim, leila's neglectful husband. after losing leila to another man, jim literally cleans up his act, shaving off his mustache, working out to lose the middle-aged spread, and dressing neatly. there are several shots of jim at home, lonely and thinking of leila, including a powerful scene when he finds one of her old dresses in the closet. the film gives the audience the advantage of watching jim's transformation along with leila. it isn't just the exterior that's more attractive; we come to know much more about the kind of person jim really is, and we see how completely different he is from leila's second husband, schuyler (lew cody). dexter shines as the before-and-after jim, who is determined, after discovering schuyler's true character, to win leila back, if he can. the film's most touching moment comes when jim and leila discover that they are standing under the mistletoe, and jim talks of what he has lost.definitely worth watching.

i thought this movie was really good. it ends up showing the viewers in the end that leila should of kept what she had. leila was sick of her husband jim, who was more worried about work then her. he was so into his work that he forgot their anniversary. he was also very sloppy. she couldn't take it anymore so she left to see if he would miss her. the movie shows that he misses her, he even tries to make up for the night he messed up. he goes to her and tries to bring her home. she ends up finding another man named schuyler. he seemed like the man she always wanted neat and notices her. in the end she sorta foreshadows by when she look at schuylers shoes and the way he let his cigar ashes fall on the floor the way jim did the same kinda thing. jim ends off making lots of money and cleaning himself up. leila thinks in the end that she should of kept her husband because thats all she really wanted and he did changing.

i found this movie to be filled with irony. but watching the movie you can almost for see what will happen. leila is a confused, bored house wife, who is constantly looking for happiness. when she thinks she finds true happiness, she clings onto it, leaving behind all that she knew. but she finds her self almost comparing notes between her ex and her current husband. she learned that if she only had communicated more about what had bothered her in her previous marriage, that it could have been salvaged a lot easier that she intended it to be. she realizes that words are nothing with out action, but she learns that too far into her second marriage and finds herself looking back and hoping for change once again. the main conflict in this movie, is leila vs herself. you can not have true happiness with out yourself being truly happy. i liked this movie, but i would only recommend this movie to women, i can't see a man truly finding enjoyment in this movie.

gloria swanson (as leila porter) is an understandably bored wife. workaholic husband elliott dexter (as james denby porter) has "lost his romance" along with his waistline; he also smokes cigars in bed, eats onions, and snores. he can barely remember his own anniversary - which is attended by caddish lew cody (as schuyler van sutphen); the younger man eyes ms. swanson's voluptuous figure, and flirts unabashedly. soon, swanson is drawn to mr. cody. then, mr. dexter decides to try and get her back. who will win? the three principals are fine, with swanson most impressive in the pivotal role as the woman torn. julia faye grabs supporting honors as cody's other interest, "toodles"; off-screen, she tempted director cecil b. demille. the demille touch is evident; especially in an imaginary sequence wherein cody promises swanson... "pleasure wealth love" ******* don't change your husband (1/26/19) cecil b. demille ~ gloria swanson, elliott dexter, lew cody

don't change your husband is, on the one hand, the beginning of a series of lightweight marital comedies from cecil b. demille. on the other it is his first picture to star gloria swanson, probably the greatest actress of the silent era, and is the film which made her a star.although the old demille formula was beginning to change, and his films were becoming wordier and less purely visual, with such an expressive performer as swanson we regain much of that silent storytelling style. her character does very little, but conveys volumes through subtle gesture and facial expression  with a particular talent for looks of disdain. in real life swanson was herself coming towards the end of her disastrous marriage to wallace beery, and it's possible that this fact fuelled her convincing performance.as if to best complement his leading lady's talents, demille's use of framing and close-ups is particularly strong here. he uses cinematic technique to show off the acting  often holding swanson in lengthy close-ups at key moments  and also to clarify the story visually. for example, when we are introduced to the character of toodles, she is shown reflected three times in a dressing table mirror. her character disappears from the story, only to become important towards the end. that attention-grabbing first shot of her helps us remember who she was. later, at the anniversary dinner, swanson and future husband number two lew cody are framed together in one shot, while elliot dexter is isolated in his own frame. also  and this is a sign of the increasing sophistication of cinema in general  there is much use of reaction shots  for example the disapproving glance of the bishop when cody acts out his intentions with the wedding figure dolls.in contrast to demille's visual narrative method was the increasingly verbose screen writing of his collaborator jeanie macpherson. as i've remarked in several other comments, macpherson could put together a strong and dramatic story, but like demille she tended to state her themes in a somewhat pretentious and flamboyant style. and so we get these very long quasi-philosophical title cards about the pitfalls of married life which, if they improve the story at all, it is only because they are unintentionally funny. for example, only jeanie macpherson could come up with a line like "fate sometimes lurks in christmas shopping". fortunately though in this picture these titles mostly introduce scenes rather than break them up.although the pictures he made around this time tended to be small scale, it is at this point that demille seemed to develop his taste for the spectacular. you can see him start to sneak in excuses for a bit of razzmatazz like the little fantasy scenes of swanson being showered with "pleasure, wealth and love". it wouldn't be until the early twenties after the unofficial embargo on historical pictures was lifted that he would get the chance to go all out with the grand spectacle.all in all, don't change your husband is a fairly decent demille silent picture, although to be honest it is only really the presence gloria swanson that lifts it above the average. it's curious though that this is supposedly a comedy, and swanson was cast at least in part because of her background at mack sennett's slapstick factory. she hated comedy acting, and here gives a dramatic rather than a comic performance. it makes sense then that the only straight drama she did with demille, male and female, was by far the strongest of their collaborations.

no more corned beef and cabbage for her!this little romantic comedy clips along from scene to scene with a few exotic twists (some imaginary scenes and a costume party). all of this is centered around the wife of the husband(s) who is looking to break out of the doldrums, played by gloria swanson (she is twenty here!). both the leading men have a natural air that is convincing and of course swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods, from frivolous to worried to hopeful. behind all the games and apparent lightheartedness is that old serious problem of staying in love and not straying in love. there's a little corniness, but director demille is on top of keeping it snappy and believable in all. as with many films from this period, the subtitles do not just tell what they are saying (or thinking) but often give a kind of philosophical insight, as if to justify the tragedy (or raciness). and there is that higher purpose here, probably better without the instructional text, but it's part of the narrative style, and it's kind of quaint. if you are looking for visual or formal amazement, you won't find it here. but as a story, well acted, and filmed with precision and economy, it's really a great example. the events might not come as a total surprise, but it's such a modern love story, set almost a hundred years ago, it's a gas. and did i saw swanson was perfect?

cecil b. demille directed a series of domestic comedy-dramas in the late teens and early 20s. he found his perfect leading lady for these provocative pieces in gloria swanson. in don't change your husband, swanson plays a bored housewife whose wealthy businessman husband (elliott dexter) pays more attention to work than to her. she is chased by a handsome roue (lew cody) until she relents and divorces the boring husband for the new lover.things soon become familiar and swanson discovers the new husband is as neglectful as the first. to make matters worse she discovers cody has a woman on the side (julia faye). after several confrontations and convenient meetings, things are resolved.this was a smash hit in 1919 and helped make gloria swanson a major star. although she was only 20 when she filmed this she is very good as the maybe foolish wife. she looks great and wears some stunning gowns.there is one memorable scene that is 100% demille in which cody is luring swanson with promises of wealth, pleasure, and love. as he coos to her she imagines the scenes. pleasure is a fantastic scene of swanson in a spidery hammock swinging out over a pool while people dance around. wealth is a scene in which swanson is gowned like a babylonian queen as servants bring her chests of jewels, which shes tosses aside. love is a scene in which she is a wood nymph making love in a forest glade with a pan-like character (ted shawn). pure hokum but very entertaining, and swanson looks great.dexter is very good as the bland husband who shaves off his moustache and starts to work out in order to win his wife back. cody is also good as the fake charmer who is a liar and cheat. faye is funny as the bitchy other woman--named toodles no less--who gets hers. sylvia ashton plays mrs. huckney. ted shawn was married to ruth st. denis and together they were groundbreaking and influential modern dancers (of the denishawn school).swanson impresses me more every time i see her. she seems to have been such a natural actress and yet there is a way that the camera captures her expressive face that is just mesmerizing. she's a joy to watch.very entertaining film with lots of color tints in varying scenes to keep things lively. and a lot of the furnishings are back in style 86 years later.

the book "the railway children" is a children's book published in 1906 by edith nesbit, an early british socialist who had very strong views about the importance of family values for the upbringing of children, and the story it told was presumably intended to be contemporary. somewhat surprisingly, it seems to retain a significant appeal for today's children a hundred years later.a film adaptation of an edwardian classic children's story with the principal roles those of the children, does not sound very exciting to most film-goers in this day and age. but a really great performance by jenny agutter who (near the start of her long and distinguished acting career) played the part of the oldest girl roberta (bobby), combined with remarkable work by the script-writer and director lionel jeffries and outstanding photography by arthur ibbetson, have made this a film that is still not to be missed, and one which most of its viewers find quite memorable. it is remarkable that this book, set in the year 1905, was filmed five times between 1951 and 2000, (four of them by the bbc for british television), and all of these versions are not only still greatly admired but also very highly regarded (something that user comments on this database will confirm), even though this may seem almost inconceivable for a nostalgic period story designed to appeal primarily to children. since i have not seen the four bbc tv versions, these comments relate exclusively to the 1970 film version produced for showing in cinemas. unlike most films of children's books, 'the railway children' may appeal more to adults than to children. the structure of family life has changed so much in the last century that many children may feel totally lost by the way in which it is depicted in the film, whereas many older adults may find it has a considerable nostalgic appeal. perhaps compensating for this, the children featured in the film are full of life and vitality, whilst the adult characters although well rounded tend to mostly be 'stuffed shirts'. the story is a mature one, which deals with love, support and encouragement, it is not only timeless but capable of appealing to all ages. it can fairly be described as sentimental and more than a little idealised, but it is never in any way mawkish, and that rarely justified adjective 'uplifting' fits it like a glove.spoiler ahead.the film starts with its upper middle class edwardian family celebrating christmas in a comfortable and fairly spacious london home when two unexpected visitors call and take father (who is a senior government officer) away with them. mother has to move to a very small cottage alongside the railway in a remote part of yorkshire and the children gradually build a new life mainly associated with the railway and the few trains that pass. this life proves quite eventful in small ways and the elder daughter bobby grows up rapidly as she takes over more responsibilities from her mother. at one point she averts an accident to the train when her sharp eyes spot that a landslide has created a natural hazard. father's story is never given much emphasis, but he is never forgotten and it gradually becomes apparent that he is incarcerated and suspected of treason. finally these suspicions are cleared up (we are not told how or why) and he reappears unexpectedly at the local station to rejoin his family.for many years this film was not available in any home video format in north america, but anchor bay created a dvd from it three years ago, so they clearly recognised that this quite simple film has not yet lost its appeal. for anyone who has not got one already, i would very strongly recommend rushing out to buy a copy of this dvd whilst it is still available - you would be most unlikely to be disappointed unless you have become totally cynical, or your minimum requirements for a film include buckets of blood and/or intense sex scenes.

perhaps once in a generation a film comes along that is perfection. for me, "the railway children" is that film - a timeless classic that was directed and performed most beautifully. it depicts all that is worthwhile in humanity and climaxes in the conquest of love and faith over cruel injustice. every performance is a gem, though bobbie stands out and, like judy garland as dorothy before her, jenny agutter makes it impossible for us to imagine anyone else in the role.the world is all the better for this film and the children of today would be much the better for watching it.of course, like so many young men of my generation, i fell hopelessly in love with jenny agutter and her hold was as strong when i had the great good fortune to meet her a few days ago - the bewitching smile and voice like dripping honey were still there to send me weak at the knees as they first did all those years ago!

...apparently bernard cribbins ad libbed nearly all of his lines. if you can sit through the 'daddy! oh my daddy" bit without blubbing then you really need to get in touch with your inner child (trust me. i'm a 41 year old bloke).

this is a film that i love above all others. i try to revisit the main film locations in oakworth and oxenhope whenever i can, which help to re-establish those magical qualities that this film seems to embody so uniquely - recalling a gentler and more mannered age, with its unspoken assertions that people really do matter, that family life is not just another disposable, and that life really is worth living (though sometimes, we may doubt that). in short, a film that soon brings tears to my eyes, helped perhaps by the deeply evocative music - some tunes are jaunty (like the perks' tune, played on a trombone, sometimes with spoons), the stirring melody when the family first set off for yorkshire not knowing what lies ahead, and the haunting little tune played on a solo clarinet (or is it an oboe?) that precedes sudden child-felt changes in fortune.this is as much a film for adults as for children, appealing to the eternal child in us all - a key that effortlessly reactivates those deep and apparently long-lost values and feelings buried inside us, which are normally swept aside by the demands of modern everyday life. this is a film about basic human goodness and decency in which we the viewers are left to make of it what we will, and there are welcome touches of humour sometimes added for good measure, such as the arrival of the aunt or, on a more earthy level, the bedroom scene on perks' birthday - "all right bert - as it's your birthday!" i must know every scene, every line of this film, and yet so great is the magic that each time i watch, it is like i am opening a box of delights for the first time, savouring each moment - sometimes humorous, sometimes....well, very different. as peter says in the film: "it's perfect - more perfect than you know". and so it is!!!

the railway children is perhaps my favorite film of all time simply for the brilliant acting of the cast,the warm,humane interaction of the 3 children and the people they encounter living near the railway in the beautiful english countryside. jenny augutter is especially believable in her role as 'bobbie' the older sibling of her sister phyllis and brother peter.the adventures they discover and relationships formed in their new home and surrounding area are very real and fascinating.the scenery is lovely,the trains a part of britain's vast history and the soundtrack is very moving. this heartwarming film never fails to bring tears to my eyes,each and every time as well as makes me homesick.i often wonder if i should have been born in that era as i think i would have fitted in just fine as people treated each other with such chivalry and decency.in short i consider this film somewhat of a masterpiece and a must see for anyone who considers themselves a 'sensitive or caring type'.edith nesbit wrote this story around the beginning of the 1900's and what a wonderful story it is.more kids today need to read this or see the film instead of playing violent video games.if we had more films of this nature ,the world would become a better place.

this almost perfect cinematic rendition of edith nesbit's popular children's novel follows the lives of roberta (bobbie), phyllis, and peter, and their mother, after their father is unfairly accused of treason and sent to prison. they go to live in an almost uninhabitable house in the country which stands near a railway line  mum writes stories to make enough money for food and candles, while the children spend much of their time around the railway station and, specifically, waving to one particular train to 'send their love to father'.always an involving and clever novel, the characters are here brought to life under the perceptive direction of lionel jeffries (better known as a fine character actor). jenny agutter plays bobbie, while sally thomsett and gary warren are her sister and brother. their mother is dinah sheridan, while the other memorable characters are played by bernard cribbins (perks the railway-man) and william mervyn (the old gentleman on the train).'the railway children' is gentle entertainment from another age, but does its job beautifully. as we watch bobbie grow up with the worries of an absent parent jostling against her own needs both to be alone and to have fun, we can only rejoice when events come together at the close of the picture. throughout we have a sense of time and place  be it from the steam trains, the university paper chase, or the red flannelette petticoats worn by the girls (and used to avert disaster!).

this wonderful film has never failed to move me. the colour, convincing cast, and stunning scenery all make big contributions. this production, unlike the later remake by carlton, is more impressionistic, and presented more from the children's own perspective. it focusses on certain episodes from e. nesbit's charming story rather than trying to make a somewhat more documentary "warts-and-all" style that carlton adopts. above all, the superb musical score of the late johnny douglas underpins the story throughout, adding extra emotional depth. the net result is a truly formidable combination of sensory experiences that cumulatively present the poignant story of "the railway children".one uncomfortable factor for the viewer to ponder throughout this film is how things have changed since those times - and in many ways, for the worse! yes, maybe many of us no longer have to use outside toilets and travel in horse-drawn carts, but what about the quality of life in general? consider the foul-mouthed celebrities who now "grace" our tv screens. their language is now apparently considered perfectly acceptable. consider, too, the fragile "here today, gone tomorrow" aspects of so many of today's "partnerships" plus all the single mothers - whatever happened to that institution called "marriage", when people accepted each others' flaws but still remained together, loving their children? these details add extra piquancy when watching this marvellous film.i hope that, as generations pass, children will still be able to enjoy this film. not to mention certain adults!

i avoided this film as a boy because i thought it would be boringno fights or shooting, cops, robbers, cowboys or indians. it was definitely not a cool film to like. so i didn't see trc until i was in my twenties and found it one of the most beautiful, captivating films i have seen. all the actors deliver the characterisations perfectly and each emotion is drawn from the viewer scene by scene. the filming and direction are deceptively simple but feel so natural and drew me completely into the story. my two favourite scenes are bobbie's birthday party and the scene on the station platform near the end, directed and edited to perfection. the quality and phrasing of jenny agutter's voice when she calls: 'daddy! my daddy!' wrenches emotion from the viewer. tears are welling in my eyes as i think of it.this adaptation isn't just a movie it is a piece of precious art, as well as being the perfect example of what all film makers should be striving to achievecreation of an emotional experience.

this covers just about every area of the creative process, and goes through the three stages chronologically, with the main focus squarely placed on the production. there are documentaries that go into more detail, and cover the other two groups better. this consists of artwork, behind-the-scenes footage, clips of the movie, and many interviews. with a running time that comes in at just over two hours the audience is entitled to a lot of information, given that this is nearly the same length that the film itself is. it could be argued that a lot of the time is spent on the people, with the craft and the result of their collaborative efforts coming in second. this is well-done, with tight editing. it gets into the technology some, and reveals how certain effects were achieved. this spends a lot of time on the physical training, in preparation for the fighting and such. you do get nice candid shots of the people, crew and actors alike. the ultimate matrix 10-disc set of this also holds nearly three hours of music, in a simple system, with individual track selection and a play all function, about 38 minutes worth of bts material in addition to the title itself, in various featurettes. the original release, however, has several very brief extras, including clips of the making of the sequels, a preview of the animatrix and yuen wo ping's blocking tapes(a complete run-through of a couple of the biggest martial arts sequences, with stunt performers and almost the exact cinematography, with the same shots and angles of those bits in the finished silver screen effort). the language is quite strong, but rather infrequent, nearly non-existent. i recommend either version of this to anyone who enjoys the concept, and/or wants to know about how they put the first one together. 7/10

long trailer? whoever said that has got to be joking. this has got to be one of the most in depth behind the scenes or making of documentary ever made. how can it be a trailer when several minutes are spent telling the audience how the movie was conceptualized and then brought to the studios? this documentary also spends lots and lots of time detailing how stunts were done and the new technologies created to achieve them. then it shows us how woo ping's team came up with the fight scenes along with blocking tapes that pretty much put to shame the actual scenes with the actors. there is stuff mentioned about matrix reloaded, but there's hardly anything really. if you are a real fan of the matrix, you have to see this documentary. the original documentary in the dvd is good, but incomplete compared to this one. for instance, it never explained why keanu wore a neck brace in the original documentary, but that is explained in revisited. the revisited dvd also shows carrie ann moss spraining her ankle during the lobby scene and being really distraught because she feels like she's letting the crew down. and that's just the tip of the iceberg. so ignore that "just a long trailer" review and go check it out for yourself. you won't regret it. casual matrix fans need not apply...

i am salivating for the sequels. i needed something to keep me from going insane with tension, anxiety (what if it isn't as good?!), and constant lack of information. i needed something to calm me a little, something to pass the time, other than, of course, the matrix. this was just the thing. i found it informative (like the part about keanu's neck...) and some of it was funny. i pitied carrie-anne soooo much when she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys. i found only one problem with it. given that 95% of the people there were as a matter of fact male, they just kinda let their mouths run wild, and there was language in it. it's not near as bad as the shawshank redemption's cussing runs, but that one scene were keanu is describing a bad day, plug your ears if you are little. >it was entertaining and was just what i needed. it is what all matrix fans who are going nuts need to keep them quiet. they mention a tiny bit about the sequels, and someone almost gives something away, but he catches himself in time (shoot!). it gives you almost no spoilers, but it is great to have if you are a matrix head like me. there is no spoon.

"best in show" is certainly christopher guest's funniest and deepest movie yet. the characters are excellently portrayed and the connection of pet to owner adds a new level of comedy to the movie. i've been a fan of guest since spinal tap but in this movie he has truly achieved what he set out to do in the "mock-umentary," a genre he invented and has now perfected.

in this offering, one only has to view the current westminster kennel club's annual offering to see the parallels. outrageously funny and captures the true essence of the competition. one can only imagine the wit of the producers and the amazing ability of the performers. i too would have nominated this movie for a globe award and feel it is one of the funniest i have ever seen.

in an earlier comment i mentioned how much i enjoyed this film - better second time around. i don't resile from that opinion. strangely, i can't find anyone else who did like it. my mother was going to see it but several friends told her "no way". my sister and her family saw it and half the theatre walked out part-way through. my wife's suggestion is that australians see the characters as just normal, everyday americans and therefore it's not funny. but, hey, most americans think all australians are like crocodile dundee, so it's nice to have the boot on the other foot for a change.

this is one of the funniest movies i've seen in ages. i watched for about 20 minutes, slightly puzzled by what was going on. then i started to laugh and didn't stop 'til long after the movie ended. such deadpan satire is rare indeed. christopher guest has a true eye for the humor inherent in those who have no sense of humor about themselves (about 90% of white heterosexual males, to start with). as in "waiting for guffman" guest nails middle america's idiotic self-importance to the wall. i can hardly wait for his next film.

this flick was even better then 'waiting for guffman'. the great strength in these two films lie in the brilliant character acting by guest and levy's little second-second city troupe. if one finds this movie boring or pointless, god help 'em, they just didn't get it. it is a mockumentary, something at which guest and levy have a genius for. at the end of the movie where guest's southern down home dog lover tells us that to relax after the show, he went to israel to work on a 'caboose', or when he tells us that ventriloquism is an ancient art and we see a hieroglyphicof an ancient egyptian holding a tiny ancient egyptian in it's hand, i realized it is moments like this that make life worth living. thank you mr.guest and mr.levy, and god bless you.

the first time you watch this movie you may hate it, but the 2nd time you see this movie i guarantee laughs all around. the owners of the dogs are so ecclectic that you can't help but look at them and laugh. from the littlest toy poodle to the announcer, everything will make you laugh. and you may learn every single nut there is!

i recently saw this movie for the first time. i enjoyed it so much that i went right out and bought the dvd. this movie is pure genius and only gets funnier with each viewing. anyone can write jokes or funny dialog and have actors memorize them, but the basis of this movie is improve!! how do they do it? thank you, christopher guest!

"best in show" tracks the stories of a handful of human contestants as they prepare for one of the biggest dog shows in the calendar. any amateur psychologist would say that an unconditional love and obsession with a pet is a sign of something missing in someone's life, and each of the characters in some way fills this cliche. there's the former high school hottie who's now married to a geeky man, the childless, label-obsessed yuppie couple, the solitary outdoorsman, the young wife of a wealthy old codger (along with her short-haired dog trainer), and the gay couple.what makes this film so funny though is the way it portray's these stereotypes in a completely believable way - almost affectionate, in many cases. every ridiculous thing one of the characters does or says - with their dog as an innocent onlooker - seems like the kind of behaviour you'd totally expect to see at a dog show.the biggest laughs come from the commentary team of an all-american style sports announcer, comparing moments in a dog show to parts of a baseball game, and his english, canine academic, foil.the trials of the geeky husband as his blonde wife meets an astonishing number of men from her past is also always good for a chuckle, as is the demented behaviour of the yuppie couple as the pressure builds, while their hound stays completely unflustered.well worth watching - even if cats are more your bag.

i saw this movie with an open mind, not knowing what to expect. i was pleasantly surprised to see that this movie was written, directed and acted in such a manner that every minute of it is a delightful watch. the people don't seem like they're acting, more like they are real people who really train dogs and lead the lives portrayed in this movie. there are some wonderful moments where you laugh or chuckle, some jokes may be dry but are presented in a very viewable fashion. highly recommended!

this film isn't a comedy, its an expose. i've always hated dog shows, considering the ridiculous get-ups people put their dogs in and the idiotic names they give them. hence, the reason for my uncontrolled cackling while watching this film. i get a kick out of something being taken so seriously, even though the gains are small and insignificant. it's like miniature golf, or jump roping championships or the need to set some obscure world record. the acting was much more refined in this film than waiting for guffman, and its mainly due to the more fluidity of the characters, who seem more comfortable with their specific acting partners in this film than the previous. eugene levy was great, as was michael mckean and fred willard. however, it was the dogs who eventually stole the show. but then again, who wants to see a bunch of humans in a film about dogs anyway.

well in to 2002 i've got some catching up to do. and looking back on a lacklustre year, best in show shone. no great storyline. little action. just a cavalcade of magnificent characters. particular reference to fred willard and jim piddock as a rattling pair of tv commentators. well done. well worth the effort.ron (viewed 24mar2001)

this has got to be the funniest movie i have seen in forever. chritopher guest is truly talented. he has a gift for humor. i almost died laughing. actually, when i saw this in theaters, i considered walking out because the movie was so dumb. but it is dumb in a good way. it is funny-dumb. and this is a really good combination. you will be laughing from start to end.this mockumentary style film follows an array of characters all competing at the kennel club dog show. the cast includes parker posey, fred willard, eugene levy, catherine o'hara, john michael higgens, michael mckean, larry miller, bob balaban, jennifer coolidge and tons more. this is a truly funny movie that will have everyone laughing. someone born without a personality would laugh at this film. it is presented in widescreen to give the image that you are viewing an actual documentary and that is probably what adds to the hilarity. best in show: 5/5.

this movie brought together some of the old spinal crew for another mockumentary film, this time revolving around the world of the dog show, how their owners prepare and train for the show before moving on to the show itself.we meet several teams as they hope to win the top prize- the fleck's, cookie who seems to have slept with every man ever, and gerry who tries to cope with his wife's old escapades and the fact that he literally has two left feet. harlan, whose dog talks to him, and enjoys ventriloquism. the swan's who have taken far too much coffee and scream at each other. donalan and vanderhoof the gay couple, and cabot and cummings who have won the last two years. fred willard commentates on the show, and is very funny as always. funny scenes include the 'look at me!' scene, and any with levy. unfortunately some of the best scenes were deleted or filmed later- willard interviewing leslie cabot, and the alternative epilogue with gerry is one of the funniest things i have ever seen. if these had been included, i would give the film an extra mark. but...7 out of 10

this is the best of the films (so far) that christopher guest has created using his very talented ensemble cast. previously, they'd made the excellent waiting for guffman and following best in show, they made the very enjoyable a mighty wind. as for their latest, for your consideration, the less said the better.the film appears to be a documentary about dog shows and several contestants in particular. you follow these few chosen dogs from pre-show preparations all the way to the big night where one of them is chosen best in show at the fictitious "mayflower kennel club". however, none of these people are real dog show enthusiasts but talent improvisational actors that parody many of the common types of people you meet in the dog show world. amazingly, even though the characters are rather outlandish, there is a lot of truth to the personalities they are parodying--as decades ago i had some experience with dog shows and this is a very cutthroat group of people! my favorites of the dog owners were the incredibly high-pressure and tense yuppie couple who just exuded anger and volatility. i also loved the openly gay couple, as they were terribly funny and clever. however, the best performance probably wasn't from any of the couples but from fred willard who played the world's stupidest and least talented announcer in human history. his comments were uniformly inane and often betrayed his as an incredibly stupid person--how he got to be the announcer for such a prestigious show is anyone's guess. the other contestants featured were also quite funny--the high-priced professional poodle handler and its rich owner, the country boy and his hound as well as winkie's "parents" who could barely scrape together enough to make it to the show.despite the improvised style of film making, the pieces all fit together wonderfully and told a very funny and compelling story--one that is not for dog owners only. exceptional acting made this one of the best comedies of the last decade. clever and consistently funny.by the way, try to find this on dvd as the extras were actually worth seeing. while a bit painful to watch, i loved seeing harlan pepper and his beach ball collection in particular!

this movie should go down as one of the funniest movies in history. its cousins a mighty wind, spinal tap and waiting for guffman are terrific in their own right but best in show takes the cake. a movie about the idiosyncrasies of dog owners that show their dogs competitively, it's the intricacies of the characters that make it so good. after watching the movie about 75 times i have come to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this film. there is very little interaction between any of the "groups" of characters but that only seems to add to the beauty of the film. if you watch this movie and don't find it as funny as i am billing it as, watch it again. the first time i saw it i thought it was serviceable but not overly hilarious. it is a film that grows on you. defininatly a movie that you will find yourself quoting frequently. characters: hamilton and meg swan: a+ if you get the dvd check out how these characters were "born" amazing that these two could hit it so on the head. and to find out that they really didn't go by a script and sort of made it up as they went. gerry and cookie guggleman: a cookie is especially funny and she does a fantastic job of selling the cookie character. gerry (eugene levy) delivers his standard stellar performance of the hilarious discombobulated type weaker half. stefan vanderhoof and scott donalan- a+ find me a funnier character than scott donalan, i dare you! he will forever be typecast as this character to me as he was so natural and didn't seem forced at any point. stefan (micheal mckean) was very good as well and they interplay here (and a brief appearance with the gugglemans) goes to show why he is always in these films. a great actor with razor like wit. harlan pepper- b+, i don't want it to seem like he isn't funny, he sure is but being the only "solo" act he can't be quite as funny as the others above. he does use the dog more than others and has some other idiosyncrasies going for him.the rest are all great as well, there is no weak character. see this film at least twice. buy it, you will not regret it.

i love the mockumentary format that chris guest and crew have developed over the years. i actually like this and "waiting for guffman" better than "spinal tap", which was the first of the group (and made by rob reiner but starred guest and several other of his mockumentary regulars). this humor is not for everyone. it's rather subtle and not too physical, so some people may not relate. however, as a dog lover (and a dog show fan), i loved this movie. there are so many funny lines in it! my daughter and i quote them to each other often. i find it amazing that these people can ad lib so much funny material for each movie! what a fun bunch they must be. i highly recommend this to people who prefer their humor on the cerebral side.

functioning as a sort of midpoint between "waiting for guffman" and "a mighty wind", "best in show" portrays a dog show and the various people who bring their canine friends to participate. some are weird, some crazy, and otherwise, but they all make the movie good. director christopher guest is particularly funny as gay harlan pepper, very much trying to promote his dog. eugene levy, parker posey, michael mckean, catherine o'hara, and bob balaban also do great jobs (i can't imagine them not doing great jobs, at least not in a christopher guest movie). as someone who's never attended a dog show, this movie is my main exposure to them. they sure look neat.

this is the funniest movie i have ever seen. however, i have laughed harder at plenty of movies. this is because best in show's brilliance lies not in slapstick or one-liners, but in sophisticated and layered verbal wit. the improvised dialogue is is so quick that you end up laughing not at each individual joke, but only until after several jokes build on one another, each disarming your senses until the jokes climax and you can't help letting loose.it's a well-shot film, but what makes it extraordinary is the acting. i was impressed on my first viewing, but when i watched it after having learned that virtually every scene is improvised, i was amazed. it was thoroughly enjoyable to see the comedians work off each other, build jokes out of nothing, and completely immerse themselves in their characters.i imagine the golden days of second city were like this.

you know, this movie reminded me so much of so many people i know, i think that's the reason why i loved this movie so much. i was just on the floor laughing because this had such a serious and document feel to it, but the dialog is so hilarious, that you can't help but have a good time. basically the movie is about these crazed dog owners who are competing in a big dog show to see who is the best of the best. whlie it seems like it should be the dogs who take this competition seriously, it turns out the owners are just as insane. megan, one of the dog owners, goes almost serial psycho killer on the hotel manager because she cannot find the special bee squeaky toy for her dog.there is another couple that is just great, gerry and cookie, this complete nerd and attractive woman that are just so lovable. in the beginning of the movie, gerry describes how many boyfriends cookie had. throughout the movie, her "lovers" see her and hit on her even in front of gerry! it was just great and fun to watch gerry's looks. this whole movie is just a hoot, and you can't stop with the recognizable faces that keep popping up. it's a great movie is just fun to watch, i'd highly recommend it! now, i have to find a nice way of showing this to my friends who are like these couples to see the mirror image of themselves. :d 8/10

this is the only christopher guest movie that rivals spinal tap and princess bride for sheer entertainment value, but somehow never gets near the recognition. the plot surrounds the contestants--dogs--and their owners as they venture into the world of competitive dog...ok, it's about a dog show. the owners truly are characters, as one would have to be to be so attached to their dogs. that's really all there is to it, but that makes it funny enough.you'd never be able to convince me that a mock-u-mentary about dog shows would be funny prior to catching the hilarious scene where levy and o'hara visit larry miller's house on tv...but that's really all it takes to convert any doubters. spinal tap was non-stop hilarity, joke after joke whereas best in show was had a few more lulls (and by that i mean say 3 minute at most where something riotously funny doesn't happen), but the big laughs are even bigger.the casting in this one is great and even the typically out of place in, uh movies in general parker posey does a fine job. in fact, her tirade directed at ed begley jr. and a pet store owner over a lost dog toy is probably the funniest running gag of the film.what's amazing about this movie to me is how the writers somehow managed to weave a plot, simple as it was, around these great jokes so that it actually felt like it had direction. i guess there's a freedom in having such a minimal plot. everyone's role is pretty well crafted here and the characters are rarely over-the-top. the realism of how pathetic they seem to the outsider is what makes it funnier than mighty wind or the uneven guffman. i actually encounter wierdos like this now and then. if you like guest's stuff at all, you should definitely own this one.

in the era of the farrelly brothers and the jackass series, to have a movie made and performed by americans come out that is well paced and full of charm as well as hilarity is well-nigh miraculous. this ensemble has been behind some other efforts, most recently "a mighty wind" which was so subtle it seemed to be an actual documentary without the overlay of entertainment, but "best in show" hits on all cylinders. it is superbly cast with some of the best of current us actors, parker posey, who exudes energy even when she stands still, eugene levy as tolerant everyman who is nobody's doormat, even when he appears to be (or maybe, 'indomitable doormat'). the brilliant stylings of fred willard, the understated performances of so many others, which is a characteristic not normally associated with americans or american actors. one of the few humorous movies i can watch again and again.

it seems everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon and say "maha go go go"....the word is macha........like "mach".....pronounced maa - ka"...i grew up with this series in the early 70's here in la on the late and very lamented channel 56...before that there was tetsuwan atomu (astro boy), dating from 1963 on ol' khj tv. astro boy was the first tv example of anime we got here in the states...i was into anime as a kid and followed it until the late 80's when, by then it'd become a series of badly animated "talking heads", a phenomenon which has only gotten worse. 'nuff said.as for "speed racer", i really enjoyed the basics there, the pov shots, the cinematic aspects of live action skillfully adopted to animation...that was fairly typical of most japanese anime back then...graphics graphics graphics! take note sometime how obviously the series was inspired by stanley kramer's film "grand prix" (1966), especially the redone american credits....oh yeah, i have the original comics from which the series is based, so i know of which i speak.what were we doing animation-wise besides crap like johnny quest?.....th' same ol' stuff we'd been doin' since the 20's....ho-hum!i guess the real problem i had/have with the way anime was/is shown on american tv is the hatchet job done on the scripts, credits, etc to "sanitize" them for american audiences...i won't go into other programs as we're talking' speed here.look at clowns like peter fernandez as one of the culprits here, as he was 99% responsible for the re-writes of the series...not to mention the voice of speed, racer x and others...between him and the goofs at trans/lux ( think felix the cat and the mighty hercules - oy vey!) they took a slick, very sophisticated show and dropped it down to the level of sesame street. think "cruncher bloch", the "forthebird company", "skull duggery"...if i go on i'll puke.this series dates from 40-odd years ago but i, at the time, was keen enough to feel insulted by the dumbing down of this and other japanese programs...i mean it's obvious when someone's getting' killed but they either remove it or gloss it over........pleeeeeze!good show - originally. sadly all the more recent incarnations of the series have that crappy "made in korea" look, not to mention being nauseatingly "pc" in content. even the japanese outsource their animation now..try watchin' the original japanese opening on youtube sometime...it sends chills up my spine.....if only......oh well. robert

the role of economics in the industrialized north american market must have always been theorized in the homelands of the engines creation. persons and industrialist such as mercedes benz and the bavarian motor works (bmw) surely realized the opportunity of the north ameircan market with the purchase of fuel and number of automobiles purchased per household. this type of economic phenomena sparked the concept of speed racer.after the new constitution of japan the industrialization of the isolated island nation of japan must seek opportunity once again via economic partnerships with its global neighbors. this also helped spark the economic opportunities in the european and north american market if not the global market.speed is a young avid driver who without knowing any better is driven by his demanding father pops racer who has challenged himself his whole life to make a better machine better at winning races. it was in fact pops racer who drove his first son rex racer to the brink of destruction with his strategy of how to best use the technology he developed. as a mature racer, rex, finally realizes his own inherent values and becomes independent but still feels obligated to his younger bother speed.the exact relationship of rex racer to persons such as the inspector are never really clear, but put into dramatization. rex is eventually accused of being a type of agent for a country or organization due to his ability to be in places at times when there is no other explanation to how he would have known speed was in trouble. or the fact that the situations involved some types of illegal activity were his secretive knowledge is leveraged against an evil plot. this brings a level of cloak and dagger romance to speed racer.the mixture of speeds innocence with trixy, sprital, and chim chim brings a level of comic human nature. this concept is a good form of rhetoric to balance the themes and plots as they are played out from episode to episode. so, instead of a dry detective story the thrill of international race car driving, romance of cloak and dagger, and comedy of human nature is put into one story, speed racer.

i have seen this film at least 100 times and i am still excited by it, the acting is perfect and the romance between joe and jean keeps me on the edge of my seat, plus i still think bryan brown is the tops. brilliant film.

apparently this australian film based on nevil shute's novel exists in more than one form. beware heavily cut versions sometimes shown on cable or satellite, running anywhere from 95 minutes to 2 hours. only the full 5 hour miniseries version tells the story properly. it is a very close realisation of the story, suffering only from editorial faults commonly found in tv movies: choppiness and episodic progression. but this excellent cast carries the story forward very well with generally good production values accompanying their work. yuki shimoda is notable as "gunso mifune", one of the guards assigned to accompany the women on their agonising trek. in the end he becomes a friend. you will agonise with him when his loss of face leads him into death.helen morse as "jean paget", pretty but not a great beauty (she resembles sigourney weaver a bit)registers just the right amount of spunk and winsomeness as the occasion demands. the miniseries properly emphasises the beautiful love stories, three of them: "joe" and "jean", "noel" and "jean", and "jean" and willstown. gordon jackson plays "noel strachan" appealingly, but as a somewhat younger man than nevil shute indicated in the novel. the third love affair i mentioned doesn't get quite the emphasis it is due, and the full significance of the title is diminished. "jean" is devoted to the goal of bringing businesses to willstown that will attract young women and girls and their civilising influence to this god-forsaken out back town. she wants to make it "a town like alice"; alice springs, that is. we get only a few hints of this in several scenes. if you have the five hours to spare, this miniseries is a truly rewarding experience. nevil shute based his novel about the cruelty of the japanese military in shunting a large group of women and children from one place to another on the maylay peninsula on a true occurrence. it happened on sumatra, according to shute, though, rather than on the peninsula. the crucifixion of "joe" by a japanese officer for stealing chickens to feed the women is probably fiction, but the cruelty of the japanese in dealing with prisoners is certainly a matter of record.

this mini-series is iconic of the australian spirit. while there may be what are perhaps considered glaring inconsistencies, the film portrays a spirit that is unique to australia, and one that should be cherished. if anything, this mini-series demonstrates the aussie sense of humour. the ability to laugh at the supremely ridiculous. our willingness to have a laugh in even the most dire of situations. while a large part of this series focuses on mateship and how humour can be used as a means of survival, it also has elements of drama that are evoke real emotions. the main actors who appear are absolutely sensational and very convincing in their different roles. capturing the essence of their characters perfectly. this mini-series should be mandatory viewing for all australians.

i saw this drama by cable tv. although i saw just two series, i love this drama. i'm waiting for more series will be aired by cable.even though it describes horrible, absurd situation in a prisoner's camp, this one shows us an indomitable spirit, warmth, friendship and humanity. they don't know whether they can survive or not, but kept their hope strongly without being discouraged by adversity.i know this movie is not realistic like other war documentary, but i don't want to blame for it. it makes me believe the strong will of people in the most difficult situation. 'private bill' , especially, this episode touched deep in my heart.i remember every scene. i always hate mathematics. but after seeing this drama, i can understand something about mathematics... mathematics is his connection between past and present, also symbolizes eternity.'time, light and memory framed in a circle.'like other victims of war, he lost his lover by irresistible fate. i'm immersed in his time and memory as if i experienced same thing.he experienced the great loss but he has pure passion of study.he started his study in the camp, his joy of realize,i believe his dedication of study sustained him.i saw it several times, but the meaning of this film never faded. every time i saw it, i feel same deep emotion.* their songs are beautiful, harmonious,i'm sorry that i can't listen ost.

never have i sat down for six hours straight to watch a miniseries, but changi changed that. i'm not going to lie, i know some aussie flicks can be pathetic and boring (actually, i quite like aussie flicks myself but maybe i'm biased) but changi is on a completely different lane. although not historically accurate, as we are continually reminded, the show combines superb acting, an excellent script and the addition of humour to provide us with an entertaining and emotional perception of life in a pow camp in wwii.keep in mind, the show was not supposed to be a documentary so don't let any factual errors disappoint you. this series exposes such creative writing by john doyle (aka roy slaven)who is known more for his comedy than anything else, and an excellent director and actors move this creativity along perfectly. if you want to see how much hard work went into this series, visit the official website, it is really interesting and you'll learn a lot about true accounts of changi. if you haven't seen changi yet, make sure you are doing nothing for a whole day because you'll want to watch the series in its entirety.

this is a really sad, and touching movie! it deals with the subject of child abuse. it's really sad, but mostly a true story, because it happens everyday. elijah wood and joseph mazzello play the two children or lorraine bracco, a single mother who just tries to make a home for them. while living with her parents, a man, who likes to be called "the king" comes into their life. he hits the youngest boy, bobby, but the two brothers vow not to tell their mother. but finally she finds out, after the bobby is hurt badly. the end kind of ruined it for me, because it is so totally unbelievable. but, except for that, i love the movie.

well...i like this movie first of all because it's very well thought of... and well..because the um...director and others chose an extremely great actor to play mike....and also my last reason because ( my opinion) elijah wood is so so hot!!!

"radio flyer" is one of my most loved american movies.the really great job of two boys, joe mazzello and elija wood, (in spite of terrible performance of t.hanks at the beginning and ending...) with marvellous script of d.m.evans and powerful and emotional directing of r.donner plus absolutely incredibly peerless music score of h.zimmer allowed the "radio flyer" to win one of the first places in my family's rating of movies.it's so pity that that very good movie was underrating by some movie critics.i just can't help waiting to see it on dvd.

where do i begin? i first saw this film in 1995 and had no idea of what to expect, i was actually at the time searching out films that elijah wood had starred in and this one had come highly recommended. i sat down and watched the film once and didn't know what to think. i watched it a second time a few days later and the floodgates just opened. never before in my life had i ever really cried while watching a film, and i was blubbing, every high and low the film i was riding right alongside, on an emotional roller coaster.it struck such an emotional chord in me on many levels, the intense sadness and elation we see in the film, the wonder and innocence of childhood, the yearning for a time that once was, but is no more. more than anything, this film reminded me of my childhood (except for the abuse) during a time in my life when i'd shrugged off my childhood some years before and not even really noticed, i'd given it up and moved on to a life entirely devoid of it. the radio flyer made me wake up and suddenly realise what i'd given up without really even noticing. from that day forward i immediately set about to change my life and myself, and i did.this is going to sound corny but basically i rediscovered my inner child, i started down a path that has been ongoing over the past 6 years and has changed me so much, so much for the better, embracing and living that part of myself. i've been finding out who i really am. i don't think it was simply a case of the right film coming along at a crucial moment of my life, the radio flyer really did something very special, and i still look upon it as an incredible piece of work in all respects, an incredible film.in closing i cannot fail to mention the music. i am a great fan of hans zimmer and this is among his very finest works. the sheer breadth and depth of emotional expression he has put into the score of this film is a huge part of what makes the film what it is to me. like subtitles to a foreign language film, his soaring music is a crib sheet to the intense emotions this film will take you through. find the soundtrack at all costs, it was sadly deleted long ago, i never expected to find it but amazingly did, after chatting with someone i met on a hans zimmer fansite guest book.watch this film, let yourself live the emotions, don't get bogged in trivial nitpicking of the ending, be that child again

i am a 20 year old bloke from england. i don't cry at films. but this one moved me. i cried like a girl! this is absolutely the most moving film i have ever seen, even though the story was questionable. joseph mazello's little face when he dreams of crying made me sob every time. how could anyone hurt such a sweet looking kid? i'm going to cry now just thinking about it! remarkable.

young elijah wood and joseph mazzello are outstanding in this excellent film about two boys who have promised to "take care of their mother," and how they cope when their new stepfather begins beating the younger boy. the supporting cast around the boys is top-notch as well. the script really gets inside the mind and heart of an imaginative child. it's hard to believe wood could grow up to look anything like tom hanks, but that's nothing new in hollywood. that's honestly my only criticism of the film.

this story is an excellent tale of two boys that do whatever they can to get away from there abusive drunkard father. "lord of the rings" star elijah wood is outstanding in this unforgettable role. this movie is one of the main reasons i haven't touched a single beer and never will as long as i live. that might make me sound like a nerd, but that's what i have to say. it is a wonder why this isn't hearld as a classic american tale.

i first saw this movie as a younger child. my sister had told me about it and i thought it would be more of a kid's movie. however it remains to also be an incredible movie. true that the subject behind the movie is ruff but also true this movie will never stop touching your heart.i was only 6 when i first saw it and just yesterday, 7 years later, i saw it again. for the first time in a long time. even after i knew how it ended, i knew that i had seen it a billion, bizillion times i wept like a teeny weeny little baby. when i saw it a few years back i finally got the idea and the seriousness of the film. so i stoped watching it for a while. but yesterday i didn't change the channel, i watched it. by the end i was astonished at how much it still made me laugh, cry, think, and above all, believe in mericals again. i haven't belived in a long time and this movie got me out of my shell and opened up my heart. this movie wasn't just impacting. i was also so impressed with the actors. especially bobby. so if you are wanting to see this movie for the first time i suggest seeing it alone. with tissues. and being ready to discover your young, sweet, innocent side and the side that still has hope. this movie touched my soul when i was only 6, and even in this time of trying to figure out who i am this movie helped me realize both what i don't and still do want to be in life.

this has to be the best movie of all time (in my opinion). it really taught me when i watched when i was 10 (in 2000) that the freedom of a being a child slips away sooner then we expect it to. also joseph mazzello has to be my favorite actor ever, and i think that him and elijah wood did a great job in the roles of brothers. this movie is quite sad, and some people don't understand the ending. but the story itself is quite incredible, the thought of a poor 7 year boy (bobby)getting abused by drunken step father is horrible, and what the two boys do about this is sad, and important. my favorite part of the movie is when tom hanks (older mike) lists the 7 things of being a kid that are lost to the grownup world. however there are some parts that could have been done better in this movie, such as the casting of the mother (lorraine braco), who i think is a horrible actor. "the king" played his role well, since it is a hard role to play. joseph and elijah definitely were the stars of the movie. i couldn't believe how well they played victims of a abusing stepfather, being the age that they were (7 and 9). but overall, i recommend this movie to anyone, who loves great child actors, and a great movie. :)

my take on the ending. bobby died at the hands of his step father. mike had tried as he may to get bobby out. only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine that could fly. bobby died.... mike as a child survived by creating an alternative ending in his mind...on how bobby left....mike made a plane that flew bobby out. children who are sexually and violent abused often create whole other worlds in their minds to survive.was also great seeing my old housing area. we called it san jose boulevard and i lived right around where these house were filmed. it was so strange to see that they filmed inside the houses...not studios... it was my kitchen, bedroom and living room. and those hills...we use to hike them as kids....looking down on our little valley....seeing glimpses of the bay. was a real nostalgia trip for me.

this movie was a heart-felt piece of cinema that helped show the darker side of childhood, and the little things that shaped who tom hank's was. using a very cryptic story, they were able to give you an idea of what truly happened to tom hank's character as a child. and while scenes like the flying machine may have never happened, it helped to show how even denial can help tell the truth. in all good conscience, i could not rate this lower then a 9 out of 10, great performances from all the actors, and while many may not have understood the cryptic ending in which the brother is murdered by his step father, and tom hanks covers it up using a far-fetched story about a flying machine, pay close attention to the little details, such as the turtle that he still has, even though his brother "flew" off with it. truly, a beautiful piece of cinema, and every actor deserves recognition for it.

i am surprised that so many viewers didn't find all the symbolism in the movie.....it's what made the movie an incredible work of art! the story deals with some of the saddest content a movie could hold, yet it is one of the best movies i've ever seen because of the need for your own imagination and the brilliance in the storyline.if you will pay close attention, the message is there. the younger brother is killed by the stepfather. the older brother made up the story about the wagon flying as a way to deal with the pain of his brother's death. there are those that would argue why would he lie to his own children with the story. to me the answer is because he doesn't want to share such ugliness with his own children, or that he has blocked it out and replaced his memory of the horrific event with the thought of his brother flying away to safety. i've read some of the reviews that believe he was an only child and that he created the younger brother as an escape to deal with the abuse he suffered. although this is an interesting idea - i love the imagination used to come up with that. i don't think he would have lied to his own children about having a little brother. but, i do find it plausible that he would have lied about his little brother's death. however, i like that idea of an ending much better than the notion that the movie had no symbolism at all.there are many different takes you can have on the movie, but if you take the movie at face value.....two brothers creating a wagon that flies to escape an abusive stepfather - you've missed the brilliance. the fact that i was able to see the subtle messages in the script were what made the movie so incredible to me. it requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it work......dig deep when you watch it. you'll be amazed at the genius contained in the film. the only other movie i've seen as close to this in symbolism and subtle messages is pleasantville.....but that's a comment for another movie!

simply an amazing bittersweet movie that portrays a side of life often skipped over in feel good movies. i saw this as a child and came back to it very recently and fell in love again.as a child it sparked my interest purely for the building of a plane, as an adult it captured me in the dark world and a young mans escape from that world. the portrayal of the king was great, the camera style chosen with low shots and shots focusing on actions and hand movements was i thought well done, i personally can not recall anything quite done in that style and adds to the character and portrays him as a force almost not human (which may not be far from reality) it makes for interesting developments worth a watch any day

everything about this film is simply incredible. you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.i do feel it is important to note this tale is about child abuse. don't rent it for your kids thinking it is a fun, disney-esque film.

in reply to "state of confusion" the dogs injuries do seem to disappear rather abruptly, but that may have only been an error in continuity. but, as for the kids trying to build a plane out of junk, it's just a simple matter of imagination. these are two very young kids who have extremely active imaginations and they must rely on those imaginations to keep themselves from being exposed to the reality of the level of abuse that goes on in their home from their stepfather. as for the stepfather, it's very interesting that the director chose to no show his face. that makes him seem more monstrous. if you show his face, then that character becomes a person and not just this "monster" who is terrorizing the childhood of these two innocent children. by showing only the concequences of his abuse and not focusing scenes on the abuse itself, the children then become the main focus of the movie. this film has no loose ends, but runs just as a father's tale to his children would. it has embelleshments. this is a fine american classic.

of all the actresses in film today, kristin scott thomas would be my choice if i had to select one for stranding on a desert island.i could watch her simply, say, sitting in a chair for a couple of hours. so it's difficult for me to be objective completely with respect to one of her films.however, i did enjoy this movie and its story, per se, more than that indicated by the average ranking among the many persons previously commenting on this site.harrison ford is not one of the actors, though, whose performances i enjoy most. but he's one of a handful who have reached the level of moving from 7 figures to 8 per film, so who am i to argue?ford though is often droll in his acting style, and sometimes seems to be in serious need of an antacid and a shot of caffeine - and "random hearts" is in this grouping.his obsession in probing the losses, which both he and thomas have endured with regard to their linked spouses, is understandable, given his profession as a detective - but not to the level presented here. although not far, it crossed the line into the "annoying" category. however, most of the scenes after he and thomas became involved were interesting and well-played.this film could have been a 9*, but i'd lower it a couple of levels, based upon ford's overall performance, and and another, because it contained a bit more of the extraneous sub-plot elements than seemed required.

from the late sydney pollack comes a grown up love story about human nature,pain,passion and betrayal. police sergeant dutch van den broeck(harrison ford)is devastated when he learns his beloved wife has been killed in a plane crash,he's even more upset to learn of her affair with the husband of a famous congresswoman kay chandler(kristen scott thomas).he arranges to meet her and see if she knew or like he had no idea.they start to befriend each other then out of their mutual pain and distress begin an intense affair(which could be seen as healing for them both).however will the memories of the dead and pressures from their respective jobs drive them apart and cause more harm than good or can they escape the past?well you'll have to watch random hearts and find out.a moving and well acted film with a great cast.

okay, i'll admit that if i didn't have kids, i never would have seen this film and would never see it. but, considering all the rotten kids movies i have seen (such as spy kids 2 or babe: pig in the city), this is a significant improvement. and, it had enough in it that i wasn't totally bored out of my skull or contemplated suicide (something i did repeatedly in the other two movies). sure, the performances are pretty broad and the plot is kinda silly--but it is a kids film. and, compared with other films in the genre, this is definitely better than average. frankie muniz and amanda bines actually appear to have some talent and probably will continue to have careers after puberty--at least on infomercials or doing voice-overs.so, if you are looking for a film to see with your kids, you certainly could do a lot worse!

random hearts is a very well directed, well scripted and perfectly cast actors for the primary roles. i found it to be so intense, that you have to stop and wonder in almost every scene harrison and kristin are together, how their characters deal with this horrible situation they find themselves in. very talented acting from both of them. a lot of people i believe who did not appreciate the movie for what it was, did not get the point of the movie or could not even fathom a situation like theirs.(please skip this next part if you have not seen the movie yet)i loved the ending, which was a great surprise which tied the whole movie. it was relieving to see how these two good persons can come out actually happier in the end.

i must be getting old because i was riveted to this movie from the first time i saw it. i'm watching it again right now on hbo. it's a very simple film about 2 people that fall in love after they found out that there spouses were having an affair. plot is very thin, but the actors acted very well in this movie. in the mix of kristen scott thomas running for congress and harrison ford being an internal affairs cop, these two meet, under unfortunate circumstances and fall in love. i love the soundtrack. perfect fit. one thing i can't figure out, this movie had a budget of $68 million dollars. were was it spent? the plane crash or harrison ford's salary?

random hearts snuck up on me. criticized for the implausibility of a) the premise and b) the pairing of an ia cop and a congresswoman, as well as for its slowness, the film felt just fine to me , and even ended up being surprisingly absorbing. i found my interest engaged as the film cut back and forth between ford's and thomas's lives as they first found out about, and dealt in very different ways in very different environments with, their spouses' deaths and the subsequent revelation that they were involved with other people. it could happen; two people's philandering spouses could be on the same plane, the plane could go down, the survivors could be brought together by the aftermath. so what if it's improbable? improbable is not the same as far-fetched. so..what if it did happen? why not speculate? ford's and thomas's performances are believable and nuanced. instead of finding their coupling implausible (opposite sides of the tracks--give me a break) i felt it driven by a grief and betrayal neither party knew how to deal with. the script does not bring them together too soon or too easily, and the end of the film does not resolve their relationship conventionally, either. where i find it unsatisfying is when the dialogue brings up interesting wrinkles in or insights into the ramifications of the situation, personal and professional, but never seems to pursue any of them very far. and if you make the mistake of thinking about it too hard, harrison ford does seem about 10 years too old for the part.for five and a half bucks at wal-mart, with full length director commentary and behind-the-scenes featurette, the dvd is well worth owning. i don't think i would pay $20 for it on a bet, but my wife might. ok, ten...

i admit i have been a fan of harrison ford for many, many years now so it didn't surprise me that i enjoyed his performance here. but i also enjoyed the way the storyline developed and thought the casting was well done. i don't know whether i "buy into" kristin scott thomas as a congresswoman but she is a fine actress and a beautiful woman. i took notice of her in the first mission impossible. although her part was small she stuck out on the screen.here her and ford play people whose spouses are killed in an airplane crash. they are seated together and this is where the plot takes off. apparently ford, a police detective in wash d.c., discovers that his wife was having an affair. he further discovers that the affair was with the husband of a new england congresswoman.the story takes on many subplots as ford and thomas find themselves drawn together by revelations of their marriages, the uncovering of deceipt, and the pure grief and anger over the loss of a loved one.i think the movie is worthwhile either renting or catching on cable.

true, there are some goofs, for the one who wants to find them. they're not important, though.the primary feature of this film is watching veteran expert actors do their craft. kristin scott thomas is beautiful and plays well the part of a strong woman, but one who has been hurt. same for harrison ford, who, for the ladies, is just as beau as kristin is belle for us guys.their hurt at the hands of their adulterous spouses brings them together in an awkward manner, but one in which they find support in each other. how they evoke their hurt feelings and their humanity within on th screen is why these are such sought performers. the viewer cannot help but feel what they feel, nor can one help wanting to cheer them when they're together.yes, there are several action scenes involving angry corrupt cops, but they only spice it up a little, and are not a significant part of the movie.for the lover of music, dave grusin provides a superb jazz based background, featuring trumpeter terrence blanchard. like the actors, grusin shows why he is one of the most sought musical consultants in the movie business. blanchard shows why he's one the premiere trumpeters on the scene.not a movie for the lovers of guts, blood, and gore. but for those who want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside, watch a beautiful english actress with big expressive blue eyes who can act, like harrison ford, to the endless soothing accompaniment courtesy of dave grusin and terrence blanchard, this is a move to watch with someone you love. preferably in bed.i thought it deserved at least an 8.

as a fan of history, mythology, and fantasy "mystic knights" show pulled me in from the get-go. it has semi-decent scripting, the costumes are fantastic (there are exceptions), it has pretty good acting, and the heroes and villains all play well off each other.scripts--half a script is pretty great, the other half falls flat, but its all mixed together, meaning many episodes turn out so-so. also, some of the key players are repeatedly being given dead lines (king conchobar and angus for instance) they need to be given something... more. i'm not sure what but the writers should be able to come up with something. acting--apart from some over acting by villagers (horrid lines they end up putting too much effort into), casting did extremely well in choosing their leads and so on. everyone, good and bad, works well together! costumes/weapons--the everyday clothes that everyone wears are spectacular! mystic knight armor that falls short are deirdre's and garrett's. a chainmail bikini would probably have better protection in her case... and wouldn't look as plastic; his looks like bunch of snap-it-together pieces of brown plastic, when it should look bronze. ivar's trident looks like it was bought at a discount store and while garretts weapons look cool, they also look plastic.recently "mystic knights" has taken on too many "power rangers" traits, if you watch the show, you'll know what i mean. as the series progresses, though, it should find its niche and perfect its style. overall, it is a wonderful show that all ages should enjoy (most of my friends and i watch it and we're all 20+). the plot thickens and twists, though it gets a bit juvenile in places, and everything just keeps getting more interesting. it might be of some interest to fans of the movie "willow" or the t.v. series "the adventures of sinbad". a lot of adventure, a dab of mystery, a dash of romance, a sprinkling of forces at nature... check it out! (my score: 7/10)

this show is a show that is great for adults and children to sit down together and watch. the stories are a little slow for adults but they are still good. there are lots of children in my family, boys and girls, and it is hard to get them all to agree on what to watch, but they always agree with each other when they want to watch the mystic knights. it is a wonderful show and i hope that they will continue to keep making it. all of the kids in my family and myself think that vincent walsh is the best of them all. we have seen that he has done lots of other work and think that he is doing a great job. we wish all of the actors, actresses, writers, directors, and producers the best of luck and would just like to say keep up the good work.

years ago, i didn't love and respect the films of jimmy cagney nearly as much as i do now. i noticed that many of cagney's films done with warner brothers in the 1930s lacked realism and his acting style was far from subtle. however, the more i watched these films, the more i found i was hooked despite these aspects. in fact, i now kind of like and expect them! fans of old time hollywood films probably understand what i am saying--teens and other young whippersnappers don't! well, when it comes to entertainment, the mayor of hell never lets up from start to finish. while the idea of a shady character like cagney played taking over running a reform school is ridiculous, and while all the changes he made also seemed far-fetched, it all somehow worked out and delivered solid entertainment.the gang of tough thugs were pre-dead end kids and instead of the likes of leo gorcey, huntz hall and billy hallop, similar roles are played here by frankie darrow and farina. yes, i did say "farina". this black actor was already famous for his roles in the our gang comedies and was, believe it or not, one of the highest paid child actors in hollywood. all he needed to give up in return was be named an insipid name and act like a nice stereotypical "negro". here, he actually was pretty good and the usual black stereotypes are a bit more subdued than usual. however, some will cringe at the very funny but horribly offensive court scene involving farina and his dad, fred 'snowflake' toones. with awful names like "farina" and "snowflake", don't say i didn't warn you.apart from this small complaint and a plot that is tough to believe, the film is exceptional and fun. the kids do a great job, as does cagney and dudley digges in a truly despicable but exciting role as the evil warden. also, as an added plus, you get to see perennial warner stock actor allen jenkins in his first role for the studio.

it is a nice comedy. it has the great features of the childhood, lying or trying to get away from own generated troubles. the casting is great, great acting. and the special effects ? well, some stunts are really impressive. watch it! :)

for a tv movie this was definately worth seeing. all the acting was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme. i have not read/seen the original and as a rule i can't stand shakespeare, but i enjoyed this movie(the civil war setting was very well done as well). dont expect to see an epic, however you should find it moving enough to enjoy. by the way (on a side note) don't compare this (or any other movie for that matter) to the original work. movies aren't supposed to transfer a book to the screen, but rather take the general idea of it a then adapt a story from it. when people say "the book was so much better" (they're usually wrong anyway) what they are really trying to say is the book was so different.

never having read or seen the bard's original work, i can't begin to compare this work to his story. so i won't. instead i will just say that this was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects (and some that looked a little lower in budget, but still decent enough to enjoy). i thought all the primary actors did a fine job performing. the style of magic seemed more black than white and is almost certain to offend anyone easily upset about that sort of thing, but i thought it was well done.

...but it's still an entertaining tv movie. the transposition to the civil war makes a nice change of pace, and adds a few subtexts (such as ariel's servitude to prosper/prospero) that you might not otherwise see. thankfully, they didn't try to make it a mini-series: at 90 minutes, it's just about right.

this is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more. a mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it). but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold. it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work. a very rare type of film these days - it holds the attention and stirs the emotions without abandoning artistic integrity and succumbing to manipulative, superficial shortcuts.

can't grade this very well, because i can't say i liked it. but it is the story that bothered me, not the realization of the film. the acting, directing, atmosphere, music were all good. it's just that after you see a bunch of people doing things you can't truly relate to, the movie ends. it is educational in the way that it shows the horrors of war as seen from home and the way feelings don't need to make any sense at all and still be strong, but that's about it.the plot covers a period of a few years in which the poet dylan thomas is taken under the roof of a former ex-girlfriend. he is married, brings his wife and later the kid, while the ex (knightley) marries some other guy. but the tension is there, dylan is a self obsessed jerk and the new husband comes back home from the war with a slight case of ptsd. add in some pretty temperamental characters and you have your hands full.bottom line: you have to be "in the mood" to like this film. the hard part is defining this mood. i don't think i've ever been in it yet. ever. so it is probably better watched by adults with a grasp on weird complex human behaviour and maybe a curiosity about dylan thomas.

although i am very familiar with poet dylan thomas, i know nothing of his life. whatever his life and specifically his marriage involved, i would imagine that the edge of love (based on the novel) manipulates things a bit, but unless you are a historian or a poet, who cares.the movie is less about thomas and more focused on the two most important women in his life. one is his wife kathrine, and the other is vera who was his first love. one romantic night on the beach as youths is something that both have tried to put behind them but cannot, now grown up they are good friends. i forgot to mention that this is set during the war. vera becomes engaged to captain will killing who he gets her pregnant and leaves for war. while he is away, vera starts to fall for thomas again, and kathrine has fallen out of love with him. she is also carrying another man's child. things get even more emotionally complex when capt killig returnsas you can see, it is a very soap operatic plot, and it takes shape in a fairy drab slow manner, with perhaps one too many sequences of sappy dialogue. but all is not lost yet. for a non- hollywood production, i think that the edge of love is about as stylish a picture as one can get. it is certainly more dimensional and intelligent than about 90% of contemporary romances, hollywood production or not. some of it has to do with being set during the war, which sets up emotional conflict that feels more convincing and less artificial, a bit like atonement. this one features acting and cinematography of equal talent to joe wright's oscar nominee, but it is in far greater need for stable pacing and progression. things are okay at the start and finish, but the middle section is where your attention span may be tested, unless you are deeply and profoundly rooted in the story. i doubt if the edge of love will have that kind of an effect on the viewer, but is a good film to check. it might even make a good date night movie, considering it is so much smarter than the chick flicks that boyfriends are forced to endure today.

given that dylan thomas is an icon of modern anglophone poetry i expected a movie that would be prone to a hagiography of the subject. on the contrary the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible, a drunkard, a bad father, a lier and a hypocrite and perhaps a coward. of course one could argue that all those things are an advantage when some one is an artist and especially a poet since one of the purposes of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality but still i do not thing that a positive role model could crop up from such a bundle of personality traits. any way i found the other male hero of the story captain cillic a more endearing character. the two female roles were played by actresses knigtley and miller and were truly charming especially the first when she performed songs in slim outfit to inspire bombarded londoners during ww2. another good point is the role that sexual jealousy plays even in relatively progressive milieus that think that age-old conventions can easily be surpassed.the atmosphere of the blitz was also convincing as well as the portrayal of the distinct outlooks among people who have experienced war as opposed to those who talk about it theorizing on it's possible political outcomes.i think one would recommend such a movie.

this is primarily about love in wwii, yet we must remember that it's also a biopic for dylan thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his life.the movie's timing is just great. it really captures what i think would have been the spirit during those times; smiling and hoping you're not going to get bombed. while it may prove boring to some, the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it.at one point, my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax. it really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors. cillian murphy is on fine form here, as is matthew rhys. both are polar opposites and it makes for an interesting watch. the relationship formed between sienna miller and keira knightley's characters is wonderful and we have the acting to thank (and watch out for a cameo by suggs of 'madness'). despite all of this, it's a rather slow movie. coupled with the fact it's just shy of two hours, it's quite a slog to get to the conclusion.overall, it's a solid non-fiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that were no doubt helped by the splendid number of well-known british names behind the scenes. but it really does drone on for too much at times. still, a worthwhile watch. 7/10

'opera' (1987) director: dario argento (deep red, suspiria) screenplay: dario argento and franco ferrini (the church, sleepless, demons) photography: ronnie taylor (a chorus line, sleepless) music: claudio simonetti (phenomena, 'goblin')story: betty (cristina marsillach) is the lady macbeth understudy of a very stylized staging of verdi's macbeth opera. betty's time to shine comes when the diva star breaks her leg before opening night when she is hit by a car running away in a tantrum. the famous curse of macbeth takes a more sinister and calculating turn when right away the body count begins to rise. it seems betty gets her first fan via a stalker who ties her up and tapes needles to her eyes to force her to witness the grisly murders of the people around her. story: 3 of 5acting: acting in a lot of these italian films can sometimes be hard to judge. english, italian, french, german, spanish can sometimes all be in the same flick as they usually speak their native languages making dubbing rule of thumb and hard to judge. i usually cut them some slack in the area as a result. acting: 4 of 5 direction: giallo maestro argento enters again the genre helped pioneer. 'opera' shows him at the top of his game with an exquisite blend of gore, tension and beauty. direction: 4 of 5visual: this has to be one of argento's best looking films. gorgeously filmed by taylor, 'opera' features some stunning and inventive camera-work that keeps the film running fast and hard and keeps the eye-candy coming. the camera always seems to be in notion whether it is a wonderful shot of the camera going up a spiral staircase or a sequence towards the end of a bird's eye view of said bird circling the crowd at the opera house. visual: 5 of 5audio: frequent argento collaborator simonetti (through his various bands goblin, demonian and solo effort) compliments the screen action with zeal as his score touches from the classical (verdi) to metal musings (with a little help from brian and roger eno and bill wyman) and lends music muscle to the screen's bloody gristle. the sound design give you all that you need from stabbings to gunshots, fire to screams and masterfully remastered on the anchor bay disc in glorious 6.1 for every crunch and caw. audio: 5 of 5technical: the editing keeps the film flowing and moving wonderfully. combined with the camera-work, the editing help keeps the surreal dreamy imagery flowing. the exquisite opera house is one hell of a location and perfect for staging the horror version of macbeth. one can't end a review of an argento film without having to comment on the kills. argento dispatches characters with glee this time around with a brilliant stabbing sequence, crow eye-gouging and the film highlight of a gun blast through a keyhole into the eye and out the back of the head shot that once again sends argento's ex-wife daria nicolodi to the movie morgue. priceless! technical: 5 of 5wrap-up: a nearly flawless giallo that suffers from a slightly unnecessary epilogue in switzerland that delivers all the visual thrills that argento fans crave.overall: 4 of 5

dario argento is a filmmaker i'm slowly getting into, following the iconoclastic efforts of deep red and suspiria; he's not a filmmaker to always care directly about silly things like "plot". that might be his one minor (but, for me, apparent) liability: he won't let a little thing like common sense screw up his plan for his elaborate killing sequences, as his killer(s) can go through any kind of elaborate set-up of being invisible, until revealing past the point of the pov tracking shots of said psychopathic killer. but it's thrilling to see a filmmaker take chances like this anyway, of a pure italian aesthetic making its way into the soul of a hitchcockian warp (in fact, as a note of interest, if one has recently seen the scorsese short film where he took three pages of an un-filmed hitchcock film, which also took place in an opera, argento had it beat by almost twenty years, probably with no knowledge of the text). it's also unabashedly 80s (cd players and heavy metal and the hair, oh my!) and with an absurdity that makes it all the more palatable to swallow.the story is simple: an opera of macbeth is being produced, with high-stylized pyrotechnics and trained ravens. there's even a talented up-and-coming star replaced at the last minute, betty, played by marsillach. but a murder occurs during the premiere- interrupted not by that but by a falling light- and now the killer is after betty! she can't go to the police (how can she let out that the opera is really cursed?), but will that matter in the face of a killer who won't let up? one has probably seen premises like this played out in other argento films- girl being chased by a killer- but it's how argento, like de palma, constructs and executes his sequences, and adds a distinctive flavor of his own to add touches of bizarre humor (the breakout of the ravens to attack the killer, and the subsequent version of pointing out in the lineup), a kind of over-stylization ala leone (the bullet through the peephole through the door probably inspired a similar shot in kill bill 1), and even sado-masochistic inspiration with the pins taped to betty's eyes, more than once! argento puts his actress through the wringer, and she's all game for it, even when things seem to just go into 'what-the-hell' territory (i was throwing up my hands almost saying i give up when she is led down the secret passage by the little girl, as if suddenly we're in aliens now). and through such dark genre material argento keeps the violence thick and fresh, the suspense about as much as that with opera music coming right out of a speaker of a stereo system, and a cinematographer who may have had a few drinks (and rightfully so!) during some scenes the way they're shot and vibrate to a heart-beat. it should be considered trash, but it's elevated past any limitations of the genre by the ballsy attitude of the director, this in spite of a silly ending- sillier than anything that preceded what came before it (thanks little lizard)- and an attempt to break the macbeth curse, which, unfortunately, didn't seem to happen in real life on the set of opera. 8.5/10

i consider myself a casual fan of dario argento. for every really good flick by him (such as "deep red" and "tenebre"), there seems to be one that's equally uninspired (his output since "opera" has tended to disappoint). still, there's no denying that when he's at his best, there are few horror directors who can top him. i consider "opera" to be argento's finest work.this is definitely the film where all of his trademarks are present. there's no well-developed characters and the plot makes very little sense once you begin to scrutinize it. still, think of argento as an european equivalent of brian depalma - the style is all that matters here, so much it becomes the substance. typical to argento, there's some beautifully filmed murder sequences. those unfamiliar with the man's work may perceive that as a sadistic remark (and it may be, considering the often time misogyny of them), but its really true. argento stages murder with an intricacy to eye-popping visual detail. he truly makes graphic violence an art form. plus, his direction and the look of his films is impeccable.fortunately, "opera" is one of his most frightening products. argento is the only director whom i feel booming rock music works well for horror sequences (when others attempt to pull it off, it comes across as cheesy). the acting varies, with cristina marsillach playing a beautiful and reasonably sympathetic but never particularly animate young opera performer. the rest of the actors are workmanlike and get the job done, but again, with argento, the acting is never the point. its the beautiful colors, the terrifying violence, and the overall fever dream / nightmare atmosphere. (9/10)

one of his lesser known films, many horror fans have yet to catch this dario argento offering, which is unfortunate. it is underappreciated mostly because of the fact that really not enough people have seen it. the film boasts grade-a argento gore, with his customary close-ups set to savage rock scores. while it true that this script is not very complex, it is not nearly as bad as other entries in its genre, or his own personal resume for that matter.this movie symbolizes more of the 'dread' that he likes to portray in his films by his own admission. worth a good look on any night.

no matter how much it hurts me to say this,the movie is not as good as it could have been.maybe i was misled by the countless exaggerated reviews here on imdb,but i expected so much more...sure,the idea is a good one,the violent scenes and the camera-work are outstanding,the imagination of genius dario is breathtaking, but the movie is "soiled" by a couple of mistakes that i find unforgivable. first of all, am i one of the few people who feel that the heavy metal music played in the most intense scenes simply rips the atmosphere apart??? with a different kind of music (goblin????) during the "needle" scenes,it would have been soooo intense!... instead,the soundtrack destroys any chance for tension... secondly, the final killing scene and the last few moments of the movie are simply silly and uninspired. i don't want to say "amateurish", cause i love argento's movies.the ending left me feeling empty.talk about a final impression! this is hardly what happens in most of dario's films! though,admittedly,suspiria also suffers from a rushed finale (even if most of it is brilliant)....in short,watch this movie,try to make the most of its good points,but be prepared for some bad ones as well. this is not a perfect movie by any means.

betty is as an understudy in a production of verdi's macbeth who is asked to go on when the diva is hurt in a car accident. however, in the grand tradition of "the scottish play", the production seems cursed with problems, not least of which is some madman slicing up the crew. unfortunately for betty, the killer seems to have special plans for her ...this is one of several must-see argento mad-slasher flicks, in this instance primarily for the extraordinary photography by the great british cameraman ronnie taylor. i haven't measured it, but i reckon around two-thirds of the shots in this film involve either pans, dollies, tracking or cranes - the sheer amount of camera movement is just astonishing and makes the movie ten times more exciting than a standard thriller. the imagery is wild and dizzying - closeups of the heroine's eyes forced open with nails, a swooping glide around an opera house from a raven's point of view, shots of the killer's brain squirming, a bullet fired through a peephole, a swallowed chain dug out of a victim's trachea. conceptually it's just amazing and could only be realised by this director. the movie isn't without some shortcomings though; the cast are variable at best - marsillach and barberini are both a bit shaky (and his dubbing in the english version is appalling, even by italian standards), although argento regular nicolodi is fun and charleson gives a thoughtful performance in a role that is more than a little autobiographical (a horror director much maligned for his remoteness and reliance on technique). the material is a nice three-way mix of the phantom of the opera, shakespeare and slasher flick, scripted by argento and his usual collaborator, franco ferrini, with shifty suspects galore and the usual disdain for boring expository scenes to explain what's actually going on. full of all sorts of different music - brian eno, claudio simonetti, bill wyman, puccini, and of course, verdi. the scenes in the beautiful opera-house were shot at the teatro regio in parma. for some bizarre reason the uk print of this movie has the alternative title terror at the opera.

often considered argento's last "great" film, this entry into the giallo canon is unquestionably better than any argento film that has followed it (though i have yet to see "mother of tears"), but to call it his last "great" film might be stretching it a bit.the directorial and stylistic flourishes - the hallmark of all argento films - is indeed present, with some of his sequences of suspense ranking up with his best (the "peephole" sequence is especially memorable), and the cinematography by ronnie taylor is outstanding (the fluorescent lighting is beautiful).however, the narrative - which is hit and miss in all of argento's films - is missing here. there is indeed a potent sense of mystery and intrigue, but the plot resorts to what is essentially a string of murder sequences, with one following the another, leaving no real time to fully construct a right, focused mystery to be solved. all of this results in a climax that is... well... anti-climatic, as the film did not invest enough interest to make us truly care.regardless, this is recommended simply due to the masterful direction and beautiful imagery that argento evokes. i wouldn't' recommend this as a starting point for argento's films, however (for that, i would recommend either "deep red" or "suspiria"), but if you enjoyed those, or even any giallo, then this is a very good addition to your viewing repertoire.

i did not expect to enjoy this. in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but wasn't credited. knowing dylan thomas, and really being appreciative of his poetry but aware and rather disconcerted by the man, i didn't feel i needed to see a twee adaption of his lame bohemian life laid bare. and this was not it. critical and yet appreciative it was. it made me cry. kiera knightley was superb, even with that slightly strained welsh accent,and it is a sad tale that they tell. dylan thomas is not the hero as sadly he was not throughout his life and neither really are the so called 'feisty woman' of the pr spiel. it is cillian the william of the movie. a man that leaves the woman he loves to fight a war that they ignore. his challenge to reoonnect with that indifference is what is of real interest to this film and what a beautiful performance from that actor. i thiink this film is underrated because it was marketed so badly. dylan thomas fans will expect something more from their so very flawed hero and get less, and well that is how it was marketed. it is not a film about dylan thomas and it is much more interesting for it.

horror-genius dario argento is one of my personal favorite directors, and his films "suspiria", "phenomena" and "profondo rosso" range high on my personal all-time favorite list. "opera" of 1987 is yet another tantalizing and brilliant film that no horror lover can afford to miss, and that will keep you on the edge of your chair from the beginning to the end. this stunning and ultra-violent giallo could well be described as the master's nastiest film, which is quite something considering that argento's films are not exactly known for the tameness of their violence. the violence is extreme and very stylized in a brilliant way that makes opera a film censor's nightmare.- warning! spoilers ahead! - just when betty (christina marsillach), a young opera singer, is becoming successful, a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath starts stalking her... the murders are truly brutal, and of particularly sadistic nature. the killer attaches needles to the tied up betty's eyelids, so she has to keep them open and watch while he brutally murders people close to her in abhorrent ways. when done with the butchering, the killer releases betty and leaves, just to come back for other friends of hers...as usual for argento's films, the violence is extremely graphic and very stylized. "opera" truly is a brutal film, and what a stylish and atmospheric film it is. this film is absolutely tantalizing and pure suspense from the beginning to the end. the performances are entirely very good, especially christina marsillach is brilliant in the lead. a stunning beauty and great actress alike, marsillach fits perfectly in her role of the talented singer, whose fear and horrid experiences are slowly making her crazy. other great performances include those of ian charleston as a horror film director who is directing an opera, and director argento's real-life girlfriend daria nicolodi, who has a role in many of his movies. the camera work is excellent as in all argento films and the huge opera house is an excellent setting that contributes a lot both to the film's beauty and its permanently creepy atmosphere. the score, which is partly classical music and partly heavy metal is great too, even though i slightly missed goblin's brilliant progressive rock soundtracks that are such a distinguishing element of most other argento movies. "opera" truly is a terrifying and absolutely breathtaking giallo experience. this is an absolute must-see for any horror lover, and i highly recommend it to any other film-fan who is not too sensitive when it comes to extreme violence. excellent and absolutely tantalizing!

beware the scottish play! in his riveting and harrowing opera, dario argento returns to classic form, regaining the composure he lost while filming convoluted and delirious psycho- shockers like tenebre and phenomena. indeed, predicated on a simple narrative that is offset by opulent set pieces, imaginatively brutal murder sequences, and refined photography, the film feels like the argento we once knew. opera's only real infraction is its lack of a score by goblin, who provided unusual, iconic, and timeless music for many of argento's greatest films (the opera selections used here are wonderful, however).the production is filled out by several competent actors. while she's no jessica harper, annabella sciorra lookalike cristina marsillach manages enough pluck and compassion to grasp the role of the tortured heroine. ian charleson is interesting as horror-film-helmer- turned-opera-director marco. and daria nicolodi is fantastic as always, even in her relatively brief role (watch the making of featurette on the dvd for a hilarious interview with nicolodi about her role -- clearly brash and resentful over the end of her relationship with argento!) fans of stage fright (another excellent 1987 giallo, directed by michele soavi, who served as the second unit director for opera) will barely recognize the final girl from that film, barbara cupisti, as a stage manager here (i think it's the glasses that do it).with me, it's often the little things that matter, and argento's fascination/obsession with solitary nightmarish images makes him my ideal filmmaker. opera is full of minor details that left me smirking. for instance, i love that we never see "the great" mara czekova's face. i also love the scene where the killer is scraping the tip of his/her deadly sharp dagger across a television screen showing betty's performance as lady macbeth. finally, i defy even the most grizzled slasher veterans not to cringe as the "pin grates" are placed over betty's eyes.in short, opera is a clean, tense, and taut thriller. with its solid performances, lucid focus, and literate cinematography, it begs to be in the same league as deep red and the bird with the crystal plumage. might opera be the last great giallo?

being both a dario argento fan and a phantom of the opera fan, i was dying to see his first take on the story, before the so-bad-it's-good "dario argento's phantom of the opera". the film is just terrific, even the plot, which here is one of argento's best at a coherent story. the way he turns a classic romance story into a creepy slasher is just terrific. the film has a very nightmarish feel, which helps on keeping you on the edge of your seat. the colors have never been better in an argento film since the jaw-dropping "suspiria". the murders are clever and gory, all done in argento's trademark style. the thing with the eyes in this film is just unsettling, and done some much better than in fulci's splatter. the acting is so-so, but once you seen the movie more times you understand the characters' motivations better, and you get used to it. my two biggest complains about it is the use of rock music. i think it was a clever idea to mix beautiful opera fragments with heavy-metal, but it's not executed very well here. the ending is very disappointing, which is the worst thing about the movie, seeming to echo argento's previous "phenomena", but done terribly, it just didn't need to end that way. the same thing happened in the director's cut of "the exorcist". i wished they kept the original ending. but still it's a fantastic motion picture and really a must-see, if only for daria nicolodi's memorable murder sequence.

an opera diva has an accident, which leaves the door open for her understudy to take over the role. betty (marsillach) is now the star of mac beth, but someone hiding in the trenches has an opera of his own planned out. he gets his kicks out of tying betty up, putting needles under her eyes (so she cant close them) and murdering members of the opera company before her very eyes."opera" is certainly one of argento's more ambitious films, like mixing it up with shakesphere's macbeth there is of course the fact that the opera performed in the film is giuseppe verdi's version of macbeth but also argento, just like shakespeare uses ravens as an omen of death and misfortune. and like the ravens circling the castle dunsinane, foreboding the demise of the scheming macbeth, the ravens in opera play a key part in the downfall of the killer. furthermore just like in the old play the murderer acts on the exhortation of his lover. but i don't want to go as far as saying opera is intended to be a remake of the either the phantom of the opera or macbeth, the similarities are far too subtle. it's just a typical argento masterstroke, and with it he gives this otherwise quite basic thriller a vivid hue of gothic mystique.although this movie does have it downsides like the heavl metal soundtrack just doesn't fit in with this movie and the final scenes in this movie are a bit strange.all in all "opera" is something of a flawed masterpiece but still good.

after the lead actress of the opera is killed in a car accident, her young understudy, betty, is brought to the forefront. that's very lucky for her, with one problem: she has an admirer that has decided he will kill all her friends and make her watch. what is his connection to the opera, and what is his fascination with betty? i love dario argento with every part of my body. and i'm not an orthodox fan, i think. many people, particularly critics, praise his earlier work ("suspiria" and "deep red") but really frown on later films, such as "sleepless", which i liked. my favorite, "phenomena", is usually vastly underrated. "opera" tends to fall somewhere in between. some consider it one of his last great films, others see it as part of his so-called decline. i loved it.the picture is crisp, the music is great (unlike other critics, i love the metal soundtrack), the female lead is someone i can feel for (not unlike jennifer connelly from "phenomena"). and the imagery... wonderful. great cinematography, and some amazing kill scenes. the concept of taping needles to a person's eyes so they cannot blink... brilliant. my assistant tina thinks this looked fake, but even if it does, the idea is more than enough to pay off. and some great effects, like a knife blade coming up inside a man's mouth? awesome.jim harper calls the film "stunning" and calls attention to the "innovative cinematography, well-constructed shots and exceptionally violent murders." i agree with this completely -- one shot follows the camera through winding tunnels, and there is a very interesting visual use of crows throughout the story. mike mayo likewise calls it "visually fascinating eye-candy" and lauds the "crisp editing and flowing camera-work". it's really a wonder that this is not one of argento's more highly-praised works.argento returned to the opera with "phantom of the opera", which was a bit of a failure despite the casting of his daughter asia and julian sands. even more interesting, this same year offered the release of michele soavi's "stagefright", which (like "opera") has a killer loose inside a theater killing off the people involved with the presentation. both are great films, with soavi's more on the slasher side. (soavi actually served as second unit director on "opera"... you can make your own conclusions.) my only complaint with this film is the length and pacing. while it is very beautifully shot and the kill scenes are glorious, they are not as frequent as they should be. the first one takes over a half hour, and then we get down times between them. the lead actress should be in constant terror, but she is given time between kills to calm down as if everything is normal again. not cool, dario. we need to keep the suspense low and the intensity high.

even if it's not labeled as a slasher flick, it has all the elements. the fact that slashers are well known for it's low budget, lame plot, cheesy effects, and everything you may add, it doesn't means that there can't be good slasher movies. "opera" fills the description. even though it's part of italian giallo; which is far from being a slasher sub-genre.dario argento proves that he deserves the label of one of the best directors in horror. "opera" is one of the most stylish horror movies from the past 30 years. though the movie takes place in a beautiful, shinning place; the situations and gore turns it to be one of the scariest places ever used in a horror movie. i think of "opera" as a stylish slasher although there's in depth plot and character development. the cheese factor often used in most slasher flicks is not present here but in exchange we got a suspenseful, visually stunning gore tale. the movie's plot is simple (as in every slasher). there's a psycho in the opera that is somewhat obsessed with the lead actress/singer and forces her to watch gruesome deaths. the death scenes are extremely gruesome and are the best thing about the movie. the infamous "peep-hole" death scene is the highlight of the movie in my opinion. it's a terrific death scene that none other than argento could release. the knife through the neck (and mouth) is another gruesome scene but less violent than the scissors death. the gore in "opera" will please the wicked and lovers of violence.what i didn't like about the movie is the lack of coherence or logic. i mean, after watching the first death, the lead female, calmed as if nothing happened gets a ride home and doesn't makes much of a big deal about what she saw. also, she's left alone in home and doesn't take security measures. still, the suspense in the movie makes you forget the lack of logic. argento knows how to create tension and how to scare the subconscious. for example, when betty's friend tells her that someone was watching her from outside she freaks out and sets suspense in case that something happens. the direction of the movie is great. for an italian giallo it's excellent. argento's creative pov shots are impressive. the ravens also added a creepy feeling to the movie. argento add his unique spice. "opera" is one of the most underrated but popular through the horror community for these reasons, in my opinion: -the peep-hole death scene (brilliant) -the ravens attack in the end -the opera setting -the knife through the neck and mouth -the heavy metal score combined with opera music (this music never freaked me out before) -the killer's ferocitythe only thing i don't like about "opera" is the heavy metal songs used in death scenes. it's ok to disturb the audience but i think that the opera music could've added a creepier feeling. still, the "shocking" use of heavy metal is a singular disturbing aspect in the movie.watch "opera" even if you don't like gore. there's a lot of suspense and tension that could scare the most skeptical person. this is no "suspiria" but it deserves to be among argento's finest.

this film flopped miserably in the uk, and it didn't deserve to. the trailer of this film is slightly misleading, and i guess it mislead critics and audiences into thinking it was "atonement: part 2". while the film was marketed that way to capitalise on the earlier success of joe wright's bafta-winning film, it's very different in tone. it focuses on an imagination of sorts of welsh poet dylan thomas' life during the second world war as the writer of propaganda films for the war effort, and his subsequent return to wales. director john maybury quickly introduces dylan's (matthew ryhs) childhood sweetheart vera phillips, played by keira knightley. she was dylan's first love in their homeland, but the moment has passed, and singer vera only wants it as a beautiful memory. or does she? vera unexpectedly strikes up a close bond with the other woman in dylan's life, "queen of ireland, love of my life, mother of my child" caitlin thomas (sienna miller). the three form a sort of menage a trois in war-struck london, but vera then falls for a dashing soldier, william killick (cillian murphy). they quickly marry, with killick leaving for war. a frightened vera convinces the thomas' to return witb her to wales, but the three are faced with the realism of the birth of vera's child, william's jealousy and shell-shock after returning home, and caitlin realising she cannot share dylan with her best friend.filmed on a low budget, this is more of a mood piece than anything else. it works best as a realisation that some memories and feelings need to be treasured but not renewed. the performance of sienna miller is particularly excrellent (unfortunately the paparazzi nonsense detracts from the fact thats she's quite a talent), and knightley and murphy are once again very good. the let-down is rhys as dylan, who, while the welsh poet himself was no bed of roses, lacks charisma and makes us wonder what these women see in dylan. the writing is very choppy, some beautiful moments interspersed with sloppiness. it's certainly worth watching, however.

"opera" is one of the greatest achievements in horror genre. this masterful picture has everything what should be in the pure horror movie:good, captivating story, a lot of symbols, wonderful visuals and plenty of gore. the killings are very shocking and bloody. an unforgettable atmosphere of dread and fear. a must-see for a true argento fan, so if you get a chance watch it.

betty is an understudy for the lead in a production of verdi's macbeth. when a car mysteriously hits the lead, betty is thrust into the spotlight. opening night is a smashing success and betty decides to leave the after-party to celebrate in private with her boyfriend. but when the boyfriend leaves the room, betty is grabbed from behind by an unknown black-gloved, masked figure. the unknown assailant ties betty to a column, gags her, and places needles under her eyes that will cause incredible damage and pain should betty close them. the boyfriend returns to the room and is stunned to see betty in such a predicament. he's even more shocked when the killer grabs him and shoves a knife through his lower jaw with such force, the tip of the knife can clearly be seen in his mouth. and betty has been forced to watch all of this. so begins betty's terrifying ordeal with a killer not just intent on hurting her, but also on forcing her to watch as he mutilates her friends.opera gets classified as a giallo, but to me, it differs in quite a few ways from the model. less emphasis is placed on the mystery elements of the story than in something like argento's tenebre or the bird with the crystal plumage. the black-gloved, masked killer may be omnipresent, but the clues and red herrings normally associated with a good giallo are absent. instead, opera is all about the tension of an unknown killer and making the audience uncomfortable. the focus is on the grisly death scenes, betty's fear, and the killer's obsession with betty.opera features what i think are some of argento most artistic death scenes. when the killer grabs betty after her boyfriend leaves the room, you're sure that betty's had it. but the sadistic killer only wants to force betty to watch as he brutally stabs her lover in the neck  the knife emerging in his mouth. it's a well shot and designed scene. and those needles in the eyes  brilliant. or, take the death of the seamstress. at first her death seems like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill murder. but when the seamstress accidentally swallows the killer's locket, what started out as just another death scene turns it up a notch as the killer uses a pair of scissors to cut the girl's throat open to get his chain. finally, there's the most famous death scene in opera that i'm amazed with each time i see it  mira is shot in the eye while peering through a keyhole. that scene displays a lot of what i like about argento. it's got style to burn. as implausible as it may be, it's creative, memorable, and a blast to watch.argento certainly wasn't the first italian director to concentrate on eye mutilation, but in opera, he's taken eye trauma to a new level. needles holding eyes open, a bullet in the eye, and ravens pecking out an eye are all part of argento's vision (pun intended). and these scenes do have the effect that i believe argento was going for. the first time i saw the killer putting those needles in betty's eyes, i couldn't stop blinking. it actually had a physical effect on me. what is it about the eyes that make them such a target for abuse in italian films? to be fair (and not sound like such a fanboy), there are problems i have with opera that keep me from rating it as argento's best. one of my problems is with the air duct system running through betty's apartment building. while i don't doubt there are air duct systems in older apartment buildings that connect the apartments, the ducts in opera are huge. i'm no expert, but i sincerely doubt any building like the one in this movie would have had such mammoth air ducts. it doesn't seem practical at all. and don't you think someone would have done something about them long ago to keep criminals and nosey neighbors out of the other apartments? it's convenient for the plot, but it's not very realistic.but i suppose my major problem with the film comes with the finale. what's up with that ending? it feels totally out of place, tacked on, and like a bad afterthought. i'm not sure what else to say other than it's horrible.

although many have mixed feelings about this latter day giallo thriller from argento, it still stands as another lavish testament to the cinematic brilliance that is argento.a young opera singer has her first break out performance and suddenly finds herself the subject of obsession for a crazed maniac.in a way, opera is like a modern-day giallo take on phantom of the opera blended with all the glorious style and color that one would expect dario argento to deliver. argento makes terrific use of inventive camera techniques, reoccurring symbols (like those ravens!), gothic atmosphere, and truly gruesome murder sequences. one scene especially (which involves a peep hole and a gun) will knock viewers right out of their seats! story-wise the film also manages to be gripping with some strong suspense and given great atmosphere by claudio simonetti's gorgeous music score.the cast does some satisfying performances. cristina marsillach is good as our leading lady. the late ian charleson does a nice turn as the director, as does urbano barberini as an investigator, daria nicolodi as marsillach's agent, and william mcnamara as marsillach's ill-fated lover. opera is terrific latter day argento, and perhaps the last of his great works. it's sure to please his fans and even create some new ones.**** out of ****

i've noticed that a lot of people are taking opera to task for the way betty reacts to the murders. i think they are basing these complaints on how they imagine a "normal" person would react. the thing is...betty is not a "normal" person, due to traumatic events in her childhood. she has problems way way before the movie ever even starts...and by the end of opera...in my opinion...she has become totally unhinged.---------------------spoilers--------------------------------------- you have to keep in mind that when she was a very small child she witnessed her mother's lover commit at least one brutal murder while her sadomasochist mother was getting off watching it.she was raised by a woman who achieves sexual release tied up watching girls get hacked, slashed, and strangled to death. that does not make for a healthy home life. i think it's pretty easy to conclude that her mother would have employed all sorts of emotional manipulation and negative reinforcement to ensure that her daughter never snitched on her. it is also likely that at her impressionable age, betty might have been deeply confused by what she saw. is this just something that adults do, etc.betty obviously looks up to her mother...i mean...she's become an opera singer just like her. if mommy likes it it can't be bad, can it...mommy can't be bad, can she? she couldn't tell the police on her mommy or this mysterious hooded fellow she associates with mommy.betty has a lot of deep-seated emotional issues. her mind has for years been trying to block out the memory of what she saw her mother doing...but it keeps coming to the surface, manifesting itself in the form of horrible nightmares, skull-throbbing migraines, a dependence on relaxation techniques, and sexual frigidity she associates brutal violence/bloody death with sex on a subconscious level. there's an inner struggle between the part of betty that has confused murder/sex and the part of her which believes these things to be wrong.after she's seen her boyfriend murdered by the hooded man...she calls the police, yet is unwilling to give her name. the part of her that thinks murder is wrong forces her to make the call, but the part that is ambivalent won't allow her to admit personal involvement. the ambivalent part of her takes control before she can go all the way. so she walks away from the phone in the rain...and when she's picked up by the director she's acting surprisingly calm, not as upset as you would think a "normal" person would be...because the part of her that's been blocking stuff since she was a child is trying its damnedest to block the horror of what she's just witnessed.the state of affairs in her life all contribute to an impasse within betty's psyche. her singing career is starting to bear fruit...she's going to be a great opera singer like her mother was. but is she going to become like her mother in all ways? in the darker ways? or will she be able to make her own path? add this to the re-emergence of the hooded man murdering everyone around her.it's not until the hooded man kills daria nicolodi's character that betty really takes an active role in defeating the killer. here's someone who loves betty, who's supported her wholeheartedly in her emerging career, who is in fact a maternal figure in betty's life now since mommy's dead. imagine how terrible it would be to lose your real mother and then to see the woman who is the closest thing you have to a mother get shot through the eyeball.i could go on...but i won't. the main gist of what i'm saying is that the character of betty is a lot more complex than most of the reviewers on here have been willing to acknowledge.opera is one of argento's best...and not just for the visuals alone (although they are truly magnificent) and not just for the inventive murders (although they are). there is a depth here...and attention needs to be paid.

when i was growing up, voyage into space was my most favorite movie. i remember the time when ktla (channel 5) ran the movie for the whole week and me and my sisters watched it every single day! i still remember every part of that movie. the ending was so sad when giant robot got blown up along with guillotine and then watching johnny sokko with all the tears running down his face calling for giant robot. there should have been a sequel to the movie, in which giant robot somehow survived the explosion. :) i can't believe that there are so many other voyage into space fans still out there. i really want to buy the movie when it comes out on dvd, but my sister said that the ones out there now are bootlegged and probably bad quality copies of the movie. i don't know why they haven't released it yet, since it's been over 40 years now. i think voyage into space was made back in 1968. only now, my second favorite japanese monster movie of all time (the war of the gargantuas) is finally coming to dvd and being released on sept. 9th and i can't wait! :) now if only they would do the same with voyage into space. giant robot, johnny sokko, and voyage into space will never be forgotten! in my eyes and probably many others too, it will always be a childhood classic to me! :)

keira knightley and sienna miller stars in the story of two of the women in the life of dylan thomas. knightley is thomas's boyhood sweetheart he re-encounters during the blitz. meeting at a bar they reconnect, however things become complicated when thomas' brings his wife (miller) along the next time he meets her. the women hit it off and things proceed at pace until the trio are joined by the man who will become knightly's husband. this further complicates things as jealousy begins to show its face.beautiful to look at, extraordinarily written and wonderfully acted (everyone disappears completely into their roles) this is a sumptuous feast for the eyes and the ears. it's so nice to see a film about adults being adults. on a purely visceral level i really enjoyed watching the film because the film is so artistically pleasing. rarely have i ever seen a film that is this beautifully crafted.the trouble with the film is i'm not entirely sure of everything that happened. something seemed to be missing and a couple of times i had to replay the film to see if i missed something. its not bad, but its not completely satisfying as a result. (i tried to look up on line to see how much of the film is true but i couldn't find anything) still i think this is a film worth seeing. it's a beautiful film for adults with probably the best acting the leads have done.

welsh poet dylan thomas excused from serving in active duty is doing his bit for the war effort producing bits of prose for some propaganda branch of government in whitehall.thomas is portrayed as a freethinker believing in free love married to a woman with an equally demanding artistic streak and likewise with a penchant for extramarital romance. thomas writing and reciting his poetry in systematic domestic mayhem throughout becomes somewhat priggish towards the end, resting somewhat uncomfortably on his society connections and pulling rank on a war veteran, who had shot up his house, and who was incidentally married to the woman he had been having an affair with.the real story of this film is the love of two women, one (keira knightley) whose first love was thomas (matthew rhys), the second (sienna miller) who is thomas's wife. at times it reminds of the singing detective, as in very good television with slightly sinister overtones laid on top of scenes of surreal camp absurdity.

where would hollywood have been without fredric march as robert browning or dennis price as lord byron, famous lovers in their day? even an actor as normally straitlaced as michael redgrave once brought some moody charm to a portrayal of w.b. yeats. writers' lives are an endless source of inspiration.but of all poets it was dylan thomas, the roistering, free-loving welshman who enjoyed a pint or two (and drank himself to death in new york at the age of 39), who was closest in spirit to the film industry. during world war ii, he produced scripts for british propaganda documentaries. he even wrote the screenplay of a vapid melodrama called the three weird sisters, in which three old maids in a welsh village plot the murder of their rich half-brother. all that is now forgiven.in john maybury's the edge of love, thomas is played by the welsh actor matthew rhys. it's not a full-scale biopic. the film covers four years in the poet's life during world war ii, when he lived with two women: his wife caitlin (sienna miller) and a former lover vera phillips (keira knightley), whom he met again by chance during the war. it seems he loved them both. the relationship of these extraordinary women -- to thomas and to each other -- is at the heart of maybury's absorbing film.how it came to be made is a story almost as remarkable as that of the lovers themselves. rebekah gilbertson, the film's producer, is the granddaughter of vera phillips and william killick. william, a war hero (played in the film by cillian murphy), married vera while she was still in love with the poet. gilbertson was inspired to make the film when she discovered a book about her grandparents, dylan thomas: a farm, two mansions and bungalow, by david thomas, describing their tangled lives. sharman macdonald, who wrote the screenplay, is the mother of knightley. the part requires knightley to sing, and her mother included songs especially for her. surely no film with such felicitous family connections deserves to do other than succeed.we begin in london during the blitz. bombs are falling, sirens are wailing, and phillips is singing to sheltering crowds in an underground tube station. in a pub, by chance, she meets thomas and discovers after all these years that he has a wife and child. phillips and caitlin form a friendship untroubled by jealousy or rancour and are soon sharing beds and bathtubs, listening to thomas read his poems, exchanging intimate secrets and smoking their heads off, as everyone did in wartime. caitlin turns out to be more experienced in the ways of the world ("my first was augustus john, he seduced me when i was 15"). but it's the refined and soulful phillips who stirs thomas's deepest responses and eventually succumbs to his charms. in the meantime, she has reluctantly married killick, who has seen her in the tube station and been instantly captivated by her beauty (if not her singing).it is an intense and strangely beautiful film, though thomas himself may be its least impressive character. he is best remembered for under milk wood, his verse radio play about a day in the life of the mythical welsh village of llareggub, whose name spelt backwards was not something polite english teachers drew attention to. i once had a vinyl recording of richard burton reading the poem (he appeared in a film of under milk wood in 1971), and i've never forgotten the creamy, seductive quality of his voice. the legendary charisma, the magnetism of the man, is something i missed in rhys's performance. thomas comes across as a strangely pallid, even secondary, figure compared with the women in his life.in his previous film, love is the devil, maybury explored the turbulent life of painter francis bacon and his sadomasochistic relationship with his lover and model, george dyer. the edge of love seems to me a richer and more satisfying film. if you ask what insights it offers into the springs of thomas's creative inspiration, i would have to say llareggub. but as an insight into his egotism, his smouldering moods and his general indifference to the feelings of others, it is wonderfully sad and revealing.thomas had a good war, boozing and writing while other men (including killick) were being traumatised by the horrors of battle. in one scene near the end, thomas's behaviour towards his friends seems unforgivably callous. but this is not, after all, thomas's film. murphy gives us a magnificent study in doomed passion and the emotional debilitation of war. miller is charming and pathetic as the wife. and knightley looks almost too exquisitely delicate to be real (as she did in pride and prejudice). but this is probably her finest performance. and in every respect the film is worthy of her.

i just saw this at the toronto international film festival in the beautiful elgin theatre. i was blown away by the beautiful cinematography, the brilliant adaptation of a very tricky play and last but not least, the bravura performance of al pacino, who was born to play this role, which was perfectly balanced by an equally strong performance from jeremy irons.the film deftly explores the themes of love vs loyalty, law vs justice, and passion vs reason. some might protest that the content is inherently anti-semitic, however they should consider the historical context of the story, and the delicate and nuanced way in which it is told in this adaptation.9/10

the inherent problem with any staging of 'the merchant of venice' has never been the pseudo-controversial anti-semitism, but the fact that there are two story lines wildly different in both tone and content; a frothy romantic comedy and a searing tragedy. while mixing genres was all the rage in the sixteenth century (and mocked by shakespeare in hamlet), it rarely fails to grate with modern audiences. as a result, most directors are forced to place an emphasis on one storyline at the expense of the other, and it is no surprise that the decision falls in the favour of shylock.like so many of shakespeare's great tragic heroes, shylock continues to fascinate after 400 years because he is such a difficult and complex character. pitiful, proud, angry, vengeful, weak, arrogant; his behaviour defies simply analysis and continues to be argued over. he is flawed not because he is a jew, but because he is human. rarely do modern screenwriters imbue their creations with such richly textured contradictions, and it is to everyone's benefit that we have shakespeare to draw on for inspiration.shakespearean language is wild and rambling, saturated in multiple meanings, word play and metaphor. to be understood it must be wrangled and tamed by an actor with the strength and knowledge to do so. when an actor fails, the words pour forth in a torrent of incomprehensible words, but when he succeeds, the english language springs to life with an immediacy and vibrancy that takes your breath away. al pacino is one such actor, and here displays an incredible level of clarity and control that, were there any justice, would sweep every award in the offering. he meets the challenge of presenting shylock head on, and delivers an extraordinarily subtle and nuanced performance. it would be a crime if we never got the opportunity to see what he does with king lear.the supporting cast is noteworthy. jeremy irons gives an original take on the familiar antonio, presenting an older, quieter figure that displays the unsavoury contradictions between medieval chivalry and ugly prejudice of the time. joseph fiennes is a revelation as he matures beyond superficial eye-candy to actually inhabit a character for once. lynn collins is the only disappointment. many of shakespeare's women are underwritten and require an actor to really work hard to bring them to life, and collins' gwyneth paltrow impersonation seems a little flat and unsuited to the darker tone that radford is aiming for.the design team must be acknowledged for creating a unique and thoroughly believable vision of late renaissance venice. the city has not looked this ominous since 'don't look now'. taking full advantage of extant locations and natural light, the film has an appearance of authenticity that is greatly enhanced by the dark and timeworn costume design. all, again, are worthy of award recognition.the financial backers of films such as this must be commended. with a budget of $30 million, they must go into such a venture in the full and certain knowledge that they will never make a profit, and yet they invest nonetheless. we can all be grateful for it, as the result is a remarkable adaptation that is sure to be a benchmark for many years to come.

michael radford has done an excellent job bringing this difficult play to the screen. he has taken a play with a reputation for anti-semitism, and shown us that shakespeare knew quite well the humanity of the jews. radford said after the screening, and i agree, that shylock is his first tragic hero, the first of his characters to be undone by a driving, compulsive need for revenge. he also points out, quite rightly, that a man who was anti-semitic could not have written shylock's speech of "if you prick me, do i not bleed?" radford is himself of jewish descent and he has picked out the good and bad of all characters with delicacy and honesty. no character is free from flaws; no character is evil. radford has placed the play in the 16th century, which gives a lush background of venetian politics and decadence on which to project shakespeare's words.if you get a chance to hear radford speak about the film, i highly recommend you take it, since he gives details about life in 16th century venice that illuminate a lot of the choices he made and give considerable extra depth to the viewing. i'm hoping that the dvd will come out with extensive commentary.jeremy irons does a gorgeous portrayal of antonio, a man who resigns himself to bearing the burden of his past misdeeds. lynn collins, a relative unknown, gives us an absolutely flawless, stunning, and detailed job as portia. not only is ms. collins beautiful - she also gives portia layers of intelligence and humor prior to the trial scene i've rarely seen in any production of this play. the rest of the cast also does a terrific job, with a notable performance by kris marshall as gratiano, and a beautifully subtle work by allan corduner as tubal, playing the foil to shylock. finally, while al pacino pulls out his usual strong (and loud) performance, his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he says no words, but you can see all the emotions and madnesses flowing into and out of him as he perceives his fortunes changing.if you like period movies, i cannot recommend this movie enough.

'the merchant of venice' is one of shakespeare's better-known plays and is still regularly performed in the theatre. incredibly, however, this film would seem to be the first-ever english-language version made for the cinema rather than television. there were a number of versions made in britain or america during the early days of the cinema, but these were all silents.the reason for this neglect of the play may be connected with sensitivities about the play's alleged anti-semitism, a subject which has been even more sensitive since the rise to power of the nazis in 1933. (this may explain why all previous versions were made during the silent era; in 1908 or 1922 it would have been easier to portray shylock as a straightforward villain than it would be today). yet in my view the film is not anti-semitic at all. it should be remembered that during shakespeare's lifetime there was no settled jewish community in england; the jews had been expelled by edward i in the late 13th century, and were not permitted to return until the time of cromwell, some forty years after shakespeare's death. as far as we know, shakespeare never travelled abroad, so it seems quite possible that he himself never knew any jews personally or experienced the effects of anti-semitism at first hand. the play is not simply about the jewish question, but is, among other things, an analysis of the corrosive effects of religious prejudice. it may, in fact, be a coded examination of the mutual antipathy between catholics and protestants in tudor england (something of which shakespeare certainly would have had first-hand experience) and an appeal for greater tolerance between them.then as now, traditional anti-semitic stereotypes had always depicted jews as avaricious, but shylock's principal sin is not avarice; if it were, he would certainly have accepted bassanio's offer to pay him six thousand ducats, twice the amount borrowed by antonio. rather, shylock's besetting sin is anger, and the root of his anger is the way in which he and his fellow-jews are treated by the christians of venice. not only are jews in general regarded as second-class citizens, but jewish moneylenders such as shylock are particular targets for abuse, even though the services they provide are necessary to the venetian economy. the play shows the corrupting effects of prejudice. not only do views of this sort corrupt the christians who hold them, they can also corrupt the jews who suffer abuse. shylock's vindictiveness is out of all proportion to the wrongs he has suffered. by spitting on him and calling him a dog, antonio behaves like a boorish bigot, but boorishness and bigotry are not generally regarded as crimes deserving of the death penalty. moreover, shylock seeks to revenge himself on antonio not merely for the undoubted wrongs that antonio has done towards him, but also for all the wrongs, real and imaginary, that he has suffered at the hands of the christian community, such as his daughter's marriage to lorenzo. it is to the credit of the film's director, michael radford and of its star, al pacino, that they understand all these issues. pacino's shylock has, initially, a sort of angry dignity about him that gradually gives way to vindictive rage and finally, after his humiliation in the trial scene by portia's reasoning, to pathos. we see clearly that he has been the instrument of his own destruction, but we can still sympathise with him. in my view, none of pacino's performances that i have seen have ever equalled those he gave in the first two 'godfather' films (not 'scent of a woman', for which he won an oscar, and certainly not 'godfather iii'), but 'the merchant of venice is the one that comes closest to those benchmarks. the other acting performance that stood out was lynn collins's luminous portia, speaking her lines with great clarity and simplicity and bringing out the intelligence and resourcefulness that make her character more than simply a romantic heroine. i was less impressed with jeremy irons's antonio, who seemed too passive. antonio is a complex character; part loyal friend, part melancholy contemplative, part religious bigot and part enterprising capitalist. although irons captured the first two of those aspects, it was difficult to envisage his antonio either spitting on someone of a different faith or hazarding his all on risky trading ventures. radford's interpretation of the play was attacked by the film critic of the 'daily telegraph' who, although he admired pacino's performance, disliked the period setting and argued that shakespeare needs to be placed in a contemporary setting if it is to have 'relevance' for a modern audience, citing a recent stage production which set the action in weimar germany. i would disagree profoundly with this approach. the theatre and the cinema are quite different media and, while there have been some striking modernist approaches to shakespeare in the cinema (trevor nunn's 'twelfth night' comes to mind), a traditionalist approach is often the best one. (i preferred, for example, zeffirelli's 'romeo and juliet' to baz luhrmann's). the idea that we can only appreciate shakespeare in a modern guise is sheer intellectual laziness; we are not prepared to make the effort to see our greatest writer in the context of the elizabethan society that produced him, but rather prefer him dressed up as an ersatz twentieth-century man.radford's traditional approach not only enables us to appreciate that bigotry and vindictiveness are age-old, universal problems, but also makes for a visually striking film. in the play, the scenes set in venice itself are characterised by turbulent action; those set in portia's country house at belmont are happier and more peaceful. in the film, the venetian exterior scenes were shot on location against a backdrop of misty, wintry grey skies, similar to the look achieved in 'don't look now'. the candlelit interiors, with faces brightly lit against a dark background, were reminiscent of the chiaroscuro effects of a caravaggio painting; i suspect this was quite deliberate, as caravaggio was a contemporary of shakespeare. by contrast to dark or misty venice, the belmont scenes (shot in an enchanting palladian villa on an island in a lake) were characterised by sunshine or peaceful moonlight. this is one of the best shakespeare adaptations of recent years; an intelligent and visually attractive look at a complex play. 8/10.a couple of errors. we see a black swan on the water in front of portia's house. these birds are natives of australia and were not introduced to europe until well after 1596, the date when the film is set. also, the portrait of portia in the leaden casket is painted in the style of the florentine botticelli, who was active about a century before that date. lynn collins may be reminiscent of a botticelli beauty, but it seems unlikely that a late 16th century venetian lady would have had herself painted in the manner of late 15th century florence.

this movie has a decent story in my opinion,very good fight scenes but i was a little bit disappointed by the end of the movie.i think that it was a way better if lydie denier knew karate also or if she knew to use some weapons,her character has become more interesting too and she was a decent opponent to cynthia.i think when the director filmed the final 'battle' between cynthia&denier he wanted to finish the movie earlier so he didn't care how the end was going to be.all in all i think that fans of cynthia rothrock will be very satisfied watching this movie.it's not like 'yes,madam'! or sworn to justice but it was entertainment enough and cynthia looks awesome in this movie so my rate for this movie is a solid 8/10

when you think of golf movies, you think of caddyshack, but what if there are kids around? go right to this movie! disney uses is proved formula to make a movie that the adults and the kids will enjoy. the acting in this movie, in my opinion, is quite good and the leading cast, for the most part, is very young! this movie is also suprsingly filmed very well and unique, seeing all the angles of the golf game. i think this movie should be up for some academy awards for film editing or something like that because the entire flow of the film is top notch. though the ending might be a little predictable, the movie does well on its own! it also shows that you do not need swearing, nudity, or violence to make a great golf movie!

when i first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video. i finally got around and rented it. i thought it was going to be bad because i couldn't see shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show "even stevens". when i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes. it started a bit slow and i couldn't understand the beginning because the years didn't make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that. all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it. the cast was top notch and even though i'm not a fan of golf it easily kept my attention with a good plot.

if you like your sports movies to be about dignity and the best values then this'll work for you big time. oversentimental in places? sure, of course it is - and proud of it. it is the biggest and best ride in the carnival and should be enjoyed as that. big production values, simple telling, with creative shots: it is not complex, is a very nice and remarkably sweet film. it really feels like a labor of love from bill paxton; and i bet his son gets that.the build-up is slow enough to be enjoyed, the conflicts feisty, and the british vs. americans handled with a degree of vaudevillian villainy, but the dignity between the two main transatlantic protagonists is always to the fore. i have minor gripes: the score wants to be james horner but is too overblown, and there are too many close-ups, and panning shots for 2005, but if you want a straightforward, decent, and good-looking sports film then this is it.so here's the thing, and i feel like i know my film, but i actually liked it more than seabiscuit: which is a better film, but greatest story is simply disney at its core and hugely enjoyable! thanks, bill.

rainy day with not much to do. we were surfing the movie network channels and found this one just starting, so we gave it a chance.the more we watched, the more we became engrossed in the story. its the old story of working class underdog trying to make it in a sport which at the time (1913 i think) was usually played by the wealthy upper class but this movie was every bit as interesting as seabiscuit and this is also based on a true story.the acting is believable and the casting is brilliant. and . . . . we are not golfers, so please don't miss this one just because its about golf. any individual sport would serve the plot, because it's about the people. golf works well for this story because of the class distinction and snobbery that seem to involve some who play the game.bottom line . . . . its a feel good movie. it's well put together and isn't it always fun to see those who think they are better than others get taken down a peg or two.

with its ww2 timing, falling in and out of love, and easy on the eye kira, this is re-atonement. this a relationship story with focused main characters working out the the balance between first and fast love in the home front of ww2. poet dylan thomas philanders his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky blitz london and later in windy wales. vera's ex and next spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls bond and share. an easy watch that works well in the era bouncing along with just a few dips in pace. would work well with french subtitles but then i may have been to too many art house movies lately.

shia labeouf has impressed me before with his acting ability, but i can honestly say that i very much look forward to his next efforts...his portrayal of francis ouimet, a 20 year old caddy who ignores his father's insistence that golf is not his place in life and enters the 1913 us open tournament in his hometown...the beginning of the movie does drag a bit, but it's necessary to set up the underdog subplot that shia works so well...the entire cast is well-chosen and they work very well together in a story that, based on the actual event, has an ending everyone can discover before seeing the movie...but even knowing that information doesn't spoil the fun...josh flitter is delightful as eddie lowery, francis' caddy, who keeps him grounded and loose while at the same time proving to be an invaluable part of francis' effort...stephen delane is outstanding as harry vardon, the legendary british golfer who francis idolizes yet does not fear...and who knows the background francis comes from as he, too, had humble beginnings...bill paxton takes a formulaic movie and makes it worthwhile...bravo mr. paxton, and bravo to the cast...from the imagery to the story to the people who bring it alive, this is a movie to get, enjoy, and revel in...it's nice to have movies like this that we can feel good watching...

from the start of "the edge of love", the viewer is transported to the striking world of ww2 london. we follow the lives of four people who might have been created just for this movie, an exploration of female friendship and the strains caused on it by marriage and infidelity. except one of the characters is named dylan thomas, perhaps the greatest english poet of the 20th century. and his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish, but at times truly despicable. this movie is based on thomas' writings about love and romance. these were adapted with a sharp screenplay by sharman macdonald (keira knightley's mother). the director, john maybury, does claim that the three other lead characters were actual people. all four are performed very strongly. sienna miller is dylan's wife, keira knightley is the cabaret singer vera phillips. matthew rhys is dylan thomas, and cillian murphy is william killick. the first section of the movie takes place in london during the nazi air raids, with vera being pursued by willaim, a soldier waiting for deployment. by a chance encounter, dylan meets with his first love, vera. from there vera meets caitlin, dylan's wife. while the three are drinking, william successfully breaks vera's guard. the film follows their lives as vera and william are married and he is sent to war. vera has become pregnant, and returns to wales with dylan and caitlin. there they face a gritty existence, with vera supporting dylan and caitlin with her husband's war pay. through these times, vera's and caitlin's friendship grows. so does dylan's infatuation with vera. she gives in. this creates the first test for the two women. when william returns from war, he barely recognizes his wife, and has no bond with his infant son. things get worse, as dylan idly watches his friend struggle with battleground fatigue (post traumatic stress disorder). william realizes something has happened between dylan and vera, and in a drunken rage shoots up dylan's house."edge of love" starts as a stylish romance in war torn london and ends in the stark, gritty life of motherhood, infidelity, and attempted murder in wales. the treatment of ptsd is well done, and should speak to an american audience. some day (see ending).each star has a great moment. miller when she is yanking out stitches in her head in response to her abortion of another man's child. knightley and murpy when he finally bonds with his son. oh hell, almost all their scenes are awesome. and rhys when he purgers himself on the stand to get vera's husband sent to jail. yet, the real star of the movie is jonathan freeman's cinematography and john maybury's direction. they seem to understand that no matter how good the story or how historical thomas is, this is a film dominated by two great actresses of our time. and they cherish their scenes with stunning shots. while this isn't best picture material, it is a very good movie (much more engaging than "the dutchess"). it has a visual lyricism that accentuates the use of thomas' poetry. also, this is clearly knightley's second best performance of her career, and perhaps miller's best. i have always had a weakness for the artist in struggle, whether it's hulce's mozart, or hoffman's capote. but i was stunned at how little sympathy i felt for dylan thomas. his struggles with alcohol are well known. but his antagonism of william and caitlin to gain possession of his first love vera makes him out to be.....a bad man.so is this academy award worthy? clearly no. at least, not this year. it will be released state side in march, 2009, making it ineligible for the academies. this is 9 months after it was released in britain. between atonement, miss pettigrew, and brideshead revisited, the us has had its fill of ww2 british period pieces. too bad. this film is better then the other ones, except atonement. but in this one, knightley's soldier does come back, but as a shell of the man who left her.
