it may interest people to know that this film was made without any recourse to phoolan devi herself and, when she did finally see parts of it, was so enraged that she announced that the film was not to be shown in india or she would cover herself in petrol and set fire to herself. i do not know whether it was shown at all or not, but given her standing at the time as a rising politician, i doubt it. since then, i saw a report that she has been ousted from office and charged with further crimes from her dacoit days, and has gone into hiding as a result.her own concerns aside, this is an excellent film, made all the more so by its refreshingly brutal approach; none of the rose-tinted melodrama one might expect from a typical indian film. it should be stressed that concerns about how feminist the film's messages really are and the like are essentially irrelevant: it's a true story. her misgivings are, it seems, not with what is depicted but with the way in which the film depicts her.

the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved. i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made. i love all six of the stooges (curly, shemp, moe, larry, joe, and curly joe)! all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts! in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team!one of my favorite stooges shorts with shemp is none other than brideless groom! all appearing in this short are dee green, the beautiful christine mcintyre, doris houck, alyn lockwood, johnny kascier, nancy saunders, and emil sitka. green and mcintyre provide great performances here! there are so many funny parts here. this is a very hilarious short. there is another similar three stooges short like this one called husbands beware and i recommend both!

there are one or two other shemp-era shorts i like more (i.e. scrambled brains), but i think one can say--without much argument--that in this particular episode, shemp gives his greatest comedic performance as a stooge after rejoining the team in 1946.scene for scene, this episode hardly lets up: from professor shemp howard's voice lessons with the glass-shattering dee green, to his futile attempts to win a dame's hand in marriage (this is your little snookums... will you marry me *click*) to the uproarious finish, it never fails to keep me in stitches.i would be remiss not mention that immortal scene with miss hopkins (the always lovely christine mcintyre). btw, isn't she rather under-dressed and over amorous in greeting the man she thinks is her 'cousin' basil? who knows, maybe the actual basil was a "very" distant cousin, which makes it legal in some states (as far as i know). >:-]

i just watched this film this morning and i found it to be a great showing of the richness of faith. babette gave them another way to look at life; not a replacement, but an enhancement. she shared all that she had with those who gave what little they had to her. i see the story of god in here. he sent his only son to man. man could not possibly give anything that would equal that. so, for our small sacrifice, we are given an ultimate treasure and are transformed because of it. in this film the bickering townspeople have so consumed themselves with a small interpretation of god. babette showed them that life and god can indeed be beautiful in it's fullest sense. the love that god's son showed to man is the love we should show to one another and our lives will be the richer for it. even the film is a metaphor. it seems slow in the beginning, but the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded in the end. it was truly a feast.

i don't know whether this film hits my heart the way it does because of the feelings of friendship, love, closeness to others or the warmth of that transformation babette's cooking creates, but when the feast starts and for the rest of the movie, i choke up often. yes, this is a feel-good movie, but without a speck of mawkishness or facile sentimentality. please note that elements of the plot are discussed. babette's feast tells its story with restraint and care, and it lets us discover for ourselves the values of grace and love. all we need to know is that babette harsant (stephane audran) was a french refugee who was given shelter by two aging sisters in a tiny community on the coast of jutland. the sisters lead what remains of their father's flock. he was a pastor of conviction who taught that salvation comes through self-denial. the sisters made their sacrifices to duty and faith. those who still remain honor the now long dead pastor's teachings and his spiritual guidance. still, as they have grown older the tiny community has become querulous and argumentative. the sisters do what they can. for the pastor's 100th birthday, babette wishes to cook the dinner for the small group the sisters will invite. the sisters reluctantly agree, but when they see the supplies babette has ordered, they and their guests become uneasy. they are used to the community's usual fare of dried cod, boiled, and a soup made of bread, water and a little ale. even though babette over time has made improvements, what they are seeing now seems close to godlessness. at the dinner also will be a visitor, general lorens lowenhielm, who years earlier had chosen ambition over his love for one of the sisters. what do we experience? there is the austerity of the aging community's faith and the stone, wind-swept cottages they live in. there is the warmth by candlelight of the sisters' small, crowded dining room. and then there is the transforming power of babette's artistry as we watch her cook, watch erik, a young boy helping her, serve and pour, and watch the old parishioners, with the help of fine wine and exquisite cooking, gradually rediscover their community and love and friendship. the general serves as our unexpected guide because he is the only one who knows what extraordinary dishes they are eating. the general tells a story to his uncomprehending dinner companions, a story about a famed woman who was the exemplary chef at the famed caf√© anglais in paris. "...this woman, this head chef, had the ability to transform a dinner into a kind of love affair...a love affair that made no distinction between bodily appetite and spiritual appetite." he, too, is being transformed into a man who will accept what he has become and yet will always know the value and the love of what long ago he chose not to accept. an old couple kiss. two old men remember past friendships. and babette, who spent all that she had won in a lottery on this dinner, has had an opportunity to be the artist she once was in france, an opportunity she accepted with love and friendship. babette, now as poor as she was when she arrived penniless years earlier, will continue with the sisters. the general in a carriage with his aunt returns to her estate. and the elderly guests leave the sisters' home to return to their own cottages. they pause and look at the clear night sky and the stars overhead. they spontaneously hold hands in a circle and dance and sing this hymn... "the clock strikes and time goes by eternity is nigh. let us use this time to try to serve the lord with heart and mind. so that our true home we shall find. so that our true home we shall find." they smile at each other. all has been reconciled. babette's feast is a wonderful movie, full of restrained emotion, unspoken understandings, wisdom...and, of course, a meal that will leave you with a growling stomach as you exit the theater. if you win a lottery so you could afford what babette created and have her skill and artistry, here's what she served: potage a la tortue (a rich turtle soup), served with amontillado sherry blinis demidoff au caviar (small buckwheat pancakes with sour cream and caviar), served with veuve clicquot champagne cailles en sarcophage with sauce perigourdine (boned quail stuffed with foie gras and truffle in puff pastry with truffle sauce enriched with madeira), served with clos de vougeot, a fine burgundy salade cheese and fresh fruit baba au rhum with glacee fruit and fresh figs coffee and a fine brandy

food always makes a good topic in movies, as "chocolat" showed. "babette's feast" is the same type of thing. babette harsant (stephane audran) is a french cook who flees her native land after the repression of 1871. she moves to a very religious danish village. the people in this village simply have no use for joy. that is, until babette cooks them one of her exquisite meals.it's not just that this movie deals with bringing fun to a place that has never known it. like other scandinavian movies (and non-hollywood movies in general), it shows that a movie can hold your interest without the use of explosions, car chases, etc. this is one movie that you can't afford to miss.one more thing. do you think that the danish word for "feast" sounds a little bit like "tastebud"?

this is a phenomenal movie. truly one of the best movies i have ever watched. i am a serious critic and it takes much to stir me, but this movie had all the right combinations for "stirring". the passion of the actors,without the overacting, the aching for all the characters involved, the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce, all make this a must see movie, despite the fact that it is 1970s. this is definitely not an "old movie", but a classic/vintage movie. i hope you engage with it as i did when you consider how volatile relationships of all kinds can be, when you also consider how deep pain associated with love can be and how the hardest decisions to make will always be the most painful, but once they are made the pain will subside, but only gradually. this movie certainly demonstrates that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that leaving certainly is not synonymous with lost/lack of love. the 'crafting' of this movie certainly emanates from a place deep within someone's heart and mind.

i have seen this film on 3 different occasions.on the first occasion,i was bowled over by this film.it appeared as a very kind film to me.i hated this film as a sentimental garbage on my second viewing.however my third viewing reasserted my belief that it is a good film.there is a lot of emotional power in this film especially scenes of emotional confrontation between mr kramer and madam kramer.there are some scenes in which meryl streep appears a cruel person despite the fact that she is a beauty in real life.dustin hoffman appears as a lost hero unable to grapple with the recent task of his child's custody.there was even a controversy on the sets of this film.according to the master cameraman nestor almendros there was a shot in which he just escaped getting hurt as the character of mr.kramer,in order to show the intensity of his anger,decides to break a glass hard.luckily nothing happened to nestor.kramer versus kramer shows the destruction of a family structure.it also tells how family must be maintained if there are kids involved.

this is probably the best cinematic depiction of life in a manhattan ad agency: the pressure to perform; client and agency demands; the parties; the creativity; the money; the cool surface with powerful corporate undercurrents. toss in parenthood for dustin hoffman. the movie is textured and deep. it follows his internal relationship as he tries to understand and live with what's going on; his relationship with meryl streep (and her friend, who becomes his friend), and his the relationship with his son. while meryl streep was great, did she set the record for least screen time to win an oscar? she sure can deliver when she is on, though.

moving beyond words is this heart breaking story of a divorce which results in a tragic custody battle over a seven year old boy.one of "kramer v. kramer's" great strengths is its screenwriter director robert benton, who has marvellously adapted avery corman's novel to the big screen. he keeps things beautifully simple and most realistic, while delivering all the drama straight from the heart. his talent for telling emotional tales like this was to prove itself again with "places in the heart", where he showed, as in "kramer v. kramer", that he has a natural ability for working with children.the picture's other strong point is the splendid acting which deservedly received four of the film's nine academy award nominations, two of them walking away winners. one of those was dustin hoffman (best actor), who is superb as frustrated business man ted kramer, a man who has forgotten that his wife is a person. as said wife joanne, meryl streep claimed the supporting actress oscar for a strong, sensitive portrayal of a woman who had lost herself in eight years of marriage. also nominated was jane alexander for her fantastic turn as the kramer's good friend margaret. final word in the acting stakes must go to young justin henry, whose incredibly moving performance will find you choking back tears again and again, and a thoroughly deserved oscar nomination came his way.brilliant also is nestor almendros' cinematography and jerry greenberg's timely editing, while musically henry purcell's classical piece is used to effect.truly this is a touching story of how a father and son come to depend on each other when their wife and mother leaves. they grow together, come to know each other and form an entirely new and wonderful relationship. ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new outlook on life, and slowly comes to realise why joanne had to go.certainly if nothing else, "kramer v. kramer" demonstrates that nobody wins when it comes to a custody battle over a young child, especially not the child himself.saturday, june 10, 1995 - t.v.strong drama from avery corman's novel about the heartache of a custody battle between estranged parents who both feel they have the child's best interests at heart. aside from a superb screenplay and amazingly controlled direction, both from robert benton, it's the superlative cast that make this picture such a winner.hoffman is brilliant as ted kramer, the man torn between his toppling career and the son whom he desperately wants to keep. excellent too is streep as the woman lost in eight years of marriage who had to get out before she faded to nothing as a person. in support of these two is a very strong jane alexander as mutual friend margaret, an outstanding justin henry as the boy caught in the middle, and a top cast of extras.this highly emotional, heart rending drama more than deserved it's 1979 academy awards for best film, best actor (hoffman) and best supporting actress (streep).wednesday, february 28, 1996 - t.v.

ever since `midnight cowboy' i have been on the lookout for films with dustin hoffman and have mostly not been disappointed. ever since `kramer vs kramer' i have been on the lookout for films with meryl streep and have mostly not been disappointed. she gave a superb performance, really one of her best, in `sophie's decision' and i lapped her up in `out of africa'. that these two actors came together over 20 years ago for `kramer vs kramer' was definitely a very good idea: the result is an excellent character drama with a theme which is still very relevant in today's society.on divorcing everyone has a pretty bad time, though the kids seem to suffer most¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö..beautifully handled by robert benton in some original directing presenting some memorable scenes: even the passageway takes on character and should be included in the cast! and as for the breakfast scene with billy (justin henry), just simply magnificent. just how do you get an eight-year-old to act? benton managed it, and of course with hoffman there seemed to be good electricity: the result is certainly engaging, endearing, and convincing. justin henry's performance must rank among the best 5 or 6 kids' performances of all time. the best thing, once again, was the naturalness, there was no going over the top, so frequent these days.this film came up again on the small screen the other night, though i have had it in my video collection for years: it is still worth watching and paying attention to everything. around 7¬Ω out of 10.

life was going great for new york city advertising artist ted kramer. he had a great job and a loving wife. no, actually, his wife wasn't so loving, for when ted returned home late from work that night his wife, joanna, had a suit case packed and was heading out the door. he tried to stop her, but she just got into the elevator and out of ted's life. well, now in addition to his job he's now got to mind the house as well as their 6-year-old son, billy; ted assured his boss that his wife's leaving would not affect his job performance in any way. it did however affect his performance as a father. he blew up when billy spilled punch on his client artwork! well, some time later ted and billy receive a letter from joanna, and it was obvious from her letter that she wasn't coming back. ted was distraught. well, he was late coming home from work on billy's birthday, which made billy sore at him. ted was late to work one day and his boss yelled at him because he had missed a very important client meeting. when he got home, he yelled at billy for sneaking ice cream during dinner. then later he truthfully told billy that the break-up between he and joanna may have been his fault, not billy's; ted invited a good friend, phyllis bernard over that night, and well, billy got his first look at a naked woman. when ted took billy to the park the following day, he fell off the jungle gym and landed face-first onto his toy plane. ted literally ran him to the hospital where they had to administer stitches. after that, life began taking a downward spiral for ted. then one day out of the blue he received a phone call from none other than joanna! they met in a corner caf√©. at first they have a pleasant conversation but then joanna informs him that she has returned to collect her son and take him with her. ted would have none of it and stormed out. well life got even worse for ted when his boss, jim o'connor, took him out to lunch and abruptly fired him. not only that but joanna was choosing to sue for custody of billy, and without a job, ted didn't stand a chance in hell for winning. he hired himself a lawyer, john shaunessy, who charged a pretty penny: $15,000 exact change. and that's if they win. ted was also able to find a new job. it was actually a step down from what he used to do with a considerable cut in salary but he accepted with great determination. finally the court date, january 9, 1980, arrived. judge atkins presiding. joanna took the stand and shaunessy proceeded to question her about why she left ted and about her other relationships and how they were failures. the next day, ted took the stand and joanna's lawyer really grilled him like a cheeseburger. ted's good friend margaret took the stand as well and she really didn't help matters. well, the judge took some time to think it over and sure enough, one day shaunessy informs ted that he lost. joanna got sole custody of billy. how typical! always ruling in favor of the mother. well, ted and billy were just devastated about parting ways. they had a tearful goodbye when suddenly joanna stopped by. she and ted have a little talk and well, rather than just give away the ending, let me assure everybody that everything turns out alright for everybody!this was a very good movie. dustin hoffman was very good. he earned that academy award. i've also seen him in hook, meet the fockers and rain man, which he also won an oscar for. meryl streep was good. she also got an oscar. justin henry was good too, so where was his nomination? i guess the academy had a rule against giving oscars to children, but the rule was lifted when haley joel osment came along. this movie has great drama, light comedy, and is very subtle. it does a good job of holding your attention. i was watching rain man on tcm the other night then this came on after and i just couldn't help but watch. and that's what you should do. if you like dustin hoffman or meryl streep or movies of this genre, then i recommend kramer vs. kramer! a gripping film about the pangs of two divorced parents fighting over their child. i liked ted's little speech about ruling in favor of mothers all the time. what was it about sex that makes a good parents? actually, that's how they have the child. but seriously, he's right. why always rule in favor of the mother because she's a woman? also in the cast, george coe, howard duff, who passed away in 1990, and howland chamberlain who passed away in 1984. watch for an up-and-coming jobeth williams in the nudity in the hallway scene. anyway, see kramer vs. kramer today!!! good movie!!-

good drama movie about a child custody case with great performances by all the actors.a good example of what an excellent script can do to propel a simple story to a much higher quality.the screenplay was just average though and this is what kept the movie from the list of the all time best dramas.still,the great acting makes this movie a good one to see if you are a fan of court dramas or a big fan of the lead actors.the movie really should have been a tad longer though for more excellence but that would really be nitpicking......

the child actor certainly deserves a lot of credit. it was a pretty weak field for best picture that year. i think "apocalypse now" should have taken it, but the academy probably felt it was too violent and strange, plus vietnam was still too recent. meryl streep was tremendous, as always, playing a very unlikeable character. i don't usually compliment directors, but i really liked that bit with the elevator doors. grade: b

i remember going to drive inn with my parent and sister. i was in grade 5, and still a kid, and the drive closed down 4 years later, but the film still lingers in my memory. an adult movie, which a kid finds entertaining. that is a mark of excellence. hoffman is one of hollywoods better actors, and this film proves it. i like the billy put down the ice cream scene, and i remember the sctv version in there film i factory myself. remember joe flairty crying. please email me if you like the sctv skit. not a bad film at all, it is a story about a father, and his son. touching and intertaining, i love the part where hoffman talks about killroy, and how the streets change. worth a second watch. 7/10

if you asked me to pick the best acted movies ever made, this movie would be on a short list along with 1951's streetcar named desire. i imagine i'll discover some others that qualify, but kramer vs kramer is an outstanding exercise in naturalism. so its a very satisfying experience on that level: just watching the marvelous, probing performances of dustin hoffman, meryl streep and the child justin henry in particular. one of the best child performances ever.but i also find it very satisfying to watch, because its such a thoroughly involving story - it always makes me forget my own problems. it has such excellent narrative drive. once you stick kramer vs kramer on, and alice kramer leaves ted to juggle work and their young son, telling him nothing more than she has to discover herself - you keep watching to know that everything turns out okay for them. and even once you know how things do turn out, each moment of the ride just rings so brilliantly true that its a joy to watch it happen again and again.make no mistake - kramer vs kramer is not light entertainment: its a very realistic portrayal of the effects of divorce on everyone involved.10/10.for one of the best scripts (born out of conversations between benton and hoffman, who was going through a divorce at the time) ever written, executed and performed beautifully and faultlessly. not to mention what a great, involving story it is. put simply, a perfect film.

i thought this film was quite good and quite entertaining for a film heavy on emotion. i agree with what another user wrote about the script being sympathetic to the three main characters. i think that this is what what made the film good. it didn't villainies either mr. or mrs. kramer and it was refreshing, i think, to see two people essentially work the issue out on their own and eventually do the best thing for billy. and, although it was a little strange, i actually liked the music in this film as well. for some reason the music seemed appropriate for the journey that the three main characters embarked upon. this movie flowed quite well and didn't doodle, like some emotionally heavy films tend to do. it dealt with a serious situation but didn't take itself too seriously. it simply told the story in a straight forward way and it worked quite well.

normally, movies stay out of the realm of "domestic drama," and for good reason: who wants to intentionally seek entertainment from a story about what they or those close to them have to deal with in real life? divorce hurts an incredible percentage of american families of all classes and custody battles are ugly and necessary parts of it. that's not escapism -- the number one reason the average person turns to movies -- that's sad reality. normally, divorce or custody is simply part of a greater story and affects the way we understand it or relate to its characters. "kramer vs. kramer" focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why that makes it so troubling. that's a challenge for both this film and its audience: turn something so real into something that can capture our attention and then make us not feel spiteful as the mirror is held up to our face. writer/director robert benton definitely achieves both and in impressive fashion in adapting this novel by avery corman.the story, as one would expect, is quite simple: big business advertising man ted kramer (dustin hoffman) comes home to find his wife joanna (meryl streep) is leaving him and their 7-year-old son billy (justin henry). ted then must quickly learn to be an active father in the boys' life and as soon as he does, joanna brings a custody suit upon him.to make an oscar-winning drama about something so generic and particularly dialogue- heavy first takes tremendous acting talent. you don't get much better than hoffman and streep. hoffman is in his prime in this role: his first oscar win after three other notable nominations. he creates a thorough character, one whose self-centered and quick-tempered ways clearly change as he learns to be a better father and the sole care-giver. streep wins her first oscar in only the second major role of her career as a woman who doesn't get much screen time but must communicate both inner torment at her decision to leave as well as renewed sense of identity when she returns to take custody. streep does so effortlessly. the young boy, justin henry, who at his age was the youngest competitive category nominee in academy awards history, plays the embodiment of all 7-year-old children exceptionally well.benton's writing and direction takes these performances to the level where we see deeper into this family's troubles than we do our own and thus reconsider our thoughts about love and raising a family. benton's previous notable credits ("bonnie & clyde" and "superman") wouldn't indicate a strong command of family drama, but the man can flat out write. numerous scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they depict. the first morning that joanna is gone and ted make's billy french toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent going into this movie in a scene that happens in americans' kitchens every morning.you'll rarely see a story as straightforward as "kramer vs. kramer" done better. there aren't any surprises at the end or twists and turns that will keep us desperately glued to the screen. the film then has to rely on its talents and they are all sure-fire, delivering a new understanding of a subject that's so familiar.

certainly when i saw this movie at hbo, i was bit erratic in following the plot, but it catches my attention when seeing dustin hoffman in it. honestly i'm not enthralled watching old movies, but then in the long run it changes my point of view. seeing this stirring film made me experience once again couching at my seat not noticing my tears suddenly roll down my cheek, and then after, let loose a heavy sigh in realizing the impact of what i've just witness. kramer vs kramer was indeed one of the best classical drama movies i've witnessed for a long time that even i, myself couldn't imagine how it touched me. the story was strongly emotional, but is not saturated with such. the characters weren't unrealistic for their roles; they possess qualities that make viewers like them whatever position they have in the film, like the role of meryl streep, she was a mother who honestly concede her mistakes at the past but then she's confident to stand up her emotional motives to get what she desires in a fair and square battle. dustin hoffman was way too outstanding, i can't even fathom how this guy could play seriously difficult roles and suddenly jump into another role which is completely different, then performed it well. even though i have already seen the movies a lot of times, when i seat back and lounge at my home scanning worth movies to peer and buy a time for it, catching a glimpse for kramer vs kramer will make my experience another worthwhile moment.

kramer vs. kramer is a near-heartening drama about shocking, drastic augmentations of the two subjects of a failed married couple. meryl streep, in the throes of her trademark maternal sensitivity, plays an unhappy stay-at-home mother who feels confined to such a role and within the first five minutes of the film leaves her inattentive husband, in a fantastic performance by dustin hoffman, to find another role for herself. hoffman is dumbstruck, having absolutely no idea what to do with himself, having taken so much for granted that he doesn't know the first thing about getting his son to school in the morning.hoffman seamlessly characterizes this husband as such a juicy load of setbacks. he is restless, relentless and impatient, but even though the positive side to those three adjectives should include just the opposite, he is unremittingly fixated on whatever he turns his head to. he's been focused on his career in advertising, and when he is left to raise his son billy all by himself, chaos ushers in immediately. he's the one throwing temper tantrums and quitting angrily halfway through an activity. after awhile, as he befriends his neighbor and joanna's former friend, played by sexy jane alexander, hoffman cools his jets enough to understand why his wife left. in the meantime, his boundless energy redirects towards raising billy and he loses his job.the custody battle of the title is a brilliantly grey circumstance. even if the ending is a little unmotivated, subjectified for the audience, the last line and the last shot still have that witty screen writing touch that seemed to diminish after the magical 1970s.

i've seen many dustin hoffman's movies like straw dogs or rain man and i liked them, but his characters are much to often calm or even shy persons. i expected him to be in this movie the same as he was in straw dogs, but i saw a totally different person. he was much more energetic in this film and kinda reminded me of al pacino in serpico. the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end. i liked the way dustin hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son. this movie is also revealing. personally, i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.

kramer vs. kramer is the story of a marital breakup and the consequences of same. they can be devastating to the partners and even more so to a minor child which in this case is played by justin henry.what i really did like about kramer vs. kramer, it's greatest strength as a film is the way that parents dustin hoffman and meryl streep are presented to the audience as whole people with many sides to their nature. though the film is slanted in hoffman's direction and more about his relationship with his son, he's not presented as any kind of saint, nor is streep a completely black villain. hoffman's a career oriented man in the advertising game. he's pretty much ignored his wife's dreams and aspirations, still it's a big shock to him when streep says the love's no longer there and she wants out. she also wants out of being a mother, at least for a while.hoffman and henry make do the best they can. the pressure of being both parents causes hoffman to lose his job and he has to take a lower paying one in another agency. at that point after over a year, streep decides she wants custody.both parents make compelling witnesses and state their case beautifully, but in these situations, the tie is always broken in favor of the mother.dustin hoffman and meryl streep won their first of two oscars respectively for this film, her in the supporting actress category. i'm not sure how these things are decided, streep does get less screen time than hoffman if that's the determining factor. the film does focus on hoffman's relationship with his son and his evolving realization that he has his share of the blame for the marriage failure. as for meryl it's a hob's choice for her as it is for many women, to balance a career and motherhood. the conflict in her psyche registers for all to see on the screen.dustin hoffman may have won that oscar partly for the same reason that spencer tracy picked up his first, by performing the impossible task of not letting a scene stealing child steal the film. children with their lack of inhibitions are natural actors and henry is great because he comes over as a real kid, not a hollywood kid. i wonder if hoffman saw captains courageous and saw how spencer tracy dealt with freddie bartholomew. dustin could have done a lot worse than channel spencer tracy in his performance.kramer vs. kramer also won oscars for best picture, best director for robert benton and best adapted screenplay. it's an intelligent and compelling drama about adults falling out of love and trying to deal as best they can with it for themselves and their child. don't miss it if ever broadcast.

manna from heaven is heavenly. this is a movie for the family -- teens and grandparents can enjoy it together. but it isn't syrupy sweet or silly. the characters really are "characters". the plot is somewhat complex and you have to pay attention, but it's like putting a puzzle together as it all falls into place bit by bit. the period beginning is like watching an old photo album, or remembering back when. it's extremely well done with very accurate hairstyles and costumes. the story moves along quickly with twists, turns and lots of fun.a special treat is to watch the large cast of familiar faces, many of whom we haven't seen in much too long a time. part of the fun is to recognize and name them mentally as they appear, though this can be distracting. cloris leachman by the end of the film looks as if she's had a make-over on "oprah". i had never seen faye grant in a movie -- only knew her as grace's mother in the tv series "saving grace". she was great, even minus the southern accent. and i didn't even recognize shelly duvall. the five sisters who created this very lovely film are a very talented quintet and sister theresa is a heavenly treasure.

what a great cast for this movie. the timing was excellent and there were so many clever lines-several times i was still laughing minutes after they were delivered. i found manna from heaven to have some surprising moments and while there were things i was thinking would happen, the way they came together was anything but predictable. this movie is about hope and righting wrongs. i left the theater feeling inspired to do the right thing. bravo to the five sisters.

i found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting. initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in buffalo, intrigued me. later i found myself lost in the power of the film. how do you repay a gift from god? the ability of characters to rise above their base natures and respond to the touch from god warmed my heart. the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film. i left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race. what more can any film do? hollywood, i hope your paying attention. america does like positive, upbeat films.

being from the buffalo area i was well aware of the movie having read many articles in local publications. i was most impressed with the movie, especially its clever plot, the acting and the local scenes. nice to see so many older, quality stars in the various roles. i feel that especially those of us over 50 will find the movie excellent and you can leave the theater feeling that your time was well spent.

as a native of the city where the story takes place, buffalo, ny, it's fun to see the local sites but the story line is so local and fun, too!the small scale promoting of this film requires strong word of mouth to accomplish the wide viewing it deserves. please make this film the success the big, fat greek wedding was.

`manna from heaven' is a delightfully compelling film.within the shifting paradox of values in middle-class americans from 40 years ago to the present day, the plot tweaks the concerns and hopes of an interesting range of `damon runyonesque' characters.their struggles with moral dilemmas, dotting on `what might have been,' hopes to yet fulfill youthful dreams, romantic yearnings, and `hit it big' combine to make a most entertaining film. rather than relying upon `in-your- face' sexual explicitness, the burgeoning relationship between inez and mac/bake is classically subtle but clear. his untying the knot in her shoelace at the art gallery and their heat in their poker game is outstandingthe script's crisp writing is skillfully interpreted by an outstanding star and supporting cast. one of the few films i have ever fone to see twice in its opening run, `manna from heaven' definitely warrants national distribution.conrad f. toepfer

in the wasteland that hollywood productions have become of late, this movie - in and of itself - is truly "manna from heaven"!!!in what could best be described as a "cute" movie, approximately 350 years of movie acting experience (allright - give or take 100 years!) joyously lights up the screen to tell a tale of deceit, remorse, and redemption about a catholic family in buffalo, ny.truly well-positioned to take its place in the "feel-good" movie genre, this quiet little independent film by the burton sisters' five sisters productions company will leave a smile on your face and joy in your heart, all while renewing your faith in mankind.from the spectacular opening scene shots of buffalo, ny to the final credits, the film manages to tell a tale that could have been told of any family, anywhere. yet, somehow this particular gathering of family and "family by association" in a small, non-descript house in buffalo more than fits the bill. if you've never been to buffalo, you'll leave the theater with thoughts of "shuffling off" for a visit! shots of the city landmarks and surroundings help to bring a quaint, down to earth tone to the film - which suits it just fine. the quiet beauty of the "queen city of the great lakes" compliments, rather than detracts from the tale that is being told. if only more movies would take advantage of the natural beauty of this country's "second cities" instead of running off to a soundstage somewhere, the end results would be so much more believable.great performances by shirley jones, frank gorshin, wendy malick, jill eickenberry, and the rest of the ensemble cast prove again that true talent outlasts hollywood's "flavor of the week" any time!go see this movie!you've wandered in hollywood's desert for too long!

we went to see manna from heaven, my husband, two friends, and i and we all enjoyed the film. the characters are funny, the story is amusing and so much like real life. i think that is what i liked most, just seeing something believable, no murders, no sci-fi, just good, clean fun. it is something you could take your children or elderly parents to and not worry. how many of those are around anymore!!

i thoroughly enjoyed gabrielle burton's story of a mysterious gift and how it effects it recipients in the past and present. the talented burton family of five film-making sisters, an author mother, and dancing dad offer a charming plot, respectfully edited for clarity , memorably chosen songs, and a beautifully filmed piece that made me laugh and cry as the characters' vulnerablility invited me into their predicamant. there was a farce-like attitude about this work with touching undertones of innocent wonder. fanatastic

i would recommend this film to anyone who is searching for a relaxing, fun-filled, thought-provoking movie. the absence of sex, vulgarities and violence made for a most pleasant evening. i especially enjoyed the buffalo scene, but that's probably because i live a short distance from there. even so, this film could have been produced in any city; it's the theme that's so important here. i'm just grateful that manna from heaven dropped down on us. try it...you'll like it!

this film is not your typical hollywood fare, though the pickings are so bad i often tend to stay away from movies rather than be disappointed. however, this little low-budget gem is thoroughly loveable and enjoyable and definitely a keeper. the actors are as varied as the characters they portray, the buffalo setting is charming (what a pretty city), and the story sparkles. the lack of gratuitous violence, sex and the "f" word doesn't detract in the least! take the kids, take grandma, take a break from hollywood! i give it an 11 out of 10!

when i first saw the movie, i thought it was sweet - a family movie. for the rest of the night and over the next couple of days, though, clever moments and funny lines kept creeping back into my thoughts and our conversation... there's a lot going on, classic elements of farce, good character acting, and wendie malick's story line is just hysterical. labelling it a "feel-good movie" belies the wit and fun - it's smarter than it seems, just like "it's a wonderful life" is.

the squire of gothos is one of the "sillier" episodes of star trek, and therefore one of the most entertaining ones. the entertainment factor is, generally speaking, fueled by the stand-off between william shatner and the episode's hilarious guest star, william campbell.during an unspecified routine mission, sulu suddenly vanishes into thin air, and kirk follows soon after-wards. spock immediately begins looking for his missing colleagues (and, though he'd hate to admit it, friends), while the two stranded crewmen must deal with the mysterious, all-powerful, flamboyant trelane (campbell), the self-proclaimed squire of gothos, a being capable of creating or destroying anything he wants through the sheer power of his mind.at first sight, the plot may seem recycled from previous episodes (honestly, are there any sci-fi shows that didn't feature at least one god-like character), but that feeling vanishes pretty quickly thanks to the script's winning use of exaggerated humor, all conveyed through campbell's deliberately camp performance: his trelane is essentially the trek version of a spoiled child in the body of an adult, while his ignorance-fueled curiosity for the human race (his knowledge is quite limited) probably served as inspiration for gene roddenberry when he came up with the character of q for the next generation pilot, some two decades after this episode aired.in short, the key to appreciating the squire of gothos is this: "silly" doesn't necessarily equal "bad".

general trelayne is a super-being who wants to play a little game with the crew of the enterprise. a lot of extremely unlikely and nonsensical stuff seems to be happening, and trelayne seems obsessed with the human practices of warfare and murder. he seems to need to experience what he imagines to be a thrill and has created a human environment (though a few hundred years out of date) in which to play out his fantasies. the environment is subtly inauthentic, and the crew immediately begins to spot the inconsistencies. pretty soon it becomes clear that trelayne is not just an immature god, but a very fallible one. regardless of how you feel about this one, stick around for the twilight zone-like ending. it is well worth it.as many have pointed out, trelayne's character inspired the more developed and amusing on-going character q - and you can see in john delancie's construction of that personality more than just shades of campbell's trelayne. it is fun to compare how the four captains we have seen coping with q all deal with him so radically differently.

i did enjoy watching squire trelane jerk around the crew in this episode, though after a while the whole thing just seemed a little too long. sure, the histrionics were kind of funny for a while, and the ending was a pretty good way to wrap the whole thing together. i think the problem was that i enjoyed seeing trelane when he was full of bravado and fun, the fun seemed to vanish when trelane became vindictive and nasty. talk about a mood killer--going from the obnoxious but affable host to the guy sentencing kirk to death! but, despite this, the episode was enjoyable and worth my time. for die-hard trekkies, this is a must-see, for others it's just a pretty run of the mill one.

in "the squire of gothos", kirk and his crew encounter a powerful super-being, who keeps the captain, "bones" and a few crewmembers captive for no apparent reason. i could be wrong, but i think this is the first star trek episode i ever saw and the program that made me hungry for more. it is not one of the best episodes, but the rock-solid premise of an alien being who putting the enterprise's crew in a corner, is the kind of situation that makes the show so much fun to watch. in a way, the super-humanoid anticipates one of star trek's most famous characters, next generation's enigmatic "q". this episode is also memorable for creating a unique situation: it is the first time uhura is part of the action and the story allows the viewer to see what an endearing character uhuara can be when the story allows her. too bad the show never fully explored this iconic figure.

an apt description by spock of an all-powerful fop into whose clutches fall the crew of the enterprise. this was one sector of space our starship should have avoided: first sulu & kirk simply disappear off the bridge; a landing party follows them to the surface of an unknown planet and encounter trelane, a seemingly aristocratic man dressed in attire from an earth of many centuries past. but he demonstrates abilities of someone or something far beyond human and doesn't register on mccoy's medical tricorder. the officers manage to escape back to the ship but, like some bad cosmic penny, trelane keeps popping up. he brings them all back, including some female companionship, to continue his games. the dilemma now takes on elements of 'the most dangerous game' out in space and there's an exasperating, even infuriating aspect to the crew's utter helplessness before such unbridled power.what really makes this a great episode is the memorable performance by guest star campbell as the overpowering but not all-knowing alien. his character is obviously an early version of q, who was introduced 20 years later in the pilot for the tng series. trelane's confrontation scene with spock stands out among all the strange drama which unfolds. as usual, kirk quickly begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new nemesis, despite being quite outmatched. the answers to exactly what or who trelane is are right in front of us the whole time so, when we do learn the truth, it makes complete sense in view of campbell's pitch-perfect acting. he indulges himself constantly, preening before some unknown audience, remarking on things with a flair which is infectious but not quite right - we can't quite pin it down at first, but there's something missing here. every few minutes, his tone becomes sinister and the crew now appears to be in serious danger. in a way, you can't take your eyes off him, always waiting to see what he does next. actor john de lancie captured that similar tone as q on the next generation series.

this is a beautifully filmed movie that questions the future of all indigenous peoples, especially nomadic tribesmen. focusing on the saltmen of tibet, the film moves at pace that may make some western viewers uncomfortable. for some peoples, life still proceeds at the same pace which it has for thousands of years. this film follows a group of tribesmen on their annual two month quest to get salt. their tribe lives its life in a traditional manner (slowly by modern standards) and always accounting to their many gods. this is a remarkable film, one which will preserve a piece of what may, unfortunately, become history. well worth the time. don't be in a rush when you see it.

i think gerard's comments on the doc hit the nail on the head. interesting film, but very long. it's definitely the antithesis to the new school of flashy, sexy, moore-style docs. there is no narrator, no facts or side info interlaced, and no other gimmicks. what you see is what you get - a glimpse into the vanishing world of the saltmen of tibet. as a huge doc fan, i was surprised how much i lost attention with this film, namely due to the length and lack of dialogue. in the end though i would recommend it if the subject matter sounds interesting to you. it's beautifully shot, informative, and presents a valuable (and closing) window into the way of life of the tibetan saltmen (and women :) - all important attributes of a good doc. but do put on a big pot of coffee, it'll help.

a documentary about a nomadic tribe in tibet going out to a dry lake to get salt does not sound very appealing. but this is not a popcorn movie but a visual cultural feast whereby you partake of a rapidly vanishing morsel of humanity. the superstitions, the epic songs and poetry, the faith of a people who truly believe in following their own unique patterns of life are something the west had in the times of homer but that is now, unfortunately, completely foreign to most of us in the "developed" world. we have lost the spiritual serenity that comes from following well established patterns of life, often with dire mental consequences in our increasingly soulless society. the film makers have woven us intimately into the fabric of these materially poor but spiritually rich and scrappy saltmen. and made us see that there was more to life than the shopping mall and pop culture. so disconnect your land lines, turn off your cells, turn off the driveway lights and sit back and ease yourself into a timeless adventure.

_saltmen_ is a long film for its genre, and quite often the pace is much slower than that expected by western audiences. that being said, i enjoyed it thoroughly both in terms of interesting subject matter and the magnificent images this film contains. some of the scenery is truly breathtaking, and there is enough of interest that most should be able survive _saltmen_ with minimal use of the fast-forward.

yes!!!! fassbinder and ballhaus are at the top of their game, back in 1973! it's about the same subject, but in my opinion it's a much better movie than the matrix (1999), at least it was 200 times cheaper! very nice camera work by michael ballhaus and the wonderful "albatross" by fleetwood mac at the end. fassbinder is creating a very moody tone for the whole film. it's a shame this movie was never released on dvd. but now after 37 years they finally came to the conclusion, that this tv-movie, is not only one of the best fassbinder films (altough there are quiet a lot best fassbinder films), it's a brilliant example for a science-fiction movie, done without much money. buy it!! watch it!!

it is an interesting fact that metaphysics by platon and aristoteles, formal logic and abstract ontology form about those sciences that most people are not interested in. but then, around one thousand years after aristoteles, the computer began to usurp the human thinking, and the humans who were refusing to reflect questions of being other than biological, physical and chemical ones, suddenly felt paralyzed because they could not cope with the consequences that this computers would bring "over night". r.w. fassbinder's "welt am draht", together with tarkovsky's "solaris" and godard's "alphaville", is probably the first movie who took the philosophical questions of emerging computer science as a basis of a story to be told in a movie. the confusing questions about identities and realities are cleverly built into different interwoven criminal stories which the audience really tries to follow because it is interested to solve the cases. fassbinder was a master to sell highly abstracts contents to his public by embedding theoretical knowledge into practical, appetizing forms. the basis problem to understand is that an identity defines a reality, but on the other side, a reality also requires identity in order to be perceived. the idea of a person with multiple identities is known to us solely from the standpoint of psychiatry. however, logically spoken, the only reason why we have just one identity, is the fact that our logic has only two values (right and false). now take a logic with just one more value, i.e. with three: then, as you can easily see, you have already three identities. what happens now, when, let us say, dr. stiller gets killed? then, it is quite possible that only one of three identities is abolished and the other two remain and are able to rescue the individual from death. another question is, if a person with multiple identities actually feels these identities at once. the idea, however, to display such sets of identities in a up-down or down-up way as shown in the scene with the elevator in the hotel, is misleading, since identities and hence realities are not structured in hierarchical, but in a heterarchical way. strictly speaking, there is no "artificial identity" either, since each identity is defined over two objects who share all of their features with one another. therefore, the idea of assuming that every individual has just one single identity is nothing but a consequence of ancient two-valued logic either (a second identity would imply that a person, at the same time, exists and not-exists). but now look around and see that one and the same object (which is by definition self-identical) is perceived by every subject in its own way. if therefore every subject sees an object differently, why should it no be possible for the single individual to open the borders of his two-valued individuality-corset, with the effect that different persons can exchange their different individualities? fassbinder would five years later pick up this topic in his masterpiece "despair. a trip into the light".

the sf premise isn't unique (although it pretty much was back then), but the focus is a completely different one than in other artificial reality films. especially during the first part it is an elaborate crime picture, that uses the sf premise to tell an unusual crime story in which the forced detective tries to solve a mystery with the obstacle of vanishing characters and unhelpful witnesses who don't have to lie to be unhelpful. instead of an unreliable narrator we have an unreliable world.in part two we follow the main character's struggle for sanity and it turns more into a psychological examination of a character in an extreme situation. he knows his very existence is nothing more than electrical impulses, how does he deal with this knowledge? he knows that there is a world that is more real than his, but he is trapped in an artificial world, a world where nobody can understand him. the problem of thinking of knowing something essential about the world that nobody else knows or wants to believe is a very real one that many of us can identify with. for me the film transports this hopelessness very well, with its dreary, artificial atmosphere which also supports the factual artificiality of the film's world.other than 'the matrix' or 'the thirteenth floor' it's little concerned with evoking a sense of awe for its artificial reality plot, instead it very much focuses on the psychological aspects. philosophy is only in so far interesting in that certain philosophical concepts are essential in how they shape and alter the character's perception of the world.arguably it is longer than it has to be (which isn't a problem if you are as captivated by it as i was) and part 2 runs pretty low on steam.

78 years ago...the premiere of "anna christie" advertised by the slogan "garbo talks!" the film runs for 16 minutes and the viewers reach the climax of curiosity: greta enters the bar and gets through a long awaited transfer from silence into sound: a few seconds closing her silent era and, at last, greta garbo says a historic line: "gimme a whiskey, ginger ale on the side and don't be stingy, baby!" "anna christie" (1930) is the movie by clarence brown that introduced a great silent star greta garbo to talkies. nowadays, we can only imagine what serious transfer it was for actors and actresses. the careers of many were bound to end - something we hardly or not at all see at present. and it was no coincidence that it was clarence brown who directed the first talkie with the swedish beauty. garbo trusted the director after two of his great silent productions, flesh and the devil (1926) and a woman of affairs (1928): movies that achieved a smashing success at the box office, both with garbo in the lead. but we are in 2008 and that fact about the movie, now purely historical, appears to be of minor importance. the question for today's viewer is not what garbo's voice sounds like but if the movie is still watchable after these 78 years. in other words, we all strive to answer the question if the movie has stood a test of time. has it?when i recently watched it, i came into conclusion that, except for some minor technical aspects, including static camera, "anna christie" is still very entertaining. it's, on the one hand, a wonderful story of a life, of a reality that the young woman faces (being based on eugene o"neill's play), and, on the other hand, an artistic manifestation of true magnificence in the field of direction and acting. let me analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs.content: chris christopherson (george f marion), a heavy drinker, lives a life of a sailor, on a barge. although his days are filled with sorrows, he is consoled by a letter from his daughter anna (garbo) whom he hasn't seen for 15 years. she says that she will come back to him. he starts to change everything for better; however forgets that his daughter is no longer a child lacking experience but a 23 year-old woman who has got through various sorts of things on a farm in minnessota where she lived and worked. moreover, he forgets that she has a right to accept another kind of male love in her life... this brief presentation of the content not from the perspective of the main character but the one which is introduced to us sooner than anna (her father chris) makes you realize how universal it is. simply no letter from the whole text that life appears to be has been erased after all these years. cases discussed here in 1930 are still meaningful and valid...performances. there are not many characters in the movie, but there are two that really shine in the roles. it is of course greta garbo herself who did something extraordinary in her 15 year-long phenomenon, the presence that strongly marked the history of early cinema (something i have already discussed in many of my earlier comments on her films). but here, garbo is slightly different. i admit that there are moments in this movie when she does not feel very comfortable with her role. that seems to be caused by her new experience with sound in english; however, her performance is, as always, genuine and unique. but that is what everyone has expected from garbo. the true surprise of the movie for the 1930 viewers and also for us is marie dressler as marthy. she is excellent in her facial expressions, in her accent, in the entire portrayal of a drinking woman who looks at life from the perspective of "hitting the bottle." her best moments include the conversation with anna christie in the bar preceded by her hilarious talk with chris. the rest of the supporting cast are fine yet not great whatsoever (here the german version makes up for it). particularly dressler, except for garbo herself, constitutes an absolutely flawless choice.if you asked me what i like about "anna christie" nowadays, that's what i would tell you: it's a classic movie. however, there is one more thing that i must mention at the end. it is humor, wonderful wit that is noticeable throughout. although the content is quite serious and "anna christie" in no way carries a comedian spirit (the only garbo's comedy was ninotchka), there are such moments when you will split your sides. don't skip, for instance, anna and matt's visit in the fun park, particularly at the restaurant where he orders milk for her thinking how virtuous and innocent she is, beer for himself and where suddenly marthy joins them by chance..."anna christie" is a perfect movie for classic buffs and a must see for all at least a bit interested in the true magnificence of performance. if you are fed up with many of those modern starlets, seek such movies out and you shall be satisfied. very worth your search! skaal greta garbo! skaal marie dressler! let us drink a toast to the great jobs you did in the movie! skaal after all these years when wine tastes much better and your spirits are with us in a different sense...

garbo's first spoken words in this 1930 film electrified audiences and became part of hollywood legend. garbo had become a star in her first american film, the torrent, in 1926. and audiences waited til this film to see if garbo could make the transition to talkies. she did. and while pola negri, vilma banky, and renee adoree fell by the wayside because of their accents, garbo sailed on for another decade. despite the staginess of this film, garbo is really excellent, especially in the opening scene with the equally great marie dressler as marthy. the two great stars trade dirty looks and sharp words as they size each other up while they have a few drinks and set the tone for the remainder of the film. garbo was 25; dressler was 60. charles bickford is ok as matt, and george f. marion is good as old chris. marion originated this role on broadway in 1922 and also played it in the 1923 silent version with blanche sweet. this eugene o'neill play is a true classic yet, oddly, was never filmed again. anna christie ranks as one of garbo's greatest performances. and despite the staginess of the film and the grimness of the story, she is truly a marvel. see this one for garbo and dressler!

this is an amazingly well-filmed early talkie adaptation of the eugene o'neill play. its major drawback is a static camera, and as a result it comes off much of the time as the filmed play it is, which is a pity, for it's a good piece of primitive moviemaking, made at a time when sound was posing all kinds of technical problems, and as a result most films were experimental whether or not this was their maker's intention. garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as she was in her silent films, and her entrance is still classic. her voice is strangely deep, almost boyish, which only enhances her already seductively eccentric persona. as her boyfriend, charles bickford is appropriately virile,--he was apparently born craggy--and a perfect counterpart to the divine garbo. his irish brogue is not bad at all, and he seems always a natural man of the sea, very o'neill-like in his independent, brooding nature. as garbo's (very) confused father, george marion seems truly from another time. he has the sort of face and voice,--open, unmannered, totally without guile--that has vanished from the earth. marie dressler is also in the o'neill swing of things. her blank expression and intensity around the eyes speaks volumes, as she plays her boozy character as a woman at times bordering on psychosis. poetic license, perhaps, as this is not in the script, but we can forgive miss dressler's excesses; she is too good at it not to. the story ends with a movement to the next thing, as distinct from resolution, which isn't the author's cup of tea; and those who like their films neatly worked out in the end will be disappointed by the absence of any real surprise. in anna christie we are in o'neill country, a place of sea, storms and fog, a feeling of all-pervading and damnable uncertainty, which we would now call ambivilance, or anxiety neurosis. rather than analyze this mood the author simply and wisely presents it, as weather, land, ocean and people intertwine and address one another in a unique language we feel priveleged to have heard.

i would say that this film is disturbing. the brutality is depicted in a very sick way, it's like a psychosis in 40 minutes. in the same time, it is a cruel introspection in human behavior. the scenes are ferocious, starting with the butchery of the horse and ending with the brutal sex scene in the kitchen. every emotion is exploited to extreme, the frustration of the butcher, the love for his daughter almost incestuous, the rage when he finds out she has been abused, every feeling is so natural and so wrong. this film delivers the truth about human nature in a very honest and brutal way. the message of the film is that one's life can change in a second as a consequence of one's behavior and that the most primitive emotions are the most powerful and can determine one's acting. i'd loved the unique manner of filming, the simplicity and the brutality accompanied with the silence in which only inner thoughts pierce through.

the short film which got gaspar noe on the movie map, introducing us to his horrific, but thoroughly interesting character the butcher, played brilliantly by phillipe nahon. noe's direction here has all the hallmarks of his later films, showing he was carving his own voice and style from the beginning. his sudden cutting along with harsh, loud noise, skipping flashbacks and many other techniques all are used to disconcert the viewer. and it certainly works. also, he is not afraid of showing violence, as viewers of irreversible will know. here the violence is equally powerful, and in the sequel seul contre tous, it is almost unbearable.the film opens with a horse being killed. it is shot in the head, and we watch it writhe on the floor, its pool of blood flowing out. we then see a human birth in all its bloody glory, the daughter of the butcher. he was orphaned in wwii, and has grown up hating the world, and everyone and everything in it. he serves his customers, but his interior monologue constantly reminds us of his thoughts- he wants them all dead. his daughter blandine lenoir, who would also reprise her role six years later, is the only thing he cares about, and we watch them grow older together. she is however mute, and the subject of bullying and toying. the butcher's relationship with her is almost incestuous, bathing her when she is old enough to do it herself etc,but this is explored more in the next film. when she is attacked by a man, the butcher explodes with rage, stabbing an innocent man in the mouth. he goes to prison, taken from the only things he wants- his shop and daughter. in the short 40 minutes we see all this and more, his time in prison and release back to his world. because of his daughter's state, autistic as well i think, she is bland, does little except stare, and is under the full control of her father. the film continues in the exceptionally bleak seul contre tous. if you can, watch these two films, this one first. it has some truly excellent acting, but is very difficult to watch because of the relentless tone.7 out of 10

this is the forty minute film that introduces us to the character of the butcher, who will later be examined more thoroughly in the feature seul contre tous. in this film, it follows the early period of his life from 1965-1979, but focusing on the late seventies. the first images are of a slaughter of a horse, then the birth of a baby, the butcher's daughter, who we quickly see growing up each year. the butcher (played by philippe nahon in both films) is a man bitter with the world. he hates many things. his anger comes to a head when a man assaults his autistic daughter. the butcher then maims the wrong man, and finds himself in prison.this film follows the butcher's life to just after his release from prison, then seul contre tous takes over from there. i watched the films the wrong way about, seul contre tous first. try and watch this little film first if you can.

this film really used its locations well with some amazing shots, dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly, but constantly keeps you watching. modern love worked well in the gold coast film fantastic program this year offering audiences a glimpse at an australian cinema that is usually neglected. most importantly it is refreshing to see australian cinema not taking on the clich√© aussie characters and story lines we have seen done to death over the years. this film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its screenings. the performances and characters are well developed, and the cinematography is fantastic. an interesting exploration into family relationships, and environments.

john and his wife emily, accompanied by their child edward venture from the comfortable environs of suburbia to the village where the husband spent some of his childhood. there has been a death in the family and john must begin proceedings to take control of an old ramshackle cottage, situated by the seaside and once inhabited by an old man who has apparently committed suicide.sceptical about the circumstances of the death, john divorces himself from his family and from reality, puts his own life in peril, and puts on the clothes of the old man who is now dead.the film now changes - nothing is what it seems - the people of his past appear, in full gothic/hillbilly glory - his wife worries about his mental state - and his son disappears into the reeds.john finds that the old man didn't commit suicide, that his death is far more mysterious and strange. in a spine chilling finale, we learn that the events of the film actually never happened and that the entire narrative was imagined by the little boy, edward, who is struggling to come to terms with his parents' divorce proceedings.modern love is a macabre piece of high art cinema, a puzzling and perverse piece of pretentiousness, full of vague suggestion and unexplored red-herrings. it is humourless and seemingly unconcerned with current indie trends which both validates its creators, but also renders it pass√©.but the weaknesses of this australian film are fully outweighed by its sheer muscular cinematic vision, its bloody-minded and uncompromising precision and its oddball euro horror. the bastardry of script norms and lack of slick dialogue pales into insignificance against a backdrop of noir and a lead performance that needs to be seen to be appreciated.one of the most aggressively weird australian films in years.

we see a man move from city to "out-back" and change dramatically - his family asks questions, but he goes mad.strange, brilliant film for screening here in israel. wonderful locations, great actors, a film which masquerades as a "thriller" but which is more a case-study of madness in the lead man.the film was way above the other films screened as part of the aice festival here in israel. best of luck to the team who arrived at this film. it's a grand guignol, a little masterpiece of noir.my only criticism which prevents a "10" is that the sound and the music is overpowering at times. it tends to get in the way of the images, which speak for themselves.

the stark, cold landscape of big sky country, with its majestic snow-capped mountains juxtaposed to barren plains, is put to poetic use here in this lynchian fable/slide picture show about death and melancholy from the young and talented polish brothers (who previously treated indie movie fans to the bizarre and fascinating "twin falls idaho"--a film about a young woman falling in love with two brothers who happen to be siamese twins). a little orphan boy is dying, and a town is about to flooded in the name of progress (in the form a damn and hydroelectric power plant). with its eerily pleasing music score, minimalist dialogue and character development, and uncanny fantasy sequences involving some very unique angels, the polish brothers put their focus on what every good film artist knows a film should be about, the moving pictures...the images, the scenes...paintings of deep beauty captured on celluloid. this is best to be viewed late at night so that the haunting imagery can linger in your mind and wash over you as you drift off into sleep. the fact that all of this was done on a shoe-string budget of less than two million dollars puts hollywood with their bloated film costs and hollow movies to shame and indicates something grand to come from the polish brothers in the future.

michael polish's hypnotic "northfork" is a film that will stay in one's memory for quite a long time. this exquisitely crafted movie that michael and mark polish wrote, is visually one of the best things that came out last year from the world of independent films. the movie is splendidly photographed by m. david mullen, with a haunting score by stuart matthewman.if you haven't seen the film, perhaps you should stop reading here.the idea to set the film in montana was a great coup for the polish brothers. never has the majestic views of the country and mountains been so vividly captured as in "northfork". we don't need any color! the beauty is in the dark tones of the film that enhances the story of the desolation in this remote outpost.at the center of the story is irwin, the sick child under the care of the mysterious father harlan. this boy is seen in his bed where the kind priest is administering the medicine for his body. but is he really there at all? we watch him interacting with the odd group that we first encounter around the cemetery. there are two freshly open graves. will one of them be for irwin? at the same time, another plot line plays parallel to this first theme. we see the six men in black that have come to the area in order to remove from the area as many people as they can. this will be the bed for the man made lake that will be created. their reward is one acre and a half of lake front property if they move a certain amount of people.the third story line centers on the mystical group composed by flower hercules, cup of tea, cod and happy. they are following a possibility of a link to an angel that has been injured in this area. when irwin meets them at the cemetery, he offers to help, only if they take him away at least a thousand miles from here. we watch as the quartet examine the feathers the boy has placed among the pages of his bible. could irwin be that angel? the closing sequence show us all parties leaving northfork in different directions. the men in black riding their automobiles, perhaps going home to enjoy the newly acquired properties given to them as a reward. the mystical group is seen boarding a plane and taking off for a higher place. we also realize that the child in father harlan, in spite of the medicines and the care he received from the saintly figure, has died.michael polish got one of the best ensemble acting from all the principals. nick nolte, as father harlan turns a low key performance in his portrayal of this kind man. james woods, as walter, one of the men working for the developer, does a fine job. the biggest surprise is duel farmer, who makes an excellent impression as irwin. this child actor, with the right guidance, shows great promise.the mystical group is brilliantly acted by daryl hannah, robin sachs, ben foster and anthony edwards, the man with the funny spectacles. peter coyote, mark polish, ben foster, and the rest of the cast are flawless under mr. polish direction.the beauty of the film relies in its simplicity. mr. polish's vision will haunt one's memory. the images of montana, as perhaps an unreal landscape is one of the best things in american films in quite a while.

the third film from the polish brothers is their best, most beautiful, imaginative film yet. though many audiences will have a problem with northfork's lack of traditional dramatic structure, "stick with it, jack!". the plot is difficult to summarize, so just know that the story includes: agents trying to evacuate a city, god in a cowboy hat, the selling of angel wings, and a sick orphan (but it all works). m. david mullen's extraordinary photography makes almost every frame exciting and wonderful to look at. the performances of the actors, working with the polish brothers' inspiringly offbeat script, are pitch-perfect and give the film its emotional punch. the strong-willed audience member will be moved by the mythology and folk tale of the story, the comic and moving actors, and finally the incredible courage and command that michael polish shows behind the camera. again all of these incredible and seemingly disjointed elements come together magnificently in one of the most incredible things you should run out and experience. a great, great, great movie!!!

it's a shame this movie is rated pg 13--it is really quite suitable for anyone--though young kids might not follow it too well.it belongs to that wonderful genre of serio-comic ghost/angel stories that would have to include everything from capra's "it's a wonderful life" to wenders's "wings of desire." the photography is stunning, the acting first rate, and--wonder of wonders--the tone is uplifting.my only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film. the two interwoven stories seem intriguingly mysterious at first; but they resolve themselves a little too nicely for my taste. as the director points out in his commentary on the dvd, all the ingredients of irwin's story are on his bedside table. the symbolism is just a trifle too pat for me.but what a lark! my favorite scene has to be when the relocation team tries to get breakfast at a diner. this is practically theatrical in its magic--a tour de force of witty acting--subtle, playful, and positively rhythmic--coupled with striking cinematography and an acute eye for the grotesque."northfork" is funny, touching, gorgeous to look at, magical (with the above reservations) and has not one single car-chase.an easy nine stars.

"it all depends on how you look at it ¬ñwe are either halfway to heaven or halfway to hell," says the priest rev. harlan in "northfork." the polish brothers' film is an ambitious one that will make any intelligent viewer to sit up, provided he or she has patience and basic knowledge of christianity. the layers of entertainment the film provide takes a viewer beyond the surreal and absurd imagery that is obvious to a less obvious socio-political and theological commentary that ought to provoke a laid-back american to reflect on current social values. the film's adoption of the surreal (coffins that emerge from the depths of man-made lakes to float and disturb the living, homesteaders who nearly "crucify" their feet to wooden floor of their homes, angels who need multiple glasses to read, etc.) and absurd images (of half animals, half toys that are alive, of door bells that make most delicate of musical outputs of a harp, a blind angel who keeps writing unreadable tracts, etc.) could make a viewer unfamiliar with the surreal and absurdist traditions in literature and the arts to wonder what the movie is un-spooling as entertainment. though european cinema has better credentials in this field, hollywood has indeed made such films in the past ¬óin "cat ballou", lee marvin and his horse leaned against the wall to take a nap, several decades ago. "northfork," in one scene of the citizens leaving the town in cars, seemed to pay homage to the row of cars in "citizen kane" taking kane and his wife out of xanadu for a picnic.the film is difficult for the uninitiated or the impatient film-goer¬óthe most interesting epilogue (one of the finest i can recall) can be heard as a voice over towards the end of the credits. the directors seem to leave the finest moments to those who can stay with film to the end. if you have the patience you will savor the layers of the film¬óif you gulp or swallow what the polish bothers dish out, you will miss out on its many flavors.what is the film all about? at the most obvious layer, a town is being vacated to make way for a dam and hydroelectric-project. even cemeteries are being dug up so that the mortal remains of the dead can be moved to higher burial grounds. real estate promoters are hawking the lakeside properties to 6 people who can evict the townsfolk. of the 6, only one seems to have a conscience and therefore is able to order chicken broth soup, while others cannot get anything served to them.at the next layer, you have christianity and its interaction on the townsfolk. most are devout christians, but in many lurk the instinct to survive at the expense of true christian principles, exemplified in the priest. many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions.at the next layer, you have the world of angels interacting with near angelic humans and with each other. you realize that the world of the unknown angel who keeps a comic book on hercules and dreams of a mother, finds one in an androgynous angel called "flower hercules." while the filmmaker does give clues that flower is an extension of the young angel's delirious imagination, subsequent actions of flower belie this option. you are indeed in the world of angels--not gods but the pure in spirit¬óand therefore not in the world of the living. the softer focus of the camera is in evidence in these shots.at another layer the toy plane of irwin becomes a real plane carrying him and his angels to heaven 1000 miles away from norfolk.the final layer is the social commentary¬ó"the country is divided into two types of people. fords people and chevy people." is there a difference? they think they are different but both are consumerist.to the religious, the film says "pray and you shall receive" (words of fr harlan, quoted by angel flower hercules). to the consumerist, the film says "its what we do with our wings that separate us" (each of the 6 evictors also have wings-one duck/goose feather tucked into their hat bands but their actions are different often far from angelic as suggested by the different reactions to a scratch on a car).the film is certainly not the finest american film but it is definitely a notable path-breaking work--superb visuals, striking performances (especially nick nolte), and a loaded script offering several levels of entertainment for mature audiences.

a dreamy, stunningly atmospheric film takes place in a small town of northfork, montana in 1955. the government officials arrive to evacuate the town about to be inundated by a new hydroelctrical dam. there are the other visitors in the town, the angels from another time but they only seen by a dying boy irvin. a local priest (nick nolte in a quiet heartbreaking performance) takes care of the boy. irvin pleads with the angels to leave the place with them...there is some unearthly quality in the film, some dignified mourning and sublime sadness when you suddenly realize the inevitable finality of everything - humans and their relationships, cities, countries, civilizations, the whole world as we know it. death and birth have something in common - we go through them in the ultimate loneliness. i cannot recall the film that affected me in the same way and as deeply as "northfork" did, the film so beautiful and so tender, so quiet and so powerful, so heartbreaking and so moving. even now, after several weeks since i saw it, tears come to my eyes when i only think of it.after i saw it, i had to talk to somebody about it. i sent a pm to one of my friends and i asked, "please tell me what i just saw?" and my friend replied with the words, "you just saw one of the greatest films of modern times. one of these days others will see the light."

when northfork debuted at the cannes film festival, many people didn't like it because they felt it was boring and too slow. while i agree that it was slow (one of the slowest movies of the year), in no way was it boring. as roger ebert said, `there has never been a movie like northfork.' i usually don't agree with ebert, but for once he speaks the truth. although john sayles' sunshine state may have some of the same immediate themes, nothing that i have ever seen or known of can even compare to the striking originality of the polish brothers' northfork.northfork is a perfect example of how many times it's better to trek an extra few minutes to go to an art-house film instead of the latest jack black movie. the plot isn't some hackneyed, cookie-cutter plot; it's just so strikingly original. a small town in montana named northfork has a dam nearby that is about to be taken down. therefore, the entire town must be evacuated. some people, however, just don't want to leave. in a side plot, a young orphan (duel farnes) is very sick and bedridden; he's being taken care of by father harlan (nick nolte). the boy imagines himself as a fallen angel, so to speak, who help him out through his time of sickness.although much of the movie is straightforward, some of it could give david lynch a run for his money. there's odd weather patterns, a weird, wooden, huge dog thing, and symbolism that would make fellini proud. it's not as overall confusing as a lynch film, but it's still quite odd. that's what makes northfork so great: it's so out of the ordinary and yet so simple and plausible.northfork has a magical feel to it: it's almost like you're watching something you're not quite sure what it is but you feel entranced by it. as i said earlier, i agreed with ebert on how this movie is unlike any other. however, i disagree when he says that it is `not entertaining'. he goes on to say it's just `enthralling.' perhaps he just thought he should give it good reviews because everyone else is, but in lieu of how slow it was, i still thought it was very entertaining, something many dramas now can't do.northfork may not be the quickest movie or the most popular movie, but if you can get to and through it, you'll be extremely surprised, as i was.my rating: 8/10rated pg-13 for brief sexuality.

the polish brothers are unique film artists, and they've really pushed the envelope here. a fantasy that has points in common with "wings of desire," "northfork" tells the story of a '50s era small town in the middle of nowhere that is two days shy of being inundated and submerged thanks to the u.s. government's desire to make a reservoir on the place where the town stands. it's a wry parable about loss and remembrance, featuring angels, dreams, premonitions, and the most hilarious government reclamation functionaries since "repo man." the performances are all outstanding, especially nolte and woods. i've noticed in reading down some of the comments that there are people who were offended simply by the fact that the polish twins use elliptical storytelling tactics, and i want to say, that's one of the things that makes this film so great: its willingness to embrace the mysterious as an aspect of everyday life. david mullen's cinematography is stunning. highly recommended; if you've suffered a meaningful personal loss, such as the death of a parent, i would even call this film necessary viewing. - ray

it's pretty evident that many of your nights were spent alone. if you watched 5 minutes of the actual show instead of watching the commercial you would have seen one of the greatest television shows in canadian history being made. too bad you would have been watching it alone. probably the reason you hate it... no game. keys to the vip is hilarious, light and funny. guys are going to eat this show up. my game is tight and i can hardly wait to get on this show. the chicks were hooooot and the clubs kicked ass. i'll be watching every week. it makes me wonder why more great shows like this one aren't being made. now it's clear that the talent in canada has the ability to produce american quality television.

don't mind what this socially retarded person above says, this show is hilarious. it shows how a lot of single men are in a bar atmosphere, and also shows that women are not as gullible as men think they are. the contest aspect of the how is really cool and original. its not the standard reality show that we are all used to now a days.give it a chance everyone, we are only one episode in, we finally have some canadian programming that isn't absolute crap. as canadians what do we normally get, bon cop, bad cop, or corner gas. come on people show that we are all not as prudish as the previous reviewer.way to go comedy network, giving a new show a chance. the panel is funny and the contestants so far are pretty good.

keys to the vip, an original series by the canadian comedy network (comedynetwork.ca) scored big with this entertaining, yet inspirational gameshow. this show is hosted by four funny, good-looking guys who judge others on their 'game' (ability to pick up women). each episode features two guys who go head-to-head in various pick-up games. there are three different sections and the winner scores a night as a vip in an exclusive toronto night-club.being a guy, i naturally find this show hilarious. we all know that it's hard to confront women and watching these guys do it naturally sparks the curiosity of men. the guys who compete on this show might even give you a few pointers -- if you pay attention.

i don't know what the last reviewer is talking about but this show is pure entertainment. basically 2 dudes are put in competitions at a club to pick up girls in 3 different scenarios. they mix up the scenarios for each show so it is not the same every time. the panel of 4 judges is not afraid to call people out or admit it when they recognize game. they will break down what the guy did wrong, and what they guy did right. some contestants are weak, some are strong but what happens is always entertaining. if you are a guy that goes out, you can relate. i've seen weak game, i've seen strong game, and this show is for real. no doubt.

for all losers who gave it negative review,its because you probably have sex once in 2 years,or you are in ltr with one girl for years. and guess what ? she is going to cheat on you when player like those on that show approach her somewhere.off course any male who is not as good as these guys are going to hate them and hate the show. and that one chick who thinks this show is meant to mock these guys.. its more actually how to show clueless man how to pick up woman.what these guys are doing it way better then what most man are doing-not approaching at all.for anybody who has open mind i recommend to read the book "the game" by neil strauss.it deals with similar theme as this show

i think it is a brilliant show with cool talking heads and very cool action. 2 guys who pretend to be masters in women seduction demonstrate their skills at different night clubs and 4 experts (pickup artists themselves) comment on them, choosing the winner. their jokes are amusing, and some participators are really fun to watch. more so, this show really teaches men how to get in touch with women, lots of expert's comments are useful while you may see how it works in the field. actually i think this is one of the best tv shows and i totally recommend this to all men, who like women.ps/ pardon for my broken engrish.

it is depressing that many people don't understand this movie. to get caught up in the peripheral elements is to miss the true meaning of this film. this film speaks to the minority of people who actually believe in love and truth. it points out that in todays society too often people say what sounds good at the moment with no intention of backing things up when things get rough. as someone else stated that is evident in the number of divorces. some people actually believe marriage is forever. forget about stereotypes or anything else, but rather focus on what is important following your heart and fighting for who you believe in. i liked the ending because it would have been easy to go with a sappy one but came instead with the reality that committent is great, and you should fight with everything you have, but sometimes that still isn't enough. too often people just give up and forget about the magic of love. late.

this is a truly great and beautiful movie. the underlying theme of this movie is the innocent child (heather graham as joline) struggling to make her naive wishes for how the world should be make sense while being incessantly beaten down by the real world. it's not an unhappy movie, though - exactly the opposite. it's a funny movie with a sad side, but just thinking about the movie makes me feel so happy. near the beginning of the movie, beautiful, vulnerable joline confronts a drug addict attempting to break into her friend's car. she reasons with him, convinces him to seek help, and gives him $30 as a start. at the end of the movie, he reappears to pay her back, explains that he is off drugs, doing well, and he thanks her. i can hear the cynics groaning. of *course* that would never really happen. this movie doesn't take place in the real world. it takes place in the world we wished we lived in. the sad part is realizing we don't live there. the happy part is knowing there are people wishing we did.

in an industry dominated by men and in lack of products with a female mark on it ; is it always nice to see a film shown from the woman's point of view. i would welcome more films from female writers and directors , and i think lots of other women with me.

joline (heather graham) married carl (luke wilson) and about five hundred and some days later, carl is very depressed and leaves her, expecting to `clean the fog' in their lives. joline faces her marriage as an important commitment to the end of her life, and decides to look for carl in texas. she is very supported by her brother jay (casey affleck), who meets her in the border of mexico. there, joline meets the confused carl and realizes that she can not change his decision, while jay knows carmen (patricia velasquez) and starts dating her, and in the end `life goes on'. this movie is very unpredictable, having a very different story. i believe it is an independent production. in some parts, it is a little slow and boring, but there are certain dialogs that makes this movie worthwhile. i liked it, and my vote is seven.title (brazil): `rebeldes at√© o fim' (`rebels until the end')

i loved this film! it has a great heart and great bones. i stumbled onto it by chance and i had no recollection, not even an inkling, of this movie from promos or reviews or word of mouth. ¬† i remember reading, many years ago, a journalist who commented on the value of watching movies without having them contaminated by the pre-judgement of reviews or the false shill of the promos. ¬†and this seems to be the single most common source of the critics' negative reaction to the film: ¬†it failed to meet expectations of it being a comedy, or a slice of life, or character driven. ¬†i had no expectation about the film, and so it was comedic - but i only laughed once or twice - without being a comedy; it was about a person, but so eccentric that it wasn't slice of life; it was about a character, but the character was so intelligently optimistic and trusting of her instinct to life, that it wasn't the angst-driven sentimental melodrama so typical of american 'serious' film - as i wrote that i realized that writer/director lisa krueger managed to poke fun at this schlock american sentimentality in the husband! ¬†and very cleverly too! and kreuger was able to keep the cloyingly sentimental ending from the screen, when the wayward,¬†not¬†prodigal, husband returned with his tail shrunk between his legs.¬†bravo, ms. krueger, bravo! ¬†(now i will be watching this film again, as it is getting better and better as i reflect on it.) ¬†¬†graham's performance as joline is brilliant. i loved how subtly but completely she was able to portray and convey intelligent awareness of her committable commitment to honouring her words and actions - she knew that in keeping her word with a band, or friends, or husband that she was setting herself up to ridicule and/or disappointment in a world that was unable to honour commitment as she was able to do. but even with that strength, she was fully connected to humanity, and embraced with a fully committed heart their frailty and failures. the character of joline was amazingly well acted, and i left the film surprised that i had no recollection of awards nominations for it. okay, not that surprised, as american awards tend to go to women in 'serious' roles, filled with angst and the proper amount of nudity, which this film did not have. what it has was far better, which was heart in this woman's discovery of herself with the assistance of new friends and a self-deprecating shaman.i admit to being a bit of a soft touch for eccentric characters who manage their peculiarities while remaining honest and true to themselves as they move through the minefield of what comprises 'proper' societal behaviour and 'acceptable' interpersonal discourse.¬†so, if people must conform to normality in your world, then this film will not be to your liking. ¬†and that was, it seems, one of the common threads in the critiques.and i am always a sucker for a good play on words when it raises questions of human behaviour and ethical/philosophical values. until this movie i hadn't made the emotional connection between being committed (to a cause or honesty or something) and being committed (to an insane asylum). at what point does one's commitment to a personal sense of truth and action in life become a one way ticket to insanity? this sounds like a simple question, or one that is easily dismissed as being rhetorical. but is it? and yet few of the critics - i think maybe two, commented on this aspect of the film either directly or indirectly.a lovely film. 8/10.¬†

the best romantic comedy i've seen in years. not the kind of slick over the top hollywood stuff by ben stiller or adam sandler and a lot less syrupy than a hugh grant epic. julianne nicholson and jay mohr are perfectly cast and both deliver smoothly professional performances as the engaged couple who decide to spend a little time sowing their sexual oats before marriage. instead of playing it strictly for laughs the writers and director concocted a nice blend of human feelings and comedic action. nicholson is just great as the awkward seductress and mohr does a great job as the man who reluctantly enters into the game but soon finds himself enjoying his flings a little too much. we see just enough of the supporting characters to nicely round out the plot without distracting from the main story. andy richter (earnest friend) and helen slater (distraught single-mom) are particularly good. there is enough meaning and emotional complexity to make this a lot more than a standard boy-girl farce. indeed, with just a little better pacing and a tiny bit more cutting this film would be a top ten comedy.

this indie film is worth a look because of the enormous talent of its creators, wallace wolodarsky and marsha forbes. mr. wolodarsky has directed the young cast, and he is to be praised for this effort.the premise of the film is a cautionary tale of the danger for wanting something one can't have. which is the story of alice and ed. after living together for a while, alice suddenly gets restless because she imagines she's lacking experience in the sex area. alice and ed's relationship, while not an example of ideal happiness, is a comfortable way to share their lives with one another. that is, until the moment alice and claire, her sister, happened to bump into a sexual encounter by another couple that has no clue of being observed.this incident makes alice reevaluate her own sexual life with ed; she finds it lacks substance. when she proposes 'seeing other people', ed is shocked, to put it mildly, but not wanting to contradict alice, he decides to go along. what happens next is that both alice and ed enter into a world that's been unknown to them. the people they meet, in the end, are not worth the trouble. they sadly realize at the end, they were made for each other.the film is worth watching in order to see the amazing julianne nicholson, who we happen to have liked in another indie film, "tully". ms. nicholson reminds us of a young shirley mclaine; she projects such a luminous quality about her, that is hard to take one's eyes from her whenever she is in a scene. this young actress proves she is an accomplished performer who gets better with each new appearance. basically, she carries the movie. her alice is a study in contrasts. alice is a decent woman who thinks she is inadequate in pleasing ed because of her inexperience.jay mohr, is an excellent match for ms. nicholson. both do wonders together. his ed is perfectly credible. we have known people like him. deep down inside, he is a good person, who suddenly gets himself in a situation he didn't call for, yet, he goes along only to discover he is too decent and not cut out for a life of gratuitous sex with the willing women that have no problem with a tumble in the hay, just for fun.the rest of the cast is wonderful. lauren graham does some amazing work as claire, alice's yuppie sister. andy ritcher is also wonderful as the grounded carl, the nerdy friend who finally finds out fulfillment when he meets penelope, a single mother. as penelope, helen slater, makes a felicitous, albeit of a short, appearance in the film.the director is enormously gifted, who will no doubt go places because he shows he is well suited for the job.

intense, funny, witty, and more than anything, social comedy on the ways of adult dating and it's results-be it good or bad. mohr and nicholson are engaged couple two months away from a wedding date, when a bizarre event at their engagement party forces nicholson to re-think the relationship and start to date other people so she won't feel so pristine when it comes to sexual experience. this leads to a disaster of events following mohr, nicholson, and their cohorts. very intelligent and needed in this time of clumsy, condescending comedy, while containing your usual variety of comedic, sexual, and frustrated characters(especially charles as a sexually frustrated sex fiend...very annoying) who even they seem to get the right feel to this heart felt commentary.the film goes the way films should go these days, showing that guys are sensitive at heart and have morals. most of the male characters are the moralistic, straight forward eyes, while the woman are the fresh faced street prowlers who will stop at nothing to get pleasure. guys will be appreciative of the message made for guys with self respect, however it is easy to assume that most males who do see this film will use it's message of male sensitivity cover up any flaw or trait that a female might find offending. still, the writing formula uses this as a tool to pave the way for it's male leads, particularly those of mohr, richter, and finding the director in a cameo as a sales man!the females are by far the most promiscuous as they speak of nothing but pleasure and what it would be like to... with someone else. they have amicable traits though, even though they are covered by the image of sex driven kittens. very funny stuff.on another level, the film follows some of it's ensemble into different relationship work. richter meets up with a stressed divorc√©e(a very remarkable and noteworthy performance by the always reliable helen slater) named penelope who is divorced with a son who hates her for splitting with his father. as the two go deeper into a relationship, human interest is revealed and both the comedy and tragedy of divorce and starting anew are studied. by the end of the film, mohr and nicholson have become way to deep over the heads to see what's coming next, and it is up to what they have learned about each other and themselves to decide what will come next. it becomes appropriate and dramatic at just the right time.wallodorski's direction is emulated very well when the characters learn to face each other after all that has happened...with the right ending.all in all, this film should have been released nationwide, and i should hope that it is up for some academy awards...maybe helen slater can finally get the recognition she deserves. anywho, this film is a no hits miss, give it all you got romantic sex farce, displayed very maturely and aesthetically.great film!

i'm sure the film contains certain gaps in logic, but i was so enthralled by it that i really didn't care. the movie plays out like a fun, lighthearted teen romp combined with a schwarzenegger-type action flick. it's packed with action, packed with excitement and has some humorous moments as well. sean astin is fun to watch, and i haven't seen louis gossett, jr. since i saw "diggstown" in theaters. he is a fine, underrated actor and i love watching him on screen. i just wonder what he's doing now. unfortunately, he might be starring in a lot of those direct-to-video flicks. hopefully, my assumption is wrong. anyway, this is a fun, edge-of-your-seat thriller and i definitely suggest you check it out. my score: 7 (out of 10)

'toy soldiers' is the story of five misfits boys (most noteably being sean astin, wil wheaton, and kieth coogan) attempt to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the american government imprisons the leader's father. lou gosset jr. plays the headmaster of the school, a headstrong guy who tries to instill in his students a sense of discipline.'toy soldiers' is a funny and pretty cool action, and certainly the better of hostage-crisis-at-school movies. i think most of the appeal comes from the teen cast, but also, the terrorists don't come off as completely useless whereas in some movies, they never seem to be quite the intimidating group that they should. trapped inside the boarding school, and threatened to be killed if the military or police interferes, this is a very formidable challenge for these group of guys who plan to save the school. they're actually pretty clever about it, too.i was surprised that it was a pretty good movie. it keeps a steady pace and doesn't get ridiculously sentimental or anything like that. astin and gosset jr. give good performances. i, too, agree that this is an underrated action movie.

i came across this movie while channel surfing one day; and decided to give it a chance. to my surprise i enjoyed this darkhorse movie. i felt some genuine chemistry between challen cates and malcolm-jamal warner. it was such a lighthearted and warm movie that when it was over i felt upbeat. sure, this movie was predictable from the very beginning, but i give it high marks for the way that it made me feel when it was over. i must admit that i have never seen challen cates before, but i feel that she can definitely act. when you combine her good acting with her cute face and attractive figure. she has the makings of at least becoming a well-known star.

a tender movie that represents how our daily life is a catalyst that causes us to change our thoughts, behaviors and emotions into people we're not. this story is a love story where true emotions arise. i credit malcolm jamal warner (win) and challen cates for outstanding performances . a movie definitely worth seeing, a holiday roadtrip that turns into an emotional turn-a-round. i suggest seeing it.

"a fare to remember" is a totally derivative, almost ridiculous movie, but has a warmth about it that makes it a very effective and upbeat holiday movie. it stars a pretty newcomer, challen kates, as a high-powered ad executive who, right before her wedding, has to rush from l.a. to seattle to keep a client who has rejected every other presentation. she has transportation difficulties from the beginning and seemingly no money. this is the first dumb thing - were there no atms anywhere? she must make a fortune. at any rate, she meets a cab driver (warner) who looks like a homeless man, and he drives her to her presentation and when she emerges with a huge box of beef jerky (the client's product), he's there to take her to the airport. all flights are canceled, so in order to get to l.a. for her wedding, she hires him to take her there.along the way, they bond and learn from each other. it's a very sweet movie though there is absolutely nothing new in it - it combines "six days and seven nights" and a few other films. but the chemistry between the stars is good, they're likable, and the acting is good. look for jerry springer as the head of the beef jerky company and a cameo by karl malden.this is a nice film to take in over the holiday season. it's on lifetime.

most christmas movies have a "redemption" theme but most are a variation on a very similar plot. this movie is wacky and has an unusual plot. you may need to hang in there for the first half where events may seem hard to believe for a movie (but not as unbelievable as real life - scott adams, the creator of dilbert, says he's never made up anything in any of his cartoons - they're all based on real life stories told to him by his fans). the second half starts to fit the plot together. i enjoyed it. btw, one reviewer noted that the idea of someone not having cash available is not credible in these days of atms, but it's perfectly credible if you've lost your wallet - who carries atm cards anywhere else while on a business trip?

this movie was a suprise for me while i was surfing from channel to channel... i don't know why but it filled in me with warmth and happiness. this is what a high budget movie can not do mostly. i liked it, this is "a must see" one...

challen cates does a wonderful job depicting a conflicted bride, torn between the challenges that await her professionally, the memories of the freedom she thought she would have when in college (inspired by a famous author) and the safety of her pending marriage to a man she really doesn't love. this movie is definitely worth seeing--- as predictable as it may be, the acting is inspiring and real chemistry exists between challen cates and malcolm jamaal warner.

now i like victor herbert. and i like mary martin and allan jones. but it would have been nice to see a real biography of victor herbert. walter connolly as herbert does have a decent resemblance to him in his latter yearsjones and martin sing beautifully though. the herbert music is just there to adorn the plot line concerning these two musical performers. jones's john ramsay is a frail character, very similar to gaylord ravenal in showboat who jones also played.as for mary martin, it's a mystery why she never had a good hollywood career. she did films with bing crosby and dick powell as well as this one. she performed well, but movie audiences didn't take to her. the best musical moment in the film is jones and martin in a duet of thine alone. the recordings i have of the song are individual and it was written as a duet. there's also a pleasant scene with jones and martin riding bicycles swapping herbert songs as they ride.the real victor herbert with his womanizing and his irish patriot background and his musical training in germany where he developed a love for all things german would have been a fascinating study. he was also a cello virtuoso before he turned full time to composing. i have to take strong exception to the reviewer who said cuddles sakall would have been a good victor herbert. sakall as irish, hello.nice movie, but the real vic would have been so much better.

i cannot argue with other comments that the story line focuses more on the romance between the mary martin and allan jones characters, much in the manner of "showboat", than on the life of victor herbert. but in the 1930's, would that have been a box office draw? instead of the life of vh, perhaps it should have been the music of vh. there is an abundance of this.for me, the thrill of the movie came near the end of the movie when susanna foster sings "land of romance". it has been over a decade since i caught this movie for a second time at a local 'old movies' theater. at first the audience was stunned; then it burst into spontaneous applause. i remember the shivers running up and down my spine. my trivia memory recalled the information provided to an inquiring public by a local journalist when the movie first came out back in the late 1930's. 'that note hit by miss foster was a far f above high c.'she may not have had four octaves a la yma sumac but the then teen-ager certainly had a range!

the cinematography is the film's shining feature. park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera. every shot is filled with vibrant colors that leap off of the screen. every frame of the film seems to tell a story all on its own. i hope there's a blu-ray release of this film because it will look fantastic. it's rather intriguing to see which elements of the vampire mythology park used for his vision. sang-hyeon has to drink blood to survive and to stay looking flawless, has incredible strength, and is vulnerable to sunlight. he doesn't, however, have fangs and also has a reflection in the mirror.although i've never seen the film, i couldn't help but feel like this was chan-wook park's version of twilight. the entire middle portion of the film is devoted to sang-hyeon's and tae-joo's love for one another. it felt like the adult version of twilight, really. there's a lot of blood, nudity, sex, and even a few obscenities thrown in for good measure. maybe it's the chan-wook park fanboy in me, but i honestly feel like i can guarantee that this is the better film of the two. the psychological aspect that i love about park's previous films is in thirst, as well. that's a major factor for me as any film that causes me to think or is unusual in any way winds up becoming a fan favorite. the soundtracks to park's films always seem to fit its respective film like a glove. thirst is no exception. while the soundtrack is a bit more subtle this time around, it fit the overall atmosphere of the film rather effortlessly.the middle portion of the film did seem to drag on longer than everything else in the film. it's weird though as the scenes during that time are crucial to the storyline of the film and it's hard to imagine thirst being the same film if any of those scenes were cut. nevertheless, it is my one nitpick of the film.chan-wook park bites into the vampire mythology with thirst and puts his own dark, psychological twist on it. park's films always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the following: great writing, beautiful cinematography, a solid cast, some sort of psychological twist that'll mess with your head, and a memorable ending. thirst delivers on all fronts and will hopefully get more of the attention it deserved during its theatrical run on dvd (and eventually blu-ray, hopefully).

i wasn't expecting much because of the harsh reviews, and proceeded to enjoy the movie a great deal as a result. softer colors and less stunning compositions of the shots than some of his previous films, in my opinion, allowed the narrative to take the focus. though the religious conflict in a vampire flick was commonplace, i felt like many of the other things were not. for example:how his powers were often revealed through interaction with her.the very strong and well acted love scenes.the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other actually separating them even more.their strong differences of what it means to be 'vampire' created by their prior life experiences.the lack of scores of other vampires appearing or being created through the movie.i've heard and read several things about 'tricks used in other films'. of course. however, i feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and i feel that he does this well. i don't need a director to use new tricks. i prefer that the tricks that are used are used well and appropriately, which i feel is the case with this film. i recommend it.

an on screen caption informs us that it is 'the caribbean sea, may 1891'. a small lifeboat drifts aimlessly at sea containing six convicts from a shipwrecked prison ship, and the ship's doctor a lt. claude de ross (claudio cassinelli). it's night, a strange current takes the boat towards a strange, unnamed and uncharted island. the boat hits some rocks and is torn apart. one of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fish-man creature. the next morning morning claude wakes up to find himself washed upon a beach. he finds a pool of white bubbling water and one of the prisoners dead beside it. claude warns another surviving prisoner jose (franco iavarone) not to drink the water as it will kill him. they both eventually meet up with the other surviving prisoners, peter (roberto posse), francois (francesco mazzeri) and skip (giuseppe castellano). francois wanders off on his own to try and catch an animal for food, he finds and kills a large water bird. but in turn he is killed himself by one of the fish-men. claude, jose, peter and skip continue to explore the island as they put francois's death down to an animal attack of some sort. soon after skip is killed when he is impaled on a spike at the bottom of a pit. now only claude, jose and peter are left. they stumble across a cemetery with lots of empty graves and signs of recent black magic rituals. claude spots a snake on a nearby rock, suddenly a shot is heard and the snakes head explodes. a woman on horseback named amanda marvin (barbara bach) is revealed to be claudes saviour. she tells them to leave the island immediately as it is owned by a edmund rackham (richard johnson) and he doesn't like visitors. claude, jose and peter decide to carry on regardless, eventually finding rackham's large house in which they are invited to stay. that night peter goes after amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp, peter quickly becomes food for the fish-men. and a voodoo priestess called shakira (beryl cunningham), who lives with rackham, performs a black magic ritual involving slitting the throat of a chicken at the cemetery. the next day claude and jose decide they should leave the island as they feel very uneasy about rackham and think he is lying to them. jose rides off on horseback and is lost. claude is saved from one of the fish-men by amanda and is again told to leave. claude wants to confront rackham again. rackham reveals that he has a scientist, and amanda's father, named professor ernest marvin (joseph cotten) who he needs to be kept alive. rackham says that the longer ernest stays alive the chances of his own survival will dramatically increase. rackham tells claude his plan. rackham has found the lost city of atlantis at a depth of over 2,000 feet. he is using the fish-men as a means of getting at the lost treasures of atlantis, and needs amanda and her father to control them. he claims the fish-men are descendants of the original inhabitants of atlantis. rackham offers claude a share of the treasure if he will help him keep ernest alive. later claude remembers the name ernest marvin as a scientist who was condemned for experiments transplanting animal organs into human beings. finding ernest's secret laboratory he discovers rackham had lied to him and the fish-men aren't descendants, their actually genetically altered people turned into amphibious creatures by ernest's grotesque experiments! rackham has finally had enough of claude and decides to put an end to his meddling by sticking him in a large tank and slowly filling it with water, as the islands volcano starts to erupt and send lava flying everywhere. rackham wants to leave the island with his treasures and amanda, will claude escape almost certain death to save amanda and get off the island before the erupting volcano tears it apart? directed by sergio martino i really liked this film that mixes various genres. the script by sergio donati is fast paced, interesting and entertaining. the plot is revealed bit by bit, which kept me interested in watching it all the way through. i must say at this point that i've seen the original version and not the one with added scenes inserted for it's us release by roger corman. barbara bach makes for an extremely attractive leading lady, but i hated the way she was introduced by shooting a snakes head off, i thought it was more than a little distasteful. richard johnson makes a great villain and claudio cassinelli a likable hero. the fish-men themselves look a little fake when the camera lingers on them too long but their cool looking and i've seen worse. some of the miniature effects look a little poor too, but overall again i've again seen a lot worse. there's no real gore, violence or nudity in it, but that didn't really bother me actually. the photography by giancarlo ferrando and the production design by massimo antonello geleng combine to create a very nice looking film. period costumes, props and sets like rackham's house and ernest's lab with it's old scientific equipment. the lush green jungle settings also add to the visual splendour on show. i really liked this film and i was entertained throughout it's running time. i'm not sure who i'd recommend it too as it mixes various genres, i guess someone who maybe fancies something a little bit different and generally well made. if you can find a copy give it a go, i'm glad i did.

this movie is based on the novel island of dr. moreau by h.g. wells. it's a fairly good one too, it's at least better than the version by john frankenheimer.

1891: stalwart, morally upright military doctor lieutenant claude de ross (solid claudio cassinelli) and several other shipwreck survivors wash ashore on a remote tropical island that's governed with an iron fist by the ruthless and sadistic edmund rackham (superbly played to the deliciously slimy hilt by richard johnson), who lives on the island with the feisty amanda martin (a winningly spunky performance by the ravishing barbara bach) and her unhinged rogue biologist father professor ernest martin (a marvelously dotty portrayal by joseph cotten). moreover, de ross discovers that professor martin has control over a dangerous race of fishman beasts who are being exploited as slave labor by rackham. director/co-writer sergio martino relates the lively and absorbing story at a constant snappy pace, offers a flavorsome evocation of the lush and remote tropical setting, does an expert job of creating and maintaining a creepy and mysterious atmosphere in the spooky opening third, further spices things up with a nice line in dry humor, and stages the exhilarating action-loaded climax with considerable rip-roaring aplomb. while the central premise is obviously inspired by "the island of dr. moreau," the story nonetheless is given a great deal of freshness and intrigue because of martino's artful melding of such diverse elements as voodoo, the lost underwater city of atlantis, a rousing mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption, buried treasure, unscrupulous genetic experiments, and even some exciting rough'tumble fisticuffs between de ross and rackham during the thrilling conclusion into an altogether dynamic, imaginative, and often immensely entertaining whole. the sound acting by the sturdy cast qualifies as another substantial plus: cassinelli makes for a likable hero, johnson essays his juicy villain part with supremely lip-smacking aplomb, bach rates as a quite fetching damsel in distress, plus there are neat supporting contributions by beryl cunningham as sinister voodoo priestess shakira, franco iavarone as the superstitious jose, and roberto posse as surly troublemaker peter. giancarlo fernando's sumptuous widescreen cinematography delivers a wealth of striking visuals while luciano michelini's throbbing tribal score hits the funky spot. the amphibious humanoid fishman creatures are pretty gnarly-looking, too. an extremely fun flick.

watching this odd little adventure movie, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who brought us such high quality giallo classics as the strange vice of mrs wardh and the case of the scorpion's tail, but it has to be said that despite it's low quality production values, island of the fish men is an entertaining ride and one that surely deserves more praise than it's getting. like many italian films from the seventies, this is one is a rip off of a successful american film, the one in question this time being the critically panned island of dr moreau. sergio martino's film takes ideas such as mutation, greed and adventure and moulds it into one slightly compelling film, which makes up for what it's lacks in coherency and logic with a load of mostly intriguing ideas. the central plot follows a boat which crashes on a small island. it quickly becomes apparent that not everything about this place is normal, and it soon transpires that half of the population has been turned into "fish men" - a cross between a man and a fish, which exist for purely selfish reasons...the truth about this movie is that it's a lot more fun if you ignore the trashy production values. the central monsters look completely ridiculous, and much of the movie takes place on sets that look like they cost someone a few pennies - but the movie is well shot in spite of this, with the underwater photography being a particular highlight and the pacing of the movie is well done in that the film never becomes boring. the way that the plot comes together isn't exactly genius, but it takes in a lot of ideas and i've seen films made on plots with much less thought put into them than this one. the biggest location standout in the film is definitely the lost city of atlantis. to be honest, i'm not a massive fan of adventure movies, and therefore don't see this lost city get mentioned much - but it is always nice to see it in a movie. the central island location is good in that it provides an apt setting for the story and also provides the movie with the right amount of mystery, as martino makes good use of the voodoo theme. overall, this isn't exactly a classic and there are certainly a lot worse trashy adventure movies out there than this one.

lt. claude (claudio cassinelli) and several prisoners from his sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by edmond rackham (richard johnson). following a few random prisoner deaths, rackham takes in claude and his two remaining prisoners. luckily for everyone, barbara bach just happens to be on the island too! unluckily, there are some crazy fishmen who like to kill people.this italian produced exploiter seems to have it all - a touch of creature from the black lagoon mixed with dr. moreau with a dash of white zombie voodoo and atlantis stuff. despite some wonky looking fishmen costumes, the film does benefit from some beautiful location photography and a nice twist about halfway through. all of the actors are good and joseph cotton even pops up as a old biologist. director sergio martino handles himself well enough as there is action ever 10 minutes or so. that can't be said for his belated follow-up the fishmen and their queen (1995), easily one of the wackiest and most off-base sequels since highlander ii.

i saw this movie on television as screamers and loved it. i heard an interesting story about this film. when roger corman released it to drive-ins in the summer of 1981, his trailer department sent out an advance trailer which was not actually footage from the film. it was allegedly footage of a naked woman being chased around a laboratory set by a monster. during the film's opening at drive-in's, irate customers complained the did not see the movie they paid to see. theater owners called corman and said their customers felt ripped off. so corman had to run off copies of the footage, and send the positive film to theater owners to splice into the film themselves. since the footage was never part of the film negative, it has not appeared in any video, dvd or television broadcast. has anyone ever seen this footage? anyone who saw this film at a drive-in in the summer of 1981 remember this?

action packed,with my favorite type of creature.i won't give any of it away if you have'nt seen it,cause it's worth taking the time to sit down and unravel in the mystery of things as presented in this film.it did gets slow at times and those were the moments my mind wondered which does easily anyways but moist of it kept me quietly thrilled,where you keep it in your head instead of letting it out,probably the mood i was in at the time.special effects and action sequences you could feel made up for the occasional lulls.of course there'es a duschload of movies out there exactly like this,the film still has it's own style and flavor,which i respect from underground independent horror movies anyways.

although the video box for many copies of this film claims it is about people turned inside out, this is a total lie. in fact, apart from the opening segment, the film isn't even a horror movie. with its sunken treasure, legions of fish people, and mad scientists, it's a lot more like a doug mcclure adventure movie. obviously, this film is no work of art, but it's kind of fun to watch... just be warned that the beginning is quite gory.

when a group of escaped convicts manage to flee to a remote island,they soon find that their new home is inhabited by a strangely menacing doctor(richard johnson of "zombi 2" fame),a mad scientist(joseph cotten),his beautiful daughter(barbara bach)and a horde of superstitious natives.the tribesmen say that the doctor has created grotesque half-human,half-fish creatures for evil,secretive purposes.and though at first the prisoners do not believe this,as they disappear,one by one,they begin to change their minds."screamers" is a very entertaining mix of "mysterious island" and "humanoids from the deep".there is plenty of gore with really cool decapitation scene and throat tearing to boost.the acting is so-so,but the film is fast-paced and entertaining.give it a look.8 out of 10.

fans of euro-horror flicks - portland's video/dvd store movie madness has a whole section devoted to this genre - can't afford to miss sergio martino's gut-busting "l'isola degli uomini pesce" (called "screamers" in the united states). here's the lowdown: some shipwreck survivors land on an uncharted caribbean island in 1891. the island is inhabited by a landowner, a scientist (joseph cotten) and his daughter (barbara bach). sure enough, it turns out that the landowner is making the scientist create a race of fish-men. and while the fish-men remain calm as long as they can drink their potion, they get nasty otherwise.this movie is sort of a mixture of genres: euro-horror, swashbuckling, voodoo, and maybe a little bit of "the island of dr. moreau". but it's mostly an excuse to have the fish-men disembowel trespassers; ya gotta love that! i wouldn't be surprised if the euro-horror genre gave quentin tarantino some of his ideas for "grindhouse". after all, the european horror directors have no scruples about what they show. this is one that you're sure to like.so joseph cotten is the only cast member from an alfred hitchcock movie (i mean "shadow of a doubt") who later co-starred with ringo starr's soon-to-be wife and audrey hepburn's ex (by whom i mean mel ferrer) in an italian horror flick. the things that we see in life...

screamers is an italian fantasy film (l'isola degli uomini pesce) bought by roger corman and released through his new world pictures. of course corman has to carve his initials on it by having one of his lackeys (dan t. miller) direct some additional gore footage before he has it released in the states.l'isola degli uomini pesce is a very entertaining retelling of the island of dr. moreau. it is 1891 and claudio cassinelli is shipwrecked on a mysterious island with a few newly escaped convicts. claudio comes across the stellar barbara bach and richard johnson. johnson plays the dastardly edmund rackham: a man who is able to manipulate scientist joseph cotton into turning the local native population into amphibious deep-sea diving creatures, (they look like a cross between the black lagoon creature and one of the humanoids from the deep), by convincing cotton that the mutations are being created for the highest of scientific and humanitarian motives.having discovered the lost city of atlantis, rackham is using the amphibious creatures to loot its treasures. sexy barbara bach plays cotton's daughter who has a psychic link with these mutations. in one memorable scene, bach takes a midnight swim with these mutants wearing only a thin white cotton dress that leaves little to the imagination. claudio discovers one of the convicts he has befriended has been turned into a gill-creature and then all hell breaks loose.filmed at the same time and in the same location as zombi 2, richard johnson didn't even have to change suits between films. the house where the experiments take place is the same house johnson uses to conduct experiments in zombi 2. talk about economic filmmaking!the additional footage features a few bloody beheadings, (way to go roger!), and a laughably bad cameron mitchell doing his best pirate imitation. all that's missing is the parrot.spanish title: le continent des hommes poissons

this movie surprised me. the box is misleading, the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading. the movie is quite gory, well-acted and beautifully shot. the special-effects are top-notch and seem to be ahead of their time, until you realize this movie came out in 1979, not in 1963 like it's tone would suggest. it is a unique take on the dr. moreau story, and one of the better versions filmed. the first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking, but the film doesn't ever really fall apart. definitely worth-seeing if you are a fan of dramatic costume/horror classics and gore-fests.

i finally got a chance to settle in and compare the two versions of this film currently going around -- first, the good old scummy, sleazy embassy vhs print called screamers, and then a new fully restored italian dvd by everyone's new favorite media company, no shame of italy.the american adverts about "men turned inside out" is as everyone says, totally misleading, and indicative of a roger cormanized take on what otherwise would be a superior fantasy-adventure thriller for grown ups. the complete italian version is a somewhat sprawling, well designed and deliberately paced take on "island of dr. moreau", and there's nothing wrong with that. it's a sumptuous, handsome euro horror outing with a brain, good plotting, character development, location shooting, period costuming and sets, etc.but i must admit that the 14 year old knucklehead weed puffer still lurking somewhere inside of me got a bigger kick out of the more lurid, sleazy and unkempt roger corman version, which has some nice over the top gore, a flashy but preposterous opening segment, and then the bulk of martino's original film, albeit somewhat abridged to make room for roger's idea of entertainment. the pacing was somewhat quicker, the shock sequences closer together, and you see just as much of ms. bach's fantastic form as you do in the extended italian version.i still don't have much of an idea about what the specific story concerns though: there are a number of plot twists and incidental characters that were somewhat hard to keep track of. a local voodoo subplot didn't help much, and it's funny how everything culminates in just another fistfight between the noble castaway prisoner and the mad scientist ... perhaps a few more viewings are in order. i will say this: fans of the movie should avail themselves of one of these pal imports and take a look at what is actually a movie rather than just another murky old home video -- the widescreen shot compositions once again reveal that martino had an eye for filling his screen with interesting stuff. nobody gets their heads ripped off like in the screamers print, but it's still interesting stuff, and once again proof that while his standards may have been pretty much confined to the area around the gutter, roger corman new good trashy fun when he had it made for him, and side by side these are actually better movies than they had to be.7/10

sure, most people will designate "island of the fishmen" as silly and trashy hokum, but can you honestly name one other movie that brings forward this many exhilarating themes? this italian gem stands for pure entertainment and features stuff like voodoo, volcanic eruptions, mutant fish-creatures, the mysterious continent of atlantis, treasure-hunting, a remote island filled with death traps and utterly mad scientists! all this and much more in one simple movie? yes, please! close-minded opponents of italian horror cinema can easily tag this film as a cheap exploitation version of "the island of dr. moreau", but the truth is that this is so much more! "island of the fishmen" delivers thrills and adventure from start to finish with surprisingly convincing special effects and astonishingly stylish camera-work. the story promisingly opens with a small group of prisoners, survivors of a shipwreck, washing ashore a tropical island. they encounter the sadistic edmond rackham who rules over a native tribe¬Öand a legion of genetically created amphibian monsters that live in the island's swamps. there are so many twists and additional sub-plots in the story that it's almost impossible to write a summary but, trust me, this gem is worth checking out. sergio martino once again proves that he's an ingenious filmmaker who has the talent to be commercial-minded and creative at the same time. he makes great use of the beautiful island location and also the interior sets look very impressive. the staggering underwater footage and imaginative scenery really lift this film high above the normal standards of late 70's exploitation. i don't quite understand why roger corman reworked the original so much and released it on the american market under a different title ("screamers"), because there are very few elements open for improvement. the cast members are all sergio martino regulars (with the exception of the great joseph cotton is a neat supportive rule) and give away great performances. in case you can get your hands on the recently restored german version, you're treated to fifteen uncut minutes of extra action. see it!

this is a very odd movie for harold lloyd--at least in regard to the sweet character he played in movies throughout the 1920s and 30s. instead of a nice guy, he and snib pollard are con men--out to rob everyone blind. in a particularly successful con, chester pretends to have lost a "very valuable ring" and a bit later, harold finds it as a stooge is also looking for the ring. the ring, of course, is a cheap one dropped and then found by harold, but the greed of the stooge is so great, he "convinces" harold to say nothing and sell him the "valuable" ring and then they run away to enjoy their luck(?). again and again they find patsies until they meet up with a woman who herself is a con woman (working with a guy doing fake s√©ances). she arranges a nifty con and takes all the money they stole--and has a cop standing by to make sure they give her the money.as luck would have it, the two con men stumble into the lady's shady business when no one is home. soon, the lady returns and messes with their minds--releasing a lot of dirty tricks to punish them for their wicked ways.all around, this is a completely odd and contrived film, but it is also exceedingly funny, as the jokes work very well and lloyd and pollard make an excellent team. plus, while creepy and strange, i liked seeing pollard dressed like a lady.

i just watched this, an early harold lloyd short film that featured his "glasses" character on kino video's dvd of "the harold lloyd collection". he's actually a con man with snub pollard as his partner who gets discovered by bebe daniels who herself performs fake s√©ances. what she discovers is that lloyd and pollard bilk many customers by dropping fake rings that are "lost". i'll stop there and just say this was quite funny especially when harold and snub enter the place bebe works and encounter some creepy contraptions and put on costumes like snub trying one of bebe's outfits. not too much slapstick but what there is of was also quite funny. so on that note, i recommend are crooks dishonest?

was struck at how even the acting was throughout. william haines had an acting range that is wonderful for silent film. not over the edge. there are moments where the camera work is most excellent, and combined with the story, like when he is waiting to see the superintendent, very well done. thoroughly enjoyed the flick.

a brash, self-centered army cadet arrives at west point with a dangerous wise guy attitude towards the corps.in a role obviously tailor-made for him, william haines shines in this highly enjoyable tale of honor & friendship. a grade-a scene stealer, haines during the first half of the film is up to his usual silly billy behavior, which under normal circumstances should have gotten him confined to the guardhouse. the last half, however, becomes very serious, leading up to haines' moral redemption and giving him a fine opportunity to exhibit his acting talents. if west point does not quite reach the caliber of haines' previous tell it to the marines (1926), this is doubtless due to the absence here of a costar of the charisma & quality of lon chaney for haines to interact with. however, this tribute to the army is very effective entertainment and should be appreciated on its own merit.joan crawford appears as haines' love interest, playing the virginal daughter of the local innkeeper. joan is pert & pretty and especially shines in her first scenes, when she meets haines on a hudson river ferry and is subjected to his usual immature antics. haines & crawford made five silent feature films together and were tremendous friends for life. he was the much bigger celebrity at this period and gave her many hints for getting ahead in hollywood. a superstar herself by the early 1930's, she reciprocated after his ouster from mgm in 1932 by encouraging his career change to interior decoration.little william bakewell is effectively cast as a plebe who idolizes haines; their relationship is actually given more of a sentimental treatment than that of haines & crawford.the film was made with the full cooperation of the war department. extensive location filming at the academy helps tremendously with the production's ambiance, which was given splendid production values by mgm.west point has been recently restored and given a rousing new score by david davidson.

haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks west point will really amount to something now that he has arrived. haines displays his easy, goofy comic persona as he takes on west point and joan crawford, the local beauty. great fun for the first half. and amazingly touching after haines's character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets. the new, humility-filled haines get s alast-minute reprieve to play in the bill football game against navy and, despite a broken arm, wins the game. great, rousing entertainment by mgm in this haines formula film, shows billy at his best. william bakewell also scores as the skinny follower. the handsome-but-goony character would be played by clark gable, cary grant, gary cooper and others in later decades, another take on the beautiful-but-daffy dames played by carole lombard and marion davies. west point is a winner!

i found west point to be an agreeable film, although i doubt that i would watch it again. the performances were convincing, with william haines as yet another obnoxiously amusing young man that has his come-uppance by film's end. it's hard to believe that stardom beckoned joan crawford less than a year after this film was made, as she looks rather awkward at times. i would apply the comment made by another concerning ramon novarro's "huddle" (1932) to this film as well. there is a great film waiting to be made here, but there is something lacking. the backdrop and integration of the corps was well utilized, but i was less involved than i thought that i would be. perhaps haines' character went too far, or got away with too much. his "repentance" did not seem genuine enough; and what kind of message did it send for him to run every play in the last minutes of the army-navy game? where's "the corps" in that? might as well have taken out the other ten men and let him do it all himself. also, i doubt very much that william bakewell's weak, puny character would ever have a real-life counterpart at west point.all this aside, the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring. it is a fine look into the daily practices of an honorable institution. thank goodness that tradition still means something at west point too, unlike the vapid "traditions" of ivy league schools, only half-heartedly engaged in these days.as to the score: it was appropriately martial. but, there was a distinct over-use of snare drums. using them for knocks on the door, scene transitions, et alu as well as in well over half the scenes got to be rather tedious. it rather lessened the viewing experience. i was ready to say "i get the point already." with that, enjoy the film, but don't expect too much emotional involvement.

william haines sparks this tale of a brash cadet who thinks west point will really be something now that he has arrived. terrific goony comic performance by haines was his trademark--one that made him a top box office star from 1928-1932 and one of mgm's biggest stars. joan crawford and william bakewell are fine too. and although this storyline may seem trite now, this was a huge hit, putting haines and crawford in a college football (a national craze during the 20s) story. after haines blows off his big mouth one time too often and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets, he turns in a wonderful performance as he swallows his pride and gets into the big game against navy. even with a broken arm, he wins the game for army and regains his place at west point. it's easy to see from this film and show people (with the always underrated marion davies) why billy haines was a huge star of the time. he needs and deserves to be remembered!

it is a shame that this series hasn't been remastered and produced on video by warner or some other professional movie house.copies of most episodes are available, but are usually of poor quality, being copies of copies of copies.as i understand it, 92 episodes were produced during its run, but only 15 are noted here.some of the series writers, such as richard matheson, went on to become noted authors.excellent series, well written, well staged and well produced.michael weldon,udon thani, thailand

everything about "choose connor" was top=drawer, especially the script and the very proficient work done by the 21-year-old director, writer, producer luke eberl . . . a talented young man from whom to expect great things. all the acting was credible, the dialogue smart, the theme important. loved it!!!saw it at the 2007 woodstock film festival, where it was screened twice and went over tremendously with the audiences. it's more than just a coming of age movie -- this kid learns a hard, heartbreaking lesson about trust, politics and "the system" -- how things really work to suit the personal agendas of those in powerful positions.i would recommend this movie to anyone with a working brain.

if there are people that don't like this movie, i don't think they are human. this film deploys all emotions and shows many sides of judith light's character. made in 1997, this is one of the best movies i have seen and really the film that judith light has starred in to make me a huge fan of hers. this movie, although sometimes you want to rattle the son for trusting her so much, is incredibly moving. i cry at the end every time and it takes much to do that to me! the plot doesn't have much to it but the acting provided by judith light is incredible. she looks beautiful the whole time and by the end, you don't want the fate imposed by the courts to happen to her. overall, a movie worth my highest praise! thank you for making it and redefining my view on the death penalty. i eagerly await this movie to come out on dvd or some other form of media since lifetime is starting to issue some movies to customers. although i don't have high hopes for this one because this took place almost 9 years ago, which is still hard to believe, since this movie is still ingrained into my head after all this time.

an incredible performance! this is one of the best films i have seen ever. i know this is being said a lot, but i bet you will not regret watching this film.it's great from the very beginning to the last second. the acting (of especially the mother - played by judith light) is so convincing, there are not many other films i've seen that could compare to it, and it seems it's impossible not to feel anything for the people in this drama.there are lots and lots of movies made every year, but if you have to choose just to see a few in your life - make this one of them.

when i first saw this movie back in the middle of january (2005) i didn't like it. i thought it was too weird and thought that some parts that the main star, judith light, acted were so unlike her. (which of course is true) and then i watched bits of it the next day when it re-aired and i felt pretty much the same. then i watched it again two sundays ago (march 20th, 2005) and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing. i even cried the first 2 times, but mainly because the actress was actually crying and i am a big fan of hers.it is a very well acted and done tv movie. judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film! i keep watching it over and over. it's a sad movie, but very good.if you have not seen this movie, i definitely recommend it! it's not usually my type of movie, but i did enjoy this one! a+++

the movie was certainly true to the real life story on which it was based. it was hard for me to find newspaper articles about the actual facts, but when i located them, i could see that truth, in this case, was stranger than fiction. judith light was frighteningly evil in her role as the mother in this movie, so much so that it was difficult to separate her from the role, the mark i think of an excellent performance. rick schroder was appropriately clueless as her son who also defended her in court, an example of how hard it can be in some circumstances for a child to accept the actions of a parent, no matter how criminal they may be. one can find fault with the movie, but not with its treatment of the reality on which it was based.

a story of love between two people at the end of wwii. beautifully filmed, very romantic and yet rather fatalistic fable of budding love and war that would not end. if you want happy endings don't watch wajda movies, sweety.

there is one of the best movies directed by andrzej wajda,that story told about young writer who is seekin' his place after a second war(he's survive german camp).excellent true atmosphere(action goes in camp for displaced placed),main hero(played by one of the best polish actor daniel olbrychski) finally fall in love ,but unfortunately his lady has been killed .there was beautiful scene,when he is talking with american soldier and says (about death his girl)"nothing is happen,simply you're shootin' to us now... he's condition of soul has been destroyed. 10/10

krajobraz po bitwie like many films of wajda is, perhaps, not understandable for the "rest of the world". story based on the few short stories of tadeusz borowski, who during wwii was the prisoner of oswiecim, dachau and dautmergen camps. borowski in his books describes inhuman life in the nazi camps from the point of view vorarbeiter tadek - porte parole of author who also was on the privileged position among the prisoners. borowski was merciless for the humanity and merciless for himself. he describes the human history as the endless chain of exploitation and humiliation. ironically, after the returning to poland he stopped writing artistic prose and became communistic propagandist, producing stream of anti-imperialistic and anti-american press publications. after few years he committed suicide. in the movie wajda changes point of view. vorarbeiter tadek - character created by the tadeusz janczar - plays only supporting role. story is focused on the poet, destroyed, burned out by the war and imprisonement and his one-day love affair with nina, jewish girl who escaped from communistic poland although she actually hates jewish life and mentality. as the background we can observe sad grotesque of so-called "dipis" (displaced persons) life, who after the liberation are settled by the americans in ss barracks. marches, patriotic kitsch mixed with hunting for the extra dose of food and/or prostituting german girls.

aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too fat, this film rings true on the chaos of the post-war.beautiful photography, and a powerful national expression of the polish national character.it's very slow at points, but its entire pacing is so different from american and western european films that it's quite refreshing.both lead actors do a very good job. on the dvd version, you can see interviews with the principal actors and crew, and the lead actress stanislawa celinska has gained about 50 lbs and lost all of her beauty. but in 1970, she was a stunner.

in landscape after the battle, andrzej wajda in the second era of his filmmaking career, depicts emotional and psychological confusion in a former nazi-prison in poland, freed immediately after the wwii.a hand-held camera explores a lot of extreme close-ups and vivid colors. the end credit as graffiti on flanks of freight train cars symbolically concludes the film. the soundtrack is great, except vivaldi, which sounds tacky in pop-art fashion, in the opening sequence.

"landscape after a battle" opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences - in rather funny movements accompanied by vivaldis four seasons. a touching opening. but we soon enough learn to know these prisoners as a mob, and when they (also treated humouristic) burry a man alive, the protagonist stops for a moment, but is soon more engaged in finding books from the turndowned camp than caring about his neighbour.the rest of the film is set in an american camp from where the prisoners are not released, in some kind of semi freedom, semi camp. a perfect set for a study of war criminality, american camps, polish nationalism, catholisism, grief and human misery in general.film makes an important turn. in comes women, and with them film changes light, colour and temper. at the same time it turns out that these prisoners were slaves in holocaust. i think a main underlying political theme of the film must mankind's treatments of jews under and after the world war, and not only the nazi exterminations, but mankind letting it happen - and even forcing them out of europe after the war. on an emotional level the film is about grief and the problem with letting grief come, how environment makes grief difficult, and how difficult it can be to share grief for people with different experiences. but the film is a carpet of underlying contradictions,humour, irony and sudden beauty. a couple of times during the film a gypsy prisoner plays on an harp, an emotional tune brutally rejected (filmatically speaking) by the protagonist. that example picks up an important essence of the film's style and theme. when it comes to humour its very comic how the protagonist constantly looses and finds back his glasses, in crowds, in hay stacks etc.its not hard to understand spielberg's respect of wajda when you see this film. the great treatment of light can be compared with spielberg on his best. the grunwald intermezzo speaks for itself. narrativly it only brings the film out of the camp, but filmatically it brings the film to dream and eternity with profound beauty. anyhow, there is also another scene i can't let go without comment. its the christian supper. undoubtly ironical, but simultaneously deeply religious we see the transsubstantiation moment, everybody falling on their knees, while the protagonist is saved from isolation by the priest to serve as a comic altar boy. his bells are mocking the scene, but also gives it emotion and love. when nina gets her bread, sun light falls upon her and bells ring spheric, its the peak moment of the film.main actors are excellent in their roles. olbrychski as the perfect wajda protagonist - the doubting reflecting mind, unable to put all the aspects of his mind and emotion into life. beautiful celinska is with great body acting debuting in a character unable to express all her inner in her proud movements.those who try to describe everything, often are unable to take nothing in consideration. this is what wajda manages. his films are either very moving, deep or beautifully shot, but pays attention to life's and society's particularity. a moment of joy for one, is the moment of irony for a second, the moment of grief for the third, a moment of nothing for the fourth.there is at least two reasons to pay attention to wajdas films of this period. first is the remarkable free expression of deep political impact. this country was the first to overthrow communism twenty years later. second is the development of a filmatic and narrative language that kusturica has rose to grandeur.

of course i am going to think it was a great movie. i recognized several people i didn't see during filming also. i was the one playing the guard about an hour into the movie in the death row exercise yard asking for a light for a cigarette. i also changed this one scene. they had originally had it set to go into the rec yard and straighten out the inmate and turn him around and walk him out. the director said "it is taking to long, what would you do gower." i said, "we need to go in and hook the arms and drag him out backwards. that way your camera can stay on his face as we take him off set." i also lived at this same prison as a young child as my father was the assistant warden of security. i am also a current employee with the tennessee deaprtment of corrections as a supervisor at the riverbend maximum security institution. even though a lot of the movie was a joke, the part i was in was reality enough. also in the bar scene the dancer kicking high in the air and leaving the stage was an actual stripper i use to work with at a club called "the classic cat".

andy mcdermott (tom everett scott) is a shy american teenager spending vacation in paris with his friends brad and chris. andy saves serafine pigot (the gorgeous julie delpy) from committing suicide in eiffel tour and has a crush on her. he does not know that she is a werewolf. they go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves. andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf. he is advised that the only way to become normal again is killing the werewolf that attacked him and eating its heart. this movie is a violent black humor movie. the special effects and the soundtrack are excellent, highlighting the song of the band bush. i do not know why some readers compares this movie with the masterpiece 'an american werewolf in london'. the stories have nothing in common (only an american teenager, werewolves and a city in europe). highly indicated for fans of werewolf and black humor movies. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "um lobisomem americano em paris" ("an american werewolf in paris")

is it full moon tonight? oh! it doesn't matter they can change whenever they want cuz of that drug! what was i thinking if its full moon tonight?! geezi really like this movie, there's romance, suspense, horror, and hot stuff ;) i like the first half of the movie when the guy saves the girl from killing herself by bungee jumping and catching her. that was really cool. the setting of this movie is in the city of love which is paris in france. the cemetery scenes are nice, it gives you chills not knowing what will happen there or who's behind the walls. the scenes that makes you jump out of your seat is really cool. even they got me on that scenes. his friend who died and the girl whom he killed in the cemetery but still shows themselves to the lead character(sorry i forgot his name), was really funny. the actors did a good job plus the make-up crews. the part when they're all partying in an abandoned church, i can't believe people would that because even though that's an abandoned church, that is still god's house. i bought this movie long time ago, and i do not regret buying it. i'm a horror-movie-lover. i give this movie 5 stars out of 6. for the people who are open and loves movies like this, give it a try, you might like it.

this movie is not as bad as some say it is infact i think it`s more enjoyable than the original . maybe that`s why some people hate it as much cos they dont want to admit it`s a good (not great) movie.most if not all fx were done by c.g.i which i didn`t mind at all cos it was an enjoyable movie. phil buckman - (chris) was in my opinion the best guy in the movie julie delpy was rather attractive she brought the sexiness to the movie.there were a lot of wisecracks in the movie which i thought were good. this movie is in my collection but the original is not because i dont like it as much as this one. i was not bored when i watched this movie it kept me watching unlike some horror movies i could mention like oh say = driller killer & suspiria (dario argento`s movie) thats to name but two.this is an ok werewolf film it should be in people`s collection if they like werewolf movies maybe i`ll get the original at some point maybe. i have only one complaint and that is phil buckman - (chris) should have been in it more than he was but apart from that the movie was fine.rating for this movie 8/10 an ok werewolf movie not the worst one out there.

i have never seen "american werewolf in london" but this movie was very entertaining. when renting it i thought it was a horror movie but it turned out to be more of a comedy with some horror aspects. i thought the transformation sequences were nicely done but effects wise, the best scenes were those where the effects and the lighting built off each other, nice. the transformations reminded me a lot of werewolf transformations in other movies, but the werewolves themselves are very beastly and not very dog like. gore: i do believe there is too much in this movie, which really takes away from the horror, when every frame has blood in it, taking the violence seriously is hard. j.hurst (8th grade)

ok, most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake, but at the same time it's also a different movie in its own right. don't get me wrong, 'american werewolf in london' is a superior film, but 'american remake in paris' is a decent movie as well.first off, the only real similarities are the title, 2 american backpackers, and werewolves. other than those 3 things, 'american remake in paris' stands apart fairly well on its own with its special blend of humor, action/adventure, and horror. most of the people who say this film is better than the original are the youth of today's generation that think any movie made before 1990 is total crap. while those of us who grew up in the 80's can appreciate older films and what they have added to the horror films of today. what a lot of people fail to realize is that without the old classic films, including the b&w ones, horror wouldn't be what it is today. now i'm getting a little off the beaten path...an american werewolf in paris is a good attempt at re-creating a classic, but it will never surpass the original, ever. with that said, this is still a very entertaining film to watch and i do recommend it. i'm giving it a 7 out of 10. maybe that's being a little generous, but i've seen much worse attempts at trying to re-create a classic.

i just finished a double feature night of an american werewolf in london & paris. let me start by saying "london" still holds up after all these years and the transformation sequence is by any standard quite impressive, the film was funny, and scary, also a bit of gore....now lets get to "paris" its enjoyable, a few scars, lots of gore not as exciting or eerie as original but it does have a few laughs in what has become quite the fashion these days in films so maybe in that sense it was ahead of it's time, the transformations al'a cgi while good for the technology of its time are nowhere near as impressive as the original. i gave this movie a 7 because i have to admit it was enjoyable, i laughed a lot and found tom everett scott to be so silly that at first i wanted to dislike his performance only to end up liking it...go figure...julie delpy was competent as was the direction it's the script that lacked a bit of shine & finesse. i read here that john landis was supposed to direct to bad he didn't i am quite sure it would have been a different movie altogether. i also noticed some discussion of a sequel "what if" well no one has noted the obvious it should be in american and here is my title "an american werewolf comes home" or in dc that would be fun all those political dogs need a good scare. you simply must see the original in it's new dvd transfer with dolby 5.1 sound and see both of these on an hdtv with upconvert turned on...nice!!!!

the title suggests that this movie is a sequel to "an american werewolf in london". none of the characters from the previous movie return and aren't even mentioned in this movie by name. so as a sequel, aawip fails, one would say.i dare to say the opposite.an american werewolf in paris is a charming, effective horror movie. it's one of the better werewolf films i have seen in a long time too. and i have seen quite my share, such as an american werewolf in london, the howling, wolfen, the wolfman and the underworld trilogy.the story tells of three americans visiting paris on a vacation. at the top of the eifel tower one of them saves a woman trying to commit suicide. what starts out as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that lurk in the city are revealed...i really liked the acting in this film. especially the two stars of the movie: the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her. they have good chemistry together. but the other two americans also play their roles nicely. i didn't really find anything annoying about the acting, so thumbs up for that! the effects on the werewolves are nice. it doesn't look too cheap or fake to me. of course, the opinions are divided about this subject. but let's just say that i wasn't disappointed.there's also a good amount of humor in this movie. there are some really funny scenes you will probably remember for a long time.so, to sum it up, an american werewolf in paris might not be a direct sequel to it's predecessor, but it's still an enjoyable movie. perfect for fans of werewolves! 7 out of 10 stars!

three american lads are backpacking their way around europe, challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and hot babe lays as they can, but andy seeks true love. he finds this during their bungee-jump attempt on the eiffel tower, when he comes across and breathtakingly saves a suicidal and heart-burstingly beautiful julie delpy. his attempts to find this girl and the secret he uncovers lead he and his friends into an fast paced adventure full of action, romance, gore, and inspired humor, without ever taking itself to seriously, or striving to be anything other than a wildly entertaining 90 minute ride. i have seen this film a number of times and found it a much more rewarding experience than the 'london' original, although both films are so different it is not fair to compare the two or even to consider this a sequel.

i have mixed emotions about this film, especially as it compares to its forerunner,"an american werewolf in london." that film had it's funny moments, it was still more of horror tale than anything else. this updated version, now set in paris, does not have that "edge" at all and simply isn't in the same class....but it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall it's still fun to watch. so, "werewolf purists" aside, most of whom think this film is pure garbage compared to the london version, i'll still give it decent marks since i don't care what others think. i liked it even though i agree "london" is better and i prefer that version, too. the first 30-40 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a "balloon" in a restaurant. it also introduces the lead female character, played by julie delpy. i don't see enough of this actress. she doesn't seem to make that many films, or least ones i hear about over here in america. this french actress has a face that is classic beauty, so the film got points for having her in it, and she looks great.when the horror starts, it can get scary and the special effects are good. i also liked the lack of profanity in this film, unlike the first one: no f-words and no lord's name in vain - amazing!however, there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me. the soundtrack is heavy metal which isn't appealing to a middle-aged guy like me, either. this film is geared a lot more toward 20-somethings, if that helps anyone.it's entertaining.....just don't expect it to live up to the first film.

to paraphrase thora birch: "i kind of like this movie. it's the exact opposite of everything i hate in a film".this obscure film was too low key and intelligent to get a theatrical release, any chance for success would have needed a costly promotional campaign. and a coming of age story where nothing spectacular happens - where instead the focus is on character development, has a limited target audience. whoever heard of a mature teen movie?but if you have an opportunity to see this or if you can part with a few bucks for the dvd, you could do a lot worse. "my teacher's wife" is nothing revolutionary but it has a lot going for it and holds up well to repeated viewings.jason london (as high school senior todd boomer) is the star and fits this character as well as his parts in "the man in the moon" and "dazed and confused". he is helped out by exceptional work from his supporting cast. tia carrere in the title role is a revelation (she can act) as todd's calculus tutor and love interest. christopher mcdonald as the teacher in a nice self-parodying performance. zak orth and alexondra lee as todd's best friends, and jeffrey tabor as his father. as someone commented earlier, this is a "mature" teen movie because the romantic relationships are universally unsuccessful-at least by traditional happy ending standards. even todd's parents are indifferent to each other, with his father panting after the title character and his mother (leslie lyles) literally on the telephone during her entire time on screen (a device that provides increasing comedy relief with each successive appearance). the london-carrere romance has unexpected charm and is far more believable than any other older woman storyline you are likely to find. but the real strength of the film is the evolving relationship of the three friends. there is no overwrought melodrama here, just three immature people who alternate between testing and trusting each other, subject to all the dynamics that three young people can bring to this kind of thing. they actually manage to pull off a "believable" three-person relationship, perhaps the first one in cinema history. then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

tia carrere was the reason i decided to watch this film, as neither the title, nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this film ¬ñ which goes to show, me and everyone, that a dvd shouldn't be judged by it's cover.***spoilers*** the film felt like it was trundling along, not really going anywhere for the moment ¬ñ the awkwardness of paul faber (zak orth) around girls being almost too embarrassing to watch, and the fringe on the otherwise attractive kirsten beck (as alexondra lee) being too school-girlish to watch. where those really fashionable in 1995?the relationship between vicky mueller (tia carrere) and todd boomer (jason london) was tantalising from the start of though! that first meeting across the lake ¬ñ magical. what a beautiful coincidence they should meet again just as he has behaved like a complete moron ("boomer, with two o's as in moron¬Ö") in front of alexondra. a shame really that we as the audience knew who vicky mueller really was. (well¬Ö the title did give that away, wouldn't you think?)what really surprised me was the acting. especially in the scene where vicky gives todd a metal version of his alter ego (the dog character), in the little white jewellery box. the actors really managed to recreate that tingling sensation of a first kiss ¬ñ point of no return for todd and vicky. a shame really that the film ends with focus on (after getting over todd's fathers harvard drive) his re-uniting with his friends. i could envision a whole new film ¬ñ following vicky to new york ¬ñ there must be a good art university there that todd could attend?!?nevertheless, a film that does just what we want hollywood to: entertain us for the duration of the film. did anyone else notice how none of the loves are happy ones in this film? todd's mother is slightly insane (on the phone 24/7), his dad doesn't find her attractive (any more?) todd's teacher obviously is disenchanted by his wife and vice versa ¬ñ todd himself enters into a wonderfully erotic & daring relationship which, however nice it may be, would realistically be very difficult to maintain (age difference, maturity difference etc), and alexondra & zak do not get together because alexondra is not mature enough to handle a relationship (-> her reactions towards the condom, the cheating, zak's advances etc. are all very immature, and often involve running away), and zak himself, the poor guy ¬ñ is too much of a best friend/like a brother-guy to pull even alexondra.mind you, good film though! i gave it an 8/10. brilliant performance by the actors - who bring the script to life.

as talk-shows go, larry king live is not bad, and since he occasionally gets good guests, it's a show to turn on once in awhile, but not compulsively. when bill maher, carl bernstein, a former president, or other substantive guests sit across from him, it's not too bad. other times, he tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal which contributes absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and tv stars. during the oj simpson trial, it seemed like every other guest on his show was related to the case. but is this really journalism? or the national enquirer on the tube? sometimes, it comes off a little bit like trash television--jerry springer in a sit down interview with phone calls instead of a live audience.on the other side, king's show is definitely much better than bill o'reilly whose show is nothing more than a rightest-political platform of the rush limbaugh variety. that said, larry king is not a bad interviewer, but alas, he is not a great one. king does not always come off like he completely comprehends when intellectual material is being presented, especially if it is by a scholar or historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics. always seems like the minute king can't quite deal with the issue at hand, that's when he turns to the phone calls, maybe hoping someone out in the country will have a better question than he has. he might interview someone like david gergen, but may not have read any of his books. sort of like the movie producer that never bothers to read the script.when it's an entertainment celebrity, no problem. he can come off like he's thoroughly knowledgeable since the material is not that substantive anyway. talking to elizabeth taylor about her relationship with richard burton is not exactly rocket science. and i notice he usually has seen the star's latest movie. watching a movie takes much less time and contemplation than reading a book. however, if it's the likes of john dean or bob woodward, king comes off a little like he didn't quite finish his homework. so off to the phones.if you are looking for real in-depth interviewing, terry gross of npr is probably the best interviewer in the united states. she reads and/or researches everything written by or about her guests beforehand and has a working knowledge of those areas. i don't see king quite doing that. granted, he probably has an audience 1000 times larger than terry gross, which may say more about the american audience than king. in short, larry is better than bill but not as good as terry.

i've been a fan of larry king's show for awhile, i think he does a terrific job overall and i don't think he ever 'wusses' out, as so many people seem to believe. he's a subtle scorpio, he gets his zings in when he needs to, just as he managed to do last night with paris hilton, during her first post-jail tv interview.the thing about this entire case that has really amazed me is that hilton is still apparently clueless about why judge sauer gave her what she believes was a too-harsh sentence (and what's more, actually made her serve it) . in all the time she was in jail, supposedly alone 23 hours a day in her cell, she never once, in her mind, rewound the events which led to her being given the sentence that judge sauer saw fit to impose on her. she never once realized that it just might have set off a major red flag when she (1) showed up late in court for the original hearing and (2) proceeded to inform him, when he asked her did she not know that her license had been suspended, did she not get the papers in the mail, that "i have people who read that sort of thing for me." all the time she was in her cell, she never came to the realization that this action (showing up late) and that statement -- and more importantly, the attitude - the utter cavalier disregard for the court system and the law in general and her driving privileges in particular that she displayed -- just might have made judge sauer (pardon the pun) go sour on her. last night, on king's show, after giving lip service to how she has been changed forever by her traumatic experience, how she has "learned" her lesson, she answered his question, "do you think you got a raw deal?" with a resounding yes. and during the course of the conversation (if you can call it that), she said more than once that she did not feel she deserved what had happened to her. king asked, gently, more than once, if she does not feel she creates the situations in her life that she "finds" herself in, to which she pretty much stared at him blankly. she basically, therefore, holds the conscious belief that she's been victimized in this situation; she does not understand how she herself caused it, that day in court, by her cavalier attitude with the judge. i feel this is very sad - tragic, even, considering what a huge "role model" hilton is to some people, and it renders anything she said last night about her so-called rehabilitated state into the realms of complete and utter cluelessness, contradiction and hypocrisy. during the course of the interview, hilton alluded to spending a lot of time in her cell reading the bible. at the end of the interview, king scored major points by asking her what her favorite bible passage was. she responded by groping perplexedly at her pathetic notes (completely superficial non-insights, which she had read on air as if she were nelson mandella or something) and finally grunting out, "i don't have a favorite passage." judge sauer, in my book, is a hero, and after last night, so is larry king, for subtly exposing hilton for what she truly is.

river's edge is an extremely disturbing film written by acclaimed american screen writer neal jimenez.it is based on an actual event which happened at a time when most of american youngsters were trying to make sense of their lives.this is one of the most outstanding films made by american director tim hunter.much of film's attention is focused on a reckless murder committed by a feckless teenager.this unfortunate event sets in motion a whole range of questions about real motivations of youngsters in american society.those who saw this film during its initial release must have had vivid memories of great actor dennis hopper in a confused role as a sympathetic social outcast. matrix star keanu reeves also looks good as one of the teenagers before he reached star status.at a time when teen flicks are made without any kind of serious preparation,it is hoped that "river's edge" cannot simply be ignored as just another silly teen flick.it had massive impact on people who lived during turbulent times of the past when being an inhabitant of a sleepy town was akin to not having being born.for today's generation with their heady overdoses of internet props such as facebook,twitter and orkut,river's edge might appear to be outdated but its importance cannot be denied by any serious film admirer.

although i was hoping that i'd like it a little more, this was still certainly an impressive film. there were great performances by all the leads, and the story, while not what i'd call chilling, was still effective and it kept me interested. for me, the best part of this film was the look of the picture, for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well. i also thought that the low budget suited this movie, for i don't think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim. all things considered, it fell a little short of my expectations, but i'm still very glad that i finally sat down to watch this movie.

i finally saw this on video, after years of hearing about it. it is by no means a perfect movie, but it is oddly hypnotic - one of those rare, special films that creates its own world. ***spoilers*** first, the bad stuff. the scenes in burkewaite's class are excruciating. even if the subject is social studies, this guy is way over the top. his speeches are so overwrought they are laughable. and no teachers i ever had would grill their students like that, and tell the ones who protest to "shut up!". these scenes are brief, but they break the mood and pull the viewer out of the story. next, how the heck does layne just walk out of the police station near the end? also, what happened to samson's car after the first scene of him riding into town? he spends the rest of the film being chaffeured around by layne or feck. ***end spoilers*** ahhh, feck...this guy is great. dennis hopper effortlessly steals the movie. "check's in the mail", "i love company", "you're my friend" - every line is a classic. he gives feck an internal logic that makes the story work. incredibly, he actually makes the audience feel empathy for this guy, especially when samson talks about his (samson's) future.  by contrast, crispin glover is hard to take sometimes. yet the scenes of him driving around in the beetle are perfect - kids with cars in high school always have something to do, and buds to do it with. matt's low-key attitude makes a good foil for layne - their friendship is believable. glover's mannerisms are a little much, but he is consistent throughout. he drives the plot and exudes a sense of urgency that no one else does - just try to imagine this flick if layne were as much of a zombie as matt or samson - snoozefest! ***spoilers*** what makes "river's edge" unsettling is the fact that samson is not really evil, in the usual sense. he is kind of a boring guy who got sick of being taken for granted - in other words, he is like thousands of other boring guys. after he kills jamie, he starts to unravel, which creates some suspense as we wait to see when he will snap again. ***end spoilers***part of this movie's appeal is the way the action stays centered around the teens and their point of view. the parents are comic relief - clarissa's mom, tony's dad - or overwhelmed - matt's mom. this underlines how the kids hang together for the attention no one else gives them. it keeps the story focused on the relationships within the clique, and emphasizes that the only adult they can relate to is feck. "river's edge" is a textbook on alienation. it conveys how awkward, mysterious, and disconcerting adolescence is like no other film.

this film is so 1980's and that is what i like so much about it. it does an excellent job of conveying the feel of that odd decade. the reality that russian nukes could wipe you out at any time. reagan in the white house telling everybody that things were great, while more and more social programs were slashed. young people dropped out, but not as far as their parents of the 1960's did. young people still went to school, they just smoked so much dope that their sensetivities were all but dead. nothing effected them, not even the death of one of their classmates at the hands of one of their friends. how weird is it to realize that the murder was wrong, but you are not sure why. watching the characters deal with the crime is fascinating and telling of a very sick society. glover is great, keanu is great, hopper is incredible. one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen.

i didn't expect much from this movie, it was just one of those movies i thought i'd just watch because it was on television. i certainly underestimated this movie. it's about a guy who kills his girlfriend and brags to his friends. i was very happy with the acting, they had the characters played well. it was a particularly great scene when feck(dennis hopper) and john(daniel roebuck) are talking to each other about why john killed jamie. it's upsetting to hear how he explains that he wanted to feel control and thats why. but feck had loved the girl he had killed. feck felt remorse while john felt nothing, hell he was proud of what he'd done. it really makes you think about people. keanu reeves did a great job as matt, and ione skye was good. it's weird to see her as a valedictorian in 'say anything' and her as clarissa. every actor did great at .....acting. it was real nice for a change. it was a great movie and i would definitely say i recommend it.

not a box office success; no-one really knows why. it may have failed simply because of its title. it looks as though you need a two-word tough-guy title to attract a sufficient proportion of the idiot crowd - "die hard", "lethal weapon", "hard weapon", "die lethal", etc. - talking about "the long kiss goodnight" will get you nowhere. but for once renny harlin has made a good action movie. a large part of the reason for this lies in the fact that the central character, samantha, earns our affection and interest early on. as she becomes charly again, we're torn: we certainly want charly to thwart the bad guys, and all that; but we don't want her to lose touch with samantha in order to do so - even though we like charly, too. geena davis bestows all of her considerable charm on both halves of the central character. samuel l. jackson plays second fiddle for a change. it turns out he's good at it. that was a compliment.intelligent, far superior to anything in the "die hard" series - if i were more cynical i'd add, "it's not surprising that it didn't do well", but i don't really feel that way; it is surprising that it didn't do well.

definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not over-think their movies. lots of action, lots of great dialogue (e.g. fun to quote), a little intrigue, and stuff blowing up all over the place. samuel l jackson and geena davis had great chemistry. violent, but not gory. the fact that the female part was the competent action lead is a pleasant turn-about.have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite films rotation every 3 or 4 months. i initially rented the movie because samuel l jackson was in the film, but was caught up in the events surrounding samantha's quest to regain her memory and have never looked back.all you cerebral folks out there -- suspend disbelief for once, take yourself a little less seriously -- you might actually enjoy yourselves!

this is by far my favorite action movie. but what makes it work is not the elaborate renny harlin explosions and shoot-em-ups. it's the shane black script and its deft delivery by geena davis and samuel l. jackson.the chemistry between the two principals merited a sequel. thank god it was never made. too much danger of marring the original.'the long kiss' checkerboards from quotable scene to action scene to quotable scene and back again. never a dull moment. this has to be jackson's funniest role ever, and the amazing thing is that he is playing one of the most normal characters of his career. no quirky tarantino hit-man, super-cool shaft, or borderline psycho soldier. in tlkg, jackson is the everyman we identify with. the poor schmuck gets dragged along on this crazy woman's odyssey to uncover the dangerous secret of her past.though the story claims that davis's character, samantha caine is suffering from amnesia, the writer and director treat her condition as if it were a multiple personality disorder.samantha caine is not just a new identity taken by the amnesiac charly baltimore -- she is a separate, fully-developed personality. the traumas suffered by samantha in the first half-hour of the movie help the submerged dissociate personality of charly to emerge again.the materials of her past life excavated by jackson's detective mitch henessey facilitate charly's resurfacing. good timing, too, considering the target samantha makes of herself.but charly has to fight herself to remain the dominant personality. one gathers from bits of dialogue that the warrior personality (charly) developed after her father died and she was recruited by the "chapter".in the eight years charly was buried in the psyche, though, her samantha identity developed into the dominant personality. (she's even funnier that charly.) this was probably due to becoming a mother, because it's the reunion with her daughter that breaks charly's struggle to suppress samantha, leading to their apparent integration by movie's end.it's impossible to choose a "best quote" from this film:"now you're a sharpshooter?""i saved your ass. it was great!""continue dying. out.""i sock 'em in the jaw and yell 'pop goes the weasel'".and a couple of dozen more, many too raunchy to quote here.geena davis looks great, and comes off as an action hero without glossing over the fact she's turning forty. (listen to charley's history, do the math).fantastic soundtrack, too. santana, muddy waters, elvis, labelle, marvin gaye. i give 'the long kiss goodnight' a 9, only because i don't believe in a perfect 10. seen it a dozen times, and it still stays fresh. nice twisted holiday flick to place on your shelf next to 'it's a wonderful life.'

though this is a good, enjoyable cartoon, they did much better ones later on, like carrotblanca. this is almost like the first star trek feature, which would have been welcomed with open arms and glee no matter what, just for existing. this is really a patchwork of old bits with some nice touches, but nothing special. reminds me a bit of the hunting trilogy in spots and the ending is priceless. available and certainly well worth watching just for the novelty and the good bits. recommended.

black scorpion is roger cormen's batman. which is cool and there is a lot of cool stuff in this movie. like the breathtaker being a cross between doctor doom and darth vader, that's kind of cool. the mind control gas in the inhalers was worthy of the mad hatter. the cormen b-movie style is all over this puppy which is not always a good thing. there are plenty of stunts and hot babes to make any action fan happy. this movie, the good out weighs the bad. but if you aren't one for comic book movies, then i would advise not watching black scorpion, however if you like comic book like movies and don't care if it was ever a comic before. then check out black scorpion, as for me i give it 8 stars.

i'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie. (i'm not counting super bug budget, no storyline batman's either)a couple of my favorites are the phantom and a budget movie called the demolitionist. the black scorpion can be added to that collection.if you've seen the demolitionist then get this movie. it's basically a copy of that heroine. (it even stars the same guy in both movies)if you haven't, then let me explain...a cop's father is murdered and she seeks vengeance. she laces up the black outfit (a sexy catwomanish, skimpy outfit that looks absolutely great on joan severance) and goes out to kick some booty.it's a fun, action packed movie, mind you, you may not wish the kids to see it...without screening it first to see if you approve of the pretty graphic sex scene severance has in it. which in my opinion, was a bonus (alright, give it an extra star <grin>)

black scorpion is a fun flick about a groovy female super heroine who wears leather tights and drives a car that can morph into her snazzy armored scorpion mobile. she battles the evil breathtaker and all of this is an excellent recipe for a good time imho. i loved the bit about her having to say "yo" to get the car's computer to take orders! breathtaker is so evil he wants to give the entire city asthma! it's all so over the top and that's the beauty of it! the scene where black scorpion "attacks" her partner steals the show. you'll know it when you see it. this dvd also has a fun interview with joan severance. she's a doll. black scorpion is a fun dvd. loved it!

this movie will not be considered for an academy award, but if you enjoy a movie that doesn't take itself seriously and just wants the viewer to enjoy for ninety mins it is not a disappointment. you'll enjoy a send up of darth vader for the villain (the breather), a female batman for the heroine (but much cuter with much less costume), and a running joke that involves cigarettes and the police captain that's very funny. not by any means a great cinematic achievement. but if you enjoy campy fun it was worth a viewing. god help me, i liked it.

this movie was better than i expected. i don't think it deserved an r rating, though. i've seen pg-13 films with worse language and violence. i found this movie entertaining and i enjoyed it. if you're a person who dissects everything, you might find a lot wrong with it, but if you take it for its face value, i think you'll find it entertaining.

i saw this movie in a theater while on vacation in pablo co. i had just quit my biomedical engineering job at a hospital. i consider the script to be a exaggeration of the real type of stuff that goes on in hospitals. the idiots that put it down on production value don't get the point and probably have never been hospitalized. and never worked in one for sure. billy jack (same era) was very poorly produced but had a significant social comment and was a very good movie with a real social message.i have ever since been looking for this movie this is the first site i have found where it get mentioned.

it has been since 1972 that i saw this movie and i still remember it as one of my favorite all time movies. i would buy a copy if it were on dvd and it is too bad it isn't. you would think that anything starring peter sellers would be brought back. much better than "being there" and as good as the pink panther series. uschi digard had a small part for such a well endowed performer. she is bonus in this movie. i think the medical field may not appreciate this film as it really makes fun of the profession and it also makes one appreciate that sellers was never available to treat them as his bed side manner sucked as well did his analysis of urine samples.

i remember seeing this film in my late teens or early twenties on tv - probably hbo. i watched it with my parents, a brother and a few friends. since that was about 30 years ago, i don't remember a lot of the story. i do remember that the entire group of us watching agreed that this was the funniest movie we had ever seen. when it was over, our bellies hurt from so much laughing. my dad worked at a hospital, so that made it all the better.every time i see the party in the tv listings, i look to see if this one is there, too. to my dismay, it never is. although i loved the party, i feel this one is funnier. peter sellers was great as a crooked hospital administrator. why it's never been released on video is a mystery to me. it's a classic, but it appears that nobody under 35 or 40 has been allowed to see it. i'd buy it in a second if they ever release it to dvd.

though often considered peter sellers' worst film, it is in fact an excellent send-up of medical corporate corruption and abuses of power. often misunderstood, the film is actually a departure from the type of film sellers was best known for; satirical farce. this film had excellent performances by jo ann pflug and pat morita (of happy days and the karate kid movies), but was marked by its ribaldary, irreverence, and total madcap demolition of the medical industry of the day. it was ahead of its time (1972) in taking the outrageous path that the monty python crew would take into the cinema some time later. as such, it was unacceptable to the traditional peter sellers fan, who found the more pointed barbs in this humor to be something to which they were unaccustomed. presently, peter sellers movies are in demand by fans, but this effort, where does it hurt?, has by its nature become almost impossible to find.

dead or alive: final, the movie that supposedly brings together the three films in the very loose dead or alive trilogy, and connected mostly by its stars, riki takeiuchi and sho aikawa and that each film has its share of bizarro-world fixtures and neuroses and heaps of violence, is admittedly the weakest of the lot. that none of the three films ends up being a disappointment is less a testament to the creativity of the material but to the pound-for-pound guts that director takashi miike takes with the surroundings and the material. here he presents an overtly dystopian future, however low-key, where a homosexual mayor/dictator (richard chen) has the entire village drugged except for a group of rebels. there's also replicants- robots- in this year of 2346, one of them is ryo (aikawa), a robot of complete lethal skill but also with the capacity to love and learn and so forth. then a cop, takeshi (takeiuchi) happens to be the mayor's top guard. but things start to unravel on both sides, ryo teaming up with the rebels and takeshi with his employer, though blood-soaked mishaps like a hostage trade-off gone bad, and with takeshi finding out his wife and son are robots (not done in an alien mood, mind you, just suddenly as if in a the power went out), and that he himself is one as well. and it all leads up to one last, inexplicable showdown between the two men.strange that there's yet another film where miike has peaks and valleys here, sometimes finding that middle ground of success where science fiction can have some meaning to it. but there really isn't anything to take from this story, except that the mayor/dictator is a dingbat with no back-story who gets his rocks off making sure his drug stops couples from getting pregnant and that everything remains under control. he also has along with him his love slave, i'd guess, in the hilarious non-speaking part of a saxophone player who also doubles sometimes as a human fixture when not plugging away the moody blues. meanwhile, we get the conventional sides to ryo and takeshi's stories, and they're never uninteresting, just not totally convincing enough to hold interest. of course miike isn't above having some fun, like when takeshi plops michelle (maria chen) in to the water to get her to swim after a near-assassination attempt on the mayor, or in having the original rebel leader speaking english for no good reason at all. there's even a playful homage to old sci-fi cartoons at the start of the film. but there's nothing very compelling substance-wise, with the exception of takeshi's minor turns at becoming "good" midway through the film (helping one couple get by with clearance to have a kid), and mostly miike's strengths this time are purely stylistically and in the choice of locations and sets.it's like a grungy japanese alphaville where everything still has a contemporary feel through all of the special effects. and i really liked the yellow-green tint miike used through the movie, as it impacted very well in outdoor scenes and added just enough grittiness in the indoor scenes. but as for peaks and valleys, one sees this ever more clearly- and the sci-fi movie channel level of visual effects, with maybe a few more dollars put into it- during the climax. this contains some of the funniest material in the most delirious, freudian sensibility from the director, even if it has to get started by unbearable contrivance; the way that ryo and takeshi finally meet up is sort of random and just a means for the producers to try and cheaply tie together the past two films, when it wasn't needed. on the other hand, in terms of the sheer guilty entertainment value of a flick like miike's where one sees something totally unexpected and very crudely sexual, it ranks right up there with the best scenes in happiness of the katakuris and visitor q. overall, dead or alive: final is a cheesy 90 minute effort that doesn't take itself too seriously, and is better off all the more for its wicked contrivances, militaristic decay and cultural hang-ups put on pulp-level display.

i love those kind of movies. blood, revenge, a lot of action, very dark, cheesy and more. but this one doesn't deliver the genre that you might expect. when i saw kite birds and ichi the killer before, i had fun watching those but why this one not? dead or alive: final is a decent anime and its not hardcore and don't even expect nudity in this movie.at least add some more action to entertain the audience. even the drama wasn't that good. well, i don't want to spoil the movie nor the plot.but i felt that dead or alive: final is a bit nerdy. so, without further to do. i don't recommend this movie to everyone but i recommend for the people who love decent and well directed anime.dr jacques coulardeau, university of paris dauphine & university of paris 1 pantheon sorbonne

the final installment sees sho aikawa and riki takeuchi (looking cooler than ever in his reversible overcoat!) pitched against each other for one last battle, this time in the future. the plot owes a lot to blade runner, but done in takashi miike's low budget, frenetic, comic style. i did feel that it was the weakest of the three doa films, and although the ending was still outrageous, it lacked the shock value of the previous two. compared to the likes of ichi the killer and visitor q, doa:final is nowhere near as extreme, but is faithful to the other two films in the trilogy. that said, fans of the first two (and fans of miike) will get a lot from this as it ties all three films together and gives a final explanation of the relationship between the two protagonists.

two actors play rival gangsters in three films, the final of which is a sci-fi film, that nods strangely to william s. burroughs, philip k. dick, and anime all at once. the robots are actually called "replicants", a reference to dicks blade runner(several visual allusions to the film can be found as well) and the bad guy is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with limiting procreation through use of a compulsory drug for "heterosexual love is fleeting, and homosexual love is eternal"....martial arts fights ensue, a first for the dead or alive films. the hilarious climax involves the two leads morphing into a winged robot with a gigantic phallus for a head, who personifies "destruction", which has been the path of both characters thus far, their individual minds and later literal heads functioning as something like testicles. the film ends with the mayor f*&%ing his free jazz playing boy lackey as the robot apparently tears down a wall around them, the last words of the mayor "oh f*&%", followed by a quick fade to black. part of me felt cheated, part of me confused, but mostly i was just laughing. a lot of the film is quite boring though, the best scenes bookend the film while the rest is far too slow. takashi miike has always mined the sexual motifs beneath male violence in action films, and this film with the exception of "gozu", reinforces this theme more than any other. sex and violence are two pretty basic themes, but like cronerberg(who the jazz interludes may be a homage to ala naked lunch)miike is able to show where the two connect, to hilarious an oddly cohesive effect.

the third part of miike's dead or alive trilogy is as unrelated to the first two parts as they were to each other, more or less. show aikawa and riki takeuchi are back again for the lead roles, but this time the movie thrusts us forward 300 years or so into the future... post apocalypse.riki plays a tough cop, an enforcer for the corrupt city's extreme police policies, and show plays a drifter who hooks up with a bunch of the city's oppressed rebels. the film must have been shot in hong kong, as most of the rest of the cast are cantonese speakers, with terence yin and josie ho being the most recognisable faces. there's also a hk stunt crew on hand for the films action sequences, which are very cool in a hk-via-miike style.this could be fodder for a dreadful low budget b-movie, but in miike's hands it of course becomes something more interesting. it's quite a slow, thoughtful film that meanders along and doesn't try to force anything down the viewer's throat. characters are rounded and interesting and the plot an interesting but fairly loose framework for the story to be hung on.all in all a fairly low key effort until the action scenes, which show miike's increasing prowess at directing and choreographing very nice action. watching the short making of with show & riki in wire rigs is really fun - you can tell they were having a great time the finale of the film tries to tie together the 3 dead or alive movies, which is quite unnecessary because each one is really self contained. miike's explanation of the connection is very funny though, and caps the series off quite nicely.not as deep or well developed as doa2, not as outrageous and intense as doa1... still another good miike movie though.

ok, this doesn't compare to the explosive tempo of the first part's opening sequence; nor to its visual shock value; nor, for that matter, to the melancholic suspense of the second installment. no, it's surprisingly and refreshingly different (apart, of course, from the two main actors). the tongue-in-cheek futuristic scenario drives the characters towards each other across genres and languages with an almost gravitational force. the moment of impact-conclusion is your choice of: a)shakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume; b)sublimation of violence into homo-erotics; c)humorous detonation of an impossible buildup. everything up to then is even less unequivocal.highly recommended to indiscriminate movie buffs who don't mind following foie gras with a hot dog; caution to those with more refined palates.

four unhappy women leave dreary london to spend an enchanted april in a castle on the coast of italy.elizabeth von arnim's novel comes alive in this charming little film which beautifully demonstrates the virtues of a literate script and ensemble acting. all the elements come together to produce a movie that, although nearly forgotten now, still produces a feeling of appreciation at the story's appropriate resolution.the actresses each acquit themselves splendidly. ann harding is the free-spirited wife longing for 'wisteria & tranquillity' far from foggy london. katharine alexander plays the quiet housewife wishing for the elegant responsibility of acting as hostess in the castle. jane baxter is the beautiful young noblewoman temporarily escaped from her throng of male admirers. jessie ralph steals every scene she's in as an old lady wanting only to be alone with her memories of the past.the men in the story are also well cast. as miss harding's husband, frank morgan has a rather complex role as a mousy researcher who has a disturbing personality change when he becomes a successful writer. reginald owen, as miss alexander's spouse, is marvelously pompous as a man well equipped to bore for england (his hilarious attempt to take an english bath in an italian bathtub is made even funnier with the assistance of charles judels & rafaela ottiano as the castle's harried servants). finally, ralph forbes, one of the decade's finest forgotten actors, is joyously eccentric as the ladies' lighthearted landlord.movie mavens will recognize an uncredited ethel griffies playing the proprietress of the hampstead housewives club.

my son adam (5 years old) is a big scooby doo fan. he like this film a lot. he particularly liked when the loch ness monster tried to attack shaggy and scooby. the vote score is his choice and reflects his love of the characters.having seen the "vampire rock" film first, this, not surprisingly, was very similar as they repeat a well worn basic plot in a different setting.few adults will come across this without having their own memories of the tv cartoon series and even fewer will watch it without children. you either like this or love it. i loved scooby doo for half an hour as a kid, i am happy my son loves it, i can just about put up with it now.

monster of mexico i do agree is the weakest of the modern scooby doo movies, mainly because of the weak plot and how predictable it all was. loch ness monster however, is a considerable improvement, with gorgeous animation, honestly scotland looked beautiful. the music is good, and the plot is well thought out. plus, there is some great dialogue, and the voice acting was fabulous, with casey kasem a consistent delight as shaggy, and the beautiful scottish singer sheena easten a pleasant surprise in a guest starring role. in fact, my only complaints were some strange accents in one or two members of the voice cast, with the exception of easten whose accent did sound genuine, and somehow the loch ness monster wasn't as well designed as it had potential to be. overall, a solid and enjoyable scooby doo film. 8/10 bethany cox

one of quite a few cartoon scooby doo films, "scooby doo and the loch ness monster" turns out to be entertaining, exciting, interesting, funny and also does a surprisingly good interpretation of the highlands of scotland. one annoying aspect of the film is the voices of many of the characters - american people trying to sound scottish in this film are unfortunately not succeeding all that well (although some people do better scottish accents than others).daphne has come to the highlands to see her cousin shannon and the highland games at blake castle. gravely shannon tells the gang that she believes to have seen the loch ness monster. when yet more chaos arises, the mystery inc gang have another mystery on their hands...good for scooby doo fans and for people who want to find out more about scotland! enjoy "scooby doo and the loch ness monster"! :-)

good job.that's how i would describe this animated scooby-doo adventure.this is so far the best of the animated scooby movies i have seen.i liked the story.i thought it had some depth to to it.the movie is also well paced.it doesn't get boring for a minute.it also has an interesting group of characters(besides scooby and shaggy and the gang,of course)plus,the movie was a real blast.i has a lot of fun watching it.i also liked the great scottish music.it was very catchy and infectious.naturally,we know that scooby and the gamg will solve the mystery,but it's still fun getting to that point.the animation is also pretty good for this movie.i would love it if they did a 3d animation scooby adventure,but we'll just have to wait and see.for me,scooby-doo and the loch ness monster is a 7/10

scooby doo and the monster of mexico was no doubt the weakest of the modern scooby doo animated features. loch ness monster is a considerable improvement.this time the gang head off to scotland to see the highland games and visit blake castle, daphne's ancestral home. and wouldn't you know, the castle happens to be in the 'quaint' fishing village of drumnadrochit, on the shores of loch ness.during their stay they meet a few interesting folks. first there is fiona pembrooke, a scientist who has drowned all of her money into finding the loch ness monster.sir ian locksley, the boss of the national heritage museum of scotland, he is staunch non-believer of nessie.the haggarts, the own a cozy inn on the shores of the loch. the sons are a couple of local jokers, always into mischief.del chilman, a wild, paranoid hippie dude who is convinced the monster is out there and will stop at nothing on find her.and finally, duncan macgubbin, the dock master who has seen nessie too many times to count.most of these characters are stereotypes, which gets a bit annoying as this is teaching younger audiences a load of crap and giving the wrong impression. however if you can immune yourself to it you'll be alright. being from scotland i can't help but wince at the awfully mimicked scottish accents. fact: we don't sound like that.soon enough nessie, looking rather more demonic than 'usual', shows up and causes havoc. looks like the gang have another mystery on their hands. the usual chase scenes, clues and shaggy's wacky disguises follow. there are plenty of laughs. the animation is splendid, with some atmospheric scenes and locations. and the plot a lot better than monster of mexico.the only bad thing this time around is the music. i miss louis febre's scoring and the songs here are pretty rotten too. where are the hex girls when you need 'em?the region 2 dvd is in crystal clear 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen (the region 1 ain't) with dolby 5.0 sound. some okay extras are included. definitely worth getting.

cool flick. enjoyable to watch. hope to see more from fred carpenter soon. i really like the location setting with all the new york references. it was interesting the way it all unfolds in the end. the suspense factor was effective and the acting, though kept simple, was also effective in portraying the characters. there are a bunch of neat little tricks incorporated into this film that make all the better. i think the supporting actress did a great job in her role. the casting and directing in this film seem to be sewn together seamlessly and the quality of the shooting is quite impressive. the movie is not without its soft moments either, which gives it a nice sense of balance.

i am a talent manager. i have been for 15 years now. i have discovered some wonderful talent. they have been in movies, commericals, braodway and television. in my opinion eddie monroe was cast wonderful. i love seeing the ability of real people. not just a name. the actors in this movie were very natural and believable. i was very entertained by this film. i love a movie with a few twists. i also enjoy when at the end of the movie the puzzle is solved. i still would like to know what happened to the large sum of the money.(when you see the flick you will understand what i am saying.) the mobsters all look real ???? i would like to see this film on the big screen. the footage was shot really well. the scenery of new york was the new york that i know. have a happy 2006 and may this movie make it to the awards.

i have seen a few of fred carpenter's movies on showtime, pay per view and video/dvd and i enjoyed most of these films especially with a few beers, (carpenter knows how to entertain)"eddie monroe" and "murdered innocence" are my favorites. i recently viewed a promo dvd of "eddie monroe" and everything from the cast to the storyline and directing all worked smoothly. (doug brown's music score was sensational.) i enjoyed seeing frank sivero ("goodfellas", "new york, new york" and "the wedding singer"), he is an amazing and very underrated actor.but i especially liked the performance of paul vario who played uncle benny, i looked up his acting credits on the imdb and i found out this was his first starring role. where has this guy been! give fred carpenter credit for discovering great new talent, it's only a matter of time you'll be seeing this guy costarring with pacino and deniro. as i mentioned carpenter knows how to entertain and when your working with a limited budget it is amazing what carpenter can produce.(i read the vent magazine interview and carpenter has never made a movie for more than $400,000.00 dollars.) before i watched "eddie monroe" i saw "rocky balboa" and "the good shepherd" both great films. "eddie monroe" took me on a ride to a surprised ending because of a very good script, good performances from the entire cast(craig morris is a movie star waiting to happen and the lead actress jessica tsunis was hot!) great cinematography, direction and doug brown's music score. as i stated i recently seen "rocky balboa" and "the good shepherd", if i were to write a comment about those two movies i would be saying some of the same things i have stated about "eddie monroe", the only thing those two very good films don't have in common with "eddie monroe", they didn't cost a few hundred grand. great movie and i didn't even drink a beer.

"the love letter" is a somewhat pleasant, very very low-key romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few words in a mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passions and longings of a sleepy sea-side town's inhabitants.it's not for all audiences. "the love letter", i feel, benefits from it's simple and quiet tone. never intentionally wacky and phony like most romantic comedies it's quaint, picturesque, and comfy. however, for these exact same reasons, many viewers will be bored and disinterested.the cast is nice. it's great to see tom selleck again, and is such an underplayed role. and it's hard to believe this is the same kate capshaw we met 15 years ago in "indiana jones and the temple of doom". she's quite naturally good here; improving in every role i've seen her in since grating on indy's nerves. and is it possible capshaw is just getting lovelier and lovelier with age ? ( what is it about that spielberg!?)it doesn't amount to much; but after another noisy summer movie season i'll probably look back with brief fondness for this light-as-a-feather romance.

the love letter is one of my all-time favorite books, so naturally i was skeptical when i heard it was to become a movie. but, i liked it. i found myself grinning through the entire movie. i admit that it isn't a great movie but definitely a pleasant hour and a half. i thought that capshaw and scott were perfect as helen and johnny. just as i pictured them. and the town and scenery were just right as well. i recommend this film, but don't expect too much, just enjoy it.

i thought the movie was pretty good. i really enjoyed myself as i viewed it. however, the last scene at johnny's birthday party was cut way too short. i, myself, was an extra in that scene and was upset with the results. but other than that, (and the weird casting), the movie was superb.

this movie was a sicky sweet cutesy romantic comedy, just the kind of movie i usually dislike but this one was just cute enough to keep me interested. it was really funny in one moment (probably why i liked it) and then just as serious in the next. plus, it had ellen in it and i've always had a soft spot for her.basically, the owner of a book store, helen (kate capshaw) finds a love letter in one of the old couches in her store. she thinks it is for her and goes crazy trying to figure out who sent it. she has kind of shut herself off from the world, so it really throws her for a loop. eventually, almost everyone connected with her finds this letter and they are all getting mixed signals which creates some really funny moments.like i said, i am usually not one for this type of movie but i really wound up enjoying it and recommend it highly.

this film ain't half bad. it may be a little long at times, but carried along by beautiful scenery, an immensely beautiful love letter and great actors, you forget time and enjoy. the grand prize, however, goes to blythe danner and geraldine mcewan as..........well that would be telling, but they are just great!

i thought that the love letter was a pretty good movie. there were certain things that could have made it better. but kate capshaw is absolutely beautiful, and she showed it in this movie. i wish that there could have been a few more revealing scenes of her, but it was still a very good movie. it was very fun to watch!

so well done. the photography, sound, music and the performances were the best. it's also an amusing story line that brings a smile to your face with each scene--i loved it and i'm a 60 year old heterosexual guy. each character seemed to fit their part to a tee. it's the best performance that i've seen from ms. capshaw--she's been in more movies than i thought, but this was a wonderful achievement. i suppose it's a plus to have spielberg money behind you allowing for a fat budget and all the best that money can buy technically. two of the cast have successful t.v. shows of their own now--it's easy to see why. tom selleck does his usual good job.

aside from the fact that this movie was filmed mostly in rockport ma, which is a beautiful town where my mother once rented a small storefront and i spent many a pleasant summer as a child, it is fun and cute little film. i must admit that i had no desire to actually see this movie even though i have a weakspot for romantic comedies (i don't know why). the trailers i saw were not appealing, the cast did not look that interesting and i had no idea what the plot would be about. in the end i found it to be an interesting meditation on relationships and family. i thoroughly enjoyed myself and must admit that i thought that this film was one of the most overlooked gems of last year. i am disappointed that so few people seemed to have enjoyed the very "human-ness" that this movie presented the viewer with.i have read many bad reviews of this film, and must admit a certain level of shock at the cynicism that is prevalent in them. as a grad student i consider myself to be quite cynical, but this was a beautiful little film that deserves much better than it got.

this is one of the better feel-good films of 1999 with kate capshaw leading an all-star cast about a small town and a love letter. first off, the scenery is beautiful, and anyone who sees this film and doesn't want to move to this location is crazy! for the cast, capshaw is stunning as the lead actress who captivates the emotional roller-coaster role. tom everett scott is charming as the "author" of the note throughout the film, and the always delightful ellen degeneres is hilarious! blythe danner and the actress who plays the bookstore saleswoman are both terrific, too. although it was unsuccessful, the film is great as it is both short and sweet and well as very romantic. 10/10

this is definitely a girl movie. my husband found it utterly boring, but i think this is a really sweet movie. it's amazing to think that just a note can bring so many people together. this is a great get-away for anyone who loves a cute, funny romance!

i'm a large scarred heterosexual male ex-bouncer, ex-rugby player, and ex-boxer, and i love this movie.it's no "mystic river." it's a piece of fluff. but there is room in life for fluff, and when that fluff is engagingly shot, well-acted by attractive, likable people, cleverly plotted and full of good dialogue, there's even more room for it.i'm not the biggest tom selleck fan. but he's good in this. so are julianne nicholson (love her bald head and freckles), ellen degeneres, kate capshaw and even tom everett scott (that thing you do!).the scenery is nice, the mood is upbeat, there's heartache and wistfulness and farce and even a little redemption.any (male) reviewer who disses this movie is, shall we say, not perfectly confident in his masculinity. in the meantime i'll continue to catch bits and pieces of it without apology whenever it shows up on cable.

the love letter (1999): starring kate capshaw, tom everett scott, tom selleck, ellen de generes, gloria stuart, blythe danner, jessica capshaw, alice drummond, bill buell, erik jensen, margaret ann brady, walter covell, patrick donnelly, lucas hall, christian harmony, christopher nee, breanne smith, marilyn rockafellow, sasha spielberg, jack black.....director peter chan, screenplay maria maggenti.based on the novel "the love letter" by cathleen schine, director peter chan's film version, released in 1999, was not a big box-office draw, not even for a romantic movie with some comedy elements. while it was not as popular in theaters, it soon became a beloved film on cable television and on vhs/dvd. set in a seaport town in the good old usa (i forget the exact location), this is the story of a mysterious, passionately written love letter who sparks emotions and confusion among the principal characters, each who think the letter is personally addressed to them. by the end of the film, we don't know who the lover or the beloved is but the power of the letter has altered the lives of nearly everyone in the small town. the cast is made up of wonderful actors who have fared well on tv and film, among them kate capshaw in the lead role of middle-aged beauty helen, a bookstore owner, comedienne ellen degeneres as her friend/employee janet hall, young hottie tom everett scott as johnny, the young 20 something guy who falls for the older hellen and an older tom selleck as the firefighter george matthias who must compete with johnny for helen's affections. there are cameo roles by veteran old hollywood actress gloria stuart, who is best known to modern audiences as the elderly rose in "titanic" (1997) and a cameo by kate capshaw's own daughter (with husband steven spielberg) jessica capshaw. the love triangle is between a middle-aged woman, an older man and a young man, each of whom feel as passionately for helen as the writer of the mysterious letter. the conflict lies in helen's indecision. will she choose the right person ? which man has the most to offer her ? johnny is in a relationship with a girl his age who loves him with a passion all her own, and is in fact, a kind of reminder of what helen was like at her age. george is in the process of divorcing his wife and has lived a worldly and eventful life. a cultured intellectual, he takes helen on an opera date, where the tragic death of puccini's ultra-italian heroine tosca moves helen to explosive tears. there are lots of beautiful vistas of the charming coastal town, rendered beautifully by cinematographer tami reiker. the score is a paradise of romantic and lovely songs - " i've never been in love before", "i'm in the mood for love" and "only the lonely". ellen degeneres as janet hall, who is consistently late to her job at helen's bookshop, who endlessly dates men without being able to find the right guy , is simply wonderful. she has not lost her comedic flair, even though at this point in her career she was not appearing much on tv or film because only about two years before her hit mid-90's tv show "ellen" was cancelled because of her "coming out" as a lesbian and the new lesbian subject matter of the show. here you even find comedian jack black, long before he made it big, in the bit part of a fisherman. this is a moving film about human emotions and making decisions that are significant, about the human need for a passionate consuming love and the general love of escapism brought not only through books, letters, and music, but through a genuinely loving and secure relationship. this is a great film with wonderful moments and an infectious romantic spirit.

helen (kate capshaw) owns a bookstore in the sleepy, coastal town of loblolly by the sea. divorced, helen has a young daughter who is going to camp for the summer, giving mother a bit more freedom. working at helen's store are the manager, janet (ellen degeneres), a man-crazy village-gossip girl who has eyes for the handsome fireman, george (tom selleck), and two young college students, jennifer (julianne nicholson) and johnny (tom everett scott). one day, helen stumbles across a romantic, tender love letter and she suspects that johnny has written it for her. throwing caution to the wind, helen and johnny begin a small-time "thing". but, the letter subsequently lands in others' hands, including janet's, who thinks george has sent it to her, and johnny's, who imagines helen has penned it for him. and, on and on the letter goes. but, in truth, george possibly has eyes for helen and jennifer has fallen hard for johnny. the town's museum curator, too, may have a secret love. will tangled affairs like these ever straighten themselves out? this is a cute movie with a gorgeous setting and capable stars. each of the main actors gives a pleasing performance, including the addition of blythe danner and gloria stuart to those mentioned previously. then, too, the coastal scenery is most lovely, the costumes quite well-chosen, and the photography very nice indeed. there are a few surprises, including a subtle gay plot development, which may not please all viewers. but, for those who love romantic comedies, this one should be included on any list of good choices for the genre.

although it's definitely an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours and it's always worth a watch, this film never quite meets the targets that it should for two reasons. firstly, after the first forty-five minutes or so it focuses heavily on helen and johnny, who are far less interesting characters than most of the others - janet, jennifer, george and miss scattergoods are all much more enticing. although at first this works, since in life we don't always know everything about everyone else, and because the point is being made that perhaps helen is slightly self-involved, it quickly wears thin and we want to see more of the other characters.secondly, the film seems to lose its way in terms of plot in the second half. the letter itself holds far less significance than it does in the first half and, again, although this works well in some ways, it seems odd to leave so much of the potential displayed in the first half behind.overall, this film is sweet and good-natured, with some genuinely hilarious moments - for example, janet explaining condiments to an avid audience. the lazy but quietly desperate atmosphere that helen feels is heavy and the sense of living in a small seaside town is accurately portrayed, but the film isn't quite as intelligent as it's trying to be. it just misses being both a light romantic comedy and being a clever portrait of life. however, it's still good and if you get the chance, it's definitely worth seeing.

i normally don't like romantic films, but i love this film very much. the story is really touching, and the ending is very appropriate. i feel i really care for many characters in this film. i feel i can feel their feelings. while most romantic films always make me feel detached and bored, this one completely makes me feel involved, starting from the scene of capshaw running along the beach with scott until the ending scene. i want to rate this film 11 out of 10, because i want to give an extra one point for the ending. the acting part is very strong. kate capshaw has a good opportunity to show her talent. though i'm not impressed with scott in `dead man on campus,' this film completely changes my viewpoint towards him. he's so irresistibly charming here. geraldine mcewan is as terrific as ever. this film might not be as good, complex, deep, or believable as other films which deal a little bit with the same kind of relationship, such as `l'ecole de la chair' or 'post coitum, animal triste,' but `the love letter' can still be proud of itself as it casts a rare different light on that kind of relationship. and that difference makes this film eminently enjoyable. by being unambitious and relying on great charms of small stars, dreamworks, this time you really make my dream come true.

this film shows up on the premium cable channels quite often and, i find that i keep watching it over and over again. the performances are wonderful, and the material has so much happening that there is always something new to take away from the film.maybe i am too often distracted when watching films at home, you know the drill, the dogs bark, the phone rings, the popcorn finishes during the credits. but this film is about people and what motivates us, what enlivens us, what causes rifts between us, and what inspires us.for me, it is films like the love letter that keep me taking a chance on new films. frankly, i am surprised that the film is not better known. i would love to see blythe danner and geraldine mcewan in many more roles. they are a delight to watch. kate capshaw is wonderful and i had no previous idea that she would be. ellen degeneres plays a role that is much more complex than simply being the comic relief.this film provides interesting visuals as a proper background to the characters and their interactions. i find it refreshing every time i take the time to watch it.

this is an unusual film because although it was made by twentieth-century fox because it's one of the few pairings of barbara stanwyck and her future husband, robert taylor. barbara stanwyck had been making films for many different studios (rko, paramount and selznick) at about the time she made this is my affair, but taylor was an mgm contract player so he only appeared in this film because he was loaned to fox--something studios occasionally did during this era.the film is interesting because many real-life people have roles in the film, though the piece is otherwise pure fiction. you'll see actors playing william mckinley, teddy roosevelt and admiral dewey. i can't recall any film with mckinley or dewey in it as a character, though i do remember roosevelt from the wind and the lion and a couple other films. three cheers for seeing a "lesser president" in a film as a major character! the film begins with mckinley taking a young lieutenant (robert taylor) aside and asking him to be a special agent for him--and telling no one--not even the secret service. that's because the president fears that someone within the agency is tipping off a gang that has been making a long string of robberies--all based on inside information. so it's up to taylor (who is not known for his manly roles--especially at this stage of his career) to pose as a thug and find the gang responsible and the inside man.however, there are two serious complications. first, while he is able to find the gang members, one of the gang member's step-sister is stanwyck. taylor finds that he's fallen in love with her but he must also do his duty and turn them in to the authorities. second, because mckinley is the only other person who knows the truth, serious problems develop when mckinley is assassinated and taylor is on death row for the crimes!!! the film did a nice job of creating a story and placing it within a historical context. while today most people don't remember mckinley nor remember that he was assassinated, the film is set in this interesting time period. the acting is pretty decent, as the stars are supported by victor mclaglen and brian donlevy, though i must admit that donlevy's role was pretty tame and ordinary compared to many of his other film roles. overall, it's very interesting, well written and not too sappy in the romance department. a good outing for all.

a bland title disguises this solidly-carpentered example of old-fashioned hollywood entertainment, this film proves a largely successful hodgepodge of several disparate elements: a period piece, a romantic drama, a crime movie and a political thriller. interestingly, though made by fox, its protagonists ¬ñ robert taylor and barbara stanwyck ¬ñ were both usually associated with other studios; their on screen chemistry here is palpable and eventually led to marriage in a couple of years' time. while a bit too young, taylor is a dashing hero (a marine personally appointed by president mckinley to uncover the culprits behind an organized clean-up of numerous banks); unsurprisingly, no sooner has he tracked them down (led by smooth brian donlevy and thuggish victor mclaglen) that he falls for a chanteuse (naturally, stanwyck) who has thrown her lot with the gang ¬ñ although, truth be told, singing is far from being the actress' forte! similarly, apart from having to prove his worth to make it into their fold, he has to vie with mclaglen for stanwyck's attentions; by the way, the practical joker persona of the former reminded me a lot of charley chase in sons of the desert (1933) which, incidentally, was likewise directed by william a. seiter. later on, taylor is in two minds about involving stanwyck in the impending bait and tries to offer his resignation to the president while eloping with the girl ¬ñ but the jealous rival disrupts his plans. the robbery gone awry, we find donlevy dead and the other two in jail; taylor's hopes for mckinley's intervention ¬ñ having meanwhile learned the identity of the elusive and obviously prominent 'inside man' ¬ñ are seemingly dashed when the president winds up assassinated himself (a great plot twist, though the resulting eleventh-hour suspense feels contrived)! to get back to the film's jumble of styles, even if the vaudeville sequences are a matter of taste, the romantic triangle slows things up and it skimps somewhat on the thriller aspect, this emerges a handsome production indeed ¬ñ with the actors already mentioned ably supported by the likes of john carradine (who unaccountably disappears after just one scene!), douglas fowley, sig rumann and, as two american presidents, sidney blackmer (the bubbly theodore roosevelt) and frank conroy (mckinley).

in 1937 darryl zanuck, who had recently moved from head of production at warner brothers, was trying to get his newly created company, 20th century fox off the ground and on a level playing field with his old bosses at warners and the glitter palace at mgm. "this is my affair" was an attempt to cash in on the current success of historical films set around the turn of the century ("san francisco" "in old chicago")and in retrospect he succeeded quite mightily. the plot is fascinating. a trouble maker but heroic naval officer (robert taylor) is given a secret assignment by president mckinley to uncover a ring of bank robbers that are paralyzing american finance. he finds the gang but falls in love with their female mascot (barbara stanwyck) and must decide between love and duty.not everything about this vintage film works well, but overall it is a good slice of studio film-making. the plot gimmick would be borrowed by kurt vonnegut for "mother night" (the lead role of that film of the book was played brilliantly by nick nolte) and seems quite believable, at least within the confides of studio make believe. as a fan of old movies i am always thrilled when i stumble upon one that i have never seen and "this is my affair" was no exception.

cool action - yeah the premise has been done - but not this way - that's the trick. hey folks - shock - it's an x-file.to me - it's cool that scully/mulder have almost no scenes together -- they have to adapt, rely on each other's intrinsic sense about what's really going on - and each other's adaptation skills. they read into each other's moves and get the job done.... (sort of).oh yeah --- really good acting -- do these people get paid to do this? or- a slow day when the convenience store doesn't call them into work. (hey - duchovny - where's the day-old donuts?? malcolm - get to school...)

another decent offering from the pen of vince gilligan.a pre-"malcolm in the middle" bryan cranston plays patrick crump, a deranged guy who eventually hijacks mulder via gunpoint and has him driving west at high speeds. it has something to do with his severe head ringing (& possible deadly combustion--his wife just experienced it), and the pressure only seems to be relieved by heading towards the left coast. only mulder could relate to this guy's plight, and actually bond with his captor before the all night ride is completed. meanwhile, scully seems to have solved the case with a possible remedy for mr. crump, and will meet them at the ocean. check it out to see if our dynamic duo can hook up at the pacific and somehow rectify mr. crump's big problem.

drive was an enjoyable episode with a dark ending. basically a man and his wife are infected in their inner ear by a high pitched sound wave being emitted by some military equipment. some favorite parts of mine from this episode are mulder's dialogue in the car, and the scene where scully goes in with the hazmat team and find the little old deaf lady completely unaffected by what they thought was a virus. the ending of course is tragic in its realism because it leads the viewer to believe that they are going to actually be able to pull off this elaborate plan to save the victim but when mulder arrives the man is already dead. 8/10

as much as 'the beginning' showed that we're still going to get "classic" x-files, drive showed that the x-files was going to explore new territory. they start by giving us a unique teaser to drive, with the news camera footage. it was an interesting transition from the the tv to the real events. i would've liked it even better if they had kept that news footage camera for the entire teaser and not cut to the inside of the car. upon viewing this episode live back in 1998 i was thinking, "am i on the right channel?" that first autopsy by scully flooded me with big words that i don't understand. i think she learned her lesson to always wear a mask before performing an autopsy. silly scully! what is the deal with the lighting in the autopsy lab? it's as dark as a tomb in there! how are they supposed to see what they're doing in there? assistant director kersh gets his first lines in this episode. i have no love lost for that man. he is the third recurring character in a row that is introduced that you love to hate, the first two being diana fowley and jeffrey spender. i guess the producers felt that there was too much love going on for mulder, scully and skinner. so they needed to add some characters to give our favorite agents some grief and incite our ire as fans. i love the quarantine suits worn by scully and her team with the cool helmet light bulbs. boy. it's really smoky or foggy in dry northern nevada at night. can we say the word "effect"? drive is a cool episode, but looking at route 36 on my u.s. atlas, there's no way mulder could've maintained a speed of 70-100 mph on that road. if he had been on i-80, the freeway, maybe. but no way on a state road with that many curves. all of the filming inside the car looked very authentic. excellent job by rob bowman. it looks nothing like the old days of the obvious blue screen or clip of passing scenery outside a car window on a stage. this was a fun episode, but some of the inaccuracies keep it from being a great episode. it keeps you on the edge of your seat, so hold on for a fast ride!

a straight-forward x file that shows that action is always the equal of intelligence. rob bowman's direction is crisp and sharp, the episode looks just as fresh now as it did almost a decade ago. david and gillian both give fine performances and both seem to relish the lack of baggage - it's a standalone x file that even non-fans could happen upon and enjoy. junior brown gives both the leads a run for their money during his scene with them, he's so convincing that you could believe the crew drove to the middle of nowhere and knocked on the first door they came to. bryan cranston is intense and energetic as patrick crump, he has since admitted in interviews that he knew next to nothing about the x files prior to this role, a fact that makes his hit-the-floor-running performance all the more incredible. a brilliantly dumb episode.

i first saw this masterpiece on vhs 10 years ago, and the powerful interpretation on angry-kid-painfully-against-established-society it carried stayed in my heart since then. director hector babenco is such a good humanity, who finds a delicate angle to tell the story of how urbanity kills the childhood of the kids from poverty class. even the outcast kids have their innocent beautiful dreams. but the corrupt reality never gives a chance...thanks to the publishers for the recent dvd release, i now can keep this great movie to my favorite collection.

this movie has an outstanding acting, by marilia p√™ra, and a stunning dicretcion by the argentine hector babenco. this is, in my opinion, the best brazilian movie ever made. the movie was filmed with child from the 'favelas' , the brazilian ghetos. the children weren't actors and were casted by babenco in the city of rio de janeiro. the story is about the criminal children that are arrested in the correctional prison, that looks much worse than alcatraz. the children are constantly raped and beaten by the policeman. unfortunately this is not purely fiction, in brazil it does happen till today. a must see for those who like violent movies. but take your mother off the room, because it is a hard movie.

trust the excellent and accurate junagadh75 review! this film is compelling and moving in that roughest, most brutally beautiful film-masterpiece "way". file under unforgettable strong meat. or films that howl at the moon. pixote gets into your nervous system and elevates you despite the pain on the screen. here's an unrelated list of films that did the same thing for me, i.e. "engaged, destroyed, transformed,inspired, resonated... this category transcends nerdy film top ten lists that seek film perfection. "a woman under the influence" , "wiseblood", "wages of fear" "saint jack" "funny bones" "out of the blue".

the story takes place on the streets of sao paoulo in brazil where a young boy named pixote grows up alone without his parents. left troubled and with no direction, pixote gets taken into a child asylum with other adolescents from the street. behind closed doors terrible things occurs within the staff and within the child-groups. and there is one last trigger that gets the place blown up, the last incident that makes pixote and his friends decide to break out and escape. from there on begins a journey overwhelmed with strong bonded friendships, friendships torn apart, love and hate, criminal activities and simply chilling on the beach talking about things, something someone like you and i also does sometimes.i think this film is perfect in so many ways because it touches you on so many levels, it did that with me anyway. the document-like style used to portray pixote and his surroundings does it seem more realistic, and the actors, who really are street children and have lived similar lives, helps the humanity in the conditions seem more natural. it has a social comment about child abuse too, but i think what makes the film so great is that the pressure is on the story and not on the political views. the last scene, which i find the best piece from the film, strikes me as something beyond nothing i've seen before. so full of emotions and yet so unsentimental makes this film a truthful, believable, unbearable, unforgettable story-tale. a true heartbreaking masterpiece which is so underrated!my vote: 10/10

this is probably the best movie from director hector babenco. it shows a brazilian reality unknown by foreigners, which is the same reality that haunts all of the latin american countries, poverty and a survival instinct. the most affected in this reality is the children usually left orphans, or abandoned by their poor parents have to make it in a "dog eat dog" society many times falling into the gap of delinquency, prostitution and crime. very well acted and with a "no frills" approach, this movie will get to you, great story plot, a must have movie on anybody's collection. the starring role went to fernando ramos da silva, a young boy who fell into the crime wave, killed some years later during a robbery. i would suggest people to watch the movie "who killed pixote?" so you can have a more in depth idea of the lives of these characters. some other characters from the movie had a similar fate, some died and others are in jail. none the less this movie will last for a long time in your memory

i'm originally from brazil... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was done to that boy. they told his life story and he never got one "centavo" (brazilian cent) of that movie. fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through that life style in brazil. sad... but that is the world we live in. it's about making money not saving lives. question is: where is fernando today? most probably... dead. we tend to want to live in this "disney filled fantasy bubbled life". when someone comes up to the plate to help... along comes the higher power and says: "what do i get from this? where's my cut?" - i wish people's conscience would speak up!

film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults. overwhelming impossibility of dealing with life and the means the children go to to try to achieve living. only living. staying alive in a cruel world. a nightmare world, we are afraid to watch it because we are seeing truth and are afraid to see it. to see a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complaining about what we have not got when it is so trivial compared to someone else. they, the children of the movie, are desensitized. they are more than desensitized by what is around them. they see sex as an act, like they are watching a tv program. when the one boy is with the hooker, pixote is sitting on the bed watching with a blank stare, no feeling. he wants to be a little boy and have a family but the hooker has no compassion either and pushes him away. a "human" film, with "human" relations and moral judgement in a ugly, scared, cruel world. reminds us that life is not fair, but you can still have a human connection.

for me, this is another one of those films that i got to see off of the los angeles based "z" channel when it was in service. and it was another one of those movies that i saw when i was young...and learned that there was a world out there...one i did not want to accept.moving to los angeles and getting to watch international cinema became quite the guilty pleasure hobby of mine and to date, no premiere channel programming has matched the "z" channel in its showing of international films. the three international films that stuck in my young head were "spetters", "beau pere" and of course this one, "pixote".this was the most shocking and saddest movie i ever witnessed in my life. this was also one of the first movies that made me understand that there is a difference in cinema: to entertain, and to inform. let me be honest..growing up in a small town on the east coast, i had no idea anything like this -- to this extent -- existed. all i knew from south america was brochures of fabulous brazillian vacations and that columbia had a lot of drug trafficking.then comes a film like pixote. sad. disturbing. unflinching. scary. you're watching: children. those that need shelter, love, understanding and all these get are a way to survive day after day through drugs, sex, robbing, stealing, sleeping on the streets and in sadistic group homes etc. their survival is hard to watch with other street children, prostitutes, etc., and you begin to wonder how can things like this be allowed to happen in this world.pixote is not a film for entertainment, it is a film of information. it shows shocking and disturbing images - but it shows life for these daily street children.

this was really a "nightmare" of a film; i saw it about nine years ago on cable tv and haven't forgotten it since. pixote is a 10-year old boy who lives in the streets of sao paulo (brazil) and leads a criminal life in the company of his teenage friends lilica, dito and chico; they steal, pimp, sell drugs and murder in order to survive each day...in the first half of the film pixote is caught by the police and sent to a sadistic foster home where he witnesses every kind of abuse from the older inmates and guards to the rest of the kids; one night, lilica's boyfriend is killed after a beating, so pixote and his friends decide to escape during a riot. the rest of the film shows pixote's descent into a criminal life; he doesn't show any feelings or remorse after killing someone, maybe because he knows that good feelings are of no use in the world in which he lives...but there is, however, a gentle scene in the middle of the film; pixote and his friends are at the beach, missing (and wishing) one of his friends from the reformatory was there. i thought it was a poetic and melancholy scene in the middle of all these horrible events...the boys are obviously longing not only for their friend, but for a better life. director hector babenco's "pixote" is a brave and depressing film that doesn't shy away from showing the harshest reality many people -including myself- tend to ignore or misunderstand. this film will probably open your eyes and make you a better and compassionate person.

i've been studying brazilian cinema since 2004, when i stumbled onto "cidade de deus / city of god". let me tell you something, this movie is probably as good or better than "city of god".the acting, cinematography and music supervision make this movie a unique experience. i have not been to brazil yet, but this movie presents the harsh reality that is beset before the citizens of s√£o paulo.i recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema. this movie is disturbing and you may feel a bit despondent after watching it.something you want to watch, but nothing you want to go to sleep on.

when it was released, in the beginning of the 80's, pixote brings to brazilian society the problems of young delinquents, and the impact of this in brazilian society. i can't watch the movie at that time, cause i was too young, but now i got a chance and watched it a few days ago. it's a very brutal movie, but everything is absolutely true, and sad. pixote is the name of a 12 year-old boy who lives in the streets, and survive with misdemeanors; he stays for a while in a house of detention, and when he left it he continues to plan robs with other buns and a prostitute, played by marilia pera. the boy is still a marijuana addicted and smell glue with another teenagers, to forget his sad reality. the quality of the images it's not the best, but the movie is totally realistic about brazilian problems, and must be viewed and admired.

"pixote" is the one of most powerful, shocking, and moving motion picture to come from brazil. it's about the lives of street kids on the streets of sao paulo and rio de janeiro, and it centers around a ten-year-old boy. the camera follows them around in an almost documentary style;from the juvenile detention center (where most of the staff is as corrupt as the police) and back to the streets, and it never turns away from the horrors of the city. prostitution, drug use/dealing, corruption, and murder are all witnessed by these youths; yet it's something they're painfully used to. director hector babenco used real street kids as the actors, adding to the films brutal reality. although not for everyone, a film i highly recommend. an emotionally devastating movie.

the film opens with the director talking to the camera and saying he is going to show a story about brazilain street kids whose families live in poverty and must steal and kill to survive. in fact the main character (pixote) was played by an actual street kid only 11 years old. what follows was one of the most brutal, depressing and horrifying film i've even seen. i saw it about 17 years ago (on a double bill with "black orpheus") and have never forgotten it. i don't think i ever want to see it again--it was just too much. spoiler ahead!!!! the scene which will not leave me is when pixote meets a prostitute who has to abort her own fetus. you don't see her do it...but you get a quick glance at what she got out. it's almost 20 years later and just recalling that scene upsets me. spoiler end!!!!!the movie gets more brutal as it goes along and ends the only way it can. what's all the more harrowing is stories like this really did happen in brazil in 1981...and are still happening today.a harrowing brutal film...but it should be seen if you can handle it. i'm surprised this got an r rating--i've seen x rated film that are less graphic. a 10.

this is a difficult movie to watch, and would have been even more difficult had i known then that the actor playing the protagonist was in fact killed in his home by police at age 19. pixote (peewee) is a street kid in sao paulo who is caught in a roundup triggered by a murder in which he had no involvement. he is committed to a juvenile prison where he witnesses brutality and exploitation that ordinary citizens try very hard to believe doesn't exist. when finally he escapes, he and three comrades survive by the only means they know, which is crime. what makes the film so heart-rending is that both pixote and the actor portraying him clearly do not wish to be the characters life circumstances have made them. pixote tries to trust and to love and to bond, but there simply is no room in his world for the gentle side of human nature. one is left at the end wanting desperately to do something for the pixotes of the world, but what? building more children's's prisons with higher walls surely is not the answer...

this is no walk in the park. i saw this when it came out, and haven't had the guts to watch it again. you will never see a more horrifyingly devastating or depressing movie. i felt like i'd been severely beaten. what kind of world are we living in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage? this is our world, what we have created, what we have allowed to happen. and i would hesitate to say that i-me-we are not responsible for this. babenco made this film to wake us up, to shake us to our very core, and he succeeded. how can we be cruel, or self-indulgent, or neglectful of our children, when we see the graphic results of such behavior? he is pointing a finger of accusation at us all for doing this to the lowliest and least powerful of our society. and if you aren't doing something each day to prevent it, then you are part of the problem. i am not a religious fanatic, but this movie made me think about the state of my soul.

"pixote: a lei do mais fraco" deals with what is perhaps the greatest of all brazilian themes: poverty. and along with poverty the other unnatural feelings and actions it brings; prostitution, violence, crime, rape and murder.brazil is the country of paradoxes, and its social problems are present everywhere. the difference between the rich and the poor; the beautiful and the ugly; happiness and the most profound human decay."pixote" is one of the films that dare to touch and open these so painful wounds, and does it without the slightest glimmer of hope, in an honest portrayal of a country that, like pixote himself, is already lost.

the violent death of fernando ramos da silva only eight years after the completion of this film, only adds to the poignancy of dierector babenco's powerful message. the film is split into two halves - the first in a reformatory where a group of youngsters are abused and violated by the violent law enforcers and guardians. the second backdrop is the city where they are confined instead by their own actions and morality, which includes mugging, pimping and killing different characters who enter their lives.the differing gender and sexual roles in the film allow for constant changes in the characters as they interact with other people. particularly interesting is teh character of lalica, a transvestite who is mother and lover to some of the children. her reaction to the arrival of sueli, a prostitute is both poignant and tragic. there is no happy ending to this story and i reccomend to watch it with caution as there are some very uncomfortable scenes to watch especially in teh opening twenty minutes. but whilst watching it, it is important to remember that this is not just a fictional tale. the actors are not trained professionals but instead boys selected from the streetsof sao paulo. they actually lived this life that is portrayed so vividly on screen and in da silva's case, died at the hands of the police who are depicted so brutally. a documentary? a piece of fiction. it borders on both but it certainly makes for heart wrenching material and is a film that actually leaves you breathless and thinking long after having watched it.10/10

in his descriptions of caa, platinum card lunches in hollywood, psychoanalysis, a vacation in provincetown he never took, and free trips to nicaragua, financed by columbia pictures.it sounds narcissistic, but spalding gray (possibly because of his unusual personality) ropes the audience in, laughs at himself (perhaps because he did not take the hollywood thing oh-so-seriously) and gets us to care.this monologue is not just about "the killing fields", or "swimming to cambodia"; it is more a pastiche of events, as he sees them. some of the lines are classic, as when gray meets with the esteemed talent agents at caa. the conference table is ..."full of them, tanned, healthy, fresh from drinking blue-green algae from an oregon lake...there are no drugs now in hollywood".this was before the tragedy occurred. many of us will miss his off-balance humor. 9/10.

three of the things you can say about spalding gray are: he certainly marched to the beat of his own "drummer;" he was never at a loss for words; and he obviously felt that those watching and listening to him would be interested in every aspect of his life, experiences and thoughts - no matter how trivial at times.most of us are not quite as far "off the wall" as he was. most of us aren't as interested in sharing the most minute parts of ourselves with others - even one-on-one or in small groups, let alone on stage.but that doesn't make it any less-interesting to watch and listen to this erudite, unusual man. and after seeing one of his performances, on reflection, we can find many of his articulate musings were perhaps more relevant to our own lives and thoughts than we may have first thought.granted, he was a "new york/avant-garde" type of personality, and undeniably a bit "strange." (there are those who would maintain describing someone as "new york" and strange" was being unnecessarily redundant.)i give him a "10" for the talent he presents in this genre which is his specialty.

gray can make the english language jump through hoops like none other. he recounts a number of events, tied together by his writing of a manuscript (the "monster" of the title), some sad, some uproariously funny, all in his characteristic, sarcastic manner. if you liked "swimming to cambodia" you will love this one. i actually thought this was a bit more interesting and better told than "swimming to cambodia". a real masterpiece.

this is marvelous movie, about a soul of ale. this is a journey to ale's heart. i found it fascinating. the director did a great job. he makes the scenes talk. especially on the silent scenes. the window of ale is a great one. an the scenes when he lies in bed are one of the best directed scenes i have seen. apart from directing. it has been a quite time i did not watch a movie about a soul. as a philosopher i can say that, this film proves that the age does not matter about your soul. so as ale's soul. as living in turkey i do not care about the other side of ny. this is a universal scene you can see everywhere in the world. as to my opinion more universal than every other thing. do not miss this film. otherwise you will miss a great thing about a soul. if you have one. baris.sentuna

i was very impressed with this production on likely all levels; from production to plot and character development.this definitely fall under the "realism" genre, since there is nothing going on here that makes use of creative imagination, twists, or manipulating audience in how a viewer shall feel, think and asses.the actors are great, especially the "little" ones. the chemistry between the brother and the sister is mind blowing, maybe not even as common as should be in real life. it is a movie excellent to literally watch while visualizing it. one knows when a movie is good when one just does not want it to end, but eventually everything does...

the majesty of ramin bahrani's second feature is that, like the work of a poet, he portrays the very soul of humanity and lets it flourish on the screen. beyond the scope of most other indie films out there, chop shop is wise, exuding the very best of the great cinema of the ages; we can look back at the works of bresson and pasolini and compare bahrani's work to theirs, and yet chop shop is fresh and urgent to modern society. we can see the workings of a master here ¬ñ a certain sense of beauty, style, and content all merge together in a film that reminds us what it means to be alive. instead of focusing on the side of nyc we so often see, we live and breathe with our young hero, alejandro, in the destitute willits point ¬ñ a fascinating quasi-sub-world of our culture ¬ñ and yet it's a very, very real place. trying to stay afloat, alejandro has to support himself and his older sister. watch this film and feel the sense of raw spiritual understanding that bahrani leads us toward ¬ñ all with profound and concise realism.

this is one of those movies when you are watching it you wonder whether it is documentary or fiction. after the movie, ramin bahrani answered many questions and we learned that the movie has a script.bahrani's camera is silent, he is not judgmental, he almost erases director from the movie by purpose, background is not organized to make the picture pretty, however don't get me wrong; there is a lot of preparation for this movie. starting on personal level, being the part of environment, being to be ignored when you film.main character is a 'real' actor in every sense.i would like to thank all crew for this movie, showing us another country within nyc. i strongly suggest it if you like stories of others.bora kizilirmak

some critics have compared chop shop with the theatrical releases of city of god and pixote. i've seen both of those as well as chop shop and like in many instances, i don't feel the comparison is warranted. city of god and pixote surely had a much higher budget. chop shop is a low budget independent film about survival and hope, disappointment, and continuing with life. one of the scenes is allegedly filmed during the us open and either the filmmakers had incredible connections or the scene was filmed at another time and the us open footage was added. i say that because i live in the area where this movie was filmed and security is insane while the tennis matches are in progress. it's also noteworthy that the actors actual names were their character's names in the movie. back to the movie. it's an enjoyable story about survival. however, it ended up getting a 7 because... at times the actors acted extremely well. at other times, they appeared to be just reciting their lines. if the actors were less competent (as they were in the low budget "the big dis" for example) i would have been more forgiving. but in several scenes each and every one of these actors gave exemplary performances. at other times, they appeared bored. the director might be at fault here. i also had problems with the ending. this is one of those movies that "just ends". maybe there will be a part 2? definitely worth getting on dvd. i wont bother summing up the story because that info is already available on imdb.

can't say this wasn't made well. at a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took 30 takes. and there isn't the slightest indication he didn't get exactly what he wanted. but this is an oddly non-hispanic film in the same way west side story was many years ago. both the leads, a brother-sister team, are excellent and memorable in their parts. the setting, a sort of underground car repair district in queens, is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission by itself. but there's something unsatisfying about the key issue in the film, namely, what the sister feels she has to do to get by. i can understand the brother's reaction, but it just seems a little too easily come by to me. the movie seems to suggest that people like these don't need our help, that they'll find a way to survive without the usual support systems. i wouldn't encourage anyone to believe that. there would be far more resistance to the choices made here than depicted. other than that as an entertainment it works well. as an accurate depiction of a culture, not so well, i think.

ramin bahrani sets up a scene early on in chop shop that immediately had me identifying with where the character of ale (alejandro polanco) and his friend were coming from. the two of them get on a subway, and as soon as the doors close they ask if they could have everyone's attention for a moment, and that they are selling candy bars or m&m's or something, and then they proceed to sell some bars. if you (as i) have ever been on a subway in new york city, at any time, this is the kind of situation that happens so often you almost don't notice it. often the people on a subway will see kids like these or minorities selling something or announcing and talking about something on a subway and not pay them any mind. bahrani's focus isn't necessarily just on kids who hock things for sale on subway rides, but on survival and the state of being one is in when in the lower class in america. it is, subsequently in his hands, thoughtful and heartbreaking, usually at once.to compare it to pixote or the bicycle thief isn't too far of a leap (actually in the latter at least the father and son have each other), though bahrani is specific in his intentions in his documentary style. we care about this character ali, no older than eleven and working in a car shop cleaning some cars and helping take apart others, and his sister who comes from out of town to stay with him. but it's not simply because we're force-fed any clich√©s, aside from, you know, a brother and sister (more-so the brother) trying to take care of one another. bahrani makes the story accessible through the simple aspiration ali has, the kind of goal that is possible attainable in his situation: saving up enough to buy a used food truck that ali and isamar can operate themselves.it's all ali is working for, but what bahrani shows us in brutal detail is this work, what ali has to do to make it happen even if its distasteful things like ripping hubcaps off of tires from cars in shea stadium or, at one point, stealing a purse in a desperate moment. this makes it all the more serious an issue when ale sees what his sister does for money on the side at night, doing sexual favors for men in an abandoned truck on the side of the road. he doesn't mention it and pushes it aside, but its always something that adds to the tension, something ale wants to protect his sister from. it adds to the tragedy when ale finds out the real cost of what it will take to make the food truck into a profit-maker, a cost that just further adds to the anguish that he just internalizes.one could look immediately at the fact that ale is an orphan in such a neighborhood as the one in the area of queens the film was shot in- naturally, as with a work of neo-neo realism (lets just call it realism), featuring practically all non-professional actors in the parts of the mechanics and workers and people on the streets- but bahrani is focused more-so on the here and the now, and that is what makes chop shop so immediate and heartfelt. not a trace of melodrama is in the film, barely even music accompaniment aside from the live latino music coming from the cars and radios. sometimes bahrani will focus on a very subtle moment that makes it pronounced in further scenes, like the way ale is awake but acts like he's asleep the first night after he witnesses isamar's late-night tryst, and we see as she slinks into bed she probably knows he's awake but neither can say a word. or, in a lot of other scenes, poetic touches that seem seamless, like when the man shows ale how feeding the pigeons work.it's rough and gritty, as you can expect, and it doesn't give much hope for its main characters despite the few moments of happiness sprinkled about. it's also a superbly shot hand-held film, where the technique, as with a lot of movies made in its urban-set tone and approach, informs and compliment the subjects on screen and what they're doing, but it also is never recklessly shot or too flashy. the filmmaker has a superb 'real-life' cast (ale was plucked from a nyc public school without any experience) and knows how to not waste a shot, while at the same time achieve a brutal artistry with just showing what he shows. it's not city of god or pixote; it's its own little masterpiece on a character or characters we usually would just not give a second look to (or a first one barely) on our way in a city such as new york. if you're not moved by ale and his daily struggles, i don't know what to do for you.

this almost documentary look at an enterprising boy who lives in the body shop area outside of new york is real all the way. real lighting. real sound. less editing in the whole movie than in 1 minute of most movies. and while there is very little script, there is a story. shot in primary colors, almost all red, white, blue and yellow, we get a real sense of the life of a boy who is making something from nothing. he has a place to live that he makes his own, has a good job, and is trying to bring his sister into his little universe. the people in the chop shop area also give us a look at this culture which i didn't know about. they mostly seem decent and pay ale what seems like daily, seeming truly concerned about his well being. the actor (i think) playing ale says more with one facial expression than one can imagine. this reminded me what a true small movie can accomplish. it shows what kids are capable of, even without much support and love. definitely recommend.

chop shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters! i cannot begin to describe how wonderful the performances are in this movie. this film is for anyone who wants to watch a powerful story and see an example of what contemporary movies should look and be like.this film is about a young boy, alejandro "ale" who works and lives with his teenage sister, isamar "izzie" in a one-room tiny loft in an auto shop. the story takes place in a part of new york city (that i did not even know existed--willits points) where there are endless junkyards and body shops. here, bahrani tells the story of two forgotten children hoping to support themselves by buying and fixing up a food van.ale makes money helping at the auto shop, and izzie helps at a food van; both, however, earn extra money on the side. ale sells bootleg movies and stolen car parts; izzie results to selling herself. their lives are surrounded by grit and grim, but even though both witness, live and barely survive within their harsh world, their love for each other is never tainted by the filth that surround them. and occasionally they are able to laugh and enjoy moments of their childhood that is being stolen by the reality of struggling to survive and stay together.the best comparison i have for chop shop is that bahrani's juxtaposition of an innocent love between family members against such a bleak atmosphere is as powerful as pasolini's mama roma combined with the struggles of growing up too fast in an adverse environment just as in bresson's mouchette.having co-written, directed and edited both this film and his first, man push cart (which won awards all over the world), bahrani is a total package filmmaker.i can only hope that his films will not be hidden treasures for long!

chop shop. written and directed by ramin bahrani ( man push cart). bahrani specializes in character driven studies in naturalist style films about the sort of little people that get passed by every day, without anyone ever really noticing they are there, in new york. these are people who have been pushed to the very fringe of society. they exist in a sort of grey world, many of them migrants whose legal status in america is appears somewhat doubtful. where do they come from ? how did they get there ? how do they cope ? where will they end up ? these are not feel good stories as such, but stories about survival at its most basic, day to day level. ale is one such street kid. he has no education and hustles anyway he can, to save money, he is also not beyond turning to petty theft. mostly he is anxious to be reunited with his older sister. we see him in the early scenes ringing a safe house looking for her, but not having any real success. a young friend, carlos gets him a job in a chop shop, in the shadows of shea baseball stadium. eventually his older sister comes to live on site with him, but he is jealous of the motives of her friends and suspicious of how she makes extra money. he dreams of buying a food van and setting up a vending business with his older sister. bahrani shoots all his films on location. there is nothing glossy or glossed over about them. this is life as these people have to live it, in the raw. lt is not pretty although it is never ominous, and the slightly despairing air that hangs over much of the film, is the same one that hangs over these peoples' everyday lives.the script is also very natural and the characters are given plenty of scope and room to work in. polanco is outstanding in the lead role, and gonzalez gives solid support as the older sister.

a friend brought me this movie and at first i was hesitating, the pace in the movie was so slow that it was admittedly boring at the beginning. but the life scenes were attractive, it's like observing than watching. it turned out to be simply stunning throughout the film, the way how the director handled the life scenes to reflect the reality was confounding but somehow also overwhelming. it's like understanding the real life of a lively person than watching a movie. mr alejandro polanco and miss isamar gonzales did their roles so well that it's more like telling us their own stories. indeed they used their real names in the movie.

i watched love life on holiday, when it was filmed at a film festival in florida. it was a lovely surprise to find a british film that wasn't derivative or exploitive. a beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm the pants of audiences prepared to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the film. the transitions between scenes i found a bit distracting, but as whole i think love life is a winner, a ruby in the dust. one for all the family. a pleasant change to see a british film for teen audiences that isn't littered with four letter words. try and see it.

wow! why aren't more british movies like this. great rights of passage money with a big heart and some stand out performances. the comedy is quirky and original and the kid is really great. one to hunt down and watch. look out for it! ten out of ten.

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart. it is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent. nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.

it's just one of those films, you're either love it or hate it, my girlfriend and me loved it, told my brother to rent it and he hated it, said it was too flashy and colloquial, then again he only usually goes to see big action movies, so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed. there were some great new talent (i'd never heard of the leads before anyway)? des brady (the directors brother?) was especially good. playing a right dick at the start i thought he never would redeem himself but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created and by the end i was really routing for him. a very surprising film with a whole lot of heart, if you can live without a body count and explosions then this one is very original. yashimo. brixton in the uk.

there's a unique place in the pantheon of john ford films for wagonmaster, sergeant rutledge, and the sun shines bright. it was these three films with no box office names in them that ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it john wayne, henry fonda, or any of the others he worked with. not surprising that ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. ben johnson and harry carey, jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a mormon wagon train to a valley in arizona territory. along the way they are joined first by a group stranded players from a medicine show and then by a family of outlaws on the run named clegg. their stories merge and what happens is the basis of the film's plot.had wagonmaster been done even 10 years earlier on the strength of the two performances turned in by johnson and carey, both probably would have had substantial careers as b picture cowboys. in the case of johnson it would have been art imitating life. johnson was a real rodeo cowboy and came to hollywood with a string of horses for john ford to use in fort apache. ford was struck by his presence and the rest is history. but the day of the b western was drawing to a close and johnson and carey had great careers as two fine character actors.ward bond plays elder wiggs leader of the mormons. bond is a recent convert though and has trouble remembering to not use some four letter words. but he's the leader because of his strength of character, not his impeccable lds theology. he turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader.in portraying the cleggs, ford only had to reach back four years to his my darling clementine. they are the reincarnation of the clanton gang and pure evil. in fact if walter brennan who after my darling clementine refused to ever work for ford again was willing i could easily see him being cast as shiloh clegg the head of the family. as it was charles kemper did a fine job, this is probably the role he's most noted for. shortly after this film was done, kemper was killed in automobile crash. he might very well have worked for ford in the future.ford makes the mormons pacifists here and i don't recall that pacifism was part of lds doctrine. nevertheless it works here, the whole idea being that these people who carry no weapons are innocents when dealing with evil people like the cleggs. it takes some gun toting cowboys to properly dispose of them. i think that this post world war ii film is trying to say that pacifism isn't always the best policy. another carryover from my darling clementine is alan mowbray playing the same kind of role he did there as head of the medicine show troupe. part of that troupe is joanne dru who's doing another turn as a woman of elastic virtue the same as she did in red river. dru used to do so many westerns that she longed to be out of gingham and into some modern fashions.wagonmaster is great entertainment and i'm willing to wager in the state of utah it's a pretty popular film.

this film blew me away. i thought i knew a little about the attica prison riot. after watching this, i see i knew nothing. the story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate. both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting. the flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. it's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real. it was not only a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in american history. i'm with ebert and roeper. i give it two thumbs up.

the killing yard is a great film, although uneven at times. morris chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate, and the presence of alan alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. the emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's "flashback" scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured. i was not even born when the attica riot took place, however, through extensive research, i find that "the killing yard" does the story all of it's fair justices. i would definitely recommend this film for viewing by any educational or activist group as a much needed learning tool.

usually, alan alda plays characters that are too "soft" and overly verbal -- it's probably how he really lives. this time, he fits the character. though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered.the 1971 attica prison riot and the state of new york's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. only a few journalists have told the true story. this film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the attica riot/revolt. attica had a major impact on this country. maybe the movie will stimulate someone to research the history.i can't remember a feature movie made from the perspective of the prisoners -- though there is a great pbs piece with the actual attica survivors/participants. the perspective of the guards held hostage is explored in "against the wall" with kyle maclachlan, samuel l. jackson, clarence williams iii, and frederic forrest.back in the day, we shouted, "attica! attica!" it was nice to hear it in the movie. brought back memories.the worst part of the movie are the natural wigs morris chestnut and the other african americans must wear. it would have been easy for these people to grow a 'fro.

i really like this show. it has drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one. i am 28 and i am a married mother, so i can identify both with lorelei's and rory's experiences in the show. i have been watching mostly the repeats on the family channel lately, so i am not up-to-date on what is going on now. i think females would like this show more than males, but i know some men out there would enjoy it! i really like that is an hour long and not a half hour, as th hour seems to fly by when i am watching it! give it a chance if you have never seen the show! i think lorelei and luke are my favorite characters on the show though, mainly because of the way they are with one another. how could you not see something was there (or take that long to see it i guess i should say)? happy viewing!

gilmore girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, wit, and charm. at age 16 lorelai gilmore gave birth to rory gilmore. she left her parents house and got a job. now, lorelai and rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. they are best friends. the girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and tv shows, and are constantly quoting them. in the first season, lorelai needs money to send rory to chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents. they are happy to give them the money, but in exchange, rory has to come have dinner with them every friday night. i highly recommend this show. i love it!

i'm not the type of person to watch t.v. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or too dramatic! but this show is perfect. everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. everyone has their own personality and lorelai gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. rory gilmore is a good role model for all girls. she takes pride in wanting to attend harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. she's a loyal friend and always the peace maker. there's subtle romance which is what i like, personally. not the mushy gushy romance that not many people get to have in their lives, but a realistic type of romance. every character eventually gets it, and they don't find their prince charming at first glance and they don't just "fall in love" with every guy that comes their way. it's a realistic show but when you watch it, you better brush up on your movies, pop culture, and random facts because lorelai gilmore is always making references. i fell in love with this show and if you give it a chance, so will you.

gilmore girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows i've ever watched, (second only to my most favorite television show of all time, f*r*i*e*n*d*s). the quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. just some random comments, i recently (finally) began watching season 6 and wow! it's one of my favorite seasons so far. i love the luke-lorelai thing and all the drama in the various episodes is (as always) exhilarating. the only thing i'm not so fond of is the surprising bad attitude and reckless actions rory has suddenly 'adopted'. unfortunately i don't find this very realistic and hope it's not just a way to stir up some more drama to keep the season going strong. all in all great season though and i can't wait for the next!!!~ ashly a.k.a. "tookie clothespin"

hands down, the best drama/comedy show on television. a cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. lorelai gilmore (lauren graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. rory gilmore (alexis bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both. with the help of luke danes(scott patterson) and sookie st.james(melissa mccarthy) and an enormous variety of other hilarious characters, this show easily remains one of my favorites. what really puts the show over the top is the complex yet, incredible and witty writing often using references from pop culture to the mink dynasty.

this show is really great. it's smart.it's funny.it's great acting and writing. this show is really the fastest show i've ever seen. the dialogues are really funny and well acted. lauren graham and alexis bledel have a great chemistry.you really do believe they are mother and daughter. this show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with lorelai and emily. just watch this show i highly recommend it.it's great and definitely the best show on the air. season 7 stars tuesday september 26th, 2006, 8/7c on the new the cw

people need to give this show a chance. the people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes. one needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. all of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. they make mistakes, but they are realistic mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. also, for the most part the acting is superb. lauren graham has been snubbed of an emmy for six years now. someone needs to give this woman the credit she deserves. same goes for kelly bishop who plays emily gilmore so perfectly. also, it's nice to see a show that can have a young girl at the center of it, and not be filled with teen angst. rory is a smart girl, which is also not seen a lot on television today. if only other shows could capture the wholeness of this show...

i have watched this show from the beginning, and i am a 45 year old man. to me, this is so much more that a show that appeals to women. this is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family none the less. it centers around a mother and daughter, lorelei and rory gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. lorelei makes her home in fictional stars hollow, ct, a small new england town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family. the show also throws in the relationship between lorelei and her parents, richard and emily gilmore, old money dar wasp people who do not approve of lorelei's choices in life, though lorelei doesn't care. the relationships story and through line are what makes this show, in my opinion the finest on the wb network (soon to be the cw). watch this show!

when the gilmore girls started in germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique. it was a series and i even did not know someone in it. later on, i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard (a movie, i absolutely adore). i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time. i do not do these things all the time but when i do these things i feel a little bit like a gilmore girl. even my boyfriend started to watch them and that tells something. from season to season it got better with the scripts and the stories. they have a open mind and by being different from every other show, you want to be like them.

this is a really great series. i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet. it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mom and me. ya for gilmore girls. um, i'm running out of lines. but i love how luke and lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they so needed to be together. and i absolutely just love sookie st. james! she is so awesome . and the show wouldn't be anywhere without michel. the whole show is dry humor, sarcasm, and life in a very small town where everyone knows each other....especially the gilmore girls.

wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, lauren graham and alexis bledel! they're simply wonderful! i'm especially a big admirer of lauren graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a "monster" of an actress as well! i'm not saying that alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like lauren better! anyway it's a real delight seeing them on screen, "sparing" with words! in the words of the immortal jim carrey "b-e-a-utiful!"

honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it everyday on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the lorelei's are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it's an hour long which is a major plus because you can't ever get enough gilmore! even in one hour.. emily and richard gilmore are kicks (loralie's parents, rory's grandparents) they're you're average rich parents.. emily president of the dar and richard a well known lawyer and yale alumni st.. rory is following in the footsteps of her grandparents and this could not make them any happier, of course, rory's mother is so very proud of her but her whole life has worked on ultimately defying her parents and rory going to yale did not help her on that journey but believe me, every episode she does get closer ;)

the idea of young girl, who gets pregnant at the age of 16 is nothing new to the drama genre. but it is pretty new if you take a look at the comedy genre. there is this basic plot of lorelai and rory, mother and daughter. lorelai comes from a wealthy background, got pregnant with 16 and ran away from her parents' house at 17. but this series does not start there, it starts when rory is 16 and everything is just about the problems of a single mother, who has terrible problems with her parents and about all those problems you have when you are 16.okay, now again this sounds pretty normal, but there is this little thing called joke. the gilmore girls talk incredibly fast and they make like 60 jokes a minute. even if you don't understand all of the jokes, since they contain hundreds of references to films, music, gossip, history, literature and politics. sometimes you even get confused, but that really is the fun. and not only it is fast, it's smart and wonderfully sarcastic. in addition to that it is not only funny, it has great drama parts in it and you can take some lessons from it even home. which is a thing that does not go for every single tv- series.so watch it! it'll lighten your mood and help you through hard decisions!

this is definitely an excellent show. i don't have cable, so i started renting them, because my friend recommended it. i thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that kind of thing. but it was not. it is surprisingly deep. it is also very witty. it moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. it is a comedy-drama, which is rare when well done. it is about rory and lorelai's relationship. instead of the classic mother-daughter relationship it is a story of the best friend relationship-- about a mother and daughter. the characters are perfectly cast and all do a superb job. it is definitely the best tv show i have very come across.

i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love gilmore girls! i've gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like lorelei. my friends say that i talk and act like lorelei. lorelei and rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it. my vocabulary has widened from watching gilmore girls. lauren graham and alexis bled el are perfect for the parts of lorelei and rory. i think luke and lorelai should get married because chris has left lorelei and rory way too many times. and has broken lorelei's heart too many times too.

it's the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! i just love them!! i watch it every day! i have the episodes from the internet! here in romania is being broadcast the 6 season! i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season. until now, season 5 is my favorite one :d i love it because logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. i have liked dean too, but logan is best. i would like lorelai to remain with christopher, because he is beautiful. this show is good for all ages and is worth to be seen. i really want the dvd's but i think that here in romania will never appear, because i think that they don't even know that they have fans here. but, no matter what, i'll be watching it. bye!!

i didn't catch gilmore girls when it first came out, so still doing some catch-up on the first season. i read through most of the users comments and for the negative ones, i have to ask, what show are you watching??this show is a classic, great lines, characters and good acting. and best of all, not your standard formula show always with an occasional twist to the story. there are probably more women who see themselves reflected in the lorelai/emily relationship then in the lorelai/rory relationship. the people and storylines are not pc but they are real!!if you find the dialogue annoying, i suggest you tape the show, so you can rewatch the parts don't understand.

obsessed!!!!! i have every season of gilmore girls and i think the reason i love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. and its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. i think gilmore girls is one of the bests shows on t.v. shows of its time. its fun because they talk so fast you can't get everything the first time its nice to go back and laugh at the other jokes. also they have so many references its amazing how smart it is.and you can relate to the characters also their so real and there actors are superb from the witty lorelai to the hermit luke to the immature kirk the show is just amazing. i definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and spend sometime with there family this is definitely the show for them. there is only one word that can describe gilmore girls....classic!!!!!!

every time i watch this show i just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. the dialogs, or monologues rather, as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. for example, the episode i watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (i forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the gilmore family dinner into all-out war. and these were just the few seconds or so.so it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content. the scripts they use must be enormous.but then every once in a while something happens. the babbling stops and suddenly there are these wonderful silent, emotional moments. for example, this week it was lorelai's breakdown at the estate agent's. i just thought it was the best piece of tv i have seen for a long while.almost makes everything worthwhile.

i have been hooked on "gg" since midway through 2001-2002 (2nd season), when i tuned in to see "smallville" 10 minutes early. thanks to "beginnings", i now have all but 2 episodes on tape, right up through last night (ep. 4.9). i am a middle-aged straight male, and this is the only weekly tv show i watch. i love this series because: a) lauren graham is a damn fine-looking woman, and funny and smart to boot; b) the dialogue is extremely well-written; c) it is flat-out hilarious, putting overrated garbage like "everybody loves raymond" to shame. many current tv comedies have been heavily influenced by the highly successful and much-despised slime-pit known as "married with children", where the viewer is encouraged to deride and feel superior to the characters. in "gg", the characters have faults, but we can see our own foibles in them, and laugh with them, not at them. this is stimulating tv, where the writers challenge us to keep up with rapid-fire exchanges and out-of-left-field pop-culture/literature/current events references. i get immense pleasure out of watching these episodes over and over again, catching all the one-liners and references to previous episodes. stars hollow is its own little world, one that i will happily continue to visit as long as the series runs.

i absolutely fell in love with this girls. let me tell you something: i am from romania and here is only the sixth series running bunt every other day that is on usa tv i check the internet and download it from there, so i am in line with the rest of the world. i can not believe how deep i am in this show. i become to know absolutely everything about them i looked on the internet what's rory's car what are their middle names and stuff like that: rory is also leigh and lorelay is victoria. i can not understand why but my boyfriend does not like them and i try and try to make him see how wonderful they are but without success, but he does understand me and lets me be with my "obsesion" with the gilmore girls. i adore them. i really hope that if someone see's this will give them a try : you won't regret it

this show is my absolute favorite. this show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. lauren graham is perfect as lorelai gilmore, a single mother who is rory's best friend. alexis bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent rory gilmore and keiko agena is one of a kind as rory's best friend, lane kim. i love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. kelly bishop is wicked great as emily gilmore and edward herrman is terrific as richard gilmore. scott patterson is a joy as luke danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch. the community, miss patty, babette, mrs. kim, taylor doose, kirk and other's are always laugh out loud funny, quirky and interesting that always makes the snappy one-liners stand out. this show has changed so much over the years that it won't ever get old. gilmore girls is an original and clever show that keeps you watching. that is how good it is. i give this show a 10/10 rating.

gilmore girls is my favorite tv show of all times. they only aired the first 2 seasons in india but i've watched the rest on dvd or read it online. it's very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist isn't sneaking around her mother's back but has an open relationship with her. the chemistry between lauren graham and alexis bledel who play lorelai and her daughter rory is really great. all the acting is excellent and the characters, though extremely quirky, are still believable. the residents of stars hollow show all the amusing bizarreness of small town life, which is contrasted by the endless snobbishness and social norms that make up the high society life of lorelai's parents. on one hand there are dance-athons and firelight festival's while on the hand you have cotillions, dar meetings and cocktail parties. all the character's develop a lot and there's a happy ending for more or less everybody. there are dramatic elements but also a lot of very witty humor. rory's boyfriends are all incredibly hot as are her friend lane's. basically it's a cool, funny, very satisfying show which encompasses all the aspects of life and gives you a feeling of -if you work hard enough and wait patiently, you'll get what you want even if it wasn't what you intended.

the gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. sharing everything, trusting each other completely.i like the gilmore girls but i am not sure why. the mother, named lorelai (lauren graham), and the daughter, named rory (short for lorelai, played by alexis bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. there are some funny supporting characters, such as luke (scott patterson). he and lorelai like each, may be even love each other, but neither of them really acts on it. they have their little moments. there are some other supporting characters, most of them very funny, and with their won touching moments.what i like the most i think is to see the relationship between the young mother and the daughter who is becoming an adult. the dialogue between them is quick, sharp, funny and sometimes touching as well. the band they have is beautiful. the gilmore girls makes you feel good so try it.

fuckland is an interesting film. i personally love the dogma movement. i wish it had lasted longer. it seems to have already died. many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. i don't know why. it's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the french new wave. besides fuckland, i've seen the first three in the series, festen, idioterne, and mifune. they were all great, festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. fuckland isn't up to those others. i was just fascinated with the filmmaking. it's played as if it were a real documentary, with a real person who was so obsessed with his camera that he refused to put it down. at a few points in the film, it becomes clear that it is a work of complete fiction, but that illusion was protracted for an amazing amount of time. i wish that the filmmakers would have come up with something a bit more interesting to put onscreen. it is basically about this guy, fabian, who is an argentinian visiting the faulkland islands. argentinians were only in the last couple of months allowed onto the islands, and fabian plans to impregnate the women with argentinian children. he sets his eyes on one, and most of the movie is spent on her seduction. the two actors are very natural. camilla heany only kind of hints that she is an actress. fabian stratas seems completely real. the politics of the film are somewhat confusing to me, since i have only an inkling of the situation surrounding the island and its recent history. i was 3, i think, when the faulklands were invaded. the final bit of the film doesn't work at all. i don't get what the filmmakers were going for there. still, fuckland is an interesting dogma experiment. it does break some dogma rules, though, notably the no extra-diagetic music rule. there is a lot of that. 7/10.

text taken from 2001 melbourne international film fest guide.fuckland the title is a pun based on the film's lead actor fabian stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.fabian is an argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. his master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the delicious camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half argentinians. fuckland creates the illusion of a documentary and maintains a fish-eyed perspective that gives the film a voyeuristic flair and intimacy.

this is a truly great film, with excellent direction. the core plot element, the painting of mila's ass is captivating. i really can't express in words just how much i enjoyed watching mila getting her ass painted repeatedly.connor

the creator of donnie darko brings you a twilight zone themed tale of the oddest fashion. the film centers on a middle aged young couple living paycheck to paycheck in 1976. one day a mysterious box appears with a red button. later on that day a spooky gentleman shows up and tells them that they have the choice to press the button and receive a million dollars but someone they don't know will die. it's a disturbing and provocative question suspensefully outlined in the trailer and tv spots. but let it be known that you just don't know what your in for until you see it. at times pretentious and a bit melodramatic the film is ultimately effective because of it's good performances and intriguing subject matter. it would be unfair to ruin any of the plot twists for you but lets just say the film will deliver on the aspects you expect it to and not completely fulfill others it begins to outline. there's a lot of apparent symbolism and subtext in the film which is both interesting and annoying as it wasn't so evident in his other superior film donnie darko. there isn't too much more to say without ruining the film for you. it's meant to inspire lots of cafe chatter afterwards. however, i'd also like to say it's shot well and has an appropriately aged look to it and it's worth a watch. check it out.

forget about donnie darko. i open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews i have read on the box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to darko. it isn't that i disagree with that necessarily, i just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. there are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. in darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential. in the box, the driving force of the narrative stems from a moral dilemma. believe me when i say that i understand the inclination to compare an innovative filmmakers'movies by looking for trends and patterns, but for me it is more important to approach each new film as a self contained entity first, and then broaden my gaze afterwards. the box is one of those films you get mixed feelings about because it seems to be in some sort of identity crisis. it isn't always sure what it wants to be. the twists are numerous, but easy to follow if not to predict. james marsden and cameron diaz play a relatively believable pair of newlyweds who are in financial straits. a box containing a "button unit" arrives on their doorstep and they are informed by a horribly burned man that if pushed the button will cause the death of one person whom they don't know, and they will receive one million dollars. one of the things the box achieves is to conjure up this invisible fear that somewhere out there our actions have moral consequences. before the button is pushed it has an eerie and seductive quality, alluring yet sinister. once it has been pushed, events are set in motion that make the two leads question their own morality and deeply regret their fateful decision. the notion that the box is an experiment is interesting because for me it provides the movie with a paradox. if there are external beings developing an "altruism coefficient" based on data gathered by couples pushing and not pushing the button, then as the conspiracy unravels, we notice that ultimately it is a forced altruism: be selfless or the species will be wiped out. i suppose the couples don't know the consequences of their actions when they are faced with making the decision, but they have no reason to suspect that the box can do anything, so why would they choose altruistically? is altruism devalued by the fact that we only care about it when presented with a problem in our own lives? the psychological hurdles in this movie are everywhere. push the button or don't, it's likely someone is messing with you. take the money or don't, no one gives anything away for free. search for the truth, the answers you find slowly reveal your demise. i propose that the box is an ironic work because it offers the false choice of free will while revealing that we are trapped in many metaphorical boxes. you can only choose to be free at the expense of another's life, is that freedom? no, it is only another box because then you become trapped in the consequences of your own morality. there is no escape for us because we live on earth and that is another box. this is precisely why the external beings in the film are ultimately antagonists. they demand we conform to moral standards which rob us of our freedom. we made it to mars, and we were burned for it and turned into slaves in a sick game. the references to jean paul sartre illustrate this point rather well. "you can only enter the final chamber free, or not free." sure, but no matter the form in which we enter the chamber, it is a chamber nonetheless. trevor nemeth

i'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but i clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic, unjustified 1-star reviews. this is an interesting story, all of the acting is good to very good (even ms. diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, yet plays it well.) the sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy. it's a fine morality play and there is *no* reason to explain the origin of the god/supernatural being/alien/whatever that's "running the show," so i'm glad the movie doesn't try. it's really irrelevant to the story, which is relatively long but quite compelling and summed up quite satisfyingly in the ending. before you decide this movie is terrible (or really, anything under a ~7.5) read some of the dozens of 1-star "hated it" reviews that are rife with misspellings, lack of punctuation and capitalization, and juvenile criticisms. maybe the trailer was misleading or something -- i didn't see it -- but some of these reviewers were apparently expecting terminator 4 or saw 5 (one reviewer actually compared this movie to saw! how utterly inappropriate and unrelated!) seriously, most of these reviews read like you-tube comments -- according to these "critics" this movie is too confusing yet too predictable, not enough action yet there's too much going on, too smart yet too dumb, explains too much yet leaves too much unexplained... oh -- and it's apparently a "waist (sic) of time." do consider the quality and source of the reviews before taking them to heart. i'm afraid these 1-star kids failed to understand the phrase "altruism coefficient" and were therefore utterly incapable of understanding the movie's premise (despite adamantly claiming that they "get it" right before explaining how confusing it was!) if you know what those two words mean you will have no trouble understanding (and enjoying) this movie.i really wish there were a reviewer reputation system here so i could be sure to ignore the rating of everyone who gave this movie 1 star forever.see it for yourself and enjoy the fine presentation of an interesting couple taking an interesting moral "test" and facing the consequences. it's a good time, in my opinion.

i'm not gonna lie. to say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. and if you've seen cult director richard kelly's previous films, "donnie darko" and "southland tales," you know that's gotta mean something. when i went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. by the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see. i for one could only comprehend roughly 40% of what i saw on- screen, and even then it can only be called interpretation. so why did i give this movie a generous seven stars? because for one, we get some spectacular performances (marsden's great and langella returns as a familiar creepy character), and most importantly two, because it's entirely original and richard kelly, undoubtedly one of the bravest directors alive, uses his creative vision to tell a story that dares to be different. quite frankly, it's the only way - only through kelly's unique style could this story be told the way it's intended.in the end, if you're not willing to spend some serious thought into an intelligent movie (and even then it may all amount to nothing), stay far away from this one. but if you want to watch a deep, rich, complex and thought-provoking piece on spirituality, existentialism, and the predictability of human nature, go see this. be prepared for lengthy discussions with your partner however.*note: if by chance you've read this review, taken my recommendation, have actually seen the movie and still believe you've wasted 2 hours of your life, i'd be happy to share my views on the whole meaning and plot of the film. see, that's why i liked it so much - it promotes discussion! as hard as it is though, i'll try summing it up by paraphrasing a rather depressing quote by langella's character, who explains the significance of the simple box to an employee: "your house is a box which you live in. the car that you drove to work is a box, on wheels. when you return home from work you sit in front of a box with moving images. you watch until the mind and soul rots and the box that is your body deteriorates, when finally you are placed into the ultimate box... to rest under the soil and earth."

the premise is rather original and well thought-of, but unfortunately, siding a good story is very low budget that doesn't even allow for decent special effects. jeff fahey does his best amongst a poor cast, as does the always beautiful linda hoffman. they should make more movies together. the movie, while not worth much praise, warrants at least one viewing.

i wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. it told the story more of robin williams, then mork & mindy. still, thought it was great. we got to see, robin always being 'on', no matter what. the performance of diamontopolous was awesome.the introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. roebuck as garry marshall was wonderful. he was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the williams energy. the little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (happy days, and laverne & shirley), was enlightening. i also thought richmond-peck's harvey was also a nice rock in the pond. (this is a good thing).this movie told the age old story of hollywood folks, going through the ups and downs of stardom. it kept me glued to my tv, and i learned to love robin, well hell, mostly everybody seem to be the super people i sometimes think hollywood is. go figure.i sometimes wonder why the network people are always played to be idiots. we never saw the head of abc. just heard him, like charlie from charlie angels (i wonder if this way planed?). it seems so sad, that a show at number 1, could be so destroy by their own network.i think this story could be told about anyone's life, as they climb the ladder of any job. movie, and tv stars are always loved or hated by so many people, that you grew up with, you just want to reach back in their past, to remember your own past. i remember watching the show, and always wondering what does happen in their personal lives.mork and mindy, will always be part of me, and i got to see part of them. it may not all be the truth, it's also all not a lie, but in the end, it told me a wonderful sad, happy story.

i just want to say that chris diamantopoulos's role as williams for that entire show, was emmy worthy. it was uncanny how well he did. and to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as robin williams really is....wow. there were scenes where diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like robin williams doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. its one thing to do a robin williams impersonation for a couple of minutes. its another to do it for a whole tv movie.i don't know how i felt about the whole show, and i don't know how much they played with the facts, but i do know that it was chris diamantopoulos that kept me watching. so for that, i give him a 10.

great, chris diamantopoulos has got to be the best robim williams that i have every seen.. he acts it up, perfectly. this was like watching robim williams as he really was and is.. it almost made me cry watching him.i had no idea that robin was as close a friend to john belushi as he was. the portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. very sad, what both of them went through.i really felt for both val and robin during his rough times. i am glad that they ended it in a high note!i hope robin puts a $100 bill in this guy's hat !!and it was great that it was filmed in vancouver!

i just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. i liked (not loved) "mork & mindy" as a kid, mostly for robin william's zany energetic performance. this movie made me remember why. was the original show great? not really, but robin certainly was. which brings me to this movie.i was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). but, of course, the real focus was on robin. it was interesting to see robin's journey from struggling street jester to national t.v star, and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife. and my hat is off to star chris diamantopoulos as he portrayed mr. williams with integrity, sensitivity, and heart; not just a cute impression, although it was even dead-on. (on an unrelated note, i noticed that robin's struggles were in some ways similar to andy kaufman, who was under-appreciated by network t.v. and held back creatively, but that's the "taxi" behind the scenes biopic.)all in all, this was a very enjoyable flick, in which i felt i got to know a little more of the man behind the orkan. the acting was solid by all- never melodramatic like i suspected- and the story moved along well. performances that were particularly good were by those who played garry marshall and john belushi (the scene in which belushi heckles robin was a hoot!). not a great masterpiece by any means (i would have liked to have seen a tad more about pam dawber), but definitely watchable, especially for those robin williams and "mork & mindy" fans out there. nanoo, nanoo!

after getting hooked on the mini series, "north & south," i could hardly wait for the continuation, "north & south ii." then years later, along came book iii, "heaven & hell - north & south - book iii." finally, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the maine and hazard families. i was so enraptured by this series that i taped each part off of tv and then managed to get family and friends hooked and i watched it again, each time someone new wanted to see them. my tapes are old and i crave this trilogy on dvd. if you missed book iii, you didn't get full satisfaction and you don't know how it all turned out. do yourself a favor and demand this set on dvd!

this is the best movie i have ever seen. it has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. and a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.the most splendid casting i have ever seen. patrick swayze and james read were top grade in this movie.if you see part 1 you will want to see it all. some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.i am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. any movie that can get children to learn history is great. i have books i, ii & iii and when the girls come up from florida each year they want to see north & south.

north and south is a miniseries from the "golden age" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. it is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although i personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.james read and patrick swayze deliver excellent performances--especially read, whose george hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story. the series also contains top-notch work from kirstie alley, wendy kilbourne, hal holbrook, lewis smith, genie francis, georg stanford brown and others. the costumes, filming, sets and music are all first-rate as well.don't take it as a history lesson, but take it for what it is--a well-made, sweeping epic from a bygone era. book 2, which followed a year later, is also excellent, but i would advise viewers to skip book 3, which came out 8 years after book 2 and was not nearly as good as the first two parts. books 1 and 2 are classics, though, even with their soapier elements, and they are well worth watching.

i really enjoyed north and south very much. i think it is one of the best and most lavish television series i have ever seen. the calibre of the cast is amazing, you have actors from "the golden age of cinema", people like james stewart, gene kelly, elizabeth taylor, robert mitchum and jean simmons with other actors who were the new faces of the 80's like patrick swayze, james read, jonathan frakes, genie francis, philip casnoff and lesley-anne down.at the heart of the story is the friendship of two completely different men,there is orry main (patrick swayze) who is from the south and george hazard (james read) who is from the north. throughout the series, their friendship is continually threatened with the differences in their backgrounds, particularly about the treatment of slaves in the south (especially at orry's plantation) but when each needs the other, they will forget the arguments and go and help their friend. i really liked the chemistry between the two men and was really interested to see if their friendship could survive the war.i liked how the series showed what life was like before the war so the audience could see what were the factors that lead up to the war, what was going on at the time, then the devastation of a nation that was being torn apart and then the nation having to rebuild the country again. the war scenes were very well choreographed and very realistic to me.i think what is great about it, is it has so many elements running through it, romance, history, battles that would interest most of the audience, there is something for everyone. i particularly enjoyed the romance between brett (genie francis) and billy (parker stevenson/john stockwell) especially when she stood up to her sister ashton for the first time. the other romances were interesting as there were not all the same, each had something different to the others which kept me watching particularly the madeline and orry story strand to see if they would be together in the end.it is one of the best american mini series that i have watched, the story had the right balance of romance and the more serious history side that was happening in the country at the time but it is paced just right. the characters are very watchable and the locations are beautiful and the music particularly at the start and end of the episode is so toe-tapping good and works with the mood of the story.

this is one of the century's best tv-series ever with all the great suspense,story,and a cast of absolutely fantastic actors and love and grief that really gets you involved and captivated in front of your tv. if you have seen it once, you will go back to see it again. i have several times and still do it. the 20 th century's best drama.

i first saw this mini-series as a child and though i am a child no longer, i still love it!!! professional copies are hard to find, however, when it's on dvd, it's mine!!! =]great casting, marvellous plots, and plenty of action, romance, and even quite a bit of well-placed comedy. i'm not a historian by nature, but i love this masterpiece of historical fiction!

i have 2 complete sets from time life, this is my favorite movies of all time. love all the actors and actresses.. awsome picture..love patrick swazy..this is the film, that showed his true talent. but yet, he does not get credit for the display he preformed! much credit has been missed in these films.love the way they portrayed the dry and dusty monologs of the civil war..making it into one of the greatest love stories of all time, and showing through all obsticals of life, what true freindship means..how 2 divided countries split.but yet all and all the freindship remained solid, even though the war divided kinships and freindships up.but through it all, till the very end, they remained and taught us the viewer, how true freind ships can still remain till present day! simply the best..gone with the wind doesn't compare to this film.patrick swazy at his best,.after seeing this movie for the one hundred thousand time. i became a big fan of swazy..and have followed his career ever since..have all his movies after he made north and south!

this is a great movie, all 3 were. the last one was not as good as the first 2 but it was made along time after and it was pulling at straws. but you want to watch it cause it tells the end of the story. just not how we might think it should end.these movies made me want to be there to be in all the hardship, love, tears, and laughter that the people in this movie go threw. it is one of the few movies that is good every time you see it no matter how many times that is.there are some parts in the movie that the little kids wont understand and the older ones maynot be old enough to watch. but it is a great movie, spanning over 20+ years.

i agree with with of the messages on here that the book is not like the movie. i read the book as a sophomore in high school in sumter sc. i instantly fell in love with the book and eagerly awaited the release of the mini series. as much as i liked the movie and thought it was very well done, i was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book. i was glad the orry was not killed off like he was in love and war or n&s ii.having grown up in sc and graduating from university of sc, i fell in love with southern history because of this mini series and book. i had the honor of meeting john jakes at a symposium in 1988 at usc. i stayed around afterwards and meet mr.jakes. unfortunately, i did not get to ask him a question. but meeting him was honor enough. i majored in accounting but got my minor in southern studies. in addition, i patterned a lot of my mannerisms after orry main. orry and myself are very much alike. i feel i was born 150 years too late. i am a southern gentleman and very proud of this.well i fell in love with 2 women in the movie....genie francis and wendy kilbourne. man, did i have the hots for wendy!!!! i never quite could find a real life version of her. i hope one day too!!!

north and south (1985): patrick swayze, james read, lesley anne down, wendy kilbourne, terri garber, kirstie alley, genie francis, phillip casnoff, jean simmons, john stockwell, lewis smith, david carradine, inga swenson, jonathan frakes, wendy fulton, erica gimpel, tony frank, jim metzler, olivia cole, andy stahl, william ostrander, george stanford brown, robert mitchum, morgain fairchild, johnny cash, hal holbrook, gene kelly, david ogden stiers, john anderson, lee bergere, olivia de havilland, elizabeth taylor, forest whitaker, robert jones, ....director richard t. heffron, teleplay...paul f. edwards, patricia green, douglas heyes, kathleen a. shelley.based on john jake's successful paperback novels "north and south", "love and war" and "heaven and hell", this was a mini series on television from 1985 to 1987. its success owed more to the success of "roots" a similar civil war era/slavery soap opera televised about a decade earlier in the 70's. patrick swayze, at the beginning of his career and at the time he was doing many films like dirty dancing which would make him famous, stars as orry main, a plantation-born young man from south carolina who sets off to west point. here he meets george hazard (james read) who is supposed to be the hated enemy, the yankee north, but with whom he bonds closely. soon, the mains from the south and the hazards from the north become friends despite the turbulent era leading to civil war. the theme of family, friendship and doing the right thing even when the nation was falling apart is at the heart of this otherwise soap opera full of action and romance. clariss and ashton (jean simmons and teri garber) portray sisters who become enemies when one of them marries yankee billy hazard (john stockwell. garber's bitchy, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and evil ashton is fun to watch on screen. though the series didn't cover everything in jakes' novels, what we see is a condensed version of it and they changed a few things to make it a sort of historical romance with history lessons attached. the characters find themselves in all the major civil war scenes - harper's ferry where abolitionist and feminist virgilia hazard (kirstie alley) loses the love of her life, the ex-slave grady, fort sumter, vicksburg, antietam, gettysburg, appomatox and we are privy to the white house where we see abraham lincoln (hal halbrook) battle out the war in his conscience, we meet all the prominent players including lee, grant, sherman, jackson and davis. several veteran hollywood actors from the golden era - robert mitchum, elizabeth taylor and olivia de havilland have cameos and it's interesting to see them. this is not historical fact, it's historical fiction and purely dramatized entertainment. but it's got cliffhanger endings and beautiful cinematography, costumes and locations. it is like watching an epic movie that runs longer than gone with the wind with with war scenes in it! the script may be bad at times and the acting may not be the best, despite the good casting. swayze hams it up as does terri garber but some performances, like that of kirstie alley, james read (as george hazard)and leslie anne downes as the beautiful and strong madeline are really good performances. they shot in sets and in southern locations.the music is enchanting and this is a feel good film in which we root for the good guys and watch the villains scheme and ultimately get their comeuppance. all fans of civil war movies and the jakes novels should watch this. it's available on dvd and vhs.

this is one of t.v.'s greatest mini-series! it comes to life almost as well as the book did. also the cast was outstanding to play the roles. i'd recommend this movie series for anyone who likes the civil war or the history leading up to it.

even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to dvd was a blessing for all time. north and south truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. i can still remember the first time i caught a glimpse of this series on tv when i was about 8 years old. i though wow this looks exciting. to bad i never had the chance to see book one and two on tv in the netherlands. when book three was broad-casted as a late evening series in the netherlands in the summer of 2004 i just knew i had to see the other two series. to most people book three was a big disappointment as far as i know. well since i have seen book one on dvd, i must say that until now it is the best of the entire 3 books. to all youngsters who just watch the fancy movies like the patriot "oh america for freedom" there is a more realistic view to see for them here.....

this movie is very long, but totally worth splitting up over several nights. it has an all-star cast, and if you are a patrick swayze fan, this will get your heart to throbbing! :-) my mother is a civil war buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it off tv), over several, several nights until we got through the whole thing. we had every line in the movie memorized, lol. pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance. it's a great movie for those that like action, war, blood & guts, but also for those with a soft, romantic side. the clothes the women wore were gorgeous! sometimes i think i was born in the wrong era, lol.

whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. this is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. the story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. the storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie. there are characters you will fall in love with, there are characters you will hate, and you will find yourself emotionally involved.both my wife and i loved it, and we will watch it again in a few years, i'm sure.

having just watched this with my mother (who got it for christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. all of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. the cast is amazing, my personal favourites being james read and lesley-anne down, as george hazard and madeline fabray/lamotte/main. the whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.

perhaps one of the best movies ever made. orry and goerge's friendship runs deep, and the war puts a strain on their strong friendship. as a southerner, i can honestly say this epic is as accurate as it gets. brothers fighting brothers. can you imagine what life must have been living during those times? the best part of the movie, for me, was when the south surrenders; general grant is urging president lincoln to really stick it to the south, he says, "mr. president, a lot of folks want the south to bleed over what they've done..." president lincoln, turns to him and in a very tired voice says, "the south has bled enough...and so have we..." i burst into tears, and take a deep breath. what a president! it's like a father saying his son has been punished enough, and despite his anger he realizes his point has been made. this war was a very dark time for our young country, and it had to be fought. president lincoln knew this. i'm urging everyone who reads this to watch this movie, and add it to your dvd collection. then, thank god that our country was preserved. as jesus said, a "house divided against itself cannot stand."

for me, north and south (books i&ii) is the ultimate tv series of the 80's. just spotting all those cameo appearances was highly entertaining.gene kelly, james stewart, elisabeth taylor, olivia de havilland, robert mitchum, even johny cash¬° no series has come close to this achievement.have you ever seen anyone looking like lincoln? dick smith's prosthetics made hal holbrock's powerful performance even more so. the crafted costumes, the jaw dropping locations, everything. it's clear that nowadays there are excellent and bright tv series (desperate housewives, lost,24) but north & south was, and still is, one of its kind. don't miss it. only david carradine's portrayal of the ultimate villain (you may call him just violent husband) worths the viewing. maybe some characters and situations are too stereotyped, i admit it but the positive sides clearly cast a shadow over them. i'm so glad that finally is available on dvd in spain.

this comment discusses "north and south book i" dealing with 1842-1861 periodthe 19th century history of the usa is mostly identified by people with the civil war (1861-1865). this is a reasonable opinion because that was civil war which put the union under the severe test; that was the civil war which made americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. from the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen. d.w. griffith, in the early 1900s, made his unforgettable birth of a nation. yet, the most famous film about the north-south clash is still, i suppose, gone with the wind (1938). unfortunately, fewer people know the magnificent tv series based on john jakes' novel, "north and south." it is the very best tv series ever made and the time spent on watching it is really precious. i taped it on my video from polish tv many years ago and have come back to it with great pleasure many times since then. why? firstly, the entire story is deeply rooted in historical reality. the two families, the maines from south carolina and the hazards from pennsylvania, represent two entirely different ways of life. in spite of that, friendship unites them. yet, what they experience is the struggle all people do: friendship attacked by "truth" of "political correctness", love attacked by hatred of "legal spouses", gentleness by strength of "social heroes". orry maine (patrick swayze) is my beloved character - someone who finds love and who is quickly deprived of her; someone who cares for friends but political fanatics step in the way and ruin much. finally, he is someone who can see the tragic future for his land but there is nothing he can do about the south's inescapable fate. his friend, george hazard, is similar in most aspects but sometimes he appears to have a stronger character. it is him who shows orry that although there are tragedies, he must get up from despair and live since life is the most precious thing we have. although they represent two different lifestyles, their friendship occurs to be stronger than any prejudice, politics or conflicts.other characters are also particularly well developed. there are villains, like justin lamotte or salem jones who are really wicked but most of the people are ambiguous as the nature of humanity has always been. charles maine is, at first, full of rebellion, prone to fighting, later, however, he learns to be a true southern gentleman for whom southern pride is not courageous words but foremost courageous deeds. virgilia hazard represents the most fanatical side of abolitionist movement striving to condemn slavery and punish the owners of "black breeding farms." her marriage with grady appears to be a symbol of equality but also a symbol of saying "no" to the politics of the south. two interesting characters are orry's sisters, brett and ashton - sisters in whose veins runs entirely opposite blood. brett, in her gentleness but also naiveness, believes in absolute fidelity. she marries billy, even though he is a northerner, because she truly loves him. brett is the representation of all that is precious in any young woman. ashton, however, is a vamp, a tigress, a woman who does not hesitate to do the most wicked things. the clear picture of their world views clash is their chat about men and family...unforgettable moment and how universal! most characters head for their values...yet, war breaks out and they'll have to put aside a lot...secondly, the performances... someone said that not all people act naturally. i wouldn't say that. i'd rather say that all cast do very good jobs in their parts from the main characters who are portrayed by younger staff to the guests that consist of famous stars, including liz taylor, robert mitchum and others. patrick swayze as orry does a great job. i consider this role one of his best ones. lesley anne down as madeleine is also very memorable. her part, perhaps, entails too much suffering but she manages to express all sorts of feelings really well. kirstie alley is very appealing and truly memorable as the abolitionist virgilia hazard. phillip casnoff is worth consideration as horribly ambitious elkanah bent as well as david carradine as a monster husband, disgusting justin lamotte. and, in contrast to him, a mention must be made of jean simmons who is truly excellent as orry's mother whose heart beats for the glory of family life and concord of union. thirdly, memorable moments of "north and south" leave an unfading trace in one's mind. who can forget the first meeting of orry and madeleine - what charm, what gentleness there is in this scene! or is it possible to skip the moment when madeleine's father dies? i found it really powerful, there is a real drama in this moment, a drama of a woman being left by someone who really loved her. i also liked churubusco sequence and george hazard so worried about the life of his dearest friend, orry. then his meetings with constance are terrific. virgilia's speech in philadelphia is a masterpiece of performance. and the final moment of the first part: although north and south may separate, their friendship will never die. orry and george symbolically join hands as the train moves on. simply, there are so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it's impossible to mention even half of them here. and these gorgeous tunes by bill conti and shot in brilliant landscapes. the music in "north and south" is very touching and memorable.what to say in the end? "north and south" is a real must have on dvd, simply an amazing tv series about the victory of all that is precious in us: love, friendship, loyalty, honor, truthfulness, absolute fidelity. 9/10

sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances ¬ñ though some folks are channeling rhett, scarlett, melanie and even lady macbeth. patrick swayze and james read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. splendid villains ¬ñ you'll want them all to come to a very bad end. lots of strong female characters in this one ¬ñ both good and bad. secondary story lines also are well developed. several cameos by major stars of past eras. good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics. curl up on a rainy day with your dvd or vhs player and drink of choice with this one. a lap rug and a cat would be optional.

this has to be one of my 3 favorite episodes from the original tv series.what makes it great is the battle of wits between the romulan commander and kirk, as well as the top-notch acting from mark lenard, who later went on to play spock's father in other tv episodes and movies. this is a case where those around rose to the level of the talent around them, and shatner, nimoy, and the whole cast deliver an outstanding performance in this episode.the writing and plot are also excellent, and i love the direct approach used to show us the characters, and the feelings and thoughts of those characters, and how freely they are expressed by the actors. this very entertaining episode ranks 10 out of 10. awesome!! desert-buddha

when the romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. as any familiar with this episode know, it is a redux of the war film "the enemy below" from the fifties. the obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an american destroyer & german u-boat) engaged in lethal war games, it is two starships in outer space. in trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, earth fought the romulan wars. after about 5 years of conflict, a stalemate brought about a treaty and the institution of the neutral zone, a boundary between us and the romulan empire. now, on this stardate, the treaty appears to be broken, as our outposts are being attacked and destroyed by some weapon of immense power. yes, the romulans are back, testing their new war toy, and kirk must now earn his pay: he must make decisions that would affect this sector of the galaxy, such as figuring out how to avoid a...oh, i dunno - an interstellar war, maybe? i think what makes this episode so effective is that it doesn't shy away from the grim aspects of war, as one would expect of a mere tv episode from the sixties - especially an episode from a science fiction show. it's all very tense and gripping, like the best war films, such as when kirk sits down with his key officers for what amounts to a war council. the writers and the actors aren't kidding around here: this is all preparation for a ghastly conflict, potentially the beginning of another years-long battleground. in the final analysis, kirk's aim is to keep this battleground to just the two ships - but even then it's an endeavor fraught with peril and probable casualties. in fact, i believe this episode holds the record for ship casualties by the end of it. right at the start of the episode, we see the devastation such battle can produce, in that supposedly well-protected outpost. then begin the cat-and-mouse war games between the enterprise and the romulan ship - it's as exciting as any conflict we've seen on the big screen. of course, if you're not into war films, you'd have to look for other things to admire in this episode.what elevates this episode even further is the revelation of just what and who the romulans are - it's an electric shock of a sort. now we have even further inter-crew conflict on the bridge of the enterprise - war does tend to bring out the worst in some people. due to still nasty attitudes about race in this future, the tension is ratcheted up even further - kirk has his hands full in this one. i suppose the one weakness in the story is the convenient relenting of the bigotry issue by the conclusion. on the romulan side, actor lenard makes his first appearance in the trek universe as the romulan commander; he's terrific in the role, the flip side of capt. kirk or capt. pike, take your pick, done up to resemble spock more than a little. surprisingly, his character is not war hungry as we would expect, another eye-opener for this episode. the actor would next return to this universe as sarek, spock's father, so he's nothing if not versatile. it's also telling how the first appearance of such characters as the romulans is usually their best shot, as it is here. they showed up in "the enterprise incident" next.

"balance of terror" is still one of the best star trek episodes ever made. it was inspired by the film "enemy below" (starring robert mitchum), a movie that deals with a cat-and-mouse game between two captains during world war ii. in this episode, captain kirk and his crew play similar game with a romulan vessel. this is the program that famously introduces the war-hungry romulans, who are distant relatives of the vulcans. it is an incredibly suspenseful episode, tightly constructed for maximum effect. it is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra layers of meaning to the story. mark lenard makes his star trek debut as the romulan captain (he will later play spock's father ambassador sarek). a must-see episode!

my favorite show of all time! yeah, i thought this was so cool, and larisa oleynik was the first crush i ever had (aaaawwwwww). it was well written, funny-except when it it wanted to be serious, and just a great show overall. but since we couldn't afford to keep nick, i couldn't see any episodes after feb. 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than i should. to me it's more the epidemy (now that doesn't look spelled right!) of having to say "goodbye" to someone that you love, and know you'll never see them again. and i still think that, because as far as i know, there are no plans to release this on dvd any time soon...yeah, life is mean! i've found that out for sure (though you can find an odd episode every here or there...but i never liked the bootleg copies of things much either).so enough of my sad life:(....most kids in 7th grade don't need powers like alex gets to get them through life (unrealistic--for sure) but then again, how many towns have a super-evil chemical plants that is willing to do anything for "progress at any cost"? gee this show was fun to watch! though i'd agree the diaglouge is a bit over developed (and even a little politically correct sometimes). my favorite parts were when the kids would have some reason to break into the plant (a video tape or something like that) like a kid's version of "tom clancy's rainbow six" (which years later i got hooked on that game series for probably the same reason) almost! then you've got the plant's "security" team who are trying desperately to find the "kid from the accident"...very mean dudes (at least when i first watched the show...they seem more sympathetic to me now). i feel rather sad for larisa oleynik, not sure if she minds this role type-casting her.....but it's what i'll always remember her by.oh and btw, the actor that plays aaron peirce from "24" is on here too as a school coach or something....too cool! maybe he can get the producers of that show to get larisa in next season of "24". i only bring it up 'cuz jack bauer is my other tv hero and i'd just love to see cross-over things, lol:). both are set in california, so i'll just keep on dream'n...i can see it now, "let me alone with that suspect for a few minutes....no, i don't need a car battery!"

i used to watch this show when i was growing up. when i think about it, i remember it pretty well. if you ask me, it was a pretty good show. anytime i think about it, i don't remember the opening sequence and theme song very well. in addition to that, everyone was ideally cast. also, the writing was very strong. the performances were top-grade, too. i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though i'm not sure if i've seen every episode. now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.

this film is an impressionistic, poetic take on the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating. these are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to america in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, that poor, illiterate sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the united states. they have some fantastic, unrealistic notions about the united states which are disseminated on the trip over. one is that the rivers run with milk, an image which is depicted in the movie to poetic, impressionistic effect. the film is devoid of sound and the silence seems to reflect the uneasiness of the ignorance the locals have about life in america, or if not ignorance of it, a vision significantly colored with superstition and fantasy. that said, the movie depicts with jolting realism, the boat ride to the united states and the intake process which arrivals at ellis island had to undergo. the boat ride is imagined as rather dull which surely it was much of the time. the quarters in which the incoming residents sleep is depicted as extremely crowded with beds spaced four or five inches from one another and lacking much light, which it was surely the case below deck. again, the film is not supplemented with undue music or excessively bright lighting and the effect is to create a fairly realistic imagining of what it was truly like for people emigrating to the united states. the villagers may not be worldly, but they are quite reasonable, and the interaction with the eldest of the emigrants, fortunata (aurora quattrocchi) with the immigration officer who insists on particular results, are quite bittersweet inasmuch as they are not diluted or softened for the benefit of a syrupy conclusion and one sees the melding of the realism of sicily with the extensive regulations which guide life in the united states.the immigrants and their story are very interesting and the combination of cold-eyed realism and the magical fantasy of peoples' imaginations make for a persuasive vision of the beliefs held by sicilians, or any people, with little formal education moving to the united states. the acting is similarly barebones; it is not at all demonstrative or showy, but seems the more realistic for it. that said, all the main performers, in particular salvatore mancuso (vincenzo amato), the clear leader of the group is excellent. while never smiling, his character's actions speak much louder and it is clear that (thankfully) the other members of the group, his two sons and the above mentioned elder fortunata, the boys' grandmother, have faith in his leadership abilities and respect his clear leadership. amato imbues his character with great decency and forthrightness and it is a testament to his abilities that his character appears so capable and confident while his character betrays very little emotion. one oddness of the film is a chance encounter with a mysterious englishwoman (the excellent and fittingly mysterious charlotte gainsbourg) who speaks italian and, during the entire film, we wonder why she is going to the united states or what connection she has to the otherwise unanimously sicilian emigrant group. at the end, this is finally revealed and the revelation is done typically realistically and does not seem particularly melodramatic or showy. the film is directed by emmanuel crialese who has a firm grasp on the realistic, if sometimes superstitious world view his characters inhabit and presents it competently and confidently. it is in fact fantastically confident given how awkwardly the realism and superstition might have combined in the film. it is a worthy examination of the immigrant experience.

i just had the opportunity to see 'nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the u.s. as 'the golden door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from sicially to the u.s. in the early days of the 20th century. it also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of homeland security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land. the (mostly) italian cast, with a few exceptions works well. this is a quiet,understated film that is lovely to look at (the occasional,but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure),while the screenplay is well written. this is a film for those who are sick & tired of mindless escapism from hollywood that serves little more than to sell popcorn (not that i have any burning issues with popcorn,mind you!---i actually love the stuff). you would do wise to seek out nuovomondo/the golden door (or whatever it's being titled in your area).

the golden door (nuovomondo) is for this viewer the finest film of the year to date. it is a masterpiece of concept, writing, directing, acting and cinematography. more importantly, this radiantly beautiful film is a much needed reflective mirror for us to view the history of immigration of 'foreigners' into america at a time when the very mention of the word 'borders' is a political fuse. writer/director emanuele crialese has given us not only a deeply moving story, he has also provided a touchstone for viewers to re-visit the history of each of our origins: with the exception of the native americans, we all entered america as 'foreigners' at some point in our histories, and it is humbling to view this film with that fact in mind.the film opens in turn of the century sicily as poverty stricken widower salvatore mancuso (vincenzo amato) and his brother angelo (francesco casisa) climb a rocky hill to present their tokens to the cross to ask for a sign as to whether they should continue to struggle for existence on the island or go to america, the land of dreams. mancuso's deaf mute son pietro (filippo pucillo) runs to the top of the hill with postcards he has found with images of america (money growing on trees, fruits and vegetables larger than people, etc), and salvatore accepts this as the sign that he should move his family to america. after convincing his reluctant mother fortunata (aurora quattrocchi) and his sisters rita (federica de cola) and rosa (isabella ragonese) to make the trip, he sells his only possessions (two donkeys, goats, and rabbits) and the man with the boat arranges their trip, giving the family shoes, appropriate clothing, and instructions to board an ocean liner as third class passengers. as the mancuso family prepares to board they are asked for a photograph, and as they pose behind a painted set, an englishwoman lucy/luce (charlotte gainsbourg) walks into the photo as though she were part of this peasant family. lucy cannot board the boat for america without male escort.the voyage begins and luce in her gentle way identifies with the mancuso family, finally solidifying her safe passage by proposing to salvatore to marry her 'for convenience, not for love' when they arrive in america. through a violent storm and living conditions that are appalling poor, the multitude of third class passengers survive, bond, and eventually arrive at ellis island, believing their dream of america has been fulfilled. but everyone must pass harsh physical tests, de-lousing, and even intelligence testing to determine if they can enter america: the officials let them know that america does not want genetically inferior people entering the new world! each woman must be selected by a man to marry on ellis island before they are allowed admission. the manner in which the mancuso family remains united until a somewhat surprising ending is the closing of the tale.few of us understand the strict rules and harsh treatment immigrants face (or at least faced at the turn of the century) on ellis island, and if we do we have elected to submerge that information. the golden door presents the case for immigrants' struggles in a manner that not only touches our hearts but also challenges our acceptance of current immigration legislation. but all political issues aside, the golden door is first and foremost a film of enormous beauty, exquisite photography, deeply felt performances by a huge cast, and a very sensitively written and directed story. the is a film that deserves wide distribution, a movie that is a must see for everyone. highly recommended. grady harp

this is christmas time! a nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the italian cinema. it was something like 30-40 years that the italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. this is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. and finally this is also a big production for italian standards of the time. in this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition. real poetry, real humor, real tenderness, real drama, real beauty. no rhetoric, no easy surreal shortcuts, no typical touristic tornatore-like picturing, no over acting, no director autoreferentialism. there is also a cool use of two heartbreaking nina simone's songs, whose music, i reckon has never been used in a proper way for a score. so if this will not be a real reviveing for the italian cinema it is an extraordinary evolution for emanuele crialese after his 'respiro' another definitive beautiful film. 'nuovomondo' is not to be missed, it is that kind of 'medicine film' helpful to enjoy movie-making, movie watching, helpful to enjoy and understand life. francesco cabras

enhanced by the expressive cinematography of agnes godard (beau travail), golden door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in sicily to ellis island in new york at the turn of the century. it is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by emanuele crialese (respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents. crialese's "magical, mystery tour" came about as a result of his visit to the museum on ellis island, the looks on the faces of the immigrants depicted in photographs he saw, and his research into the harsh policies and procedures used during the admission of immigrants.guided by letters he read of immigrants sent to relatives who remained at home, crialese identifies with those impoverished immigrants who were able to see the positive side of things beyond their ordeal. to salvatore mancuso (vincenzo amato) and his older son angelo (francesco casisa), america is a distant dream that they know nothing about. after climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the saints for a sign, they are rewarded when they are shown post cards by salvatore's younger son, pietro (filippo pucillo), a deaf mute, that depict the new world as a land where they can bathe in rivers of milk, sit under a money tree, or harvest giant onions and carrots.after disposing of their animals in exchange for shoes and suits, salvatore, his two sons, and his elderly mother fortunata (aurora quattrocchi) set out on their adventure with more hope than trepidation but the equation soon shifts the other way. as they board the boat and settle into their crowded third-class steerage compartments, the most-talked about scene in the film takes place. using an overhead camera that shows masses of people standing, as the ship pulls away, the frame is divided into those aboard the ship and those waving goodbye from the dock and the way they are separated implies they are being torn asunder from everything familiar.aboard the ship is a mysterious english woman named lucy (charlotte gainsbourg). crialese does not reveal her past or the reason she is traveling to america but she seems to stand for the onset of the modern world they are entering. though they eye each other cautiously, lucy becomes interested in salvatore and asks him to marry her in order to allow her to enter the country. the voyage is treacherous with a violent storm buffeting the ship. shot in almost complete darkness, passengers in steerage are tossed against the side of the boat and, afterward, bodies lie tangled and twisted on the floor as if in a macabre totentanz. the rite of passage through immigration processing at ellis island does not become any easier and crialese attacks the way illiterate peasants, in the name of preserving "civilized" society, are forced to put puzzles together, perform mathematical tasks, and undergo humiliating medical examinations to prove they are "fit".a marriage brokering ceremony feels like an auction block and the young women look despondent when they are matched with overweight middle-aged men. this is the only way they can enter the "golden door", however, since single women are rejected unless they have partners, ostensibly to prevent the threat of prostitution. through the fog the immigrant's can barely see the land of milk and honey and there is no statue of liberty asking for the tired and the poor, the humbled masses yearning to breathe free. in their imagination, however, the river is still flowing, waiting for them to jump in. though the ending is ambiguous and one door opens on to a blank wall, another door symbolizes a rebirth of the soul and the passage we must all take from the old world to the new.

emanuele crialese did a fantastic job with one of those films that linger in the back of your mind for years. it was respiro (see comments and synopsis here in imdb).now, carrying the magnificent young talents he had for the first time on screen then, he takes the audience into a dark void. a literal plunge into dangerous waters. the subject is migration. in this case, from italy to the new world (the name of the film). a big deal calling it for its american release "the golden door".the story of a family that leaves everything and risks the rest -that is, their lives, for a dream.i hate to spoil the show telling the story, so i'll dwell a bit in the work crialese and all his team did so brilliantly.first of all, choosing to stick to what he knows: direct sound as much as possible. this means, the whole film. the textures, the pain, the nuances of reality are always mingled with the smells, the heat or the cold, the sweat and the blood, life and death, as vibrantly as it is in real life.the squeaks of bent metal and grinding wood, the infamous drone of the wind and the ominous sounds of big engines and ship horns are among the points that make this film so involving.cinematography is in the hands of a french couturier. the symbolism of light is present from the very first shot (again, almost the very first shot from respiro) and pervades throughout the film with intimacy and a terrible sense of desperation. the subdued tones and the very gray and grim depictions of people suffering the cramped and filthy boat they sail to hope is mesmerising.light is used sparsely, almost to discover every character in the dark. the beauty of every shot, and every scene is accentuated by the period costumes and the perfectly selected physical features of the actors.again, as he usually does, vincenzo amato is definitely on his own. he plays the father of two sons (the same actors who were fifteen and twelve and now are nineteen and sixteen) with all the power he always conveys to his very complex characters.charlotte gainsbourg is so-so. i guess she's never achieved again the perfection she reached in the cement garden and in her very first film: l'effront√©e.maybe it's just that she seems a bit awkward in her role.the locations and sets are harsh and compelling, almost playing a character on their own.maybe the most remarkable character is the one played by filippo pucillo, the mute younger son. the contrast here with his first role is complete. then, he played a supercharged kid that was as relentless as anything around him. now, his character is all expression. and just that: no words at all. his eyes tell the whole story with sublime power.maybe this is one of those films that will not be very well received in the states. it's absolutely italian in everything. it's so italian that most of the time, the language is one of the many dialects that is much older than italian itself. in the usa this film may be a bit too much for americans because of the subject. but anyone who remembers the story of their families when they arrived in the states, will see this films with awe.and, again, the minimalism that goes hand in hand with crialese's ideas is back with a closing scene in the water. only this time it goes from underwater photography to aerial.all in all, another great and very well told story from this filmmaker that only this year (2006) has collected 6 prizes and was nominated for the golden lion. not a small deed!

i never thought i'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning kenji miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, i'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the galactic railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--miyazawa wrote a children's book called night on the galactic railroad). however, this glimpse inside the mind of a writer who "sketched poetry and fairy tales from his imagination" is very intelligent, creative, entertaining, and emotionally powerful.all this despite the fact that everyone is animated as animals (like in many of miyazawa's stories).some of the visuals are truly astounding, especially considering that it was a made for tv movie. seriously, some of them (like the sequence with birds trailing blue light) rival parts of fantasia. however, i still can't stand computer animation when it is mixed with cel animation. the cgi trains are horribly obvious--even more so than the anastasia train.8/10

spirit and chaos is an artistic biopic of miyazawa kenji, a japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. the film captures and interprets his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination.the film integrated excerpts of miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. his relationships with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom. miyazawa's selfless compassion for the farmers in his village, his sister and other unfortunate people can serve as a lesson to us all. furthermore, miyazawa's devotion to science was also nicely portrayed. in a time when western ideas were still met with skepticism, especially in provincial towns like the one where miyazawa grew up, he understands its usefulness in helping his fellow villagers and is inspired by its elegance. the way the film presented moments of artistic passion and disappointment in the writer were truly intense and well interpreted.i felt that the cgi integrated into the film, while groundbreaking an innovative, clashed with the more organic animation. it could be argued that this was intentional to represent conflict within the main character, but i found it rather unaesthetic. i also wish that the film had discussed miyazawa's buddhist influence, but it worked fine without it. i though this film was very well done. i give it a 9/10, with the one point being deducted for the cgi. otherwise the animation, plot and dialog were all wonderful and heartfelt. i haven't seen any other films by kawamori shoji, but after seeing this one i will be sure to give them a chance.

i've commented once on this chucky great, but i had to do it again to say some things about the film, when i first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. the film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because i cherish chucky. the other horror villains are referenced with great coolness!!! and the gore was shockingly great! the scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful! that was a great gore scene!!!!! and the ending was so bizarre and shocking it made me s*%@ my pants. the idea of having the seed of chucky was very, very bizarre and shocking! when i left the theater i just loved it and i could'nt believe it was real. the bizarre and different qualities of this child's play installment for some reason made me mark it as the jason goes to hell of the child's play series. it just had that intensely shocking, bizarre and different quality that reminded me of jason goes to hell. a sure ***** out of *****. here's how i rank the series : 1,4,2,3. i loved it but not quite as much as tom holland's original child's play classic. i can't wait for seed of chucky! bring it on!

the movie doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)!this film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. it knows it sucks, and because of that, it's far and away the best of the "child's play" series. it plays up the "stoopid humor" angle so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing at it, but with it. and, trust me, the whole time you're laughing, it's laughing back atcha.

i would say 'bride of chucky' is a "return to greatness" but the series was never really great. very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and i think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. and it contains the best subtitle/tagline: "chucky gets lucky." so he does, in the role of jennifer tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as jeri ryan did for 'star trek: voyager.' tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for chucky. and as much as i liked her in the feature, she can't get all the credit: the props (watch the first 1-2 minutes for horror-homages), the writing, the inside jokes (again, the opening + pinhead) and chucky lines were great ("in fact, if (this) were a movie, it would take 3-4 sequels just to do it justice," among others.) mercifully, chucky and the series has given up on andy the "hide the soul" quest, and just settled for a new way out of his body. he teams up with his ex (tilly) whom he transfers into a "bride" doll and a couple of bonnie & clyde teens (really, heigl?) to regain this pendant buried with chucky's human corpse. this is for any chucky fan, 1980s slasher-horror fans or even to those who's never seen any of the previous 'child's play' films. it's funny, dark, harmless, gory ¬ñ but not over the top and despite tilly's literal 20 minutes of screen time, it's always great to see her. after all, you barely see her play poker anymore. (side note: of course, i picked up on the superman reference ¬ñ hackensack, nj.)

sexy murderess tiffany (jennifer tilly) still yearns for a life of wedded bliss with ex-boyfriend, crazed killer charles 'chucky' lee ray. after getting her hands on the mutilated good guy doll that last played host to his spirit, and doing a spot of repair work, she conducts a satanic ritual that returns his life to the toy.unfortunately for poor tiff, the reanimated maniac shows no interest in marriage, and so she traps him in a cage, with a bride doll for company. eventually, a rather angry chucky (voiced by brad dourif) escapes his confines, electrocutes tiffany in the bath, and traps her soul in his 'bride' as retribution.realising that they are now both in the same predicament, the plastic pair put their differences aside and decide to head for hackensack, new jersey, where they can lay their hands on the magical amulet that can relocate their spirits into human hosts. tricking trailer park hunk jesse (nick stabile) and his tasty girlfriend jade (katherine heigl) into taking them to their destination, the psycho dolls embark on a murderous rampage, with their unwitting companions copping the blame.although the idea of a kid's doll being possessed by the spirit of a mass murderer has always been rather comical, it wasn't until the fourth film in the child's play series that the makers fully embraced the sheer lunacy of the premise, opting to plays things much more for laughs than for scares (although there is still plenty of ott splatter for us gore-hounds to enjoy).talented hong kong director ronny yu oversees proceedings, deftly translating the witty tongue-in-cheek script into a slick and thoroughly enjoyable cinematic ride. similarly, the excellent cast handle the camp material perfectly, with stabile and heigl making a likable couple, but smoking hot tilly stealing the show as blonde, buxom, pouting, pvc-mini-skirted temptress tiffany. kevin yagher's impressively expressive doll effects also go a long way to making the film such a success.overall, this film is unlikely to find many fans amongst 'serious' horror aficionados, but those who enjoy the odd spot of mindless popcorn entertainment, full of twisted, black humour, crazy death scenes, and magnificent cleavages should have a blast.

now this is the sort of film we used to get weekly . now-a-days it is rare to see a drama that depends on the cast talking to each other.there are no explosions, car chases or any chases,there are implied sexual situations.this is not film for the younger crowd, it is for those that appreciate people talking to each other,they do argue a lot as we have married couple having mid life problems.emily watson & tom wilkinson are seemingly a very happy middle aged loving man & wife. now living in this same small london suburb, handsome, rupert everett returns home to visit his wealthy father.he of course meets emily watson, it would be easy for anyone to be smitten by emily. i say no more, except that as the credits begin there is a fatal accident,the rest of the film is about the repercussions of this accident & all the lies the various characters tell..the acting by this trio & the others is excellent.julien fellows wrote the screenplay based on a novel by nigel balchin. he also directed, this was his first directorial attempt & he did very well. the entire production is first rate.the film had a few month theatrical run in late 2005, is under 80 theatres. this to me is a shame, stupid comedies open on at least 2000 screens but real good drams as this & many others open in only a few.by the way there are some very funny lines regarding certain situations.ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) imdb 9 (out of 10)

this film stands as one of the most amazing examples of compelling and artful film-making i've every seen. herzog seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of dieter's story, as well as his endearing personal character. by the end of the film, i was left wishing that i'd had the opportunity to meet dieter before his passing.on a technical note, the cinematography is intimate and astoundingly beautiful. the narrative is intricately woven, with great awareness of the subject and his capacity for reliving and reenacting traumatic events. few documentary directors have so strong an ability to so thoroughly invest the audience in the character. this film is a must see!!!

we see at the beginning of little dieter needs to fly dieter dengler, the subject of the film, an obsessive-compulsive. or at least that's what he seems to be by way of constantly opening/closing doors and with his large stock-pile of food in the cellar. in a way director werner herzog sets up a central question, in a manner of speaking, to why dieter is like this. well, in fact, he's not necessarily obsessive-compulsive as he is just, well, prepared. and why shouldn't he be after the life he's lived? aside from the juiciest, most dark and exhilarating and frightening and just downright haunting story of survival that's the core of the picture, the back-story to dieter is fascinating too. dieter's own childhood, for example, was already a slog from the start, being in post-war germnay, poor in a family without much food or prospects, eating wallpaper for "the blue in the walls". but enter in a passion, an un-yielding desire (which, of course, is part of herzog's bread & butter and love of man in his films), which is flying, and for dieter there was nothing else but to fulfill this. what it ends up leading to, after becoming an american citizen, is more than he could've bargained for.dieter is one of herzog's most compelling, quirky, and compassionately observed figures in his whole career, a man who's memory is scarred by brutal memories of his time being a vietnam pow, though at the least it provides for some of the most compelling storytelling in any documentary of the last 20 years. ironically, the storytelling comes through- unlike in the wild blue yonder- mostly in lots and lots of exposition from dieter on some of the most minute details of his time in the different prison camps (the torture tactics, the bugs, the brutal, wretched violence and threats like with the wedding ring tale), and leading into the most interesting and sad portions with his best friend duane. they escaped the prisons together, but found that their journey to reach cambodia would not be so easy. now, through most of this, the talking does something that is enthralling, which is that as dieter goes through his stories and occasionally does re-enactments (in fashion herzog could only do, with dieter already middle-aged being led in handcuffs et all through the jungle), one can picture all of this in the mind. it all becomes even more vivid to try and get these little details and the intensity of it all together into a form of reality. that herzog keeps these portions simple, and knows when to hold dieter back in his answers, makes him all the more a key figure of interest. he's not ever totally 'normal', but unlike a timothy treadwell, you wont think ever really about laughing at him either.so, along with his hero (whether of war or not is hard to say, as dieter disputes that claim as saying the ones who died were the real heroes, typical but perhaps quite true), herzog stylizes his film with a mix of old stock footage when detailing dieter's early life (the period footage of ww2 scenes and post german rubble is always a captivating sight, and with herzog gets up a notch in his timing and assemblage with music), and in capturing the footage of vietnam in aerial viewings of jungles and fields. herzog is also very wise at not injecting politics much at all into the proceedings, there's no 'i was used by the americans' or whatever thrown into the mix. there's even a sense that dieter doesn't hold too much of a grudge with everything that happened to him, that it's just what happens in time of war (and, of course, he was dropping bombs on people from his plane). now, through much of these harrowing- and even in the smaller bits involving what went on in prisons, bathrooms and the scraps of food it's always harrowing- luckily herzog keeps a level of humor in check as well. one of my very favorite scenes in the film, where herzog breaks away for a moment from dieter, is when he shows a 'trainee' film used for american soldiers meant to show what should happen in case they get abandoned in the jungle alone...with all of the gear that they could possibly have including a knife, a flare gun, and a very fast helicopter to come around (and this is put to hilariously dead-pan voice-over work).yet even the moments where one laughs only brings to mind the moments of absurdity in a time of absolute crisis, and how one can't ever really imagine what it's like to be alone in a foreign territory surrounded by people who will do anything to keep said person as a form of collateral in war-time. dieter, aside from knowing that flying and airplanes are the only way of life he would ever want to have (and herzog ends the film on a wonderfully somber, elegiac note where he flies over a large field of airplanes), knows what it is to have to survive at all costs. but yet, as well, as in many of herzog's protagonist driven films, there's the near unalterable spirit that will keep on enduring if one's strong enough, even through horrid moments (the fate of dunae) and problems all the way up to the rescue by the helicopter (is he american, or a spy, they ask on the chopper). dieter is such a man with a spirit, and he's given via herzog a fantastic, tragic, creative, well-shot, albeit maybe too short, tribute to his life. and, of course, it pumps me up even more for the upcoming dramatization rescue dawn.

i think the filmographic lineage may run like this. pay attention, please, because i had to look this up. in 1967 peter yates, an ex auto racer, directs the english caper movie "robbery," the most thrilling part of which is a car chase through the streets of london, down alleys where there are crowds of children playing and all that. it's a success.a year later, yates directs "bullet", starring steve mccool, i mean mcqueen, featuring another even more spectacular car chase up and down the san francisco hills, with dumbfoundingly authentic engine sounds that seem to include double clutching, full race cams, no mufflers, twelve-cylinder engines under forty-foot hoods, supercharged, superdupercharged, and all five-thousand horsepower running at full tilt. lots of shots of mcqueen's gum-chewing visage scowling with concentration as he tries to bump another car off the highway, though a passenger in the other vehicle totes a shotgun. the chase is staged by philip d'antoni. bill hopkins drives the criminal vehicle.a year or two later, sensing a good thing, bill friedkin directs "the french connection," featuring a chase between a commandeered cop car(gene hackman) and an elevated train in new york city. lots of shots of hackman's cursing face as he wrestles the battered car through the streets. the chase is staged by philip d'antoni. academy awards follow.sensing a good thing, a year or two more brings us "the seven ups," featuring a chase between a car driven by roy scheider, with lots of shots of scheider's cursing face as he tries to bump the other car, which is driven by bill hopkins, off the road, although the criminal car, to be sure, carries a shotgun-toting passenger. no hills in new york city, just bumps, but they are still sharp enough to elevate the cars a few feet. the pursued car screeches around a corner and dashes down a street on which a dozen children are playing. shots of the screaming kids as they scatter off the pavement and allows the car to zoom through. but once is not enough. the children immediately run back into the street and must repeat the retreat for the pursuing cop car carrying scheider.i once witnessed a pursuit at high speed on the streets of philadelphia. both the criminal and the cops drove through the streets at about 25 miles an hour, coming to rolling stops at each stop sign and red light -- very dull stuff compared to this movie.speaking of this movie, it's pretty good. "robbery" and "bullet" were cool. everyone dressed neatly. but the new york movies are filthy. there's garbage all over the place and the subway cars are covered with graffiti. shoot outs and beat ups take place in vacant lots surrounded by crumbling brick buildings, or in disposal dumps for industrial-sized freezers.the acting is pretty good too. roy scheider seems whippet sleek. the other actors have faces made for the camera, especially richard welsh. and the story is engaging, if not entirely unfamiliar. what's best about the film is the way it captures new york city in its almost total indifference to human depravity and nobility. at a funeral, the limo drivers stand around with their collars up, butts hanging out of their mouths, kicking their cold feet together, utterly bored at the ritual goings on. the film wants us to believe that the seven ups are an elite group of untouchable cops who stop at nothing to get the job done, and here it's a bit of a sell out. they always seems to be threatening to do something unethical and illegal -- beat hell out of a suspect or physically damage a hospitalized and helpless hood -- but they always manage to avoid doing it. (if they actually did it, their characters would become lifelike and ambiguous and we'd rather have our heroes and villains of a more biblical nature.) very enjoyable, even if you've seen it before, and you very well may have in one or another of its previous incarnations.

this was a very good 1950s western, one of the better ones i've seen in a decade which featured that genre on screen and on tv. it certainly had three big actors on the marquee: glenn ford, barbara stanwyck and edward g. robinson. it turns out that ford was the star of this film while the other two stars were in supporting roles. ford had the bulk of the dialog. he also was the "good guy" while robinson was the "bad guy" and stanwyck was twice as bad as robinson. she played the real heavy in this film and the character she played was a little too contradictory at times. ford handled his starring status very ably, as he usually did - especially in westerns. he played a nice guy who didn't want to fight, was a peaceful man......but if you pushed him.....look out!the story had a nice mixture of action and lulls, not overdoing either. it had an expansive western setting which was put to good use with the cineamascope widescreen. it also featured realistic people in a realistic setting. that credibility with the characters, especially the supporting players, was most impressive. the men way out-shined the women in this film, acting and character-wise. dianne foster and may wynn were weak - the only negatives of the production. it's easy to see why these two actresses never became stars.even though it is over 50 years old, this western is one you'd still find fast-enough moving to enjoy, no matter how old you are or what you're used to seeing. for classic film fans, this is almost a must with this cast and good story. highly recommended.

this is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small ranchers and farmers. it's certainly all been done before and since. but the violent men is something special.what makes it special is barbara stanwyck playing the role of vixen as she often did in her later films. she's married to the crippled edward g. robinson who's the cattle baron here, but robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent. no matter to barbara, whose needs are being met by her brother-in-law brian keith. that doesn't sit well with either dianne foster who is robinson and stanwyck's daughter, nor with lita milan who is keith's mexican girl friend.the infidelity subplot almost takes over the film, but glenn ford as the stalwart small rancher who is a civil war veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here. he's every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often. i almost expect those famous words from wild bill elliott to come out of ford's mouth, "i'm a peaceable man." would have been very applicable in the vioilent men.the fifties was the age of the adult western, themes were entering into horse operas that hadn't been explored before. the following year glenn ford would do another western, jubal, one of his best which also explores infidelity as a plot component.there's enough traditional western stuff in the violent men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well.

one type of western i greatly enjoy is when the apparently weak, which is reluctant to fight and answer the challenge of the strong, finally decides there is no other way. there is a great moment in this film when john parrish (glenn ford) goes into the saloon and decides to stand up to the gunfighter wade matlock. it is the type of scene that makes the audience applaud. in my opinion the violent men is a great western, i would rank it among the best. it makes great use of the wide screen, a spectacular scenery of the mountains. the women have a crucial part. caroline (may winn) is engaged to parrish, but you feel that she is only using him as a means of getting out of there and moving east. she wants him to sell the ranch no matter what price. martha (barbara stanwick), is tired of helping her crippled husband lee (edward g. robinson) but she will do anything to have an always bigger ranch and more power. meanwhile she is betraying her husband with his brother (brian keith). her daughter judith (diane foster) is seeing all that happens but feeling impotent to react because she does not want to hurt her father. parrish unites all the small farmers and uses the strategy he learned in the army to go against the anchor ranch. like he had warned lee, "don't make me fight because you won't like my way of fighting".

some people think this was a rather bad tv series, with cheesy effects. (considering it was filmed between 1977-1979) but really, look back at those years and think, "we didn't have computers back then." so if you think about it, it's a rather good tv series.i always figured bad ratings killed the show, but no. the network did. they canceled out their theme as "the superhero network" and abandoned a short lived spider-man series. if it had gone on, it probably would have run well into the 80's, and if it was really lucky (and i mean really lucky), the early 90s.and no one wanted to pick this series up.anyways, jolly old (or young) nicholas hammond, of the sound of music fame, is brought to the tv screen as peter parker, the secret identity of the amazing spider-man. along the series, peter deals with a clone, a beautiful girl from a foreign country, and a corrupt politician.while the series is way out of timeline (being that peter is already graduated from university, and thats when he gets bit, and uncle ben is already dead,) the audience is treated to action, suspense, and the attitude that the characters have towards peter and his alter ego, spider-man.while it's also slightly disappointing that robert. f simon looks nothing like j.j.jameson, it's not so disappointing that betty grant isn't betty grant, but a hot african american girl (who reminds me of halle berry, who is one of the hottest women on the planet) so really, this one wasn't so bad.but considering the time, and how much drama they packed into this one, it kind of foreshadows what bad tv is today. either way, it's entertaining, even for today.8/10

minor spoilers will follow.this movie is even more odd and unconventional than "songs from the second floor". there is no main character we follow around. there is no "plot" in the conventional way. there is no emphasis on an happy end. there is no crowdpleasing. in other words roy andersson is back with a vengeance. instead of falling back on convention and fixed formula roy andersson concentrates his film around an idea. i will not go into what that idea is, but even if you don't "get it" i promise that you will see the greatest visual depth ever put to film. the majestic scenes from "songs" pale in comparison here. a work of visual splendor.so be kind to your fellow man, because after all "we are the living", and only you and i have the power to change our lives. that is at least what i thought when i saw the final scene in the movie, with the inhumane bomber planes sweeping in over the city in the film to take our lives away. and of course don't forget to see this movie when it gets a limited release near you. this is one of those movies that actually have the power to make you a better person, like de sica's "bicycle thieves". a very warm and humanistic film.

roy anderson's film 'you, the living' comprises a series of fifty-odd sketches, snapshots and vignettes set in a swedish city. some characters are on screen for just a few second, whilst others appear in numerous scenes and are sometimes seen loitering in the background while another story unfolds. many scenes are drawn from the dreams, nightmares and fantasies of the strange but believable characters inhabiting this world. it is a fascinating approach: each of the scenes could be enjoyed in isolation, but together they contain a powerful portrait of what it is to be human.for the first half hour or so, 'you, the living' is gloriously funny. much of the humour centres on the members of a brass band, whose music practice infuriates the neighbours in their apartment block. the comic highlight, however, is provided by a dinner-party track gone horribly awry. after this hilarious introduction, however, the mood of the film darkens considerably. the dinner-party dream turns grim when the hapless protagonist is put on trial for his life, setting a mixed tone of absurdity and despair for the rest of the film.in the subsequent scenes, the unhappiness of the cast of characters becomes increasingly apparent. theirs is a world where people are unable to connect with one another, where talk of dreams, nightmares and fantasies is widespread, but where no person can be comforted, even when others reach out to help them. the despondent woman with the 'nobody loves me' refrain and the young girl with unrequited love for the rock guitarist, micke, are archetypal characters.the world of 'you, the living' is also blighted by selfishness. an elderly professor is called away the warmth of a vast banquet to answer a phone call from his impetuous money-grubbing son; a thief steals the wallet of a ruthless executive; an arrogant and impatient businessman insults a muslim barber and receives his comeuppance. in the film's bleakest moment, a woman in church recounts the long list of human sins as her fellow parishioners shuffle out at closing time.and yet, for all dark moments in this film, the shared refrain of 'tomorrow is another day' points to the ability of people to go on living in spite of many miseries. the soundtrack provided by benny anderson (of abba fame) seems inappropriately jovial at first but makes more and more sense as the film realises this human capacity to persevere.'you, the living' has an extraordinary visual style. the same washed-out, pale-green colours recur throughout, and there is nary a shadow in sight; this makes the characters appear exceptionally pallid and creates the sensation that human life is being laid bare for examination. almost every scene is captured in a static camera frame, as if these are photographs being brought to life. the few occasions where the camera does move are all the more extraordinary; the contrast between the life and movement of the great banquet form a startling contrast with the deadness of the cloakroom scene. in the most intense moments of longing and despair, the characters transfix the viewer by directly facing the camera ¬ñ they know that they are being examined and have a few moments to pour out their hearts to us, the viewers.this is a wonderful, human film.

this film isn't supposed to be funny, but it made me laugh.it isn't designed to be sad, but my heart felt heavy through a number of the vignettes.it isn't written as action adventure, but my pulse raced more than once.just like life, this movie doesn't manipulate your emotions and tell you how to feel. it simply is, and you react.if you don't find it funny or sad or moving, i suspect that says more about you than the film.it amazing and refreshing to see a director so wholeheartedly celebrate that we are all human, and embrace that we are all trapped here, doing this "life" thing, over and over for as long as we must.tomorrow is another day.

i really didn't see this one coming. roy andersson had me pegged out, i am the perfect sucker for a static camera (long live king borowczyk!) and i was laughing hysterically for the first fifteen minutes of the film, he hit me straight between the eyes. you have to be a brilliant man to make self-pity hilarious. andersson reminds me of the third mate on the pequod in moby dick, flask, a man who took the whole of life to be a practical joke that the good lord himself is playing on us. and the web of egotism in this movie is truly hilarious.the level of satire is at fever pitch, you have one deluded self-pitying dreamer harp on about the cruelty of the world and then totally ignore a spiritual self-reflection crying out in agony. the very depths of egotism are plumbed. i really never thought it possible to go further than bergman's "the silence" in this respect. however the grotesqueness of the self-love and self-regard, by every single character in this film, is staggering. we are shown an existence where the talentless and the idle rail against a world they believe has been unjust towards them, they truly are legends in their own living rooms. the human beings in this film make self-deception and self-delusion a great artform! only one woman in the film appears to have any sort of understanding of what is going on. an old woman who refuses to leave a chapel, knelt down praying for the forgiveness of all mankind, her speech is the most electrifying condemnation of the modern world i have ever heard. she reveals through her prayers that what is wrong with the world is not to be fixed by mere tinkering, there are not a just a few faults, there is an abyss of corruption that can only be mended by immolation, and judgement day. watching this movie puts me in the mind of a naked monk, stood waist deep in a cold river at midnight screaming out a thousand kyrie eleisons for the sins of humanity. another grand jape is that it is clear that her prayers are futile, and in fact she is stopping everyone going home at closing time.this is not a film for the smug, no-one is spared, no idols are left on the altar, no one group of humans is harangued to the glory of another group. never has there been a greater more transcendent more astonishingly beautiful summation of our sins. it is a film for the end of the world, it is the grand jest, the great hideous practical joke of human life! from the catalogue of images it is too difficult to pick a favourite, i slapped my thigh and almost fell off my chair in the cinema, screaming with laughter as a man attempted to pull the tablecloth from under a set service. i won't spoil what happens, but the suspense builds up, and something truly unexpected occurs. it is probably the funniest thing i have ever seen in a cinema. i am quite reserved and i just couldn't control myself: that is the measure of the greatness of this film.the shooting of "you, the living" is impeccably formalist. we are shown the palette of an artist, dingy browns, yellows, greys, and sky blues set alive by the shock of luminous brass textures. there is never a tone out of place, it's like an hour and a half of symphonic whistlerian colour-meld. the obsession that must have gone into putting that colour scheme in place is extraordinary. and no shot is wasted, as with all great movies, there is not a spare inch of celluloid.perhaps the best film i've ever seen.

there is no plot. there are no central characters. there are no moving cameras or close-ups. in fact, this film does not follow any of the conventional storytelling techniques used by mainstream film. however, roy andersson's du levande is a remarkable piece of cinematic storytelling. it is a touching look at the human psyche.comprised of a series of vignettes, roy andersson gives us an intimate insight into what makes us all human. in perfectly framed static shots, added with the perfectly in tune, yet quirky, music, roy introduces us to a host of characters as they undertake their daily existence. some bordering on tragic, others hilarious, we are taken on a nordic journey like no other.it is a journey into the little things that make us human. instead of over-the-top storytelling or visual techniques, everything is stripped down to the bare minimum so that our sole focus is on the characters themselves. it focuses on the insignificant points of our lives that make us who we are; our dreams, our desperation. it's through this simple observation of others that we can accept who we are as individuals.the washed out colours and deathly-pale makeup of the characters only seems to emphasize their individual stories and remind us that unlike them, we are all alive. there is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel in this film, yet you walk out of the cinema with a sense of life. much more accessible than his earlier film, songs from the second floor, du levande, is a truly inspiring piece of cinema.

"with all the misery in the world, how can we not get drunk?" ¬ñ miaa lovely aerial view of a major city turns ominous with the approach of a fleet of airplane bombers; an irate hairdresser reacting to a perceived racial slur cuts a road through a businessman's bushy hair; a man dreams of being dragged to an electric chair after a failed magic trick and a teacher breaks down in front of her grade school class because her husband called her a hag. these and about fifty other vignettes that run the gamut from the outright depressing to the wildly humorous to the joyously uplifting populate roy andersson's you, the living, his first feature since his critically acclaimed if commercially unsuccessful songs from the second floor.you, the living is filled with the same kind of imaginative set-pieces as songs, replete with black humor, surreal situations, and strange looking characters. though a bit overlong and less focused than his earlier work, what remains constant is andersson's unmistakable style with its stationary camera, sterile-looking backgrounds, and precise attention to detail. if there is a theme that ties the sketches together, it is that our time on earth is limited and "tomorrow's another day', so let's treat each other with kindness. along the way, we are entertained by tuba and drum music from the louisiana brass band, dinner guests at a banquet hall standing on their chairs singing a rousing song, and a house that turns into a moving train.the emotions range from the gloom of a daughter attempting to communicate with an alzheimer's patient to a young woman's ecstatic dream about marrying a handsome guitar-player named micke to the cheers of a crowd of onlookers. while there is no continuous narrative thread, the theme of greed and desperation appears in several sketches. the first of these threads features two corpulent individuals and their tiny dog sitting on a park bench, the woman bewailing the fact that no one understands or loves her, yet she blithely ignores the man's comforting and reassuring words.there is also a hefty admixture of irony. during what seems to be an executive luncheon, one man tells another on the phone that workers don't appreciate quality and how nice it is to appreciate money and the things that it can buy such as fine wine. when he is not looking, however, a man at an adjacent table calmly lifts his wallet from his jacket on the back of his chair. though andersson's cynicism is at times not very well hidden, you the living has an underlying humanism that shows compassion for the human condition. it is a cautionary tale that looks at the mess we humans have gotten ourselves into but suggests there is still time to turn it around, if we heed the warning of the poet goethe that opens the film, "be pleased then, you the living, in your delightfully warmed bed, before lethe's ice-cold wave will lick your escaping foot."

a short review without any spoilers follows.i saw this movie yesterday at the cannes film festival. my initial reaction is one of wonder and happiness. i'm so happy films like this are being made in our age of blockbusters. roy andersson's new movie "you, the living" is nothing less than a complete masterpiece. you, the living is composed by some 50 vignettes filmed with a static camera. i will not give away the content of the scenes here, because i hate when people spoil even the smallest details. but, yes, most of the scenes made the 1000 people in the claude debussy theatre absolutely baffled and amazed. when the film was over we applauded for several minutes, we had no other choice.so what's the score with "you, the living". hm, andersson isn't afraid to take on the heavy questions; history, guilt, gand the holocaust during ww2 are big subjects (and these themes work very well together).the images created are brilliant, the depth sometimes surpasses "songs from the second floor". well, sorry for this ranting, praising review. look out for the flying house in the beginning folks!10/10 stars - a masterpiece (i never throw this grade out).

if we consider three films with a similar subject, which are this one, which was made in 1930, 'the covered wagon', made in 1923 and 'wagon master' made in 1950, the distance between 'the big trail' and 'the covered wagon' is only 7 years whereas the distance between 'the big trail' and 'wagon master' is 20 years. this is amazing because it shows how much movies evolved in those 7 years, and how in the next 20 years the changes were slow to come. 'the big trail is technically close to 'wagon master', but ages apart from 'the covered wagon'. the story is about the pioneers going from the missouri to the west in oregon. tyrone power sr. is the man leading the caravan, he is a rough and mean guy. john wayne is the good guy and the film makes too much of a point of his good looks, not giving him a chance to be the wayne that we are used to. marguerite churchill is such a proud lady that you wonder why wayne just does not forget her. raoul walsh was a master at showing caravans and cattle moving through the west, he directed 'the tall men' in 1955, which has a lot in common with 'the big trail'.

it's quite revealing to see this today and appreciate how far we've come along in what we expect from movies, and at the same time appreciate how many bedrock notions were established.here we have a full-fledged narrative talking film - the audio and the visuals are pushed to their period limits. the framing is limited to about belt-high and up -- no face close-ups. the compositions are remarkable; there's an early over-the-shoulder cross cutting scene to showcase the dialogue; there's a treacherous descent into a canyon with some harrowing perspective angles; a sun-bleached skeleton lies in the dust as the wheels and legs march in the upper portion of the frame; the tension in the showdown between the hero and the bad guy is visually captured by filming above the long axis of a large tree that lies between them; and on and on - early visual treats abound.today, it's unsettling to see the young wayne carry a film, unencumbered by ego or mannerisms.i have to wonder if walsh recognized the self-reference: the subject is the journey of a disparate group of pilgrims; those who appear on screen are a disparate group of stage actors, vaudeville comedians, shell game artists, and, probably, carny barkers and ten-in-one show veterans. they all journey together to blaze a trail for how movies would be made.this is worth at least one viewing to appreciate the source of so many visual ideas borrowed in later movies.

raoul walsh's mega-epic, stunning filmed in an early widescreen process by the great arthur edeson, can be slow and static in the early talkie manner, but this classic wagon train journey across america to the northwest is thrilling as a sheer physical production when seen on the big screen. on t.v., the lack of close-ups and distant sound reproduction may prove daunting. young john wayne scores easily in his first starring role with a natural delivery the rest of the cast can't command. amazingly, the film flopped and wayne spent most of the following decade in grade b western fodder.

no one said that in "the big trail" and i thought it would be a natural. nevertheless, this was one of the best westerns i have seen and i am a big fan of horses and gunsmoke movies. the scope and feel of this picture is simply staggering and, as someone mentioned in their comment, it does have the feel of the 3-camera triptych of "napoleon" (1927). nowadays the cost of the production and, especially, the cast of thousands, would be prohibitive, but raoul walsh got it done.the cast was excellent, although john wayne was better when he had no lines and just swaggered around. in particular, tyrone power,sr. was a perfect villain - i had never seen him before and this was his only talking picture. ian keith was a snake, but el brendel is an acquired taste as the comic relief. he can be funny or annoying, but mostly the latter - and he shows up at the most inappropriate times.it is a bit too long and it took a while for the indians to show up, but this is as close to a documentary on manifest destiny and as true to life as you will see and a must for movie fans regardless of genre preference. by the time the settlers got to california i was exhausted.

the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age. john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry. his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him. i think that it is a must see older john wayne film.

i first saw this film in video form. even on a television screen, the vistas were impressive. seen on the big screen in its full glory, it must have blown people away.as one or two other comments have pointed out, the story of the early pioneers and how they got around the problems of terrain etc on the road to oregon is as authentic as any film can be. it therefore shows that it is totally unnecessary to take liberties with the truth - something that today's film makers should take heed of - reality is enough.the plot relies on the struggle of man against the elements and hostile natives. subplots are few and simple. but the basic plot is enough. elsewhere i have reviewed paramount's rival to the big trail, fighting caravans. in spite of having a more sophisticated plot, and having better actors, fighting caravans lacks the breathtaking scenes.the big trail should be compulsory viewing.

best cinematography i have ever seen¬Öconsidering the year the movie was made i was absolutely amazed and thoroughly impressed with the amount of attention dedicated to the scenes and with what appears to be authenticity. though i am not particularly a western movie buff¬Ö.every single scene is given the utmost detail, and it is haunting. there is a sincere connection with nature. at times i am overwhelmed with the amount of action passing through the scenes, but i am never bored. i feel as though i am truly peering into a time machine and looking back into the old west. i recommend this movie to anyone who is studying set design, location planning, and for that matter photography in general. it can be a humbling movie to experience with regards to the visuals considering this era of digital touch-up that we now experience.

''wallace & gromit in the curse of the were-rabbit'' is the same type of animation and from the same creators of ''chicken run'', but the story now is other: wallace, a inventor who loves cheese and his smart dog gromit who is always helping wallace in his problems,are trying to keep the rabbits away from everybody's vegetables,since there is in their town, an annual giant vegetable competition. but when wallace tries an invention he did, to make the rabbits avoids vegetable, the one who is going to be cursed is him. before watching this movie i didn't knew that these two characters already existed and were famous.i loved gromit, and i think he is one of the coolest dogs i already saw.aka "wallace & gromit-a batalha dos vegetais" - brazil

my only problem with the curse of the were-rabbit is that the movie does not take the time to properly introduce wallace and gromit to those not familiar with park's short films. strangely, "a close shave" manages to do this with a lot less time to spare. still, i loved seeing the boys back in action and loved all the new characters, human and otherwise. i especially loved ralph fiennes voice as the scheming victor quartermaine. it is also interesting to see the series on the large screen. the workmanship with the clay characters really stands out. it's a hoot, and great for the whole family! i buy very few dvds but i have every wallace and gromit and will happily add this one.

in 1989, aardman animations introduced the two heros in the grand day out. in 1993, they fought an evil penguin in the wrong trousers. and in 1995, they had to rescue sheep from an evil robot dog in a close shave. in 2005, they're back and they are going to fight something that used to be cute and cuddlely in the curse of the were-rabbit. in this full feature film, wallace and gromit work in anit-pesto, a pest-control business. there's going to be a giant vegetable competition, but rabbits keep eating the neighbors vegies. wallace and gromit takes care with that problem. but wallace had an idea. he will brainwash the bunnies with his machine. after doing that, something suddenly eats all of the vegies in the neighborhood and it's big. it's up to wallace and gromit to save the day. as a fan of these two characters, i was impressed. it kept what the 3 previous chapters had and instead adding a lot of hollywood actors for voice-overs, they put a no name cast to the job and boy, they did a fantastic job. wallace and gromit has not changed. wallace is still the cheese-loving freak like he always was and gromit is the silent newspaper reading dog. also, the script was not too shabby like other family movies were. there is a twist of who the were-rabbit really is. the direction from nick park (the director of the 3 previous chapters) does a really good job with the storyline. instead of adding the hollywood formula in it, he just took the style of the previous chapters and adds a bit of a dark fantasy twist in it. well done, nick. the rabbits are also funny and adorable, but the funniest rabbit in the movie is one who has the mix of wallace in him. the characters were not bad and they weren't annoying, but they'll never top wallace and gromit. the animation is indeed fantastic and wonderful. i've never seen a clay-animated movie that is so amazing since chicken run. overall, fans of the two knuckleheads (including the teens) will love this fantastic film. it is a well done film that should get an oscar next year. hooray, wallace and gromit. 10/10

this was very good, except for two things which i'll mention at the end. the animation is great, highlighted by nick park and company's trademark of exaggerated teeth and mouths of the characters, which make you laugh almost every time you see someone. the color was magnificent, too.the best part of the film, however, is the clever comedy woven throughout. this is another of these animated films in which there is so much to see and hear each frame that it would require many viewings to catch all the gags. it's just a funny exaggerated look at the oddball "wallace" and his silent-and-smart dog "gromit." along the way, it pokes fun people who get carried away with their vegetable gardens, something akin to how the obsessive dog lovers were pictured in "best of show."my only complaints were two typical traits of today's films, animated or not: 1 - let's make the cleric in the film look like a total idiot; 2 - let's overdo the final action scene with the predictable result but way overdone. those aside, this is still a very amusing film that should provide a lot of laughs to many people and a movie to enjoy multiple times.

having just come home from my third viewing of the curse of the were-rabbit, i decided to jump on imdb and see what others thought. i noticed a lot of brits loved it, while those in america just didn't get it. that really doesn't come as any shock, as america doesn't get what "english" is.wallace and gromit are very english. middle class english, in fact, with a hint of eccentricity throw in for good measure. the film is a lot like our two heroes; simple and unassuming. it has a nice and gentle plot so the children don't get lost, yet there's enough beef there to keep the adults amused too. there's some light innuendo (which seems have to have offended the evangelic - oh noes, drama!) but there is nothing more rude than a bottom for a brief moment. when people get offended by a plasticine anus, you know the world's messed up...one quick note to those (all american so far that i have seen) who think chicken run is a better film: chicken run was made to pander to your sense of humour, and i think it suffered because of it. curse of the were rabbit is witty, english, and intelligent. thomas the tank engine's film was ruined because it was made to please the americans and i'm glad nick park did not let that happen to another great british institution.to sum up: you can keep your chicken runs, your shreks, your madagasga's - that kind of crude, crass, slapstick comedy just doesn't compare to the wit and grace that is wallace and gromit in curse of the were-rabbit. english to the core, and long may wallace and gromit stay that way.

wallace & gromit: the curse of the were-rabbit (2005) **** (voices: peter salis, ralph fiennes helena bonham carter)fantastic feats of clay: wallace & gromit save the day! crackin' good entertainment!nick park, the creator of the animated team of wallace & gromit, is a genius. his painstaking art in the form of plasitcine claymation is a unique process involving literally thousands of hours (it takes roughly an 8 hour work day to contribute 3 minutes of action to a film; this foray into feature length storytelling took 5 years!) in making his lovable master & loyal dog team take form is finally on the big screen in the duo's first full-length motion picture and it's cracklin' good (to coin a phrase from wallace's usual reply to all things good!) park, who co-directed with steve box and co-wrote with mark burton and bob baker, sends up the horror genre in this rollickingly funny and swift paced action comedy with the geeky inventive wallace (voiced by british vet thespian salis) and his mute yet loyal (and sharper-minded) mutt gromit (all furrowing eyebrows and mouth-less insouciance) have devised a service to their community: pest control ("anti-pesto" as they are known) for the upcoming giant vegetable festival that has the entire town in the mood for all things vegetative a gigante and the biggest pesk are troublesome rabbits eating the crunchy goods. wallace's inventive mind has created a vacuum container that is quick, efficient, and more importantly harmless to the cute vermin that plague the estate of lady campanula tottington (voiced by bonham carter, making a fast-break to be the first lady of stop-motion animation what with her earlier turn in "corpse bride" a few weeks ago), who is housing the competition and is a love interest for the nerdy wallace.the only fly-in-the-ointment is vainglorious, bombastic loud-mouth and jerk victor quartermaine (voiced by fiennes, his first attempt in the animated arts coming across as a patrick stewart lunged braggard with hilarious results), a badly toupeed wearing macho moron who is plotting to marry lady tottington for her riches while he is a chief competitor to w&g's humane attempts by resorting to his trusty guns and nasty bulldog.to add insult to injury the duo are facing a terrible plight in the form of a huge were-rabbit (the titular monster a nice nod to both universal and hammer horror flicks) that is terrorizing the village and devouring every veggie in sight. the two set out to trap and dispose of the creature but there is more than meets the eye as things progress.relentlessly funny and with such amazing elastic, and kinetic energy to his wonderful clay counterparts, park and box have created a truly magical and highly entertaining film with so much amazingly detailed production design to their little world that it may take more than one screening to absorb just how much effort in their blood, sweat and tears have gone into making this instant classic for children of all ages. wallace, the cheese loving balding inventor, could easily be homer simpson's uk cousin with his rotund body and constant knack for getting things wrong while attempting to do the right thing; his heart is in the right place but his head is in the clouds. his sweet crush for lady tottington (resembling a pre-plastic surgery carol burnett) who is a head taller than our hero will perhaps remind those of their first unrequited love with a smile of awkward admission. his rube goldberg-like gift for making the complicated into ease is inspired lunacy that fans will recall from the earlier shorter films "the wrong trousers", "a close shave" and "a grand day out".but it is in my opinion the wise, silent and long-suffering gromit, his poached egg eyes of slow-burns and disbelief at what is transpiring, is one of the best animated characters ever created with such an amazing arsenal of exasperated, mouthless expressions and subtle nuances that most live-action actors would kill to accomplish in the attempt of conveying dismay, concern, grief, genuine surprise and relief. his final chase ¬ñ a signature of the immensely popular comic team ¬ñ is ingeniously set and quickly improvised especially his literal dog-fight with the equally soundless bulldog with tenacity, wit and a chuck jones fueled smartness that would have bruce willis and arnold schwarzenegger green with envy.wallace and gromit match the best of laurel & hardy, abbott & costello and any other classic comedy team that comes to mind; here's hoping their longevity continues on screen for just as long as their predecessors. the waiting is most eager.

there are a few aspects to park's movies, and in particular wallace & gromit, that i would say make them so great. the first is subtlety and observation, the flagship of which is the character of gromit. he doesn't speak, he doesn't make any noise, all he has are his eyes, brow, and body posture, and with these he commands the film. park manages to give us everything we need from this silent character through his expression. the comedy and the emotion is conveyed through the subtlest of movements and it works superbly well.watching the movie you have to be aware of the entire screen. normally you'll be guided to things in the movies, the screen won't be cluttered too much, there won't be many things to take your eyes away from the main clue or action. park seems to need to look the other way with his movies. he throws extra content at his audience, there's action in the background, to the side of the screen, even off screen, and there's just about always something in the foreground to catch your eye. his movies are about multiple viewing and discovery, they're layered with jokes and ancillary action.throughout this film there are layers of things happening on screen, jokes in the foreground maybe on a jar label and background shadows that give away action. you can imagine that for park the movies has always been an event, and the movies he loves are ones which he wants to watch again and again. this is what shows in his movies, and in through his most beloved characters.then there are the bizarre and wacky inventions which wallace make, something which is reflected in the storyline and the twists and turns of the plot, everything is bizarre and off the wall, yet it seems so perfectly normal in this world. you can imagine that inside park is the mind of wallace.there's also one more thing that make these movies so unique, and that's the modelling and precise hand animation. i must admit i was concerned when i knew dreamworks was involved in the making of this movie, and i thought that they would bring their computer animation experience to the forefront. what i was scared of was wallace & gromit becoming cgi entities, or at the smallest, cgi being used to clean up the feel that the modelling brought to the movie.not so. you can still see thumbprints and toolmarks on the characters, and far from distracting from the movie, this just adds so much real feeling to it and a feeling of physical depth to the characters and the scene on screen.so what of the movie? well i must say that the plot twist was something i had thought about well before the film was in the cinema and it came as no surprise, but that did not affect my enjoyment one little bit. actually watching the twist unfold and the comic timing of the discovery and reactions was everything, and it had me just as sucked in as if it was a thriller, yet all the time i was laughing.watching the movie was fascinating in various ways. to see the animation completed, how wild the inventions are, how wallace is going to get into trouble and gromit get him out, where all the cross references are in the movie, and where all the jokes are! i must admit afterwards talking with my friends i couldn't believe how much i had missed.there's something different in this movie than with the others, there's a new level of adult humour in here, and i don't mean rude jokes (although there are a couple that are just so british you can't help laughing), i mean jokes that simply fly over kids heads but slap adults in the face. the kind you are used to seeing come out of somewhere like pixar. this just adds even more appeal to the movie.okay though, let me try and be a bit negative here. i didn't notice the voices in this movie, you know how you usually listen to the actors and see if you can recognise them? well i was just too wrapped up in the movie to care or to notice who they were...okay, that's not negative. let me try again. the main plot wasn't as strong and gripping as i'd expected, and i found myself being caught up in the side stories and the characters themselves...again...that's not a bad thing, the film was just so much rich entertainment.i honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about this movie, probably the worst thing i could say is that the title sequence at the end is quite repetitive...until the final title! really, that's the worst i can say.the story is a lot of fun, well set-up, well written, well executed. there's lot's of fantastic characters in here, not just wallace & gromit. there's so much happening on screen, so many references and jokes (check out the dresses of lady tottingham), cheese jokes everywhere, jokes for all the family. the characters are superbly absorbing and you'll find that you've taken to them before you realise. there's just so much in this movie for everyone.there's so much i could say and write about, but i know it will quickly turn into a backslapping exercise for park and aardman, it would also just turn into a series of "this bit was really funny" and "there's a bit when...", and what i would rather do is tell you that this is a superb movie, to go see it, and to experience the whole thing for yourselves. i will say though that the bunnies are excellent!

i really refused to see this movie. i refused to go with the school and i refused to go with my parents. just by looking at the trailer it looked stupid, to me anyway. one of my friends wanted to take me to the movies that day and he offered me 2 choices, "the dukes of hazzard" or "wallace and gromit: the curse of the were-rabbit." it took me 17 minutes to decide. time was running out. i had to choose. it came up on the screen "few" as in a few tickets left. by the time we had to line up and get our ticket, only one of us could go in. i desperately wanted nicholas to go in to see it. but he forced me. i crossed my arms and was very moody and disappointed that i was going in to see this childishness. i walked in, sat in the only seat that was available and prepared for the movie! must say i was very surprised that i sat through that masterpiece! it was amazing. i don't know what i was complaining about. the clay animation was by far the most best i've ever seen in my life. the story was brilliant. about a rabbit disrupting and crashing a carnival that had been planned for over 500 years. basically anti pest control are protecting the people who are competing in the vegetable competition. anti pesto known as wallace and gromit (who are in charge of this business) try to keep all the rabbits away from the vegetable carnival. i wont say anymore. it's just too good to tell. i'll admit that the whole idea of a were-rabbit is ab-it unbelievable and ab-it childish, but nick park adds substance to it which what makes everyone love it. i mean, there wont be a 10 foot rabbit on the loose and there definitely wont be 8 foot werewolves as said in " dog soldiers." then again, were-rabbits and werewolves aren't actual creatures. but either way, it worked out very well. the jokes also were more grown up. the kids wont get some of the jokes. it goes way above their heads. it had a lot of british jokes in there. if you love british humor, this is the movie for you.i also loved the cast and the voices. everything about the movie is so incredibly well done. the direction and pacing was absolutely...fantastic! i recommend this to fans of the old wallace and gromit shorts (and no, i haven't seen them yet), and i recommend it to fans who liked "shrek" and "shrek 2 and most importantly, i recommend it to the people who love clay animation. cracking good movie! 10/10

what-ho! this one is jolly good. i say jolly good, ol' chap. or should i say "ol' bean"? my mastery of british terminology is a little dusty. anyway, my biker boots and i walked into this screening with no prior viewing experience of wallace and gromit. i'm happy to say that my boots and i walked out pleased to have made their acquaintance.while not as adult-accessible as toy story, w & g still manages to be clever enough to provide the grown ups with a little humor that will most definitely soar over the heads of the young 'uns who are too busy guffawing at the were-rabbit's belches to have any clue that something is amiss. i highly suggest that you pay close attention any time you see books or words on the screen because there are quick glimpses of puns that you'll miss if you aren't paying attention. my favorite is a book of monsters that refers to the loch ness monster as "tourist trappus." if you've ever been known to say, "i can really relate to kevin federline," or if you're just illiterate then not only will you miss out on these jokes, but you probably should be spending your time learning to read instead of going to movies. consider this a public service announcement.the most impressive aspect about w & g is its clay animation. thanks to the tedious process, it took five years to finish the film! according to the press notes, there were some days when the optimum goal was to merely accomplish 10 seconds of completed film. folks, i sometimes have trouble finding the motivation to finish responding to a handful of emails or adding captions to pictures for my reviews (a point that is proved by a lack of pictures in this review); so i can't even imagine having the required patience for that.i really like the rough, hands-on quality of the claymation figures. the fact that you can see fingerprints in the clay is a nice, personal touch. how can you not be impressed with clay characters that show more expression and emotion than paul walker and keanu reeves combined? the curse of the were-rabbit is, as director nick park calls it, the world's first vegetarian horror movie that should entertain both kids and adults alike. relying on (and as a male who prides himself in his shaggy-haired, cool-bearded masculinity i hesitate to use this word) cute and (oh man, i probably shouldn't use this word either) lovable characters rather than outdated m.c. hammer references, w & g is proof that dreamworks can create entertaining animation when it chooses cleverness over the cheap joke.

when wallace and gromit burst onto the scene in their academy award winning short, "a grand day out," they created a fresh new look at claymation. after two more shorts, aardman's dynamic duo returned for this thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie. it has an excellent voice cast, humorous jokes and good animation as only aardman could do! in this movie, wallace and gromit run "anti-pesto," a rabbit removal company. when word gets out about a "were-rabbit" eating all the vegetables in town, a frenzy ensues. of course, victor quartermaine, the town's handsome, toupee-brandishing huntsman, wants to get his hands on the rabbit to impress the lovely lady tottington...but can our favorite aardman duo save the day before chaos ensues?the jokes, i should say, were hilarious. one point, the villain, victor quartermaine's, booty-crack was showing, prompting a character to cry out: "beware...the moon!!!" vintage aardman!the characters are crisp and hilarious. our favorite aardman team of man and dog entertains us as only they could do, earning them their second oscar (remember "a grand day out?"). helena bonham carter was terrific as the lovely lady tottington, wallace's love interest. ralph fiennes was especially funny and foreboding as the cunning, toupee wearing hunter victor quartermaine. but the one who really stole the show was the priest, whose antics proved to be some hilarious comic relief. hats off to aardman for creating another wallace and gromit masterpiece!

wallace and gromit are the main characters in some of the best cartoons ever crafted. the excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes "a grand day out," "the wrong trousers," and also "a close shave" some of the best animated footage ever put on television. winning several oscars and also countless other awards, nick park became quite the popular man in the u.k., yet his impact on the united states has not been big. after the third wallace and gromit short, there was all this speculation about a full-length wallace and gromit movie, yet for years nothing had happened. then in 2000 instead of a full-length wallace and gromit film, we get another brilliant claymation film from nick park, which was chicken run, which almost got nominated for best picture in the academy awards. perhaps it was the success of this film that ultimately drove park to finally work on a wallace and gromit project.5 years later (these kinds of films do take long you know) and a lot of anticipation, wallace and gromit finally hits the big screen. despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign, this movie delivers in so many ways. this film will be a delight for both kids and parents. with tons of adult humor hidden beneath the brilliant animation, wallace and gromit: curse of the were-rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly manages to equally appeal to both kids and adults. this rather difficult technique is one that only pixar has already perfected and dreamworks has had a lot of trouble doing lately. despite the dreamworks logo slapped onto the poster, this film is mainly from the very creative staff of aardman animations.wallace and gromit are first seen running a business that protects the townspeople's crops from being ruined by rabbits, which apparently had been running around wild and in great numbers lately. their business has gotten them plenty of respect from the others living in the town because a gigantic vegetable contest was rapidly approaching and the crops needed protection. complications arise when wallace attempts to manipulate the rabbits into not liking vegetables and then a great eating machine is unleashed on the area. it is up to wallace and gromit to find the gigantic animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also their approval from the townspeople. to add to that, wallace wants to impress lady tottington, which also captured the attention of a snobby suitor by the name of victor. simple plot yes, but there is more than meets the eye, be prepared for a few fun surprises along the way, kind of like in the other wallace and gromit cartoons.in animated films with little dialogue, it is the animation that has to set the pacing and the mood of the film. despite requiring 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage, the payoff is fantastic. there is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one viewing to truly notice. even more incredible than the detailed and nearly flawless animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor put into the film. whether it is a creatively placed shot or normal labels put into the funniest position possible, or it is the oh-so-adorable rabbits that is constantly shown in the film, most curse of the were-rabbit's humor comes strictly from just watching the movie itself and catching all the references before it is too late. just picture the movie madagascar, except funnier much fewer pop culture references, and better animation.casting was great, even though in a film with not much dialogue, it was not that important. peter sallis yet again does a wonderful job as wallace, even though in this movie there was no stand-out quote that can be used anytime (the wrong trousers: "it's the wrong trousers gromit, and they've gone wrong!"). ralph fiennes does a superb job as the lead villain victor and also helena bonham carter (known as the crazy female lead in the cult hit "fight club") lends her lovely voice as she plays wallace's love interest. even though nothing could top the final chase in "the wrong trousers," curse of the ware-rabbit did have plenty of action scenes, including one fantastically done chase scene between gromit and victor's evil dog. last but not least, the rabbits really steal the show at some moments. whether it is their cute expressions, their funny movements, or their howling, the rabbits in the film even take some of the glory from the main stars. the funniest rabbit in the movie is the "cursed" rabbit himself, to the very end of the movie he had the audience rolling in laughter.bottom line: despite not being as memorable as "the wrong trousers", this film is just as good and entertaining as chicken run. unlike almost every movie to come out this year, the movie does not drag at all, clocking in at a short 85 minutes yet containing so much joy and fun, it will leave everyone watching it asking for more. there is very little wrong with the film; it was a pure delight to watch. this film is a total contrast of the decent yet vulgar, uncut, raw movies that have made a surprising amount of money earlier this year (40-year-old virgin, wedding crashers, and sin city) and for families and those who want harmless entertainment; that is a good thing. highly recommend, this is the top animated movie to come out this year and among the best we have seen this decade. wallace and gromit: curse of the were-rabbit: totally harmless fun from second 1 to second 5,100.

this first (and hopefully not last) wallace & gromit feature lives up to expectations. there are plenty of jokes (some a bit cheeky) as well as some great tributes to past science fiction movies. with the barrage of awful and formulaic movies being spewed forth from hollywood it's great to see such a great film like this that's enjoyable for almost everyone. if there is any justice it will be top of the box-office and be at least nominated for best animation at the next oscars. the animation is wonderful; the characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are great fun. this is one of those films that the whole family can enjoy. charming, clever, fun and well made, what's not to enjoy?

being a "wallace and gromit-fan", i was looking forward for this full-length movie. surprisingly i saw it at the world-premiere in vlissingen (nl), at the film by the sea festival. a wonderful feeling to be one of the first to see this very amusing and merry movie. it's about wallace and gromit (whom i believe don't need an introduction) having their own pest-control company in the city which is hosting a giant-vegetable contest in a few days. everyone, including an eccentric baroness, is hoping his or her giant carrot or melon will win the golden carrot. unfortunately the town is plagued by lots of hungry rabbits. this is where w&g come in. the have their own cracking contraptions to control these cute creatures in a human way.it's a very funny and colorful story. anyone who liked the three proceeding short movies of w&g (which are more than great!), will love this full-length movie. nick park really delivered a wonderful and original result with a great sense for humor. like in chicken run, it truly amazes me how he can capture so much story and emotions in just a few frames. "job well done, lad" ;-) oh yeah: the music was fantastic! it really completes the ride. enjoy!

i saw it at a german press screening. without giving too much away: most critics really seemed to like it very much. there was even applause afterwards, which is quite unusual for that species. from my point of view and until now, it was the funniest movie of the year. it keeps the charm and wit of the three w+g shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies. of course, there are obvious allusions to monster- and werewolf-movies, especially to "an american werewolf in london", "jaws", "king kong" and even to peter jackson's "braindead"/"dead alive", but also to other genres.characterization was better done in "chicken run", but that movie had a complete new "cast" where introduction was necessary. here, you are already able to know the two main characters. so, the new "wallace and gromit"-movie is enjoyed best if you watched (and liked) the shorts already, yet it also works on its own. "chicken run" had the more convenient, but also more "storytelling" plot. instead, this new aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more "isolated" feeling of the w+g shorts. children should also enjoy it very much, especially because of the sweet rabbits (if you love cute bunnies, this is a must-see for you!!!) and because gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show (children also love dogs... :-) ). but many jokes are thought for a more adult audience (there are even soft sexual allusions in it). the movie manages, like "shrek 1+2" and "the incredibles", to fulfil high level entertainment for the whole family, with adding a british and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of american animated movies.the animation is ¬ñ as expected ¬ñ superb, and they kept true to the aardman style because they didn't put in too many digital effects - i realized just a few when it came to wallace's inventions.finally, the score works fine in the movie, although one of the main themes definitely is "borrowed" by randy edelman's "dragonheart" score.the bad thing is: it will probably take another six years from now until we can see a new animated gem from nick park & co.

this is the kind of film they used to make, amusing, heart-warming, troubling, authentic, with convincing performances by people without nose jobs, boob jobs, eye jobs, in other words real people. shauna macdonald plays the female love interest, and she is so real you want to give her a cuddle at the very least. imagine that, a real girl in a movie, whatever next? hollywood would hate her, because her freshness is a sharp rebuke to every false starlet in tinseltown. this story has the same hilarious feel as sandy mackendrick's classic 'whisky galore', with the gnomic humour of remote scottish islanders puncturing the pretensions of intruders from outside and enjoying a wee dram from time to time (the actual intervals between those times often being rather short). director stephen whittaker displays a rare skill in pulling this off just right, and it is shocking to discover that he died before his film's release, aged only 56, which was clearly a substantial loss to the screen. ulrich thomsen does very well at playing a german rocket scientist who in the late 1930s goes to scarp in the isle of harris to build a small rocket to carry postal packets between the islands. there he falls in love with the alluring macdonald lass, and she reciprocates the affection. some wonderfully colourful local characters decorate the tale, and the film is pure delight. there is of course the threat of imminent war with hitler, and we learn that hitler executed 1000 rocket scientists who refused to build weapons of war, which is a shocking statistic. tragic love is never far from view, but lips must remain sealed in a review as to what happens in the end. this film is a magnificent example of just the kind of films which people in britain should be making. but are they being properly released? in a nation whose tastes have been so corrupted by reality tv shows, where repulsive nonentities have become the national heroes, is there even a market anymore for a film like this? after all, there is no grunting sex, there are no close-ups of suppurating wounds or of anyone's genitals, there are no drugs taken, there are no mindless celebrities prancing around wanting to be looked at, and so one wonders whether there is anything to interest a public which has become so decadent and jaded that only the most extreme sensations can briefly alleviate the tedium of their pointless existence. anyone who is looking for an antidote to the vacuity of contemporary britain can take refuge in this refreshing and honest film.

set just before the second world war, this is a touching and understated romantic story that is loosely based on a real event.it concerns a german rocket scientist gerhart zucher (ulrich thomsen) working in britain in the advent of the second world war. fearing hitler may recall him to germany to assist him preparing for war, zucher and his slippery assistant heinz (eddie marsan) are evacuated by the british authorities to a remote scottish island. they are given the task of building a rocket post box that will enable the islanders to communicate with the mainland.mocked and bullied by the islanders, they set up home with local girl catherine mackay (the stunning shauna macdonald), with whom thomsen begins an affair but complications arise when germany comes calling...the central romance between zucher and catherine is subtle and sincerely played and the supporting cast is a colourful bunch with an array of respected scottish character actors including gary lewis and clive russell.fine cinematography and a brilliant central theme song sung in the local dialect round out this movie.intelligent but undemanding, it is good for a quiet evening in.

an excellent film for those who simply need to switch off and enjoy the beautiful scenery of scotland. based on fact, the film takes you on a journey of love amidst spectacular scenery. the cast are 'dressed down' for the parts they play, so no glamorous costumes or coiffured hair in this film where acting is superb, gritty and down to earth.each character is believable giving a convincing portrayal of island life, beliefs and culture of the time a definite for those who have even the tiniest drop of scottish blood..... as it will tug at the heart strings and stir the soul. something that can be shared with the family and watched time and time again..................a real classic, one that i am sure will walk alongside some of the great films that never die.

i saw this at the 2004 stony brook film festival in ny and it was very warmly received. in this pre-ww2 film, a pair of german rocket scientists are working on the scottish isle of scarp as war looms on the horizon. the characters encountered on the island are priceless in their creation and their portrayal. shauna macdonald is particularly memorableafter getting up to speed on the "scootish" accents, the viewer feel right at home with these folk who watch with amusement as the germans work to link their isle with the mainland via a rocket-based mail delivery. as implausible as it seems, this film was based on an actual story.all in all, a memorable film that will stay with you for some time thanks to its casting, its story or its scenery.

a wonderfully thoughtful and involving movie that leaves an imprint well beyond it's initial liftoff. based on a true story , one of the many "small" stories prior to ww ii , that lend an understanding to the mindsets of the majority of common man cultures, impacted by others perceived as former enemies and perhaps future foes, with the darkening of war clouds on the horizon. viewed at the stony brook film festival, the film was enthusiastically received . well written and expertly cast. the characters were most believable and drew one in to experience their trials and tribulations.

the first time i saw brotherhood of satan i was 12 yrs old i saw it in a little town in central washington state it played before tales from the crypt which we left early because my sisters were already scared from the brotherhood of satan. all in all i thought it was a pretty good movie. the beginning was good we had just sat down and that tank did a number on that station wagon.what struck me about the movie was the scenery around the town in which it was filmed it looked almost like the area around chelan wa where i saw the movie especially when they were driving towards the town of hillsboro which is the location of the movie a small town in sw new mexico. i have always liked lq jones and strother martin and also charles bateman who was on get smart another show i like. i gave the movie a 7 and later on when i did get to see tales from the crypt i thought brotherhood of satan was better.

a young couple -- father ben (solid charles bateman), wife nicky (the lovely ahna capri) and their daughter kt (the cute geri reischl of "i dismember mama" fame) -- find themselves trapped in a small california desert town populated by hysterical lunatics. worse yet, there's a pernicious satanic cult that's been abducting little children for their own diabolical purposes. director bernard mceveety, working from an offbeat and inspired script by william welch and l.q. jones ("devil times five" director sean macgregor came up with the bizarre story), relates the compellingly oddball plot at a slow, yet steady pace and ably creates a creepy, edgy, mysterious ooga-booga atmosphere. strother martin delivers a wonderfully wicked and robust performance as doc duncan, who's the gleefully sinister leader of the evil sect. the top-rate cast of excellent character actors qualifies as a substantial asset: jones as gruff, no-nonsense sheriff hillsboro, alvy moore as friendly local toby, and charles robinson as a shrewd, fiercely devout priest jack. john arthur morrill's bright, polished widescreen cinematography, jamie mendoza-nava's spooky score, and the wild, rousing climactic black mass ritual are all likewise up to speed. the idea of having toys come to murderous life is simply ingenious (the opening scene with a toy tank coming real and crushing a family in their car is truly jolting). nice eerily ambiguous ending, too. a pleasingly idiosyncratic and under-appreciated winner.

i was 10 or eleven years old when this movie came out, and it has stayed with me for 35 years since. when the movie came out, all of the theaters in the st. louis area distributed, as a 'lure', a pack of flower seeds that had the movie name, etc. on the front. on the back of the pack it read, in so many words....plant these seeds at midnight. if a white flower grows, you are saved.....but if a red flower grows, you are doomed!!! suffice it to say, that for an eleven year old kid, i did not plant the seeds for fear of what may pop up. here is the spoiler: as the movie starts out, you see a small toy tank moving about in the dirt. on a small road a family is leaving town, and suddenly the camera turns to the tank again, and it is full size. it rolls over the car, and you see bloody limbs protruding from the wreckage, then, just as sudden, the tank is small again.the reason this movie stuck with me for that long, was because i had a exact toy tank as the one in the movie!!!! unfortunately i don't know what happened to it, but i did keep a wary eye on that thing ever since!!!turn out the lights, put in the dvd, make a sandwich, and watch this movie. it is very good!!!

one of the best lesser known occult oriented horror movies of the seventies. it's gritty, exciting, scary, surrealistic here and there and at moments even very smart, which can't be said about many of the movies this kind. i can't help seeing some stinging symbolic and metaphoric points at the seventies society and generation stuff of the time this movie was done. the scriptwriter has obviously been cooking while delivering also some good old "from the crypt" kind of scenes. with a job well done from a creative director the result is entertaining and thought provoking. the simple, yet effective ending specially shows how these things are treated right by those who can.the excellent cast were mostly unknown to me, except l. q. jones as the moody but funny sheriff and strother martin as the town doctor. martin, not surprisingly, always ends up stealing the movie. with that voice and skill he is one of the greatest loonies in movies, for me anyway. what an actor!so, it is a little bit of mystery to me why this movie has not gathered far greater recognition. i think it would deserve almost equal place in the occult horror canon alongside rosemary's baby and the exorcist. one helluva movie!

not everyone likes this movie. it is still one of the best "you have to be thinking" movies about satanism ever made. the fact that it doesn't have mtv-era jump cuts or gore every seven minutes is irrelevant. also, speaking as someone who actually knows satanists, the (spoiler warning!) portion of the film where the brotherhood exchange their old bodies for those of preadolescent children, it has some genuinely scary scenes. the section where (second spoiler alert) strother martin orchestrates the changeover is almost hyper-real in that it uses very few special effects, a hallmark of this film. mceveety was seldom given a big budget but was often effective. it worked in this case, too.

growing up in the late 60s and 70s i could not help but become a fan of science fiction. with america's space program in top gear, sci-fi books, movies, tv shows, and comic books fueled my imagination and opened my mind to the possibilities that exist in the universe. farscape is so unlike any other sci-fi show yet it has all the ingredients that made shows like star trek, battlestar gallatica, x-files, and deep space nine personal favorites. one of the criticisms of farscape is that the casual viewer can't just jump in and watch one episode and understand what is going on. there have been other very successful shows that used multiple episode story arcs and complicated characters. this for me is one of the charms of the show. i don't need or want to have the story all tied up neatly at the end of every episode like the various incarnations of star trek have done. all in all, farscape has wonderful and funny characters and a running storyline that says that although humans may be the least evolved or advanced intelligent species in the universe, they still have unique qualities and abilities.unfortunately, the shortsighted people at the sci-fi channel have canceled farscape's 5th season. they have stated that the cancellation was based on sagging ratings. yet just a few years ago it was their top rated original series and a critical favorite. it's a shame that all of the artists who help create this show will be unable to continue their labor of love because of the fiscal problems of the very channel/company that made it all possible in the first place.hey, don't take my word for it, watch the show, watch the re-runs and make up your own mind. help save farscape!

farscape is the best sci-fi show period, for one main reason, everything the show attempts, it does very well. from a technical aspect, the music is original and perfectly fitted to the show. the special effects are abundance and higher quality then almost any thing else that you will see on your tv. the acting is also great, too many shows nowadays use only the american market of actors for their shows. remember the first time you saw the matrix and you said, wow where did that agent smith come from? its the same feeling that you get watching claudia black, anthony simcoe, lani tupu, virginia hey, and especially wayne pygram. these aussies are great and it comes through in this great show.the plot is second to none. the next closest thing i can think of is babylon 5 during the shadow wars episodes, but this tops even that. its a real treat getting to watch all the episodes sequential again, the intricacies of the interpersonal relationships of the characters are well scripted and performed. the overall plot is both original and thoroughly entertaining. i am always itching for the next show.the comedic episodes are funny, the drama episodes are touching, and the action sequences are tense. the beginning of the second season had some great comedic episodes which had me laughing aloud, something that rarely happens while watching television that is not south park, sealab 2021, or seinfeld. the drama is even harder, whether crichton is meeting his mother or the characters face thier mortality, all is done with heart and intensity. lastly it goes without saying that the action is tops. this is sci-fi.if you are a fan of science fiction in the slightest, if you enjoy good television at all, if you like good serialized plot, you owe it to yourself to watch farscape.oh, and ben browder owns.

an astronaut gets lost in deep space and finds himself traveling through unknown territory on board of a living spaceship accompanied by a group of alien-outlaws. this incredible plotted and enjoyable tv-installment comes along as a positive birth-fantasy. the individual characters, in conflict at the beginning of the series, have to learn to get along with each other and evolve into a powerful group at last. most of the action takes place inside the womb of moia, the living space-ship (who even gets pregnant and gives birth to another ship!). while science-fiction-stories are usually interested in negative birth-fantasies (watch the 'alien'-movies for example, especially the fourth part 'resurrection') this comes as a surprise. also enjoyable is the absence of military hierarchy on board of the ship and the positive attitude towards sex and the human (and alien) body. one of the female characters who is actually a plant experiences 'photogasms' while being exposed to sunlight. the crew even has to go to the toilet. wouldn't that be impossible in 'star trek'?

having just borrowing the series one dvd collection from my somewhat obsessive brother, i was expecting to get through the first couple of episodes and handing it back. i have just found myself yelling at the screen for ending the first season on a cliff-hanger - a mere week later and i've watched the entire season. where i found the time for this i have no idea.this show is great. it doesn't take itself too seriously, it has likeable characters who are well acted, and the special effects (ignoring the odd tacky puppet here and there) are "special" enough to give it that polished feel. at first, i didn't realise it was filmed mostly here, and it seemed odd to hear so many aussie accents on a sci-fi show - it was most amusing for the main character (john) to land back in sydney midway through the first season.i believe this show's biggest strength is the vision that the creators of the show obviously had. they have gradually introduced new aspects of the characters that have explain previous actions, and the continue to smatter john's conversations with slang in an amusing and unforced way. on top of that, having watched the entire voyager and next gen series, i see little plot rip-off - so it has managed to maintain a sense of originality throughout the entire first season. i hope the rest of it is as good.farscape is not like any other sci-fi that i've enjoyed in the past. i heard that the fourth season wasn't as good as the first three, and i am now quite annoyed that they cancelled it before the 5th. i hope that they revive this show - with the same actors in either a movie or another series. it would be a shame to leave so many plot lines unfinished as i imagine that with a show that's had so much thought put into it, to have it axed without adequate warning will leave me feeling robbed.gotta go now... heading back to my brother's place to snaffle the 2nd season.v.

one of the greatest crimes made against sci-fi television was the cancellation of farscape. one of the most well-written, well-acted and over-all best shows ever to grace the airwaves, it set new standards for sci-fi television. once the flagship, highest rated, critically acclaied show of the sci-fi channel, it defies explaination as to why shows like buffy, tremors: the series, and even stargate: sg-1 have lasted as long as they have. yes, even buffy. but i'll save my buffy bashing for another time. farscape was poorly treated by the sci-fi channel, continually tossed around in scheduling, reruns rarely shown and never really advertised. but while the show has been cancelled, all those involved in the production of the show want to bring the show back (even henson company ceo brian henson). there is also an extensive fan-based movement to bring the show back . overall things are looking far from dark, and hopefully, fans will get their season 5.

the other reviewers are way waaaay off as to why the farscape show has been (temporarily) put to rest. it has nothing to do with the quality of the shows 'slacking'. in fact, the exact opposite is true. they kept getting better and better! :) i have seen every episode and when you simply watch them in order you really become in awe how much cooler it gets as they move on and on, and the wormhole & aeryn subplots are really very interesting and gave it more vibe, not less. before it was sort of chaotic, slow, and rather aimless. they spent like the first two seasons running from this foe type, but in the second two they were actually trying to do something :) also i have never seen such a great fun blend of sexy gals and attitudes in sci-fi. the blue girl - zahn - was cool, but not 'sexy'. they literally got to the point where the gals were running around in leather corsets and high heels blasting aliens - now tell me, what could be cooler than that??? :))the real reason farscape went off for a bit is because it was costing too much - and that is a good thing for the fans, because the show, watched end to end, is really like a 60 hour long epic movie, with all the cinematics of the blockbuster stuff (ok ok they do use similar sets a lot, but the cg is great and the gals are sexxxy).blah blah - the real reason is because tv shows are about profit. it is a business, and the sci fi channel or whoever was not getting as big a return on this expensive farscape show as they could with junk shows like 'stargate'. lexx was actually cool until they got rid of the hot german girl and replaced her with this bizarre fat-lipped oddity.anyway yes, remember this: farscape kept getting better and better, until it was really like a little real movie each week. then the networks decided 'hey people will watch any old piece of drek we shove on the air as long as it is the only sci fi thing on at that hour, so why are we spending all this money on farscape, let's shove cheesy low-budget 'stargate' down people's throats and call it a 'hit series' because it's like all we play every darn night lol :))that's the way it goes. also i gotta tell ya that claudia black is a really cool actress. after she got her facelift (got the baggy eyes tightened) she was looking really cool - one of those dynamic types like judy davis, and sometimes hot looking, sometimes ugly - like a roller coaster ride. i'd par claudia black with lucy lawless in style and substance - both very fun to watch - not just chrichton :) and yeah you may say the pregnancy thing was cheesy, but how many sci fi shows have a believable and deep romantic subplot that actually goes somewhere and progresses?? it was legitimately cool as a romance story - the actors on the show are great. it really is a shame the show is in limbo for now, but i hope it comes back in more episodes soon and movies as well, because i will deffinately buy them! :-d

i have to tell you i've been a fan of star trek tng since i was a kid.well, sometime ago i gave a friend of mine some ds9 episodes and i asked him"hey man, what are you watching lately because i'm done watching all tng episodes" he said. "well, i got these episodes of farscape". i said: "ok, let me try it" i was pretty sure at that time that i wont like it because i was just finised watching tng and found it great."i had 3 episodes, viewed those but the show didn't impressed me very much, i found it childish initially and i thought its just another tv show, nice adventures but regular. music was a little bit different, neat special effects though and i had the vague impression that the actors didn't fully get into the characters skin.i watched another 3 episodes thinking that 3 eps were not enough to decide i like or not since. then the show started to get me, i got a good grasp of the action and wanted to see what happened next to the poor crichton....the rest is history. i think i mostly like the freedom of the characters in the context of the action unlike star trek where everybody slept when they were supposed to do and way too much high tech bullshit. the show got better with each episode, very interesting story line.....what can i say, this movie its like poetry. i highly recommend it!!!

this series is vastly underrated. like many others, i came upon farscape after the series had been cancelled. bought season 1 and was surprised to find a smartly written drama infused with a balanced mix of suspense, romance, wit and, of course, sci-fi. right off the bat it got a 10 for being the first series or movie to satisfy us how our hero - and every alien with whom he comes in contact - speaks english! okay, a few others have skirted the issue, but farscape did it the best. the point is, the writers pay close attention to detail to make the show as believable as possible.with so much bad programming out there, it's a shame that balanced, entertaining series such as farscape don't get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production. while we enjoy the four seasons and, thankfully, the four-hour miniseries, maybe we can make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show.

farscape - is the one sci-fi show which restarted the interest in science fiction in me.but farscape is so much more then plain and simple sci-fi. comedy, drama and much more :) the acting is very good. luckily farscape survived also it's cancellation and showed with peacekeeper wars that it is not dead yet :) i hope there is a future for farscape :) in my opinion it is also not problematic that some of the characters in the show are muppets. you have to look behind that and you will see what a beauty farscape is.farscape set a new standard in television and i think it will be truly hard for new shows to prove that they can be equal or better than farscape. i love this show :)saphirjd

when i first saw the premiere episode of farscape, i had no idea what to expect. i was immensely impressed and satisfied with "premiere". subsequent re-watches, however, have made numerous flaws apparent to me that i missed initially. "premiere" is not a great farscape episode, but it deserves credit for successfully and efficiently setting up the plot and giving the basic back stories to many of the regular characters.the episode begins with john crichton (ben browder), an astronaut and scientist, preparing to launch into space in the farscape module, a small space ship perfected by crichton and his friend dk. crichton has a revealing conversation with his father, jack crichton, and then begins his test flight in space. of course, everything goes wrong and crichton is "shot through a wormhole" and winds up in "a distant part of the galaxy".after exiting the wormhole, crichton's module is pulled on board a living space ship. from here, the characters and story line for the farscape series are introduced in an entertaining albeit rushed manner.the regular characters are properly introduced during the first half of the episode. of course, there is crichton, played well by ben browder. he offers a the audience a sympathetic character to identify with. he's lost and has no idea how to do much of anything. in "premiere", crichton has to choose between joining the prisoners or the peacekeepers. he knows nothing at all about either side, but in helping aeryn (a captured peacekeeper pilot) it becomes clear that he intends to help the peacekeepers. he probably would not have ended up siding with the prisoners if it hadn't been for crais, a peacekeeper captain, declaring crichton to be the murderer of his brother. this puts crichton in an interesting situation: he's stuck with bizarre, violent escaped prisoners in a far-off galaxy about which he knows nothing at all. crichton's total lack of knowledge of the farsape world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during farscape's first season.the supporting cast is just as compelling. there's zhaan, a blue delvian and former prisoner. she's peaceful and reasonable, as opposed to fellow prisoner ka d'argo, a powerful and hard-headed warrior. virginia hey is totally covered in blue makeup, allowing her character of zhaan to appear cool and convincing. d'argo's mega-makeup, in contrast, is below-par. he looks kind of silly with his giant tentacles and strange nose, and there is something peculiar about his eyes. they look as if they have had some sort of allergic reaction to his makeup. farscape would give some improvements to his makeup in season 1, but the overall costume would, for me at least, remain as a problem until season 2.the puppet/digital characters of rygel and pilot are, to put it simply, excellent. rygel is a tiny hynerian dominar who floats around on some sort of hovercraft. in "premiere" he is given some good dialogue but not much else. pilot nearly steals the show as the liaison between the living ship, moya, and moya's passengers. even in the first episode, pilot gives off the appearance of being a real, living alien; he never once in the show seems to be a giant, expensive machine.the peacekeeper characters introduced are quite interesting as well. the peacekeepers are made up of a race called sebaceans, who look just like humans. the chief antagonist is introduced in "premiere" as captian crais, who believes that crichton killed his brother. in reality, crais's brother's death was merely an accident resulting from an accidental collision with crichton's ship. aeryn sun, a pilot who crichton helps escape, tries to explain that the death was an accident, but crais just claims that she is "irreversiby contaminated" and refused to change his mind. crais obsession for revenge, warranted or not (it should be clear to crais that crichton isn't responsible), is mysterious in "premiere", but would be explained later in the season. aeryn herself provides an extremely interesting character. by being forced to leave the peacekeepers, she changes her whole way of life, and is in that regard in a similar (though less severe) situation as crichton.the actual episode, as mentioned earlier, feels somewhat rushed and clunky. so much happens that not enough time is spent on anything. also, d'argo (for now) looks kind of silly running around in his mediocre costume trying to appear menacing. still, "premiere" is solid entertainment. the special effects (such as in the starburst sequences) are impressive. most of the costumes and the sets on board moya are original. despite its flaws, "premiere" is a must-see for farscape fans. 3/4

watching this series will probably make you feel like how our parents felt when watching star trek for the first time.this series has it all. the kind of stories that makes you forget how to blink, the kind of characters that makes you want to jump into the tv to join the action, and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair curdle in awe and endless admiration.in short, we start out with john chrichton, an astronaut, who gets shot into a wormhole and ends up with a gang of prisoners on the run from the badguys in black, ironically known as peacekeepers.other colorful characters consists of d'argo, big dude with a short temper and a sword/laser-rifle. aerun sun, former peacekeeper and a ph.d in buttkicking. zotoh zhan, who's a plant. no really, she is. she's also a priest, but with a mean streak. there's also dominar rygel xvi, an fat lazy bastard who farts helium and generally does more harm than good.later in the series we meet the most sexy alien that has ever been on television, namely chiana. a young and seemingly chronically horny nebari. she is played by gigi edgley, which is a name you should remember.one of the many things i love about these series is that since john chrichton ended up in this part of the galaxy by mistake, he keeps giving references to "real life". namely, when john is having a bit of difficulty accepting the fact that he will be frozen as a statue for 80 years, one of his many complaint is that when he returns, buffy the vampire slayer will be dead.so frell all the other series, get your dren together and spend an ahn on one of these episodes. i can assure you, sci/fi as you know it, will change forever.this series has it all. it's sexy. it's actionpacked. it's hillarious. it's farscape

i found this film rather brilliant. initially i wanted a "when animals attack" flick along the lines of "frankenfish" or even "rogue" but was delivered a truly horrific ordeal that was not devoid of humanity. having been to the areas this was made (including the croc farm at the start of the movie, even sharing the same guide!) it added to the fear factor. those crocs really are everywhere up there, though i don't think they had the "attitude" of this beastie. yes there were some melodramatic moments but they contributed rather distract from the whole atmosphere. i genuinely cared for the characters and shuddered contemplating "what would i do?" in their boat. not knowing where your enemy lurked or the sound of the croc chowing down at night was genuinely frightening. i would argue that this flick is one of the best horrors i have seen in years (coming close to the descent). i give it four alligator handbags.

this film is about so many things. most obvious is the hold that film can have over an audience and how capturing life on film can be a kind of magic. there is also the tense relationship between china and the west as many chinese saw (probably rightly so) the "barbarians" as trying to take over and pollute their way of life. liu even seeks to preserve their way of life on film because he sees that it will one day disappear. their is also liu's internal conflict between the loyalties and traditions of china versus the self-determination philosophy of the west. all these themes are woven quite skillfully into a coherent and enjoyable whole by hu. a very enjoyable film.

gentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a triviality...and to be fair the narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as drama....but i feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on an alien and sceptical society have a radiance and naturalness which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years. immensely sympathetic performance from jared harriss (who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charisma...hopefully without poor richards penchant for hellraising and haminess)....and charming offbeat cuteness from costar yu xia combine to make this a real heartwarmer. radiant location photography (including glowingly beautiful scenes at the great wall) and sensitive direction by ann hu give film added impact. in short a must for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow flickering to life...and making magic in the dark.

a very sweet movie about a young chinese man enamored of western technology and an englishman trying to make his fortune showing movies in china. it's a very interesting story that is presumably based on true events, although i'm assuming it's more fantasy than real. it's got a fairy tale quality you rarely get in real life, and it's also got 8 people credited for the script, so they must have been making up stuff right and left.this is a very likable movie that conveys how magical film was to people who had never seen it before. it is not an especially deep movie, touching briefly on the loss of tradition and the encroachment of western culture but mainly just being a pleasant little movie. it's actually a movie i enjoyed very much that is already beginning to disappear from my mind 15 minutes after seeing it. light as a souffl√©, but i enjoyed every minute.

the episode begins with scenes of a dead woman bather washed up on the shore, a forlorn jim strolling along the beach lost in reverie and a night ride home that ends in murder and mystery. yep,this is an atmospheric little number with a super twist at the end. jim does well to unravel what is, a priori, an inexplicable case of a woman going missing 20 seconds after she enters her home. to be sure, the eventual explanation is a little far-fetched. why, for example, go to the lengths of substituting a woman midway thru a car journey when simply rubbing her and her companions out would've been as easy and left less of a trail. however, these niggles aside, it's a memorable trf episode full of invention, even if yet again jim gets put in the frame by an ever suspicious police dept. i mean to say, have the ungrateful so-and-so's ever sat down and counted just how many of their files have been solved by dear ol' jimbo?

this is a very noir kind of episode. it begins with jim returning from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend, the recently divorced karen mills (pat delaney--daughter in law of john huston, who knew a few things about noir film) and her daughter. when they arrive, karen goes in the house while jim picks up her daughter from the back seat and carries her up to her room. he then discovers karen has disappeared without a trace. of course he calls dennis and when the police arrive, they see no sign of karen, but find her next door neighbor murdered in the bushes. so of course that makes jim an immediate suspect.this is a great little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by rocky asking jim to go over the story once again. rocky suggests that by jim telling him the story he might remember a little detail that he didn't think was important at the time, but now might lead to a clue as to what happened. it's a really well written scene and completes the transition of the rocky character from a grifter to a concerned parent. it also goes a long way to show that rocky isn't just some clueless old man either. as he says "you come to me because i'm your father. and i'm smarter than you!" this is one of those times where we see where jim got his smarts.this episode also features an appearance by hottie lara parker, who played angelique in the "dark shadows" series and went on to play laura banner, bruce's wife in the "incredible hulk" series a few years later. she looks terrific here.this episode also marks the first mention of the minette crime family, a name that would keep popping up on the rockford files almost whenever they needed a mob family. this time, its vincent minette who rockford helps apprehend.lt. diehl (tom atkins) makes his first appearance on the series and dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant that he was on the earlier season one episodes to a police sargent. i guess they figured it would be better to have dennis less powerful and add some conflict between jim and the police. frankly, they were right, though i prefer the later lt. chapman to lt. diehl. not a lot of the typical "rockford" humor in this episode, but a good mystery with a lot of heart.

barely three and a half years after just scraping out a month's run (7-31 oct. 1953) at broadway's coronet theatre (on west 49th street; since renamed the o'neill), mgm relied on the earlier solid london success of the play to lavish a wonderful cast and - for the most part - carefully "opened up" production on a sadly trimmed down screenplay of this slyly subversive boulevard comedy and were rewarded with a modest hit.ava gardner is the increasingly frustrated wife of stewart granger, an internationally successful and entirely complacent "workaholic" (before the term had been coined) using the perpetually frustrated david niven to attempt to rekindle passion in her spouse. when the "second honeymoon" cruise gardner inveigles granger into leaves the trio (and granger's dog) marooned on a south sea island (were there other survivors? that's for later plot developments), granger continues right on managing the world around him - building a big hut for himself and his wife and a little one of the title for niven - or the unattached male.the core of the actual plot of the play only gets going about half way through the film when niven proposes that granger and he alternate as tenants of the little hut - sharing the only female on the island as granger has been willing to share the only pair of shoes (his).reason (which granger considers his strong point) reigns and frustration reigns supreme - for a while.david niven and ava gardner are superb in their appointed roles of suave would-be seducer and seductress, and stuart granger - usually called upon merely to be handsome and virile in action roles and the odd miscast specialty (a crowing pretty-boy as apollodorus in shaw's caesar and cleopatra in 1945) - gives one of the better acting performances of his film career as the husband who may actually be as smart as he thinks he is. 33 years later he would again show this suave urbanity opposite rex harrison in granger's first (and both their last) broadway engagements in a hit revival of somerset maugham's the circle which only ended with harrison's death. we'd be far richer if granger had used these skills more often.as promising as the menage is, this is, after all, a very british boulevard comedy and hollywood in the 1950's which is to say that (unlike the source play) very little sex actually goes on. to be frank, if you don't give yourself over to the ideas driving the contrivances it does get a bit silly (the same basic plot is far more satisfyingly developed three years later in the cary grant/deborah kerr/robert mitchum/jean simmons (stewart granger's actual wife) the grass is greener, based on an even less successful play, but for some reason that superior trifle failed at the box office).as lavishly as mgm set the piece, there were unfortunate lapses - the silliness which ends the stay on the island is cartoonishly presaged in what should have been a moment of genuine excitement - the sinking of the yacht that puts them on the island. ultimately we only get about three quarters of an hour of the real little hut, but ninety good minutes of david niven, ava gardner and stewart granger that make the film a fun diversion. not high culture, but a worthy guilty pleasure.we even get some very nice garnish in walter chiari (reputed to be ava's actual lover at the time). as one of his better speeches goes: "boola, boola!"

a fun filled romp, full of silly if not sometimes cruel jokes. not the best of movies, but definitely well worth watching. david niven and stewart granger are their usual charming selves with granger as an especially delightful and ingenious gentleman. ava gardner as wonderful as always, with such a delightful character that is absolutely iresistable. the story line is typical, but full of jocular surprises, especially concerning the unconventional relationships between granger, gardner and niven.

bergman and comedy don't quite go together. some of his comedies are so naff you almost wince. this film has the odd naff moment - the last 30 seconds being the nadir, but on the whole this is a charming (rather than funny) piece, enjoyable throughout. bergman casts several of his usual suspects who perform well. there is a great scene on the train between david, marianne and an uncouth salesman which will stick in the memory. some of the marriage material is typical, cynical bergman, but this is bergman in a light rather than dark mood.this film has its moments and is worth the 90-odd minutes. not one of his classics and not the place to start if you want to fall for bergman.

bergman is a sublime comedy director and writer. this fact becomes apparent in "en lektion i k√§rlek", where the comic elements range from pure slapstick to deep, yet very emotional scenes. this movie is paves the way for bergman's later comedies "sommarnattens leende" and "kvinnodr√∂m", all of them starring gunnar bj√∂rnstrand as well as eva dahlbeck. this is an excellent movie with which to start your bergman experience, acutely portraying emotional troubles of the young as well as the old. the cinematography by martin bodin is astounding, for instance in the picnic scene. in short, the movie is a perfect example of a successful comedy, with a clarity of depth even surpassing some of bergman's own comedies.

to say i wasn't expecting much sitting down to watch "the couch trip" is an understatement. i had no idea what it was about - i thought it was going to be a journey into the realm of sexuality when i heard chevy chase played a condom man and the movie's title involves the word "couch trip," *wink, wink.* then i figured out that it had something to do with a mental institute and a patient escaping. my expectations dropped even lower.i was literally expecting a grin movie - the type where you grin once and walk out feeling a bit cheated. and in a way, this is cheap comedy - it doesn't have the greatest gags, the plot is ludicrous, but you know what? i had a big dumb smile on my face the entire time i was watching it.dan aykroyd plays john burns, a patient at a mental hospital who may or may not actually be mental. he gives the psychiatrist, lawrence baird (david clennon), plenty of grief and misery, which leads us to believe he is a sane person after all.following a little bit of a riot in the mental institute's cafeteria, burns is awaiting a tongue-lashing from baird in his office when the phone rings. burns picks it up, pretends to be baird, and finds out the caller on the other line, harvey michaels (richard romanus), wants the real dr. baird to come fill in for a radio shrink named george maitlin (charles grodin), who is taking a vacation with his wife, vera (mary gross). michaels wants baird so bad he has even booked him a ticket on an airplane.burns escapes the institute with the help of a receptionist, and drives to o'hare. he gets dr. baird's ticket, gets on the plane, and eventually poses on the air as dr. baird. his show is a phenomenal success. "people love him!" one man says, and the other man replies, "it's because he actually cares about them."donald becker (the late, great walter matthau) is an ex-mental patient who recognizes burns' clothes to be confinement-issued pants and shirts. to keep him quiet, burns promises becker a percentage of his income. the secret is kept closed.meanwhile, maitlin and his wife get in an argument. he flies home to end his vacation short and realizes that the man on his talk show is not, in fact, dr. baird after all, but no one believes him. he gets the real dr. baird, but unfortunately he has lost his id so the police take them as nutcases and don't listen to their story.let me name just a few of the plot holes i noticed while watching this film: burns poses as dr. baird, but is never asked for his id, even when claiming his plane ticket (he was robbed, he says, but they would still make sure he is baird). if burns becomes so very famous, how come the real dr. baird in chicago never heard people talking about him? word travels. and finally, why would the police ever arrest maitlin and baird (the real baird, that is) without following up on their stories?to be frankly honest, i couldn't care less. i went into this movie with a closed mind and it surprised me - i really liked it. it entertained me. its ideas are essentially ludicrous and not at all realistic, but dan aykroyd gives a truly spirited performance as a half-a-loon that makes "the couch trip" a trip worth taking. 3.5/5 stars -john ulmer

this is a strange, little, forgotten movie from the late eighties. it's one of those "large-cast kitchen sink" movies that delivers some good gags. if you like the people in this one, give it a shot.

this film came as a gift - a late-night offering out of the blue - so unlike other reviewers i had no preconceptions whatsoever. i found myself glued to my seat as the film slowly dictated its own rhythm, its own unfolding. i was drawn to acknowledge my own deep love and humanity as i willed for "good" to prevail - but also forced to wryly acknowledge that sometimes i was on the side of the "bad" guys. the film is quite quite beautiful - the word "elegiac" comes to mind, and this more than because the film begins and ends in an elegy. far from being depressing or confronting, to me, the film acknowledges deep suffering - and then, by its cyclic nature - with the births and re-births as well as the deaths - the film celebrates the fact that to quote an aussie poet, there is "sometimes gladness." oh gods, i feel as tho i've just written a love letter to this film - but there it is. hola!

i was very lucky to see this film as part of the melbourne international film festival 2005 only a few days ago. i must admit that i am very partial to movies that focus on human relations and especially the ones which concentrate on the tragic side of life. i also love the majority of scandinavian cinematic offerings, there is often a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn. character building in this film is extraordinary in its details and its depth. this is despite the fact that we do encounter quite a number of characters all with very particular personal situations and locations within their community. the audience at the end of the screening was very silent and pensive. i am still playing some of those scenes in my mind and i am still amazed at their power and meaningfulness.

so far miguel bardem's career it's been one of the more dreadful of recent spanish cinema. he's made nothing but rubbish... until now. "incautos" has been quite a surprise: it's a serious film, with rhythm, with a great cast and very entertaining.the art of robbing, that's what "incautos" is about. a film much alike to david mamet's "house of game" and stuff like that. a thousand of twists in the script, and a story where nothing's like it seems.the weak points in latest bardem's movie may be the so-american language, that makes some of the characters look rather unnatural (especially victoria abril's. she's a hell of an actress, but in "incautos" she looks a little bit forced). ernesto alterio is not that bad, but he's not half as good actor as his father... and what to say about luppi?? well, he's the man.in short: a good movie. the best that miguel bardem has ever made. i hope this is the beginning of a brand new stage in his career.*my rate: 7/10

ernesto is a man that makes a living out of duping other solid citizens of their hard earned money. together with manco, an older man with a lot of experience, he pulls out capers that allow him to make a decent living, but that is not making him a rich man by any means. enter federico, an older man who is more experience in the art of deception. together with the younger ernesto they prove a winning combination. that only lasts until pilar, federico's former love interest, appears in the picture.this spanish film directed by miguel bardem, is light in tone and pleasant to sit through. other, better made caper films have been made with much clever plots than this one, but the film is easy to take, and at times, it has a lot of funny situations.this viewer will see federico luppi in anything, even reading the telephone directory! he is an actor's actor. we have had the privilege of having seen him in the buenos aires stage doing excellent work before his international film career. as federico, he does what he does best. it's impossible to imagine anyone better in his role. ernesto alterio, the son of hector alterio, is a young actor who promises to have a great career. victoria abril makes pilar fun as she gets involved with these con men. miguel alexandre, a veteran actor, is also good as manco.

actually, i have more a question, than a comment. i loved z-boys, and the lords of dogtown. saw lords first, then the doc, and while i loved the story, i am curious as to why in the movie, sid was an important character, but in the documentary, he wasn't part of the team, and only merely mentioned as just some kid they knew. does anyone know the story on that? the story of these boys was amazing. i never experienced the skateboarding craze where i grew up, but my kids have enjoyed it. what i have seen in local skate parks is what these boys had invented. i never knew that. when the film showed the competition, and z-boys did their thing, they put to shame the others in competition.

right there. good, entertaining and accurate era-feel to most scenes. enough personality variations to cover the real people around those days without story distractions from the exceptions. the credits show peralta from mar vista, california.. up the hill from venice and south of malibu. i lived there in the heartbreak hotel days, pre-beachboys, next to that surfer kid bob cooper up on wasatch avenue, where the alley was used to burn surfboards that didn't work. old skatekey skatewheels were used on plywood cutouts to roll down sidewalk waves. things were different in each succeeding decade as the cool innocence of the fifties broke into the warmth of the sun whitewater freedom and exhilaration of the electric sixties and then into the assertively innovative playtime and inventive evolutionary madness of the weird seventies. the movie gives you a piece of that kind of magic moment in time; in a place where the imaginary wave was real.. the source of culturally significant influences. and btw, there's another movie that has a similarly american street edginess to it, and has the same genuinely unique goodness with laid back realness that helps refine that elusively eternal sense of cool.. "two lane blacktop" (with one of the best examples of freesouldoit attitude in west coast california history.. dennis wilson). like monte hellman did with that one, thanks, sp, for being right there with this one. gwr

i hate films about sports. i guess the pre-fabricated hollywood sports film is a bit tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year, what i am trying to say is that there isn't much creativity in this genre. use exhibit "a" ¬ñ "the game plan" as evidence of this if you want. so, needless to say, i was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element, but at the same time i couldn't wait because i love surfing documentaries like "step into liquid" and "billabong odyssey". i took a step, i plunged into the unknown, and to be honest, at first i wasn't happy. i didn't like the direction, the people, or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs. with my first viewing, i thought that history couldn't be fully recorded, so i thought stacy peralta was splicing stock footage with faux-actors acting like they were from the late 70s. the music was intense, it matched well peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment, but the visuals were anything but stimulating. the elongated scenes, while using amazing music to support, just seemed flushed and too long for my attention. i wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool. i wanted a combination of who these kids were, where they went during their rise of fame, and where they are now. it felt like i was watching the birth of our nation with a great score to the settlers just rowing their boats all day. i wanted to know the men behind the myths.then, with a thought that i would have another negative review under my belt, i watched the film again with peralta's audio commentary. his passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished "wow-ed" me. this suddenly transformed into the film i wanted to see. peralta lets us know more of where these kids are today, what they are still doing, and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera. he hadn't seen many of them in 20+ years, so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface. he was sincere; he was sympathetic, yet he showed so much dedication to this project. while i do not agree with everything that he chose to do (i.e. the sean penn mess up is not punk rock), he revitalized this film for me. it was due to this commentary that i rate this film much higher than originally thought.jay adams. tony alva. jeff ho. peggy oki. wentzle ruml. these are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned, and continually praised, if skateboarding is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees. while tony hawk's name sells products, it is these guys, these mild-mannered pavement slackers that redefined an entire sport. sure, others were probably doing it in the stone ages, but these guys did it with style, grace, and moved it to the next level. this was a hobby for them, but it also propelled them in a direction i believe none of them were ready for. "dogtown and z-boys" is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted, and about friendship. we have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity, and this is definitely a story that should be added to that. i cannot say that i loved this film, nor will i, but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend. it was sad, it was emotional, and these guys aren't multi-millionaires over again ¬ñ they are people with a passion, and very rarely do you see that in documentaries.overall, i cannot watch this film again, but i will suggest it to friends and family time after time. i think the downfall for this film, to me, was the filming ¬ñ the attempts to be avant-garde with the style, which ultimately drew away from the characters and events. as mentioned before, there were some elements that dragged on too much, which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now. peralta obviously had a passion for this sport, for the people, but he seemed out-of-focus at times. the music was intense, and worked perfectly with the film. sean penn, while he was decent with his voice-over, wasn't needed at all. they could have spent the money elsewhere. on the positive, the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing. peralta's voice, instead of penn's, brings a stronger human element to the scene, while he tells us better stories of the people, places, and events. watch this film, but don't expect to be blown away. listen to the audio commentary; i think you will be impressed.grade: *** ¬Ω out of *****

my son, an avid skateboarder, sat me down and made me watch this with him. as i love documentaries, it didn't take a whole lot of pressure on his part. the whole amazing story of it all - a bunch of dirt-poor kids drift together and end up creating something revolutionary out of thin air - well, more out of some wood, wheels and lack of waves to surf - it just floored me. it still does. i didn't think i would enjoy it the way i did, nor did i think i would tear up watching stacey peralta tear up over the fate of jay adams. and just watching jay adams himself.....the sheer genius of the kid skating and the shrug of the adult remembering. i watched it again last night for what has to be the 10th time and i still get goosebumps watching him fly down the hill with jimi hendrix's "freedom" playing in the background. and i teared up, again. not too many movies have the same impact with me after several viewings. brilliant.

dogtown and z-boys is a documentary about the zephyr skateboarding team, and their influence on skateboarding. it also focuses on the history of skateboarding. it was directed by stacy peralta, a member of the original zephyr team, and was written by stacy peralta and craig stecyk, another member of the team. the documentary stars the members of the zephyr team and is narrated by sean penn.the documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding, and how it evolved from surfing. it discusses skateboarding's popularity in the late 60s and the 70s, its decline in the 80s and its 'rebirth' in the 90s. skateboarding was introduced in dogtown, the nickname of the poor side of santa monica, california. the zephyr team originated from the zephyr surf shop, which manufactured the first modern skateboards. the documentary mainly consists of the original zephyr team members talking about the past in the zephyr team, the competitions they won, and their popularity and prestige. it focuses on three particular members of the team; peralta, tony alva, and jay adams, three virtuosos of skateboarding, and probably the best three members of the team.the interviews in the documentary were usually voices over archival footage from dogtown in the late 60s and 70s. very rarely to you actually see the people being interviewed, but when you do, they are shown in black and white, while the archival footage was in colour. i think stacy peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past (i.e. the glory days of the zephyr team) and not the present. the documentary is very fast paced, in that we often see clips of impressive skateboarding over up-beat music of the era (such as jimi hendrix, led zeppelin and david bowie), and the interviews tend to be quick and to the point. knowing nothing about skateboarding (i.e. not even knowing how to ride one straight along the ground) i was very surprised that i found this documentary so interesting. the reason is that this doco was more about the zephyr team than the actual sport of skateboarding, so while i couldn't relate to skateboarding, i could relate to the boys in the team. because it was made by actual members of the team, it gives it a little more depth and authenticity.all in all, i would have to say this is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen. it gave me a whole new insight, not just into the zephyr team, but into skateboarding as a whole. for those who love skateboarding, i can only imagine how it must be even more interesting. seven and a half stars out of ten.

dogtown and z-boyssummary: dogtown and z-boys is a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers that changed the world of surfing and skateboarding in venice (dogtown), california as we know it today. with their low pivotal style, they embarked on a larry bertlemen influenced journey that would lead to countless successes and a couple failures. after the dogtown articles were featured in a reinstated skateboarder magazine, the sport was revamped and the members of the zephyr skateboard team forgot about jeff ho, and looked to be on summer vacation for the rest of their lives by joining other skateboard teams that could afford to pay them like movie stars. the original zephyr skateboard team put together by jeff ho (zephyr surfshop owner) and craig stecyk (photographer) included jay adams, tony alva, stacy peralta, bob biniak, chris cahill, shogo kubo, paul constantineau, jim muir, peggy oki (the only female), nathan pratt, wentzle ruml iv, allen sarlo, and david ray perry. all of the original members except jay adams and chris cahill are still well and surfing/skating. jay adams, at the time of the documentary, was serving time on drug related charges. chris cahill, at the time of the documentary, was last seen in mexico.themes: the themes of this documentary are kind of read-between-the-lines, but if there were a clear-cut theme it would be that even kids can spark revolutions. other themes would include extensive partying in one's past may lead to an unfulfilling future, and by planning and being careful with one's assets a very rewarding future could be at hand.other works: stacy peralta (writer and director) has a fairly wide range of documentaries that he has either written, produced, or directed. most with a common theme of surfing or skateboarding, such as riding giants, sk8 tv, the bones brigrades, and lords of dogtown. he has also done films with a theme of growing up in america as a teenager, films such as: influences: from yesterday to today, crips and bloods: made in america, and the 70s: the decade that changed television.subjects: the subjects of dogtown and z-boys are the original members of the zephyr skateboard team excluding chris cahill. peralta included jeff ho and craig stecyk in the interviews. other subjects were people who grew up during the 70s reading the dogtown articles as well as skateboard enthusiasts. skaters from the dogtown area, but not on the team were interviewed.editing: the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion. there were scenes of the subjects talking so that the audience could see who was speaking and get a sense of the character, but would immediately cutaway to archival footage that would explain what the speaker was saying. when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song old man by neil young was played, which evokes many emotions. sean penn was the narrator for the film and he explained the transitions throughout the film. the film was presented chronologically from the time the zephyr surf team was put together, to creating the skateboard team, to all of the z-boys leaving the team to join other skate companies or create their own company. cinematography: the film was shot in an interesting way. the film of the subjects speaking were all in black and white and all of the archival footage of the z-boys surfing or skating were in color. of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film. the interviewees were mostly shot in the same area it appears, but all were outside. all of the footage was very well-controlled even the archival footage which i found very surprising. music: "seasons of wither"-performed by aerosmith "toys in the attic"-performed by aerosmith "generation landslide"- alice cooper "one way out"- performed by the allman brothers "lollipops and roses" and "whipped cream"-performed by herb alpert "into the void" and "paranoid"- performed by black sabbath "godzilla"- blue oyster cult "aladdin sane" and "rebel rebel"- david bowie "fastcars"- the buzzcocks "gut feeling"- devo "i'll give you money"- peter frampton "funk 49"- james gang "ezy rider" and "foxy lady" and "freedom" and "bold as love"- jimi hendrix "sidewalk surfing"- jan and dean "achilles last stand" and "hot on for nowhere"- led zeppelin "six underground"- the sneaker pimps "surfrider"- the lively ones "cat scratch fever" and "motor city madhouse" and "wang dang sweet poontang- ted nugent "us and them"- pink floyd "bad boys"- the pretenders "maggie may"- rod stewart "i wanna be your dog" and "gimme danger"- the stooges "children of the revolution"- t-rex "bad reputation"- thin lizzy "disco inferno"- the tramps "hannah"- rob trower "rocky mountain way"- joe walsh "old man"- neil young "la grange"- zz topthe music in the film make the movie. every one of these songs contributes to what the subjects are saying and evoke emotions that would not have been called to mind otherwise.

a dozen bored surfers, mostly kids in venice, california, not only reinvent the skateboard but remake a once-forgotten-about suburban fad from the 1950s into an action sports revolution.narrarated by sean penn, dogtown depicts life in the more rundown "locals only" beach communities circa 1974, which consisted of mostly of surfing in the early morning tides and loitering. the zephyr team (or z-boys as they are called) spend one summer combating the boredom by building their own boards with the help of a local who owns a surf shop. after they enter re-emerging skateboarding competitions in socal, they transfigure it all into their own scene; one that rouses a generation of skateboarders consisting of greats like tony hawk, shaun white and the creators of the of x-games.dogtown puts chronological perspective into skateboarding, and the up-from-the-bootstraps history you never knew it had.from andy frye at mysportscomplex.blogspot.com

take a subject i didn't know much about and make it exciting, why don't you? it so happens that back about 1979, director robert altman said that he didn't believe he had ever made a real movie and that he expected that one of these kids riding skateboards--if he doesn't break his neck--will make the first movie. well, i wouldn't put such an expectation on stacy peralta, but he is a skateboarder who has made a good movie. of course, he was forced by the nature of the film he was making to use existing footage, and it is certainly a good thing that so much archival footage existed. peralta edited it together well with not-your-usual talking head shots of his erstwhile colleagues as they are today. the whole effect is post-modern in the best sense, but that has been done. altman's prediction hasn't quite come true. what peralta has done, however, is capture enough of the energy of those heady days that we can appreciate what it must have been like when modern skateboarding was invented by the z-boys. this is all good. i highly recommend "dogtown."

excellent piece of work!i am not a surfer nor a skate board fan, but work this good about sorting sock drawers would have been riveting. a must see!there is a lot to enjoy here. excellent visuals. great sound track mix. huge body of documentary work both pictures and film.the life work and love of the subject is captivating.

solid documentary about edgey kids who first surf then skate in the face of the american dream. sadly some of the youngest and most gifted succumb to the lure of drugs while others become slaves to the crass marketing of their go for broke instincts. few come out on top. but the die is cast and fruit of it all is the new national pastime, skateboarding (the new york times notes that "it was once considered a snub to authority. now, however, skateboarding has its own summer camps, video games, magazines [actually it always had these] and corporate sponsors.") commercialism co-opts another kid birthed cultural node.

in the groovy mid 70's a scruffy bunch of brash young venice, california adolescents from broken homes and the bad side of town known as the z-boys turned the previously staid world of professional skateboarding on its ear with their fierce punk attitude, radical unconventional riding style, and unbridled spirit of pure in-your-face aggression, revolutionizing the sport in the process and paving the way for the many extreme variations on sports that popped up in their influential wake. director stacy peralta, who's one of the legendary z-boys himself, relates the incredible exploits of this amazing ragtag crew in a ferociously punchy and visceral manner that's both informative and wildly entertaining: the snappy rapid-fire editing, ceaseless speedy pace, and raw, gritty photography deliver one hell of an infectiously kinetic buzz, projecting a sense of sheer joy and full-on bustling energy that's a total pleasure to behold. better still, this documentary neither sanitizes nor romanticizes its subjects: these rough'n'scrappy lads were so fiercely competitive and out for themselves that they all went their separate ways when the lure of fame and fortune manifested in their lives. the ultimate fates of certain guys is poignant and heartbreaking, with gifted and spontaneous ace skateboard rat jay adams rating as the saddest and most tragic: he blew his chance at the big time and wound up doing time in jail. the other dudes are very colorful and personable as well; charismatic ball of cocky and defiant fire tony alva in particular comes across as one arrogant, yet impressive piece of furiously assertive work. marvelously narrated with delightfully easy'n'breezy nasal nonchalance by sean penn. the terrific rock soundtrack likewise seriously smokes. but what really makes this documentary such a winner is its refreshing complete dearth of pretense: it's every bit as dynamic, exuberant and larger-than-life extraordinary as the gloriously outrageous z-boys themselves.

this film to me deserves a lot of praise, because even though i am not a surfer or skater, i remained inspired throughout the whole documentary.the depth of history and development of these two extreme sports emphasised what they were able to do for two groups of individuals. the dedication that these individuals had/have is truly inspiring and it was because of them that others can now enjoy and do what these guys founded.unlike most other documentaries, this one was cleverly put together, the amount of footage that was recorded and survived throughout the decades is outstanding and it was because of this that some of the greatest editing i have ever seen was put together and resulted in the subject remaining focused. without the urge for them to retort to recent footage of the more famous surfers and skaters that remains popular today.the film explores areas such as the success, such accomplishing new tricks, winning competitions and gathering fame. as well as failures such as injury or burning out.it was also fulfilling to hear the experiences come from the skaters and surfers themselves and not from second hand information. this resulted in a better picture to be drawn.overall, a truly outstanding effort.

i saw this movie on the lowlands festival (23, 24, 25th of august) after a friend of mine said this is a very cool movie about the history of skating. i didn't now what to expect from this movie. was it recorded by a couple of skaters who thought they could do a couple of cool tricks, or was it a documentary about skating.so i went in, after waiting for about an hour, whit out any expectations.this movie is really a nice piece of work about the beginning of skateboarding. it started with the zephyr team, who where a fine group of surfers. this is taking place in a not so nice area to live in. at a certain point the waves are not so good any more to surf on. so they try something else. skateboarding was a fact. if you were a part of the zephyr team in that time, you where one of the cool guys/girls. because a lot of people saw an escape from the place they were living in with the zephyr team. so they were trying all there new tricks now on a skateboard. in no time skateboarding was popular again. there were a couple of competitions and one national competition. the zephyr team was taking part on several competition and also the national one. but what they were doing on there skateboards was unbelievable. but the jury didn't now how to judge them. so they put the whole skateboarding world on it's head.anyway i can tell you the rest of the film/documentary, but you must see this one with you're own eyes. because then you can feel the vibe of this movie. this movie got a lot of style for me, so i rewarded it with a 8.greetings from gijs and the rest of holland. see you.

this film moved me at age 39 in the same way that all the footage and coverage of dogtown affected me when i was 13. for all of those who criticized the self promotion of the z boys interviewed, they have the last laugh on you. that was their whole deal, "we're better than all of you and here's why....(insert footage of the smoothest pool carve imaginable)" this was a film to tell their story and that was their story whether you like it or not. it was their opinion of their skating that mattered..... not yours or mine. i thought the film captured their attitude and influence exactly as i remembered it in the 70's. the reality is that they did revolutionize skateboarding, they were the impetus behind extreme sports and they did inject a cultural paradigm that reached into every corner of americana. this movie gave rebirth to images of bertleman on a wave and alva and jay adams ripping up the coping that was the california dream to an entire culture of young american teenagers that just wanted to have fun and get rad! as i watched this film i realized that it was these images that i lived with every day until i was old enough to move out and back down to so cal after my family had moved to nor cal when i was five. until i could get back, my buddies and i built and thrashed ramp after ramp, searched for every empty pool possible and mimicked everything stecyk covered about these guys. we are all educated and have family's and careers now but this film reminds me who i was at that age and why i still surf. this is an inspired film that anyone who has an interest in pop culture, extreme sports, the 70's or even just good documentary film making will enjoy completely. whenever it comes on cable i can't change the channel. kudos to stacy peralta for making a beautiful piece of art!

i remember when skateboarding had it's rebirth in the 70s. i begged my parents for money to by a second-hand skateboard from a friend. it was a piece of junk, complete with clay wheels and everything. i also remember reading skateboarder magazine and being both completely impressed and totally terrified of the dogtown crew. skating never became a way of life for me, but in some ways it has always been a part of my life, whether it is using a board for transportation or just having a bunch of friends that skate.this film is a brilliant documentary of the real birth of modern day skating. watching this crew turn skating from the flat boring hobby it was into the vertical lifestyle it has become had me sitting slack-jawed for 90 minutes. it's amazing that enough footage from this period still exists to have created this film, and thank god for that. the footage is brilliant. it gave me the feeling of watching an old buster keaton film: i've seen some of the tricks keaton did repeated countless times in other films since then, but when you go back and see the first person to perform that trick it's amazing that, not only were they the first person to try it successfully, but that they lived through it and made it seem effortless. that's the feeling this film gave me. yeah, i've seen people skate pools before, but to watch the first people skating pools and inventing the tricks that eventually became the basics of modern skating is like watching the facade of the house fall on keaton, leaving him standing safely in the frame of a window. it's absolutely brilliant to watch something that, up until that point, had never been tried before, but since, has been tried by almost everyone.this film is beautiful to watch and incredible to listen to. the soundtrack is one of the best i've ever heard in a film. this is a film that will appeal to people whether they like skating or not. i've talked to a couple of friends of mine who made their girlfriends sit through this film after heavy protest, and they all said that their girlfriends were mesmerized by the end of the film and loved it as much as they did. as for the previous comments on this board that complain about the film being too self congratulatory, i think that's an unfair disparagement. i liked seeing these guys get excited about their past. they created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever. they have the right to pat themselves on the back. they were stars for doing what they loved to do. most of these guys/girls never achieved the staggering success tony hawk enjoys today, but that kind of success wasn't available to skaters then. sure, they had some success, but more importantly, they have been able to live a life doing what they love to do, and, as we see in the end, almost all of them still surf, skate or work in the surf/skate industry. how many of us can say that we have been able to live our lives and have been successful by breaking all the rules and doing what we love to do? they can. my hat's off to the dogtown and z-boys for being themselves and changing the world of skateboarding forever.

this is one of the greatest documentaries i've ever seen along with "dark days". i have skated for maybe an hour my entire life, and i still love this movie. peralta and his excellent editor captured the feeling and atmosphere perfectly, helped in part with some incredible archival footage. tony alva is one of the coolest individuals in existence. love those knee high striped sport socks, you rock tony!not only is this movie a visual feast, but the soundtrack has to be one of the best in history, if you're into 70's rock. buy the dvd, you won't regret it.

i have seen this movie twice now on cable. the first time i saw it, it caught me by suprise. the skaters i was seeing were the guys we followed in the pages of skateboarder magazine back in the late 70's. these were the guys we copied and tried to become while skating. i am glad that a film was finally made that gives an accurate account of how it all came to be. i am almost 40 years old now and i guess a pretty uptight kind of guy with all of life's problems, however; this film did a great job of taking me back. back to the vacant pools, the backyard halfpipes and the road trips to cherry hill nj. i suspect that in order to really understand this movie and appreciate it, you had to live it. otherwise, it probably won't have the impact on you as it did me. but for those of you (and you know who you are), who did live it, you know exactly what i am talking about! in any event, i don't care who you are, if you get a chance to see this movie...do it! i give thanks to the z-boys of dogtown for the memories of my youth and thanks to stacy for making this movie! job well done!

let me say first of all that i spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard before i realized i was totally uncoordinated. i've always thought it was cool watching cats that know how to get extreme on 'em do their stuff, but i've never been a skateboarder and have never really followed the sport. that being said, i thought this was a very informative and interesting documentary. some reviewers have said that these dudes were sort of waving their own flag a bit, but what the hell? it looks to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as anyone for giving the skateboarding world a jolt and they've provided some good footage of their innovations to back it up. it's great the way viewers are allowed to see these guys both then and now and the footage they shot while they were teens growing up in california provides some interesting nostalgia that goes a bit beyond the sport of skating. i never would have realized where extreme skating came from, but this films sort of ties all the pieces together and gives us an informative documentary. i'm sure it's at least a tad biased, but aren't all documentaries? worth watching for anyone interested in the sport or, as in my case, anyone who grew up in the 1970's.

this documentary traces the origins and life of the zephyr skateboard team, using original film shot in the 1970s (mostly by craig stecyk) combined with interviews of the team members and other influential people today.the first part of the film documents how the "dogtown" section of venice, ca came to be, starting back around the turn of the century when the town was created to be a venice, italy-like european city. by the 1970's, the one remaining local attraction, the pacific ocean park, had been abandoned, leaving a beach with lots of exposed piers and other hazards. the poor kids living in the area had nothing better to do than surf, and they excelled despite (or perhaps because of) their surroundings. because the waves dissipated in the afternoon, they took up skateboarding to fill their time, and the empty swimming pools caused by the drought during those years plus their surfing backgrounds led them to create the vertical skateboarding style that is mainstream today. i found that the film covered much more about surfing than i expected, which seemed like a bonus since i really didn't know much about surfing or skateboarding before i watched the film. the soundtrack, not surprisingly, was good as well. i also liked how these kids were just following their passion and generally ended up better off for the experience. the parts that didn't work so well for me were the drama that they tried to create, which seemed somewhat forced, and the team's somewhat overinflated sense of self-importance (although this is probably just left-over street attitude from where they grew up). this is not to say that they didn't have significant influence, but only that it seems extremely likely that there were other factors as well. one note: my wife is more affected than most to nausea when films use what we refer to as "spasticam" (wiggling camera movements). this film is often guilty, so if you are so afflicted, be warned. i would recommend this film to anyone, but especially to anyone with skateboarding and/or surfing in their history.seen on 5/11/2002.

back in the day, i was one of the rn's in the emergency rooms, these skaters would occasionally land in. they were not treated well, and some of it was brought on by their asocial personalities- but we all knew they were a talented bunch of "wonderkids" even then. they deserved better care than they received, i'm afraid. they had "attitude" in spades.i'm so glad i caught this documentary on ifc tonight- it will be on again at 1 am and i'll be watching again!little attention was given to them until the rich dying kid was able to talk his parents into draining the pool- and the film really highlights that as the taking off point....it was an amazing time, and deserved to be recorded. stacy peralta is due all the praise heaped on him, and long may those z-boys enjoy their memories and contribution to the real sport of skateboarding. as for the few "sour grape" reviews contained herein, there always were and there always will be "wannabees" and hangers-on who never do more than dream...the z-boys lived it, breathed it, were it.nice to see the vintage films and even the lone girl, "peggy" who was so talked about as being the only female to win their respect.thanks to ifc i get to really take the occasional drug-free head trip of my youth and relive the heart pounding excitement again.

if you have ever been, has a friend, or a kid that is or was into skating at one time, then watch this flick!. i have seen it several times and i get something new out of it every time that i see it. it reminded me of why i got into skating in the first place (a long time ago) . it reminded me of what skating brings to a person and i have found will also help a person who doesn't understand why skaters, well, skate. sure there is a very dark side to the whole seen, which the movie does touch on slightly. but it tends to focus more on what is at the core of skating. just a person on a board, doing it because they love to do it. this movie was so inspirational to me that i'm now skating once again (i'm 32) and i haven't been this happy with my self in years¬Ö.. give this one a go, you will not be disappointed.

being in the suburbs of new york when the z-boys were creating history in dogtown, i was only exposed to a glimpse of what was going on. i had a p-o-s black knight skateboard with clay wheels. it is long gone, and on the ash heap of my personal life. but i never forgot. it's like watching long-lost brothers and friends, and it hits me right where i live. i cannot watch this film enough. every time i view it, some other aspect rises to the top, some other viewpoint come into sharp focus. the vintage footage, the incredible stills, the current personalities intermeshed with the vivid shadows of the brightly lit past, the heartfelt and not over-done narrative, all beautifully edited together in such a way as to make a landmark documentary of a genuine slice of american history. in the words of glen friedman - "it was f-ing unbelievable."

my skateboarding career ended in 1974 when my two-by-four skateboard with steel roller-skate wheels hit a rock and i tumbled, for days it seemed, down the sidewalk outside my parent's house in boston. by the time the cast came off my arm, summer was gone.but i have always admired the x-games types and surfers especially. i think i spent the first month after i moved to southern california on the beaches and piers watching the surfers, bemoaning that fact that i had missed my calling. it's the sort of thing you should learn young, before the horrible senses of self-preservation and self-awareness burrow in. or else at best, you'll be so worried about not getting hurt or laughed at, you'll wind up looking like a trained bear.i always admired how a good surfer seems to not care about anything but that moment, that wave, that experience. at one with the forces of nature. a good surfer makes it look like there is nothing else but that wave right there, and the way you interact with it. there's a lot of zen in it to me.this documentary outlines how a few young folks took the surfing concepts and extended them to skateboarding. ramps, downgrades, low sweeping curves while interacting with the cement waves beneath their feet. in their day and time, this was all new. radical. prior to the zephyr skate team the idea apparently was to go as fast as you could in a straight line on a skateboard, hence my long "evel knievel at caesers palace" like tumble down the front walk.this film is a look back through time, to an america before everything was labeled, tagged, marketed, and jam-forced down our throats as "extreme". (seriously, what's so "extreme" about an "extreme value meal" at taco bell? other than the fact that it is an extreme hazard to your colon...) watch this film and watch the birth of 'extreme sports'. before there was an x-games, before boom-boom huck-jam, before crusty demons, before the asa...there were these young street urchins who created 'extreme sports' without really trying. they were just doing it for the purity, the pure pleasure, of skateboarding in the sun with friends. i hope they get a cut of the 'extreme' money out there. goodness knows they don't get the credit they deserve. maybe this film can correct that.excellent film with a great soundtrack, a portrait of a southern california, indeed an america, that no longer exists.i don't care for sean penn but he does a decent job narrating.

anyone looking to learn more about the development of skateboarding should find dogtown and z-boys adequate research material. this is not to be confused with lords of dogtown, that sorry hollywood attempt to cash in on the success of the original dogtown revival. directed by stacey peralta, a former z-boys himself as well as pro skater and mastermind behind the 80s bones brigade, and co-written with skateboarding photojournalist craig stecyk, this documentary traces how a group of surfing kids from southern california's mean streets (known as dogtown) who formed the z-boys skateboard team (actually there was one girl--peggy oki) revolutionized skateboarding. the film contains interviews from nearly all of the z-boys (chris cahill's whereabouts are unknown) with the most noteable being bad ass tony alva and the youngest, jay adams, who's talents (along with perlata) seemed to transcend the rest of the teams. there are interviews of the team's (and the dogtown shop) founders, surfboard designer jeff ho, skip engbloom, and craig stecyk. there are also interviews of folks like tony hawk (obviously), ian mckaye (fugazi), and henry rollins, who were young kids in the 70s when dogtown was making it's influence on skateboarding (skateboarding was a whole other context in previous years as the documentary explains). it really shows you not only who the dogtown team was and how they formed, but why their style changed not only skateboarding tricks (pool skating became immensley popular, and thus gave way to vert skating), but also facilitated the sport (though not into the extreme commercialism it is today) as more than just the fleeting fad it had been earlier as these surfing kids who's waves ran out in the early morning needed ways to spend their time and eventually got into skateboarding. the days of russ howell and alan gelfand were long over as the dogtown, at least through the publicity of their skate team, paved the way for the new generation of skaters. because dogtown got all the attention, they were able to push skating to the next step.it's a great documentary in the way that it is put together, though stacey peralta always knew how to do this even when producing the bones brigade mini movies/skate demos like "ban this" and "search for animal chin." narrated by sean penn, the film is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, contains lots of terrific archive footage, and lots of interview to give you a genuine feel of who the z-boys were and how they made their mark on skateboarding.

after watching ingmar bergman's skammen, i had many feelings, but most notably, i felt unsatisfied. i have heard so much hype about this movie but i came to find it lacking. don't get me wrong, i can fully appreciate the artistic value of such a film, but as far as depth and emotion, i was not so impressed. i found the characters to be disagreeable and unrealistic, which detracted from the dramatic effect. in addition, the fact that the war was fake led me to feel that the emotion was not real. dramatic war movies, in my opinion, are much more effective if the events (not necessarily the story itself) really happened. i find that of all the movies that try to show the brutality this one falls in the middle as far as effectiveness.

oh, it's an excellent piece of work, to be sure. in fact, several of the best scenes in cinema, or at least in bergman's cinema, are to be found in this film. liv ullmann and max von sydow are as good as you would expect. do these two give bad performances? sven nykvist delivers some masterful, although unconventionally masterful, cinematography. the script is quite good, especially in individual scenes. sometimes the film lags, and the pace is uneven, though probably intentionally. so what's the problem? well, the film is too bleak for its own good. other bergman films are similarly bleak, but nowhere near this harsh. eventually, i just gave up and i started to become a little irritated. i was greatly affected often during the film, but, by the end, i felt uninvolved. it's a great film, but i doubt i'd ever watch it again, nor suggest it to friends. or, if i did suggest it, i'd be very sure to warn them of what's ahead. 8/10.

it came as no surprise to me that this was a very depressing and draining movie. after all, it's all about the impact of war on civilians and it's by the "king of depression", ingmar bergman. in other words, so many of bergman's works delve deep into human misery and angst and so this movie seems not so extraordinary coming from this director.even though it is more difficult to watch, the last half of the movie offers perhaps more insight into the lower depths of humanity. that's because initially, the main characters (liv ullman and max von sydow) try to overcome adversity and are basically decent (though a bit stupid) people. however, as deprivation after deprivation occurs, they (especially von sydow) become less and less humane and more animalistic--doing anything in order to survive.fun to watch, no freaking way! but, an interesting insight into human nature.ps--1 thing i loved about this film is that it avoided a stupid movie chiche. when the couple sat down with the shopkeeper to drink a glass or wine, they finished the wine completely! in most movies, they barely touch their drinks or leave them untouched. it drives me crazy, as i would never leave a $4 alcoholic beverage without drinking it unless it tasted terrible or had a bug floating in it! bravo!

shame, is a swedish film in swedish with english subtitles. the film is about a husband and wife named jan, and eva. they live on an island working as farmers. there is a war going on and soldiers start attacking people on the island. once the war subsides a little jan, and eva are arrested as going along with the opposite side. once released even more trouble ensues and the film shows how two ordinary people will act in a situation of war and life or death. winner of the cec award for best foreign film at the cinema writers circle awards, the guldbagge award for best actress (liv ullman, who plays eva) at the guldbagge awards, the nbr award for best foreign language film and best actress at the national board of review and the nsfc award for best actress, best director (ingmar bergman) and best film at the national society of film critics awards. shame, has good direction, a good script, good performances by both max von sydow (who plays jan) and liv ullman (who plays eva), good cinematography and good production design. shame, is a well acted and well made story of how people in a desperate situation will sometimes do whatever they can do in order to survive. the film has a powerful message and is a good film. the reason i'am not rating this film higher is because it is not a masterpiece like some other ingmar bergman films like wild strawberries, the seventh seal or persona, for example. the film didn't have as big an impact on me as i thought it would and it lacked ingmar bergman's thoughtful and philosophical dialog. while nowhere close to being one of his best films there is still a lot to like about shame, and it is a good movie. i just probably would have liked it more having not seen some of those other bergman masterpieces.

bergman¬¥s tale about how the hell of the war can drive a sensible couple of musicians to the barbarousness. with many memorable scenes throughout the film, i found particularly remarkable that close to the end where ullmann and von sydow go in a boat completely surrounded by corpses of soldiers floating on the sea. a fascinating masterpiece!

"lifeforce" is a truly bizarre adaptation of the novel "the space vampires" by colin wilson, scripted by dan o'bannon & don jakoby. a joint american-british space exploration team makes a mind-boggling discovery: an alien spacecraft resting inside halleys' comet, containing three entities that look like people, one of them a female beauty (the oh-so-alluring mathilda may).they take these discoveries back on board their own spacecraft. big mistake.it turns out that these creatures drain the life out of human beings, and as american colonel carlsen (an intense, edgy, and committed steve railsback) and british s.a.s. colonel caine (a solid peter firth) watch in horror, an infestation of vampirism overtakes london, with the fate of earth in the balance.this picture certainly is not lacking in imagination. it moves a little slowly at times but offers so many strange and fanciful ideas and eye-popping visuals that it's hard not to be amused. the first of director tobe hoopers' three-picture deal with cannon films (he followed it up with "texas chainsaw massacre ii" and the "invaders from mars" remake), he makes it something truly unique. incorporating elements of sci-fi, vampire films, zombie films, and end-of-the-world sagas, it's like nothing that i've seen before.railsback and firth are ably supported by such strong brit actors as frank finlay, patrick stewart, michael gothard, aubrey morris, and john hallam. mathilda may is very memorable as the bewitching, enigmatic villainess; it certainly doesn't hurt that she performs a great deal of her scenes in the nude. also worth noting is a stirring music score from none other than "pink panther" composer henry mancini.ridiculous it may be, but i found it to be fun as well. it's flamboyant and spirited entertainment.8/10

ok, so i'm not usually one that runs out and rents foreign movies...especially foreign dark comedies. i think i can count on one hand the number of films that i found genuinely hilarious from beginning to end. this movie will be added to the short list. even dark comedies right out of hollywood sometimes turn me off because they require an incredibly dry sense of humor. but this one had my eyes welling up with tears. my sides hurt. i haven't laughed that hard in a long time. this movie was recommended by my mother and i don't think i would have even dreamed of watching it had she not raved about it. don't be afraid of having to read during your movie - you'll miss out on a hilariously well-acted flick.

of adam's apple and with your permission. i didn't know until looking it up just now. also the errrrrrmmmmm 'wilbur wants to kill himself' i prefer this very focused deadpan ...drama over adam's apple's over the top comedic zeal. but with your permission is much more layered and subtle, but that's another director.once the 'meaty' part of the story takes place i felt the dread of coming back to the shop again and again. a bit claustrophobic .. maybe that is intentional. it builds on the atmosphere. you dread the rediscovery and again and again until the 'kick in the shin'.this is some funny stuff.

send them to the freezer. this is the solution two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh. an incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror film. the complex characters defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile - if you can stand it. definitely a dark film but also a bit redemptive.

not sure i've ever seen a black comedy from denamark before but this is quite good actually. the humor is suitably low-key and deadpan to go with some of the gruesome activity. svend and bjarne are fed up with working for their boss, because he's always putting them down (in fact he mentions that they weren't bright enough to unzip before peeing at one point). they do what they have to to start their own butcher shop and when a workman is accidentally locked in the cooler overnight while fixing a light, they hit upon something that makes their butcher shop far more popular than their old boss's. in fact, he's the one they sold their first "filets" to, and it's partly his fault, since he served them at a rotary dinner at his house and the guests raved about it and showed up at svend and bjarnes the next day. bjarne is somewhat horrified what svend has done but it doesn't stop there. svend has risen above his sad little existence to be someone of some popularity which is new for him and he doesn't want to let go of that, so the freezer continues to fill up with all manner of acquaintances (and, at one point, "a small swede from the park"). suspiccions arise, though, because ex-boss holger thinks something is wrong. bjarne is also haunted by his twin brother eigil, who lived in a sanitarium for years in a coma and whom bjarne wanted the plug pulled on so he could get inheritance money to help open the shop. when eigil was taken off the respirator he was revived, much to bjarne's horror. and bjarne has a love interest too in astrid, who works at the cemetery. neither svend nor bjarne are well adjusted individuals and so things start to spiral out of control. the deadpan humor really makes this, and while this isn't exactly laugh out loud material it certainly is amusing. it is somewhat creepy though considering the cuts of meat and body parts casually lying around, especially since these two take it all so matter-of-fact. if you're a fan of black comedies this is recommended, i liked it quite well myself. 8 out of 10.

not entirely sure how i stumbled upon this movie, but i'm so glad i did. initially, we were put off by the fact that it was subtitled, but even my dyslexic brother who hates to read (especially at the weekend) enjoyed this film. i found the script fantastic and the way it was delivered in such a dead-pan manner only added to the puddles of pee on my sofa. not entirely sure whether it's quite so funny to the native danish as the comedy seems to be enhanced by the tonelessness of the subtitles and the ambiguity of the translation. i haven't watched many danish films (or any for that matter), but judging by this film i'm guessing they're not constrained by the same political correctness as elsewhere (gawd bless 'em) making the character of eigel a breath of fresh air, because let's face it special needs are funny. there are so many great one-liners in this film it puts american sitcoms to shame.

i absolutely loved this film... so much emotion in such a small amount of time. i loved the beginning and how it completely throws you off guard. i love the story and the deer being brought in. i know that when i think of deer i think of innocence, and prosperity. also, in psalm 42:2 in the bible it says, "as the deer pants for the water brooks, so pants my soul for you, o god". which could even connect the last moment when the woman says it will be okay. as if she knows she's going with god. perhaps i am thinking way to much into it. but sometimes it is interesting to see what goes on through peoples' minds. thank you for sharing this masterpiece with viewers everywhere. i live in texas and i had it playing on cable... i immediately got onto the computer to find out more about this film and this amazing director! i really liked the music that was used in the background. music can sometimes make or break a film. it definitely set the mood perfectly. very nice choice!thanks again.laetitia

for a film by a first time director, this is a simply amazing little film, though i have to admit that it's a bit hard to watch and will probably offend the sensibilities of many who watch it, as the film takes a definite stand in favor of assisted suicide. however, what i loved about the film is that i had no idea this is what the film was about until the film was more than half complete and by then i was already hooked.in addition to the excellent way the subject was introduced, i was amazed at the very professional style of the film--with some of the best cinematography i've ever seen in a short film. plus, this camera work was combined so well with music and images that made the film just beautiful.as i said, this is a controversial film. i myself struggle with what i think about this debate, but the film managed to make a statement in such a literate and intelligent way, i really have to respect the team who made this film.

i was fortunate to see a screening of this remarkable short film by joshua leonard before its premiere at the 2005 sundance festival. in twelve brief but exquisite minutes, leonard takes us on a life-changing journey as he probes one of the most controversial contemporary social and ethical issues facing our society. the film embodies elegant direction, moving performances and a heart- rending story. kelli garner and lucas haas radiate as the two lovers. and, in his first venture into dramatic narrative, leonard proves to be a director with a propitious future. i feel this short should be expanded into a feature film. it's difficult to describe talent, but as this debut film demonstrates, you know it when you see it!

this short has all the elements of a great movie. every time i show it to friends (on dvr) they love it too. the dialog is so, 'real'. the acting is superb. while the effects/props weren't as convincing by themselves, taken with everything else in the shot, they are expertly placed/used. the music is so haunting, perfect for this kind of 'moment' film. people who hold dear their beliefs and thoughts are shaken to their core about what they see in this movie. most go 'that's it?', but in the end they blossom with new understanding, and leave the movie with one word to describe it:'beautiful'. the beauty of the film is also skin deep. i love the fact that there aren't any conflicting views, no other voices, and the voices that you do hear, are agreeing with each other. no conflict, but at the same time there is one. and the ending made me love it more! harsh reality sometimes is more film worthy than any plot device, or twist. (wasn't joshua leonard the guy in blair witch project?) :) movie by a fictitious dead guy..great!

i watched this short moments ago on the sundance film festival website, and i must say it is absolutely astounding. i expected it to be entertaining - like all of the sundance shorts - but i wasn't prepared for such deep sadness and yet also a sense of passion and beauty. if you haven't yet seen any of this years entries to the festival, i suggest you go onto the site and watch these mini-masterpieces - i have seen them all, and can honestly say 'the youth in us' is the one that has touched my heart the most. i'm not the weakest audience member when it comes to romance in films, but my eyes flooded up so much i'm surprised i could still see the screen.i agree with 'addicted2you', it truly is a masterful piece of directorial work, and the cinematography will just take your breath away. i can't think of a better way to spend a spare 12 minutes.

the youth in us is a pitch-perfect gem. i saw this stunning short at this year's 2005 sundance festival. the story took me on a profoundly transforming journey. the directing by joshua leonard, the acting of kelli garner and lukas haas, the art direction, the cinematography, the score -- every element was true to the bone. one can only hope that this exquisite and excruciating film is prelude to more great work from this gifted director.just as a short film is shown before a feature at sundance, commercial movie theatres used a similar format in times past. it would be wonderful if miniature masterpieces like the youth in us could reach a wider audience this way.

kingdom county, vermont, 1927. noel lord (rip torn) lives with his indian mate, bangor (tantoo cardinal) in the area where a large dam is to be built; noel, however, is not willing to give up on his land, and he'll have to fight the dam company in order to prevent the county from any possible destruction."where the rivers flow north" is a gripping, contemplative story powered by the memorable performances of rip torn (recently seen in the small but juicy role of louis xv in sofia coppola's underrated "marie antoinette") and tantoo cardinal ("dances with wolves", "smoke signals"). director jay craven (who also co-wrote the script with don bredes, based on howard frank mosher's novel) and cinematographer paul ryan crafted this powerful story with unique, contemplative pace/visuals, which remind me of terrence malick's and john huston's best moments. it's an underrated independent period piece of the first (electric) half of the 90's, usually regarded as the rise of quentin tarantino's burlesque ("pulp fiction" is a masterpiece indeed, but the man suffers from orson welles' syndrome), todd solondz's disturbing suburbia, danny boyle's dark vision of the uk (let's not mention that "beach" flick with dicaprio, though)... jay craven should be more regarded on the lists of great indie filmmakers as well. he's been leading a respectful, discreet career and it's always a pleasure to see a constant talent like his.my vote: 8/10.

where the rivers flow north is a well-told story about two peoples' fight to live their own lives in the face of "progress" and development. besides enjoying the movie as entertainment, i also learned quite a bit about life in rural new england back in the late 1920s.the cinematography captured the raw beauty of northern vermont and set the stage, while the music brought the movie to life. very well done for a low-budget, locally-produced film. i found michael j. fox's character the weakest in the film, but rip torn and tantoo cardinal turn in two of the finest performances i've seen in a long time. i was saddened she did not get a nod as best actress that year (i assume the film was too "small" a film to be considered).

i'm not sure how the imdb "weighted average" came up with such a low rating on this film. it is in my opinion and by all other accounts an overlooked gem of a movie. rip torn is fantastic as the stubborn noel lord, and tantoo cardinal superlative as his housemate. torn and cardinal are both underrated actors who are finally given a stage to work their craft on.their relationship isn't always pleasant, but it's very real. this is not the "humerous and touching love story" it's billed as on the dvd jacket. in the end it is a tragedy. lord simply aims too high and ignores all the advice to take the money offered by the power company to move.the music is fantastic, as are the period sets.

jay craven's criminally ignored film is a sober breath of fresh air in the generally narcissistic and derivative world of independent film. first off, the photography is pure aesthetic pleasure, capturing all of the gloomy beauty of northern new england in late autumn (cinematographer paul ryan did 2nd unit on malick's days of heaven). second, the performances are uniformly excellent - rip torn's noel lourdes is irascibly charming and tantoo cardinal's bangor is at once sensitive and exuberant, to say nothing of a fine supporting cast. overall though, it is a tribute to the narrative strength of the film that the story maintains a strong and lively pace while still unfolding in its own time, and the film comes to a conclusion, natural and genuine, that nevertheless does not seem expected. this is one of the rare cells of dignity in the independent film world, a film that explores a small piece of the intersection between humans and history.

director jay craven's adaptation of howard frank mosher's 'where the rivers flow north' is one of the finer transitions from literature to the screen. craven is an admirer of mosher's work -- he also directed 'a stranger in the kingdom'.the cast is superb -- especially rip torn and tantoo cardinal. torn offers what could be the finest role of his career -- noel lord, the fiercely independent former lumberjack who is at the center of this story. tantoo cardinal's portrayal of lord's live-in housekeeper/common-law wife is dead-on as well. i'm both amazed and disappointed that neither of them were nominated for oscars when this film was released. performances of this calibre should be acknowledged. the only character that's a little hard to swallow for me is the power company executive played by michael j. fox. he just looks too much like a kid in this role. i guess there's a curse attached to youthful looks, no matter how much people want them.craven has done a nice job here in bringing the character of early 20th century vermont to the screen -- locations, angles, sets, all combine to transport the viewer to the time and place of the story. cinematographer paul ryan was exceptional. the score by the horseflies is also first rate -- it fits the mood and scenery perfectly.and the story itself...? one of the most compelling portrayals of the fiercely independent american pioneer spirit ever -- a trait that is on the wane in this day and age. when it appears in modern times, the person is often looked upon with suspicion and disdain. in noel lord, we have a character whom we can admire for his values, and even for his stubbornness.this is not a stodgy 'period piece', but a vibrant look at an era that is gone, and a type of character that has all but vanished. these are not gold-plated heroes, but real people, with both strengths and weaknesses at play within them. struggling in a harsh environment to live their lives and at the same time be at peace with the world in which they live. like today, there are those who wield power that would have it otherwise.

this is a fine, under-rated film and rip torn, well-known as he is, is a seriously under-rated actor. i read howard frank mosher's novel many years ago. how well craven captures the book and the beauty of vermont's northeast kingdom! i had the good fortune to grow up in vt in the 40s and 50s and was still living there when the "irasburg incident" took place. i've not seen _stranger in the kingdom_, the craven/mosher collaboration based on the incident(and another mosher novel), but this film has inspired me to track it down.

outstanding performance by tantoo cardinal. she carries this movie alone. rip torn is great but just a shadow to tantoo. a bitter sweet story of a woman who loves a very stubborn man. beautiful, funny, sad, touching, a must see film.

i saw this movie for the first time on a sick day from school about ten years ago. compared to the made for lifetime movies i usually watched, it became an instant though obscure favorite.i've seen it maybe twice since then. i think some parts are little cheesy, maybe the plot could use some more action.nevertheless, it captures the fantasies and realities of children with uniqueness and warmth. the magical realism is on par with that of amelie, and the heart with that of the wonder years. despite the particular development of my tastes, i still find the subtle magic of this film, the lovable characters, and its simplicity enchanting.

i highly reccommend this movie. it blurs the line between childhood fantasy and everyday reality in such a seamless fashion that it has to be seen to be believed. the actors and director have such perfect timing that in one scene a name calling fight becomes a sort of dance. i loved the story line, the actors, everything. while i do think there were one or two decidedly cheesy scenes, over-all the movie was impeccably done.

if there's one theme of this film, it's that people can cope with hardship by having a good imagination. this family is poor, their father works graveyard, and their mother works double-shifts, and peter is constantly picked on for a variety of reasons, and becomes increasingly frustrated that he is often mistaken for a girl. he is just starting to approach that age of 10 or 11 where your perceptions start to change, and thinks like your appearance start to matter. the backdrop of this story is the 1967 world's fair and the centennial of canada. the film's greatest moments come during the various fantasy sequences where we see just how they cope. watch the flim, and if you've ever had a childhood friend that you dreamt with, and then for some reason, lost, you'll really like this film. perhaps kids will like this film, but only adults will truly appreciate it, including its references to bolshevik's and what parent's will do for their children.

ok i know the original ghoulies aren't in this entry it even seems it doesn't belong in this series. but it still iz a good movie. it is hilarious i thought especially with the pepper spray or mace. i give it a 9

the lovely, yet lethal alexandra (stunning statuesque blonde beauty stacie randall, who looks absolutely smashing in a tight black leather outfit) must find a magic amulet so her evil demonic master faust can cross over into our dimension. it's up to fearless, rugged cop jonathan graves (likable peter liapis) to stop her. meanwhile, two pitifully unfunny "comic relief" dwarf gnome creatures run amok in los angeles. seasoned veteran schlock exploitation expert jim wynorski relates the supremely inane story at a brisk pace and takes none of this foolishness remotely seriously. the cast struggle gamely with the silly material: the adorable barbara alyn woods as sassy, fetching police captain kate, raquel krelle as tart, sexy hooker jeanine, bobby di cicco as graves' bumbling, excitable partner scotty, peggy trentini as alluring museum curator monica, and ace mask as the jolly dr. rochelle. mark stevi's puerile cookie cutter script, an amusingly lowbrow sense of no-brainer humor, chuck cirino's bouncy cornball score, the two dwarf guys sporting obvious cheap rubber halloween masks, j.e. bash's plain cinematography, no tension or gratuitous female nudity to speak of, and the tacky (less than) special effects all further enhance the overall delicious cheesiness of this prime slice of celluloid velveeta. an entertainingly brainless piece of lovably lousy dreck.

okay, so ghoulies 4 is kind of bad. and it doesn't really even have the ghoulies in it. and the acting is bad. the storyline is stupid. but i forget to mention how funny this film is. it is so campy, and so ridiculous it is too fun not to enjoy. there are only 2 ghoulies in the movie, and they don't really seem to be in relation with the ghoulies in the other film. but they are pretty funny. and funny thing, that jonathon graves returns for this one. if you saw the first, he was a character in that. in my opinion, this is better than the first. there are some classic scenes and some classic lines, one which is in a grocery store. "attention k-mart shoppers!" watch this if you enjoy bad movies. it's so bad it is good. and did i mention barbara alyn woods is hot?

sixth (and last) movie in the boxset. well, looks like i've saved the best one for last. ghoulies iv. i originally did a review for this back in like february, but i decided to do a new one. the ghoulies series is pretty awesome. i know there are some people who don't like them, and that's fine. this happens to be my favorite one in the series. yeah, i know the actual ghoulies don't appear and are replaced by 2 guys in costumes, one of them being tony cox from bad santa. now, onto the movie.the movie centers around jonathan graves, the main character from the first movie, being played once again, by peter liapis, who is now a cop for the lapd and has put his past of the occult behind him. during the first part of the movie, we encounter alexandra (played by the very hot stacie randall) communicating with a demon from beyond named faust, who is the dark side of jonathan. faust asks alexandra for a red jewel and something goes awry, therefore, unleashing the ghoulies from the beyond.i think jim wynorski did a good job with the directing. and the music by chuck cirino is funny as well. (spoiler ahead) at the end of this movie, the ghoulies say that there will be a ghoulies iv, part 2, or ghoulies v. i still hope that sequel gets made and i especially hope jim wynorski returns to direct. i agree with gimbotheghoulies on that.

seeing that this movie was on the imdb bottom 20, i simply had to rent it.suprise! suprise! i have no regret of seeing this movie at all. in fact, i really enjoyed it. there's a level of camp in this movie that puts cult classics of the 80's to shame. is it stupid? yes, but jim wynorski proves that stupid is not necessarily bad after all.rent it for a laugh that seems unintended but is actually meant to be funny. wynorski is a genius. hope he directs the next ninja turtles movie

ghoulies 4 is pretty ghoulish sequel. the ghoulies look very different from the first three ghoulies, but there still cool. there are some nice flash backs, from ghoulies the first movie. jonathan is back once again in this one. he wasn't in parts 2 or 3 though. the movie is low budget at times, but fun to watch. you've got tony cox as the dark ghoulie and arturo gil as the light ghoulie. the ghoulies in this movie are actually good guys, instead of evil like in the first three movies. both ghoulies are pretty funny characters in the movie. then you've got the very hot alexandra! it's a great dark comedy and funny! any fan of the ghoulies movies will enjoy watching ghoulies 4. the dvd is finally coming out this july 2007! hopefully one day ghoulies iii will be on dvd in the usa. i'd really like to see a sequel to this movie one day too. i doubt it will happen though. it's 2007 now and no sign of a sequel yet. if there ever is a sequel i hope jim wynorski will make it.i give ghoulies iv a 9/10

okay okay, i must admit, i do somewhat like peter liapis and i'll admit this is not the best ghoulies sequel. i mean, yeah, it had its flaws, such as no ghoulies themselves. but the two ghoulies that come to earth were really funny, i guess they were called, dark and lite. i enjoyed the plot of the movie. and even at the end of the movie both ghoulies implied that there would be a sequel. still waiting. lol. peter liapis reprised his role as jonathan graves, this time playing a detective, how cute! ghoulies iv may not be scary or suspenseful, but it is definitely funny. i thought i would comment on this movie and just say -- it's not that bad. it is worth watching even though the ghoulies aren't in it.

ghoulies iv may not be the best out of the series but it isn't too bad, if you don't take it fully serious then you may enjoy it.it's nice to see peter liapis return as johnathan graves who has gave up using magic and has became a detective but still thinks about what happened in ghoulies.the plot is about a woman named alexandra that is johnathan's ex-girlfriend that breaks into a museum and takes a red gem, using the gem she awakens her boyfriend named faust that is johnathan's dark side but he needs the gem so he can enter the real world and john is sent to hell.something goes wrong and alex loses the gem so she needs to find a new one, as she leaves the gateway is still open and two little ghoulies named lite and drak appear. they're not the true ghoulies since they look like guys in a troll costume wearing a mask but that doesn't matter since they are humorous in parts.lite and dark need to find johnathan since he can return them home so they go around causing mayhem as they try to find johnathan. another difference is that the two ghoulies are the good guys unlike the ones in the previous films.i found ghoulies iv to be good but this film may not go for everyone, check it out if you like low budget films like troll 2.

at least one kind. very human and moving. not out to teach a lesson or anything like that. all principals are effective. i saw the movie years ago and still remember it (but can't remember the morgan fairchild role).and a nice slice of american life.

francis ford coppola's first 'personal' film, completed and released in 1969, was the last movie he made as a mostly unknown, up and coming director before the godfather, and is in stark contrast to both that film, and the rest of his uneven career. it's ostensibly a road movie involving a disconnected young woman bored with domestic life, and pregnant with a child she isn't sure she wants, fleeing the trappings her dull marriage and hitting the open road in search of freedom. along the way she befriends a nice man, an ex-footballer player that suffered brain damage from a traumatic head injury, played in unexpectedly subtle fashion by a young james caan, and decides to 'help' him, despite becoming frustrated with his simple ways. her efforts to rid of him always fail, either by guilt or chance, and eventually lead her directly into the hands of an emotionally wounded cop(robert duvall), who has ideas of his own. the plot is threadbare, but coppola does a great job at detailing the emotional life of these characters, and uses editing techniques to relay back story that were not at all common in american films of the time. shots are simple, yet extraordinarily effective, conveying both the moody desolation of the open highway, and the emptiness of american suburban life, infused with a gentle melancholy provided by the film score. coppola also deserves credit for addressing the issue of domestic discontent from a woman's point of view in the culturally turbulent 60's. overall, a fairly low-key film that is not what audiences have come to expect from coppola, but one that is a minor triumph in its own quiet, unassuming way. 7.5/10.

shirley knight plays sara ravenna, a long island housewife who runs away from her marriage when she discovers she is pregnant. she plans to drive into america's heartland and start anew. along the way she picks up a friendly hitchhiker (james caan) who calls himself 'killer.' soon she discovers that the good natured 'killer' is actually brain damaged, and by picking him up she has unknowingly taken on a huge responsibility. the two of them drive all the way to nebraska, where sara gets killer a job helping out at a roadside reptile farm. it is here that sara meets gordon, a local cop, and soon things go horribly wrong for everyone.this is a powerful drama about people disconnected from society, alienated by the choices they make or by the limits imposed on them by others. even with such a low budget and a very freewheeling attitude, the film is able to capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters. shirley knight has a complex, diverging role and there are moments of some awe-inspiring acting by her. one of my favorites is when she is on the telephone calling her home to her worried husband the first time. it is such a tense scene on both ends, and in every small gesture and inflection of a word, so much about her is spoken with so little. then comes in the character of 'killer' played by james caan. this character is unlike any i've ever seen him play, and he performs wonderfully. it's one of his best performances as he is very restrained and moving.the way coppola develops the characters by using short, dream-like flashbacks is very clever, adding a fragmented kind of view onto it all. the quick flashbacks that are graphic and self-contained contrast well with the longer shots in some crucial scenes. also, because this film was shot on location all over the eastern u.s., it offers an interesting, authentic look at america in the late 1960's.i haven't seen many other films starring ms. knight, i'm only familiar with her more recent work on television, usually playing a nagging mother in law or a dotty old woman. it was great seeing her so young, beautiful, and so wonderfully subtle in this movie. it's also kind of a shame that james caan went on to be typecast as the 'tough guy' for the rest of his career, because this film evidenced that he is capable of so much more than that.

**spoilers** simple movie about simple people who's problems are far too complex for them to handle.natalie aka sara ravenna, shirley knight, has become overwhelmed with married life and the fact that she's now pregnant is the straw that breaks the camel's back. taking off from her homes in long island new york natalie has no idea where she's going but hopes to find peace and tranquility somewhere in the heartland of america. it's on the pennsylvania turnpike that natalie picks up hitchhiker jimmie "killer" kilgannon, james cann,who seems as lost and confused as she is. as natalie, calling herself sara at the time, soon finds out jimmie had suffered a serious brain concussion while playing football on his collage team and has been reduced to such a simple minded individual who's so passive that he lets everyone, including later in the movie natalie, step all over him.sympathetic at first natalie becomes very annoyed at the self pitying jimmie for not standing up for himself and letting himself be used as a doormat by everyone he comes in contact with in the movie. not knowing what to do with the child-like jimmie natalie finally gets him a job in far off nebraska as a cleaning man at the reptile jungle pet market owned and run by, mr. alfred, tom aldrege. being the both kind and simple-minded person that he is jimmie lets all the animals out of their cages causing havoc at the pet store and has him fired by his boss mr. alfred.in the meantime natalie who thought that she was finally through with jimmie ends up back at the reptile jungle when she's given a speeding ticket by traffic cop gordon, robert duvall. it seems that mr. alfred is also the acting county judge and is the person that natalie is to pay her traffic fine to. while all this is happening gordon-the cop- had developed a strong liking for natalie and wants to get her in the sack, at his trailer home, the first chance he can. gordon a widower with a uncontrollable 12 year old daughter rosalie, marva zimmet, needs a mature woman-with lots of lovin'- to make him forget his many social and psychological problems and natalie is exactly the medicine that the doctor ordered!***spoilers*** wild and shocking final with gordon going completely out of his mind and attempting to rape natalie, who refused his drunken advances, which has jimmie finally get out of his self-pitying stupor and came to her rescue. there's no happy ending here with natalie saved from being both manhandled and raped by gordon but jimmie, who was bouncing gordon around like a ping-pong ball, ending up dead for all his good and noble efforts.jimmy by far was he most tragic and sympathetic person in the entire movie. all jimmie wanted was a friend to talk to and spend time with and all he ended up getting was the sh*t end of the stick. by everyone even the one person who at first treated him with kindness and understanding natalie ravenna! in the end jimmie even though he was treated like dirt by everyone despite his willingness not to offend even those who stepped all over him came out as the most likable kindest as at the same time heroic person in the entire film.

francis ford coppola wrote and directed this stunningly personal story of a married woman's flight from her husband--and the reality that perhaps the youthful glee and excitement of her younger years are behind her. we learn little about this woman's marriage except that she has been feeling her independence slipping away as of late; she's also recently learned she's pregnant, which has further complicated her heart (she doesn't want to be a complacent wifey, despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone). she meets two men on her journey: a former college football hero who--after an accident during a game--has been left with permanent brain damage, and a sexy, strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life. the clear, clean landscapes (as photographed by the very talented wilmer butler) are astutely realized, as are the characters. shirley knight, james caan, and robert duvall each deliver strong, gripping performances, most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms. some scenes (such as knight's first call home from a pay-phone, or her first night alone with caan where they play 'simon says') are almost too intimate to watch. coppola toys with reality, turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks we've been made privy to. he allows scenes to play out, yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy (there are at least two or three very frisky moments). it's a heady endeavor--so much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later. some may shun coppola's unapologetic twisting of events in order to underline the finale with bitter irony, however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate its shortcomings. *** from ****

i have a letter from ms. knight, who went to college with my older sister. in it, she tells of the hardships of making this film. she, herself, was pregnant--an interesting conjunction with the movie's plot--and the novice director was unsure, fairly green, and having great difficulties with all the decisions, logistics, etc. they were on the move all the time, and it was a very difficult shoot. the film, however, with a strong debut for james caan, remains effective and affecting. it's a great showcase for the talent that ms. knight has demonstrated her entire career--on television, in movies and on the stage, where she won the tony for "kennedy's children."this film has aged well.

in some scenes in the rain people, francis ford coppola's precursor to his hey-day of the seventies, there is the mark of a similar situation to 1969's easy rider, but not exactly in the same reference frame. here we have a drama about disconnected people from society, in some ways alienated by the choices or by limits imposed by one mean or another. it's one of those rare original dramas where some scenes stand alone as total knockouts. even with such a low-string budget and a very freewheeling, so to speak, attitude about filming the movie, coppola is able to capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters and the curved, unexpected degrees of one character versus the helplessness of another, or vice versa, or both. and, as one might be inclined seeing as how it is very much about the cutaways of suburban life of the 1960s, it has that escapism of the film mentioned before, but of a more concrete, near timeless quality with the drama and the underlying issues. in a way, if bergman were on route as a quasi-guerrilla 20-something filmmaker out to get the strange truths of everyday outsiders, this might be it.but along with all of the very direct and sometimes self-conscious photography (though also with a more documentary approach at times, akin with its indeterminable characters), the actors all fit into place. shirley knight, an actress i'm not too familiar with, has a complex, diverging role as a pregnant wife running off in a sort of existentialist conundrum of what life is there to have. there are moments of some awe-inspiring acting by her, and one of my favorites (if not my favorite) is when she is on the telephone calling her husband the first time. such a tense scene on both ends, and in every small gesture and inflection of a word so much about her is spoken with so little. it's extraordinary in ways that mirror others in coppola's films. then comes in the character of 'killer' played by james caan. this, too, is a dangerous character to take on, as it is a mix of childish bewilderment and amusement with scarred memories. think forrest gump if he didn't make it past the football and wit. it's one of his best, actually, by being the most minimalist- for a guy who's usually playing tough guys in movies, here's one that also is part of the crux of the story and of knight's character. also very good in a supporting role is robert duvall as a cop with a rough side and rather checkered past; kind of an early sample of other defected characters he would play later on in his career.so the characters, and what coppola risks in having an uneasiness running in them, are really what make up the film, as whatever story there is it is definitely not resolved in the usual way you might think or expect. the last ten or so minutes are like others in coppola's work, where the specific tragedies on all sides are undercut by the emotional- and psychological- implications this will leave on the principles are amplified to the sublime and sad. this is, for its time, brave on the part of what is trying to be represented (in both the freedom as well as the flaws and ambiguities) in the subject matter. and the style of the picture adds a fragmented kind of view onto it all with quick flashbacks that are graphic and self-contained in a contrast with the longer shots in some crucial scenes. it's a road movie of its period, but its also got a lot more working than it would under another filmmaker with less chances to take on the nature of these outcast characters. one of the best films of 1969.

newly-pregnant knight bolts from husband for non-specific reasons which are apparently self-related. on the road, she becomes entangled with caan, brain-damaged former football star, and duvall, wacky but abusive cop. the type of movie that could only have been spawned in the 60's. worth a look for its non-formula plot and for early performances by future stars.disappointing resolution does not take away too much from rest of flick, which shows an interesting slice of life.

early coppola with sublime cast that most folks never got to see (a pity). there's some wonderful things going on in this one - shirley knight's best performance (an underrated actress), a road trip in the late 1960's, james caan very restrained and moving, robert duvall in a part he was born to play (edgy, lonely, motorcycle cop), and a touching script with f. coppola behind the wheel.if this had been made five years later by some nobody, it would have been a smash (so much for timing). anyway, i recommend this to all people who don't need outer-space explosions and bad mother-in-law jokes or a billion dollar budget to sit for a few hours and watch a story unfold. give this one a chance if you can find it!

for avid sci-fi fans this movie is just what you've been waiting for. watching this movie gets you lost into the characters, especially riddick, the movies bad guy. this is the case where you root for the bad guy and want to see him live and win. as you watch the survivors struggle to stay alive you long to see who lives and how they survive these unknown creatures that have taken over this planet. an excellent movie, vin diesel did a wonderful job as convict riddick and the acting and suspense were ravishing.a+

i've seen director's cut version and can be nothing but content. excellent acting (esp. cole hauser, i was sad about little space for claudia black though), subtle visual effects and photography in overall, believable plot (considering the genre) without a lot of logical holes, really non-predictable twists, build-up characters. these are the greatest assets of the movie. combined with style - some may consider this movie a b-grade effort but i would disagree with that. the whole thing really is very original and stylish.and even though i'm not a fan of vin diesel, this tough guy role of riddick suited him well. can't wait for chronicles of riddick, it's really cool this flick's gonna have a sequel...9/10 if you ask me

reasonably effective horror/science-fiction a la "alien" is fairly well done given its limited ambitions. some nice special effects and well paced action sequences adequately patch the cracks in the rather tiresome dialogue. when a space craft crash lands on a remote planet the survivors soon become aware that a hideous terror awaits them in the dark of the upcoming total eclipse.

(very mildly spoilerish)i must start by saying that i'm not usually impressed by science-fiction, so pitch black (2000) was a pleasant surprise. it had me hooked from the very beginning with rhythm, intensity and visual outburst that left me fascinated and glued to my seat. i'm very happy to say that this movie was the best (okay, at least *one* of the best) science fiction piece that i've seen in a long, long time.the plot in short might sound simple -- a (space) ship crashes on a supposedly deserted planet and the captain, caroline fry (impressive radha mitchell), must lead the survivors to safety. at first, a cold-blooded murderer, riddick (vin diesel, who plays the role with very believable spare style), might seem like the group's biggest problem but as the dusk starts crawling in, the creatures of the night start awakening... this leads to a desperate attempt to escape from the bloodthirsty predators, which, as we all can guess, does not lead to a happy family picnic.it's not the plot itself that makes the movie worth watching -- after all, let's face it, if you strip it down to the basics it's not *that* original -- but the skill in which it's told. the story flowed forward, didn't leave me yawning (at least not much) in any point. the directing was fabulous work. this was a very visual, even beautiful movie; the purple night view was a real treat. although, 'beautiful' might not be the right word to use; yes, the images shown were candy to the eye, but they also added a touch of unspecified grotesqueness, eeriness, as if something was just about to burst out from under the still surface. (not to mention that the monsters were really well done, they looked realistic, which seems to be rare nowadays [maybe people just can't be bothered to make them look real...])i did not only enjoy the visual side of the movie but also the psychological aspect of the story. during the movie we get to see the characters unraveling -- some of them fall, some of them rise -- but what fascinated me the most was the developing of the character of riddick. i enjoyed watching the change in him throughout the movie. to go even further, the other thing i enjoyed a lot with riddick was the incredibly well and originally executed ust (unresolved sexual tension) between fry and him that "didn't" (you'll get what i mean once you see it). [one can't deny that they had chemistry. don't even try or i'll seek you out and make you listen to me playing chopsticks until you scream *grin*] it was fresh. as radha mitchell once put it (a modified quote), "pitch black is a really sexy movie with no sex", which is what makes it even more so interesting.so, to summarize, i recommend this movie -- even if you're really not a fan of "space stories". the suspense was kept until the very end and, what's important, we were (or at least i was) left wanting for more. if you can't be bothered to think about psychology, subtext and such (as is my bad habit), you'll still find pitch black highly entertaining. just kick off your shoes and enjoy.

in the future, a disparate group of people asleep aboard a commercial spaceship is forced to improvise their survival when the spaceship crash-lands on a remote, barren planet. they already have one problem in that one of the passengers is intense criminal richard riddick (vin diesel, in his first top-billed role); however, they are soon preyed upon by a strange species of predator that thrives in the darkness - and a rare solar eclipse is soon to take place.while the script for this movie is ultimately on the routine side, it is decently acted and it is especially well-made technically. location work, photography, and design (production as well as creature design) are all very impressive. it is not the most original or stimulating science-fiction / horror picture ever made, far from it, but it still provides good entertainment. diesel is particularly good at getting under the skin of his intimidating character. it is not entirely predictable, however, and gets some points for**spoiler**having a more politically correct ending than most of its type.filmed on location in the desolate coober pedy area of queensland in australia.a sequel of sorts is in the works.7/10

the influences of other science fiction and thriller movies and stories are evident throughout this film. the movies that come to mind immediately are alien, aliens, and starship troopers. the story itself is fairly straightforward and not all that original, hibernated traveling through space, crash landing on planet with no apparent life and a "deserted" geological expedition - except when the lights go out, forcing different types of people to work together toward their mutual survival, while the body count mounts. this kind of movie always tends to be fun, as long as it's done well. i believe that pitch black was done well. the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.vin diesel plays riddick, the stereotypical convicted criminal who has a murderous past, physically prowess, high tolerance for pain, and conveniently can see in the dark. you know he is going to end up doing the right thing at some point in the movie, because it's hinted throughout the movie that he actually may have a conscience about things.cole house plays the drug-addicted bounty hunter who's probably in many ways a real bad guy compared to riddick, as his character reveals itself throughout the movie. it is most likely that he is most courageous when the odds and firepower are in his favor. a very self-serving character that in the end gets what he deserves.radha mitchell plays the co-pilot on the doomed vessel, who is jolted out of deep sleep because the ship ran through a meteor swarm or the tail end of a comment. finding the pilot dead in his sleeping chamber she attempts to land the ship, which leads to our discovery of that's character's potentially fatal flaw - fear of responsibility, accountability, and being a leader. her character in the short span of the story probably grows the most, in that she actually grows some conviction, takes charge, and doesn't sit around waiting to be gobbled up by night stalking aliens. she in some strange way connects with the ever-distant human side of riddick, who in turn in the end, respects her for her choices and her sticking with them.the story in some cases plays out as you would expect it, but i think you'll be mildly surprised by which characters survive this harrowing experience. this movie is an entertaining train-wreck in progress to watch. go watch it!

*possible spoilers*i thought pitch black to be quite enjoyable, with some nice effects--i liked the larger beasts, although they aren't a patch on the aliens from the alien series. it had quite a good atmosphere, which i felt vin diesel helped contribute toward.one thing which kind of stumped me was how it rained. if the planet has three suns and is in almost continuous daylight, where did the moisture come from to form clouds and therefore rain?i liked the fact that fry died at the end--it reminded me of the new hollywood films of the 1970s, with the main heroine not making it to the end.

oh my gosh! this was one of the best sci-fi movies i have ever seen, and quite frankly i can't stand sci-fi films.vin diesel and his co-workers made this movie really enjoyable!!i also must say that vin diesel is by far the most sexiest and most talented male actors i have seen. keep it up vin! your doing great!! as for everyone else good job. i thought the drama and suspense kept the viewers really intrigued. again, great job everyone and i 'm rooting for you vin.sincerely yours, alexandra

this was a great movie and the sequel should know our socks off!!! the action will be nonstop and i just bought the special edition dvd with the animated background story similar to the animatrix. this will put vin diesel back in the spotlight and hopefully get him the coveted role in spider man 3 as venom. he would be the most logical choice for the role. back to pb this movie even though it is a indie thriller, it has a great story and characters with backgrounds that scream for you to want to learn more. if they were to do books or comics it would be a great read. there was one thing that i felt was a little under done. the ending it needed a little work but not every movie will have the best ending.

even though this movie starts off with the usual: something goes wrong, spacecraft crashes, people are stranded etc. it still pulls off and introduces the viewer to some new ideas. riddick is somewhat of a bad-ass convict and has modified his eyes so he is able to see in the dark which is a much sought after ability due to the situation the ship-crew and he gets in. the cutting in the movie is very good and emphasizes the mystique that shrouds around the anti-hero and male protagonist: "riddick." the story in pitch black is, as already mentioned, to some extent very unoriginal and dissatisfied, but the clipping and cutting in the movie blended with some surprising elements which has been added to the story helps it to still support itself very well and one is afterward left behind with a hybrid feeling of satisfaction and hunger for more. vin diesel acts really well in the role as riddick and even though his character is a hardcore, tough survivor he still takes morale decisions almost on the verge of good, but that does not mean his decisions do not turn in his favor at the very end... why destroy an already perfect reputation? all in all this is a very good movie though not perfect. the story seems very unoriginal at the surface, but underneath it shines with enough originality to entertain. some scenes has that wow factor while it as a whole is a bit better than average. it could maybe be described as a cult movie and it is definitely a recommendation for people who wants a spiced up sci-fi story blended with some minor psychological moments and an intriguing protagonist, namely riddick.

people who thought that the chronicles of riddick sucked harder than the black hole that swallowed up event horizon, probably didn't see the movie that spawned vin diesel's skin-headed killer to begin with, and probably have no intention of doing so. too bad, because pitch black actually does kick major ass.directed by genre vet david twohy, (warlock and the excellent but underrated below) and written by siblings jim and ken wheat (lies, silent scream), pitch black begins with an 'alien'-esque prologue. when a combination cargo freighter/passenger ship is badly damaged by a freak meteor shower (in which the captain is also killed), the co-pilot, carolyn fry (silent hill's radha mitchell) has an important decision to make: ditch the cargo or the passengers? close to picking ore over occupants, the crash landing derails her ultimate course of action.no matter, because the catastrophic landing has been made on a foreboding rock that once held a mining colony. amongst the survivors are a couple of settlers, shazza (farscape's claudia black) and zeke (john moore); an imam (keith david) and his young followers (can you say "red shirts" boys and girls?); an antiques dealer named paris ogilvie (lewis fitz-gerald); a 'young boy' named jack (rhianna griffith), and the most controversial members of the group: a marshall named johns (the excellently slimy cole hauser) and his prisoner...a dangerous murderer named riddick (diesel). how the group dynamics shake out make for a lot of the dramatic tension, especially with concerns about riddick and how many people he might slice and dice if he ever gets away. but no one here gets out alive, as the saying goes, and the biggest twists have less to do with how they get along, than how they'll survive when they discover the unthinkable. they are not alone on the planetoid. things that are hungry, taloned and quick are slithering around just where they can't be seen, living in the darkness where they can survive and thrive. they want the flesh of the new arrivals to sate their appetites, but they can't come out into the searing daylight to forage for food.does the phrase "total eclipse" make things a little more interesting? you betcha. hence the more-than-fitting title.vin, more monosyllabic than clint eastwood's dirty harry on his grumpiest day, dripping more testosterone than sweat, has a field day here with a character that really does seem worth a sequel or two, and hauser, oozing menace and bile is every bit as good as his dad wings was at on-screen villainy. surprisingly, though, mitchell holds her own and manages to be strong and sympathetic as fry. you would expect no less than a strong showing from black, she who once was 'aeryn sun', and she doesn't disappoint. (too bad her role wasn't bigger, but that's all i'll say about it.) and david makes his usual indelible impression as the holy man whose faith will truly be tested in the very pit of hell itself.the pace moves faster than riddick slipping up behind his prey with a shank in his teeth, and once the darkness descends, the terror and tension never let up, pretty much as in other classic sci-fi/horror flicks which this imitates. but if imitation truly is the sincerest form of flattery, dave twohy and the wheats deserve major backslaps for getting this one right with a vengeance, and for giving us an ending that is anti-hollywood to the max.i don't want to spoil the surprises, so i won't say much more, except that if you saw chronicles first and weren't too happy, give pitch black a chance anyway. and if you've seen neither, definitely start with this one. i don't know what vin is up to now, but he could certainly do worse than to give these guys a call again. i'd love to see what they would dream up next...

this was a "sleeper" for sure!! much better than i thought! never realizing it was a horror flick.....and who was this gorgeous,baritoned voiced hunk, named vin diesel..adding spice and intrigue to this otherwise unpromoted film ??? the monsters in this film were quite unusual, not the same ol run of the mill gobble-you-up types!!the ending was great, too, for a change, not all "bad guys are bad"!!! i give it 2 thumbs up !!!

pitch black is a surprisingly good movie. i was not a fan of vin diesel before i saw pitch black, but after seeing pitch black my respect for vin diesel has gone up. he did a great job playing riddick a man wanted for many murders. his character is cold and makes many decisions that surprised me, like near the end riddick was going to get on the ship and save his own ass leaving everyone behind to die. i like this movie and how it deals with human instinct. this movie is low budget but this movie goes to show you don't need amazing special effects and lots of money to make a good movie, i think all the characters made this movie. i give this movie 8 out of 10 ;)

this film is a variation of a theme we've all seen over and over again - the posiedan adventure in space. the characters are all stock characters - feisty heroine, judas, coward, etc. etc. the only question really is who's next to snuff it. sometimes this tried and tested formula works - like in this case - but more often not - like the truly mind-numbing "red planet." so why does this one work? because it's stylish. the acting is above average. and above all it isn't predictable. the conclusion isn't sign-posted. i really had no idea how it would all end and was surprised at how it did end. that alone deserves top marks in my book.it's an intriguing and entertaining movie. and though it was never likely to change the face of cinema as we know it, it doesn't disappoint.

yes. watch this movie if you like brave films. this is maybe the best mexican picture since midaq alley just because the excellent cast, the outrageous direction and a sublime soundtrack. many people did not like 'cronica¬Ö', they think it's very aggressive but they didn't understand that it was just a representation with hyper realism of the mexican society but so similar to all the third world families. i hope that benjamin cann and bruno bichir (who in this movie gives another example of his greatness as an actor) soon get together again with a new film. just remember how los olvidados (luis bu√±uel) was misunderstood when released, but now we consider one of the best movies of all times. please, prepare yourself and watch this film.

excuse me if i'm wrong, but "cronica para un desayuno" could be one of the most gretatest films in tne mexican movie history for a lot of reasons. we can get a lot of ingredients for a perfect mexican middle-class family breakfast: a cup of bu√±uel's surrealistic motifs with a little drop of ripstenian desolated scenarios; a pound of phallus symbols around the film and a difficult psychological complexity, more than todd solondz's happiness and the dogma movement films. there`s a lot of sordidness, black humor, repressed dreams (teodoro's dream of fly), incestual lack of control (the relation between marcos and luzma), no-sense parallel stories, a discrete violence, anachronisms anda little sign of hope (spotlighted in luzma, the husband's home return and "un poco mas" used for leit-motif). marcos (bruno bichir) is a charming character ( i think in a bukoskian way), the king-without a-crown who don't expects for anything, but broken noses. luzma (maria rojo) , the lovable wife , put out a lot of faces, but the only thing that she worried is that her sons had breakfast; she' s a loser in many ways and sensual in few moments , but you will fall in love of her. the soundtrack's drag (too much woods) feeds the lack of technical merits, intentional , of course: out-of-focus shots, overlighted close-ups (in introspective scenes), dizzy pans and sudden edition cuts. "cr√≥nica" is something difficult to digest, it get stuck in the throat and anything helps for it. it tastes bitter, like a rotten orange juice and sour like expired milk, but you want to enjoy it. so i recommend to get some melox before the show, because you won't get hungry after all.

this film has the guts to suggest that it might be best to simply accept your life as it is, and keep smiling anyway. as one who is more excited by the idea of taking charge of one's life and moving forward, i felt slapped in the face, but that's okay: i don't have to agree with a movie to love it and respect it. great acting by streep and hurt, and everyone else really, and some wonderfully quirky scenes. a serious film. and take a hanky.

i hate to say i enjoyed this movie as the subject matter does not lend itself to enjoyment. however, i was moved by the way the family relationships were portrayed and the sincerity of the performances. it was the kind of film i told all my friends and family to experience as a reminder of how important we all are to each other.

i think one true thing is one of meryl streeps finest movies to date. her depiction of a dying woman is perfect. i have recently lived this movie, and it touched me on more levels than i could have imagined. meryl is truely the greatest actress to have ever walked the earth!!!!!

a great story, although one we are certainly familiar with. meryl streep proves that she is truly the best actress in film today. very entertaining, and just what i expected. don't go see this film unless you are prepared to be used and manipulated emotionally, but if you have that expectation, then you will enjoy the ride.....

after renting one true thing the other night, i have learned to respect my family, and not take their health for granted. i have never seen such a real-life portrayal of a cancer victim on screen like meryl delivered. she deserves the oscar nomination, but she has some tough competitors in the running. all i can say is beautiful film, great acting from streep and zellwegger. meryl streep revealed her one true ability in this excellent film!

i saw this movie in september with my mother. i was expecting a good movie, and i saw an excellent one. this is now my most treasured movie. it did not leave me after i left the theater. the situations in this movie reminded me of my late grandmother. meryl streep and renee zellweger were equally incredible. this movie has made me realize how important family relationships are. rent it. i can't recommend it enough.

meryl streep may be the greatest actor working today. her chameleonic portrayals never fail to astonish; she seems actually to be the characters she brings to the screen. in "one true thing," she gives life to a deceptively straightforward, profoundly complex woman doing her best to play the hand life has dealt to her. surviving with cancer is no easy task, and not just surviving but actually continuing to live one's life is even harder--and this is precisely what kate gulden (streep) means to do. renee zellweger ("jerry maguire") not only holds her own in this exalted company but shines as streep's daughter, who learns to see in a new light her parents' lives as well as her own. streep is a powerhouse and deservedly received an oscar nomination for her work here; her "i'm only going to say this once" dialogue with zellweger will leave you devastated. zellweger, though, is the real revelation--her face conveys every emotion, every conflict as she begins to learn the many truths about her parents' strengths and weaknesses. director carl franklin ("devil in a blue dress") handles the extremely difficult story material with sureness and delicacy.

i loved this movie. to be very fair, the movie starts off very slowly, with none of the characters being terribly sympathetic. it continues in this way for a good half of the film.but, if you're patient, you'll be greatly rewarded. what the first half of the movie lacks in character development and/or sympathy is adequately compensated for in the second half. it's a bit like riding a roller coaster - a slow, uphill climb to strat off with, and then speed, twists and turns, and a few surprises.as usual, meryl streep is wonderful. she is the finest actress of our time. william hurt is good, if a bit wooden in spots. renee zellweger does a very good job, showing that her performance in jerry mcguire wasn't a fluke.

"one true thing" is a very quiet film, that opened in the fall of 1998 to glowing reviews but mild box-office. it tells the crippled story of ellen (renee zellweger), a workaholic who is forced to move back home to take care of her terminally ill mother (meryl streep), so that her aloof father (william hurt) can run his academic department. these terms are only general. the strength of "one true thing" lies in the way the actors elevate their characters above hollywood clich√© territory.streep is kate, the perfect homemaker whose ability to light up a room with her charm is evident in her opening scenes at a costume party celebrating hurt's birthday. but ellen has never been close to her mother, and since she graduated from harvard university, has a certain destain about her- ellen almost thinks her mother is a simplistic air-head. while on the other hand, she admires her father- who shares a special passion: writing. ellen writes for an aggressive new york firm, and is almost heartbroken when her latest piece is torn down by hurt, who seems to be a very lonely figure.to get to the point, as kate gets sicker, ellen's perspectives change and she grows closer to her mother and more distant to her father. hurt keeps making excuses not to be there when the family needs him most, and ellen assumes he's having an affair. meanwhile she's given up her desk at work to spend time doing craft activities with her mother's "cult" group the minnies, and also learning that her mother isn't as weak as she first assumed.without giving too much away, "one true thing" is a masterpiece in character study. streep once again turns in a beautiful performance, this time working on a subtle level that starts slow but ends with a brilliant speech on the vows of marriage. streep earned her eleventh oscar nomination for this performance. hurt is also convincing as the father who carries a secret that isn't revealed until the closing moments. but it is renee zellweger who steals this movie. forget "chicago", "cold mountain", "bridget jones's diary" or whatever else you've seen her do and rent this movie. she is remarkable in it. working within her character's bitter resentment at understanding her parents, zellweger manages a realistic portrayal of a young woman fighting to keep her lip up while she's screaming inside.

this movie started out confusing and grew into one of the best movies i have seen... the acting was utterly superb and when i wasn't drying my tears i enjoyed meryl streep, who's performance was extraordinary. the movie deals with the hardships of a distant family coping with a mother who develops terminal cancer. the movie was very difficult to watch and heartbreaking. the soundtrack fits this movie to a tee. brava bette midler!! out of 5 stars, i give this one 4 1/2.

if you are among the imdb audience that put high fidelity in the all-time top 200, then this movie probably is not for you. this film is as unhip as steve frears is self-consciously hip. renee zellweger is excellent as a hip urbane magazine writer who returns to her suburban bucks county nest in order to care for mother streep (who delivers yet another hall-of-fame performance). william hurt is ideally cast and the feckless, faithless, and egotistical husband. if this movie doesn't move you to cry and laugh, then you are much too hip to enjoy it.

i have loved one true thing since the first time i watched it in the theater, and cried my eyes out. i bought it as soon as it was available, and have lost track of how many times i've watched it.to me one true thing is the ultimate family relationship movie. i love watching the relationships in the family change and evolve into what they end up being. i can relate to many details in the movie. my mother died of bone cancer, so it really hits home with me. maybe this is why i love it so much.i like the relationships between the children and their parents, and the relationship of brother and sister, but especially love the relationship between husband and wife. to me it is truly beautiful.i highly recommend this move to anyone who enjoys this kind of movie.

one true thing proves that it's the characters which make a movie. streep will surely receive an oscar nomination for her role. a beautiful drama, one true thing is a prime example of movie-making in the late 1990's - there are still people out there who care about making and watching movies other than the big blockbusters with million dollar special effects. it's no best picture or anything... don't be silly. but the amount of emotion that was delivered by both the actors and the writer hit me like a shock-wave. i cried twice in this movie, which says a lot for a 24 year old man.

"one true thing" puts zellweger in the midst of a family crisis as an adult journalist who returns home to care for her dying mother (streep). somber and plodding, the film studies the adult child coming to terms with the adult view of her parents as they are slowly revealed to be something less than the ideal she grew up knowing as a child. an excellent character study and a find production with little to fault, "ott" offers three fine performances by a trio of top actors and some plaintive reflections on life and death.

i don't cry easily over movies, but i have to admit, this one brought me to tears. although i am not a ms. streep fan, her performance was excellent. the title defines in a sentence what a mother's love is. for the first hour i didn't like any of the characters, but that changed as the movie went on. the movie also explained why certain marriages last even though there are obstacles. a must see film.

written by someone who has been there, you can tell, but only if you've been there. excellent performances by meryl streep (of course!), renee zellweger and william hurt.many people have said that it is about a dysfunctional family, i think every family is dysfunctional when they are facing this kind of torment. to not be dysfunctional would be dysfunctional! you are losing your family as you know it, can anything be worse? people need to see this movie so when they are faced with this nightmare maybe they will change how they do it. maybe they will see that the father is denying himself valuable time he'll never get a chance at again. maybe they will realize how hard it is to die, or to watch someone you love die. they didn't miss much of the nightmare, it's hard to forget.

the dvd jacket in which this movie came describes it as "uplifting and humorous." those are not the words i would have chosen - not by a long shot. i would choose a word like "sombre," sometimes even "depressing." which isn't to say that it's a bad movie. it's actually a pretty good movie, featuring good performances from the leads, with enough uncertainty throughout about what's going to happen at the end that you keep watching. the uncertainty comes from the structure of the movie - it seems to revolve around ellen's reminiscences of her mother's slow death from cancer, as she is interviewed by the da. so, we know from the start that something suspicious happened at the end - the questions are "what?" and "who?" renee zellweger was very good as ellen - the somewhat resentful daughter who has to give up her life and job in new york to return home to care for her sick mother. ellen evolves through the movie - moreso than any other character - as she learns to deal with both the strengths and weaknesses of her parents. her relationship with her father (william hurt) is quite interesting. my initial impression was that they were quite close, but the warts in the relationship start to show after a while. hurt was effective as the detached husband - detached not in an uncaring way, but in the sense of being unable to cope with what's happening to his wife, and seeking escape from it in various ways. finally, meryl streep as the cancer-stricken kate was very convincing in the role, seeking to live out what remains of her life in the most fulfilling way possible, then dealing with the anger she feels at her increasing debilitation. in a way, watching a family deal with this kind of crisis reminded me a little bit of "ordinary people," although this movie was far less emotionally intense. so, not "uplifting and humorous" (with all due respect to whoever wrote the synopsis on the dvd jacket) but very good in its own way. 7/10

"one true thing" is the kind of movie where the audience is inspired greatly greatly inspired performances. i am not necessarily stating that the film is uplifting, because it isn't. in fact, the movie is down right depressing. i am trying to say that it takes a lot for a movie to generate emotional tears from an attending crowd.i cried in "one true thing," enough to conclude that this is one of the most emotionally powerful movies of 1998. the characters were perfectly casted. the performances are all guaranteed oscar nominees, especially meryl streep, who portraits the dying kate extremely well. her acting alone was enough to make the movie excel to the point of recommendation, and gives you a new point of view at her. i also thought that ren√©e zellweger portrayed a realistic single, free-wheeling woman who has to take care of their own mother. the other cast members including william hurt & tom everett scott, were also superb. the script of this movie was really fantastic. it is kind of funny how the movie's concept has to do with the controversial happenings in my local area. you see, i live near lansing, michigan, and right now a big issue here is assistant suicide doctor jack kavorkian's (excuse my miss-spelling if so) ways have just been outlawed. the public will vote on this according to their beliefs in november after watching "one true thing" it really changed my perspective at this topic, although i have always believed in it. without revealing the ending of the film i will simply say that suicide is a distant theme in this movie and i think it fits in accurately with the gorgeous story. overall, this movie does indeed have more emotional impact than "titanic," "saving private ryan" or any other tearjerker released in the last few years. i think that is because the main idea of this movie is that this kind of thing happened every day, so it relates better to an audience. and indeed, that this could happening to you.

meryl streep as kate, a woman dying of cancer, performs her role admirably. no wonder she was up for an oscar. in the part she proves that caring and nurturing housewives are just as important as their sisters out in the business world. and the lesson she teaches about life's expectations and their lack of fulfillment as the relationship grows, that is the most important thing she teaches her daughter. we can expect too much of our mates. realize that there are many slips and forgiveness or understanding are the main ingredients of a happy life. this is a sombre movie and the ending though sad, shows reconciliation between the father and daughter. i give this one a ten.

i wonder sometimes if maybe meryl streep has become so accepted as the most impressive, versatile actress since, well, maybe just about the beginning of the sound era that maybe her talent is now taken for granted. there are probably about three tics that she relies on consistently throughout her performances (most noticeably a pinched lip), but other than that, her performances are amazingly variable and original and fresh expressions of internal workings. even though "sophie's choice" and "a cry in the dark" and "silkwood" may be showier, her work here and in "bridges in madison county" is remarkable, too - just more subtle. in "one true thing", she is mostly sweet and in love with her domesticated life, and streep makes what could be routine, even boring, seem attractive and charming. i think that she must work out these mini-theses for each character and find what things make this person real and interesting. she works from the inside out with each character, and maybe it's this essential quality that has evoked the main criticism of aloofness or self-consciousness. i don't think she's cold at all, but instead has thought out her character's unique qualities. i think her critics are confusing self-consciousness with intelligence. not too many other actors would be so complexly thoughtful and creative as to make kate muldrun lightweight and carefree within her beloved, homey environment, only to later reveal unprecedented depth because of her genuine attachment to that homey environment. her performances are of an unsurpassed consistency, she rarely does anything wrong. i wonder if it's conceivable for any of streep's pictures to not seem diminished because of her presence... anyway, kate loves her home, and her affection for her "family life" is as endearing as her new conflict within the home is jarring. when all of this comes together, and kate starts to recognize that she can no longer function in the same capacity, and she breaks the pie dish and screams out that she is not handicapped, it is painfully sad to watch because this has not been someone prone to emotion. streep is smart enough and generous enough to recognize how much better everything works because she has felt out the dramatic validity of kate and it's really the only scene when she allows her character to go. but how refreshingly true it is to see a character who can really surprise you by displaying something that you wouldn't have thought possible. once again, streep's character has at least three dimensions... god, this sounds like a thesis itself, but as an actress, streep just has a special kind of intelligence, incredible empathy and great expressive skills. the movie itself is probably somewhat mediocre. i suppose william hurt is meant to be an unlikeable jerk, and he does pompousness very well. i think hurt is really kind of creepy, though. script is quite standard - another tribute to streep that she was as touching and believable as she was.

kate gulden, played by one of the most nominated actresses of the last decade of this century, and also one of the most talented actresses meryl streep(out of africa). she is wonderful is every part that she plays. the yale graduate is the pride and joy of the american cinema.kate's health is deteriorating and her husband, george, role well developed by brilliant actor and also oscar winner, william hurt (smoke, kiss of the spider woman) has a hard time with the deteriorating health of his one true thing, and seeks his daughter's help. the poor daughter, ellen gulden, ren√©e zellweger (jerry maguire) has way too much expected of her. no breaks! the story takes a very realistic view on the illness of a parent. in this movie the only daughter has to put her life on hold to care for the needs of others. there is always one in every family who faces that kind of responsibility. ellen is angry the beginning of the movie, but as time passes she ends up understanding her mothers' life time dedication to her family. she even asks her mom: how do you do his, every day, in and out and nobody notices it? that is what women do, a lot of what i call invisible work. moreover we clean, we fix, we mend, we stretch, we celebrate, we are the best friends, we are confidants, the mistress, outreachers, disciplinarians, sensitive. some of us, like both women in this movie, have the perfect education, are the psychological pillar for the entire family and also do all that invisible work! that is kate ellen, and many women in our society. many of us have already gone through that stage of life when our parents age and died. i have been there. they just went too young. i have given my parents my thanks, but i never understood them as well as when i had to play their roles, and had to walk in their shoes. this movie mirrors the reality of life. perhaps it is sad, but that is how life is, at times. george a professor at harvard is complicated person, who appears to think that his work is more important than everybody else, and has a very "master/servant" mentality toward the women in his life. he is not strong enough to cope. if you want to see good acting and the reality of life do not miss this movie. favorite scenes: the restaurant coming to kate, violins and all. the making of a table out of broken china. that i so symbolic! we are all broken vessels! favorite quotes: george: "it is only by going uphill, that you realize that you are really going downhill." george "you have a harvard education but where is your heart?" 

it's not surprising that the majority of higher-rated votes were submitted by females aged 45+. this is the timeframe in women's lives when they become the caretakers of aged and ill parents. i lost my mother, from complications of cancer, in june, and went through most of the same emotions portrayed by zellweger in this film. yes, it made me cry, but the tears were real, the characters were real, and the plot development extremely accurate. kudos to the entire cast and crew for a wonderful portrayal of life and death, and the promises of tomorrow.

one true thing rises above its potentially schlocky material to give us a view of a family of complex relationships and flawed, real people. it opens with rene zeleweger discussing her mother's death with the district attorney; sparing us the cheap cinematic shots of a "shocking" illness and death. from there it proceeds into a look at a family system, in which everyone plays by a set of unexamined rules, and uses the mother's cancer to show what happens when all the rules change. william hurt as the self-important father, and meryl streep as the suzy homemaker mother are both superb; nuanced and not what they appear to be. zeleweger is seething, angry and surprised with herself. tom everett scott doesn't have much to do, but he does it well.the story is predictable, and takes at least one badly soppy turn it needn't have taken, but the performances, and the view of family as a place where anger and love are equally mixed, make it worthwhile.

what impressed me the most about "one true thing" was how up-front it was when the daughter mentions her mother's cancer at the beginning of the movie. as depressing the subject matter was, it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being blindsided with the revelation about a character's fatal illness 2/3 into the movie ("love story" "terms of endearment", etc.). meryl streep, renee zellweger and william hurt give very strong performances that don't go over the edge. the characters they play seem human; they're not perfect people. (arguably, one might not say that about the "martha stewart"-type character streep plays but throughout the film, i found her character to be noble in a non-sappy way. she's dealing with her plight the best way she knows how.) "one true thing" is an observant, unsentimental family drama in which the tears at the end were well-earned.

the reason i think this movie is fabulous is that it has so many layers of emotion. from the script and the fabulous acting you can tell that there is a history behind all of the feelings that there are. you understand why the characters take certain actions and why the do not make others. you can feel sympathy and joy and love and sorrow for them all at once. you see humanity at its best and at it's worst. you can relate to the characters because although you may have never been in their exact situations before you see qualities and downfalls in them that you see in yourself. to a certain extent this movie kind of keeps you wondering but then at the end it explains itself and you feel a certain peace and understanding not only in you but for the characters. i will say that i have have never ever cried so much in my life nor have gotten so much out of something. i implore you to watch this movie and take it's meaning to heart. that there is only one true thing and that is... love.

this movie was a very good universal monster movie. it once again stars lon chaney as the wolfman and glenn strange as frankenstein's monster. oh yeah, that jerk john carradine is back again as dracula. i like every actor in this movie. i especially liked onslow stevens as dr. edelmann. (it's spelled with 2 n's) i thought it was a good idea to have the goodhearted doctor himself doomed like talbot was. one scene that i think is very good is the scene when dr. edelmann is in deep thought as he changes. everything that is troubling him flashes before your eyes. the good doctor is saying no while his evil side is saying yes. that's the only reason why i didn't want the dracula character eliminated completely from this movie. i thought dracula had no business in house of frankenstein. if his character was taken out you wouldn't miss him. in this film the doctor's blood is contaminated with dracula's, giving him his jekyll and hyde curse. i hate john carradine and i don't think he should have ever played dracula. i didn't mind other actors playing the frankenstein monster after the great karloff because they all did good jobs. but when they get another actor to play dracula it stops right there. john carradine thought he was so high and mighty. they offered him the role of the frankenstein monster once and he turned it down because he thought he was too highly trained. i could just picture carradine if he did play the monster arguing with the director on the set, "i don't have to take this from you, i've done shakespeare." john carradine wasn't dracula and he never will be. sorry john, bela lugosi is the one and only dracula. thank god they got bela to come back as dracula for abbott and costello meet frankenstein. don't miss this movie. it doesn't disappoint you and you will enjoy it as you did the other. this is a very good addition to the monster movies. if you're a collector, be sure not to leave this one out.

despite all of the comparisons to house of frankenstein, this movie outshines its predecessor and is one of the funnest monster movies in the universal monsters series, and sadly, the last. o.k. so it doesn't exactly stack up to something like the bride of frankenstein as one a classic to revered by fans of all movies, but with a cast of dracula, the wolf man and frankenstein's monster (what? no mummy?) you can't help but enjoy this schlock fest! and unlike house of frankenstein, the monsters in this movie interact a lot more. but this movie also offers some unique story lines for both dracula and the wolf man who both go to dr. adleman for cures of their afflictions. while the wolf man actually does find a cure, dracula injects his blood into the doctor and that's when the real fun begins! i highly recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies. but remember, i never said it was good, just fun.

this movie has the look and feel of having been put together in a matter of days-kind of like plan 9 from outer space. in spite of this, it's still a classic-ranking among my favorite creature features. *****possible spoilers ahead******* count dracula and larry talbot; aka wolfman, arrive at the laboratory of dr. edelman seeking a cure for their nocturnal anti-social behavior, such as killing people. in the meantime, kindly dr. edelman discovers the body of the frankenstein monster. becoming obsessed with bringing it back to life( a common character trait among scientists, mad or otherwise), he goes against his better judgement, resulting in monster mayhem and madness. one of the final universal classics of it's time (abbot and costello meet frankenstein followed 3 years later), it rates a 10 with this reviewer. onslow steven steals the show as good doctor gone bad after being infected by the blood of dracula and becoming a half- werewolf/vampire creature, coming to a tragic end. at 1 hour 7 min. it packs quite a punch. a worthy addition to my video collection.rating: ***** out of *****

i give this a 10 out of 10, not because the plot was hard to uncover because it wasn't... but because it leaves one caring for the characters. the acting, by all the cast, is superb, especially joan hickson, and it's a marvellous episode because of it's heart. miss marple is called upon by jason rafiel's dying request to investigate, and solve, a murder that happened some seven or eight years previously, and she has to discover who, why and when as she goes along. mr rafiel is the same rafiel as was in a caribbean mystery and so there is a sense of a connection here. nemesis is definitely one for the amateur psychologists among us, and if you are one of those who is only happy with lots of blood, guts and rip-roaring action sequences, then you won't like it. but if you are like me, one who loves knowing about people and discovering what makes them tick, then nemesis is the one for you.

made the same year as the first lumiere films, this is a much more dramatic short than the brothers attempted until the following year's 'niagara'. the surviving print is very rough, but this only adds to the turneresque visual violence, as huge surges of water dash against a stolid pier, and seem ready to engulf the camera, the viewer.if you watch a number of these early shorts in chronological order, and try to get into the mindset of the times, there is a further shock in that, unlike the single frame set-ups of the lumieres, this film features an edit, which for me at any rate, was as slashing as the razor blade in 'un chien andoulu).unlike the mono-vision of the lumieres' films, paul opens up the possibility of multiple perspectives, freeing the viewer from the power of nature, eluding its grasp in a way the lumieres never could. the second shot features a similar gush to that of niagara, but is less frightening because, by way of the edit, we have sidestepped the danger. in a film like 'l'arroseur arrosse' or 'repas du bebe', nature stands indifferent and powerful, uncontainable by the camera. basic film grammar puts an end to its supremacy.

anyone who has seen the trailer for this film would be forgiven for thinking this film is an out and out comedy. in actual fact it's a light-hearted, though not overly funny, romp about a couple of highwaymen.there are numerous faults in the film. the script and plot are weak and the love aspect of the story is strangely dull. yet despite all this it is quite enjoyable, thanks largely to the two leads robert carlyle and jonny lee miller. these two fine actors, carlyle in particular, are always good to watch and here there exists a good chemistry between them.director jake scott is the next generation of the family whose brothers, ridley and tony, have given us films such as alien, blade runner, true romance and more recently g.i. jane and enemy of the state. his debut is directed with energy and enthusiasm, which keeps the film fizzling along, although without the strong cast he assembled the results might not have worked as well.in short if you're looking for an easy enjoyable film to pass an hour and a half then you could do a lot worse than plunkett and macleane. if on the other hand you fancy something subtle, historically accurate and thought provoking, go elsewhere. 7/10.

this is a very dark movie, somewhat better than the average asylum film. it was a lot better than i thought it would be, is a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror film. the voice on the telephone is really creepy - this voice without a face, this unknown and threatening voice works really well in the film, since we never see the killer face is left to the imagination of the spectator.the action and suspense never decay and after the first half of the film, it becomes vertiginous; there is not much gore in this film, just enough to serve the story and also the director does a good job at holding your attention. i gave this movie a 8/10 because some clich√©s.

i was pleasantly surprised to find a very enjoyable film that kept my attention throughout. i am a horror fan and i see almost everything in that genre, but dead line managed to freak me out. the pace is very cleverly set and andr√©s bagg does a good performance as a desperate man. what is underneath the main plot? a trip to madness. how can you end up like that? martin sanders ask him self while he sees a homeless speaking to him self, alone in the street. close to the end of the film, the character of aaron mandel asks the same question while he sees another homeless doing the same thing; not knowing, yet, that this homeless is martin sanders, answering the question of the beginning of the film. the broken eyeglasses in two are a clear symbol of rupture and division... of personality. the ending is jaw dropping and you just know that a sequel would have to be made.

good movie, all elements of a good movie was there, story, actors, script, and direction. i was on the edge of my seat the whole time.no question about it, is a low budget film, but i liked it more than many big budget films.andres bagg plays martin sanders, who is dealing with his unfaithful wife. then a voice in the telephone and then just fear.virginia lustig is beautiful and brings a powerful performance. she is an excellent part to the film.i liked the increasing ambiguity near the end, even though we know that the main character can be involved, we continued seeing everything from his point of view and asking: who is the killer?

sometimes, when seeking a movie nothing will do except a good thriller. dead line certainly fits the bill. a little warning however: if you are going to watch this film you are better off not knowing too much specifics about the plot. the plot thickens as the film goes by. a really remarkably well built tension mounts. it is deep and horrifying. it goes all the way to the darkest places in human mind.the plot also has some very surprising shifts. just wait till nightfall, turn off the light and watch this film.

i was pleasantly surprised by how good the movie was. whether you're a gore fan or a suspense fan; you'll love this. i used to dislike horror movies, considered them stupid. but, anyway, it happens i make exceptions. i find something really extraordinary in this film. rarely have i ever seen a film that has scared the crap out of me but i tell you the truth this film gave me shivers down my neck. unlike most horror films this one cares about the development of the characters. i highly recommend this film and i'm glad that asylum are finally bringing out good horror movies these days i recommend! enjoy!

it's become extremely difficult to find a good horror movie anymore, thought this movie was a good thriller.could have had better production values but what kept me going was the suspense and the twists. i had real reservations before seeing this movie (because of the cover). i was afraid that it would be excessively bloody and gory. i was wrong.although there is a lot of scary parts, there is a lot of suspense and drama too.the acting in dead line was better than what you would expect from a micro budget horror flick. the characters were believablethe movie is really thrilling and quite scary at moments so it makes you grab your seat until the ending credits rollbecause of its production values (the sound is not very good for example) 8/10.

i absolutely loved this movie! it's my number one favorite. although there were a few flaws (what movie doesn't have flaws?), this movie was very well written, directed, and produced. the characters in this movie are very real and believable. they made all of the characters fit into a specific role. i think that the most apparent thing about "here on earth" was the love triangle as well as the other emotional situations brought into the movie. it's not one of those movies where you just can't seem to relate to anything, because in it are situations that everyone is or has been in. there are so many different things going on in this movie that it is hard not to relate to it. i am just 18 years old and i can even relate to it. it was heart warming and wrenching at the same time. "here on earth" will make you laugh, cry, and sometimes angry. i give this movie an excellent review and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion!

ok..you people need to settle down! this movie is not that bad. i saw it for the first time last night and fell in love with it! i do have to admit that i have never been a fan of leelee sobieski but she grew on me in this movie. i do think josh hartnett is good looking, but c'mon..chris klein is the most gorgeous man i think i have ever seen!!! he made that movie better for me. c'mon girls..when he has no shirt on and goes to get water i know your mouth dropped. yes, i know in the beginning he is a jerk, but in the end he realizes how he acted and learns to be a great guy. if he wouldn't have come at the end..then i would have been mad. i do think a couple of lines did not need to be said but all in all it was a great movie! i definitely recommend it!

i own this movie. i've seen it over 20 times and every time i still get weepy. its a great love story, surprises, and you can definately feel chemistry between klein and sobiesky. i definately give this movie a perfect 10. i recommend this to anyone.

i just watched this movie for the first time after finishing the book last week. what's the problem here? folks admit that the performances are great--i mean, lange is stellar!--and that the film is good-looking, but it's got less than a '6'! i don't get it. come on! the writing's not that bad!having read a lot of pulitzer-winning novels, and having seen a lot of the films based on them, i think a better-than-decent job was done in bringing the screenplay together. i thought the paring down of all the dialogue in the novel was executed almost perfectly. this story had a pretty hefty amount of dialogue in it, and the story really came through on the screen despite the fact that only a portion of it was used.**book spoiler part** i was, however, a little disappointed in the ginny-tries-to-kill-rose subplot's being omitted. i thought that was one of the more emotionally jarring parts of the book, but it was probably a good bet to leave it out. avid movie-goers, more than avid readers, i think, tend to be less forgiving of protagonists pulling antagonistic stuff. it's apt to confuse johnny lunchpail and joe sixpack.if you loved the book, you will like the movie. if you hated the book, you will likely hate the movie.********rog

okay...so i am gazing through my mom and dad's extensive dvd collection (mostly because they don't charge late fees;-)) and i come upon "a thousand acres." i was stunned that here was a movie that had jessica lange and michelle pfeiffer (with a small appearance by jennifer jason leigh) that i had not seen. i don't think i had ever even heard of it before. well, this is exactly the kind of find that i dream about since i have to admit that my parents raised two movie buffs in my brother and me. with a few exceptions (neither of us can even get them to consider watching the lord of the rings movies, but my dad loves the matrix trilogy -- go figure), we have very similar tastes in movies.it was a particularly awful day today, weather-wise. it poured rain all day, so i popped in this movie and shortly after i was mesmerized.this has to be one of the all-time best "sleepers" i have seen. jessica lange and michelle pfeiffer are great in their roles especially since they are playing very different types. jessica lange's character is a people-pleasing follower who, despite her being the senior child in the family rarely takes a leadership role. rather, she bows to her father (jason robards) and sister rose (pfeiffer) and is hell-bent on teaching her little sister caroline (leigh) how to follow suit. michelle pfeiffer plays a very strong willed cancer survivor who is barely able to keep the anger at her unhappy life contained. this movie is five years prior to white oleander, mind you, so it was definitely inspiring to see her playing such a strong, angry character.i would have to say that this movie will probably appeal more to women. however, true movie buffs who enjoy a film for what it is, regardless of genre or target audience, will have a hard time denying the charm of this touching drama about family secrets and what they do the people involved and those who love them. i don't know how i missed seeing this movie before now, but it sure was a nice distraction on a rainy afternoon. enjoy!!

a touching movie. it is full of emotions and wonderful acting. i could have sat through it a second time.

i watched this movie, having never read the book, and took the characters at face value, but having already been introduced to them, watched it again recently. i got a whole different viewpoint out of the film.without the burden of having to focus intently on each character, learning their quirks and foibles, allowed me to focus on the cultural issues laid out in the film. the farm families of iowa are so intimately inter-related as they are in the area of indiana where i grew up in the 40's and 50's that i immediately recognized the back-stories and motives behind the characters. perhaps, jane smiley did mean for us to see beyond the superficial into the world these people had to live, but viewers are so caught up in the "hollywood" aura of the individual actors that they miss a rich layout of a lifestyle that exists less and less as each decade passes. another film with these characteristics is the "bridges of madison county". try watching both of these films again with an eye to the whole picture.

a jane smiley novel, loosely based on shakespeare's king lear about the cook family and its dark secrets. director moorhouse seems tamed in her approach, allowing the characters to step forward and take a bow. and how could you go wrong with the talents of pfeiffer, lange, leigh, firth, carradine and robards?

graphics: brilliant, obviously. the most stunning things were definitely not given away in the trailers. fight sequences move extremely fast, but after watching a couple of them your eyes should be used to it and it won't seem so confusing. cloud has a wide array of swords, and i kinda wish things were moving a little slower just so we could see them, because they were each incredibly detailed. oh, and we finally get to see exactly how one equips materia...music: brilliant also. i was a bit nervous about it, since (from what i've seen) nobuo isn't the best at writing music to go along with action (remember the steal the tiny bronco sequence?), but it's brilliant and it fits perfectly. i'm glad i preordered the ost. they changed the lyrics to one winged angel though, so you won't be able to sing along if you know the carmina burana lyrics.plot: the first half of the movie sets up things and introduces everyone in a fairly complex tapestry, but the second half is almost entirely fight sequences, once all the players are in place. i wouldn't call it a weak plot, but it's nowhere near as convoluted as the game's plot was. i think this is in an effort to avoid trying to overshadow the game, and i think that's a good thing...the movie is its own entity, and shouldn't try to top the original in terms of sheer plot.i admit, i was kind of hoping that this movie would bring ff7 to a wider range of people, but this is not a mainstream movie. i was going to give it only nine stars, just because it doesn't even really try to explain anything to newcomers...marlene (at least i think it was marlene...sounded like her) gives a bit of background at the beginning, but it's more of a refresher than a crash course. but then i realized, for me this movie is a 10/10, so why should i take off points just because other people probably won't like it as well...if you've played the game, or are at least passingly familiar with it, you should see this movie. but you don't need me to tell you that. if you're not familiar with it, go out and buy it, sit there for twenty hours and beat it, and then see the movie...although even without any background, it's still stunningly beautiful. you just won't get any of the inside references...which make up 50% of the movie (that is, everything that isn't a fight sequence).

"duckman" is a great show. i first saw it when i was 10 years old at the time and after school i rushed home and turned on comedy central. i saw a cartoon called "duckman" and i loved it!! it's such a funny and cool show. it's created by klasky-csupo, who are great creators of cartoons. they animated some of my favorite shows ever, like "the simpsons" and "rugrats".i've seen lots of episodes of this show and i think they're all really funny and sweet. the voice actors did a great job voicing the characters, too.i wish that comedy central could bring this show back, along with "the critic" and "dilbert".but this is a great comedy central show. great job, klasky-csupo!

rated tv-14 for sexual content and language.i remembered hearing about this show back in 1998 when it used to play on the channel teletoon.i didn't watch it then but now, it plays on the channel, razer.i have seen about four episodes of this show and i must say, it is fairly intelligent and funny.the show stars jason alexander of seinfeld fame and also tim curry of rocky horror picture show and it fame.the show is about a duck who is a police officer.he basically does his job as a policeman, while coping with personal problems.this show is fairly funny at times and fans of animated-comedy will like this.

perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the usa, "duckman" runs short at 70 episodes in four seasons.unlike the often innocuous criticism found in "the simpsons" (a pretty good show in its own right), and the rude-for-rudeness-sake humour in "south park," every bit of this series follows a plan. the criticism of us society, from its mercantilism to its selfishness, carries much more bite than it does in any other animated series.the cultural references in "duckman" also tend to be obscure sometimes (anyone browsing the fan sites will realize most have not even been caught). in that, it is different from "the simpsons," which usually uses pop culture instead of the high-brow stuff often hidden in "duckman." as other people writing about it notice, there is a growth in the characters (bernice, duckman and cornfed). also, by making the main character not just an offensive neurotic but in fact someone who is living a personal tragedy (as is made clear in episodes like "the once and future duck" ('you'll love her until the end of your days...') and in "bev takes a holiday" (when he takes a chance to tell beverly all those things he couldn't tell beatrice), the series is anchored in a deep sense of reality.one can't avoid feeling sorry for him and his lucid madness.all in all, in my opinion, the best cartoon ever made in the usa and one of the best series ever. i doubt it will ever be on dvd though. far too many things the duck said make much more sense today.

duckman was a show that used to be on during the last hour or so before it was time to sleep about ten or so years ago. it was a contrast to a lot of the kid-type of animation i was watching at the time; i was still a minor junkie for disney and looney tunes stuff, and most saturday morning cartoons were still on the run-off of the peak from the days of ninja turtles and batman. but also around this time i began to recognize that the more raunchy, mature, surreal, obscene, and (though i didn't know the term at the time) satirical cartoon shows were more creative than the stuff i was used to. around the time of beavis and butt-head, ren and stimpy, and even the maxx were hitting tv sets via mtv, usa put out two shows- one of them was weird science, and the other was duckman. i've always remembered a few key bits from the show, and some of the lines are very quotable to those who haven't forgotten it completely. luckily, i found a tape recently with about six episodes i taped long ago, and the jokes stayed very fresh. and the delivery of the jokes are rapid-fire a lot of the time in the better episodes. in the voice department, the choices in talent are top notch for the story-lines, which are usually just an excuse for crude, fascinating parodies of pop-culture, politics, movies and tv shows, music, detective mysteries, and the dysfunctional family unit. jason alexander is a wonderful choice for duckman, and his performance is a comedic 180 from his days on seinfeld (even if there might be some similar characteristics here and there). also, the voices of gregg berger as the unmistakably monotoned and deadpan cornfed, dweezil zappa as the hilariously inept ajax, and nancy travis as the sex-starved, obnoxious sister-in-law bernice, all contribute in a full amount. along with some great writing - even when a joke isn't sure-fire, the wit behind it compensates - the animation style, while a far cry from some of the refurbished, computer-enhanced product of today, is inventive and often abstract. it has that home-made, gritty quality that beavis and butt-head or south park would later have. and, like those shows, if you're a little kid, i mean little as in younger than i was watching the show, you may not understand most of the jokes (i.e. there are enough stripper and vd references to fill two shows sometimes). but it's inventive to catch if it's on tv late at night, and it functions rather well in that time slot. one can only hope for a dvd box set. so, to no one who's barely or even never heard of this program, here's a general note: think of this show as if dashiell hammett met up with walt disney and decided to go to slum part of vegas with a free mini-bar and make a collaboration in the vein of luis bunuel and the simpsons combined. not to mention, it's by the group that did rugrats.(strong) a

i've always enjoyed animated ducks for some reason: duck tales, darkwing duck, daffy duck, donald duck. though none of them are as deranged as duckman. originally broadcast between 1994 and 1997 duckman lasted for a total 70 episodes but could easily have gone on forever without becoming stale.the titular character is a discombobulated, unapologetic slob and pretty much the worst living person in the world. he's a private detective, a widower, a peeping tom, an alcoholic, a sex maniac, a murderer, a (fill in the blank). you name it, duckman has done it. but who can blame him for being such a slimeball when the world he/we live in is so insane, outrageous and just plain nonsensical? eric tiberius duckman(voiced by the maniacal jason alexander) could carry the whole show by himself but when he's surrounded by a bunch of eccentric supporting characters you just know that trouble is just waiting to explode at every opportunity. my favorite has to be willibald feivel cornfed (or just cornfed pig), duckman's incredibly deadpan sidekick who is seemingly talented and highly skilled at everything and is perpetually oblivious to his partner's infinity of vices and incompetence.the typical plot will involve some bizarre case he'll inevitably blunder through or will revolve around his highly dysfunctional household, though every now and again duckman's arch-enemy king chicken (tim curry), a sort of professor moriarty in fowl form, hatches some diabolical scheme in revenge for being bullied in high school.since i was a teenager this has been my absolute favorite animated show, better than the simpsons, family guy and even king of the hill. nothing will ever surpass it. there never was, or will be, anything quite like duckman ever again. the level of satire, observational humor and writing is so sharp it's deadly and the animation is done in that unique klasky/csupo style (anyone who has seen rugrats will understand). it's a wonderful, highly imaginative and wild world and all with a noirish, 1940s feel.you can never have too much of this particular bird.

a wonderful movie about people. i first saw four friends when it was originally shown in theatres and i've seen it many times since. if i'm not watching it when it's on tv, i'll get together with friends and rent it. invariably, the people i've watched this movie with find it enjoyable. it deals with friends from childhood to adulthood, in the 50's and 60's. it's very funny and touching, dealing with first love (and first sex), racism, war, politics- the whole 60's shebang. it can also be quite dramatic. if you enjoy movies about people, this one is definitely worth the time.

film follows four friends from the 1950s (when they're in high school) up to 1981. they are danilo (craig wasson) a yugoslavian immigrant; georgia (jodi thelan) a "free spirit"; david (michael huddleston) who has no personality and tom (jim metzler) a big, strong, handsome, rugged guy. all three of them are in love with georgia but she only loves danilo. the film mostly focuses on those two--it chronicles their lives, love and attraction to each other over the years. it also gets into danilo trying to win the love of his tough immigrant father. i love this film but it's not without its bad points. thelan's high, squeaky voice is annoying (but you get used to it); the story jumps around very quickly; tom and david's lives are never explained (tom shows up with a vietnamese wife and kids and david has a wife we never meet until the end); some crucial scenes are badly written and there's some obvious pre-release cutting (probably to keep the film at 2 hours).but everything else is so good you can easily forget the problems. the story is compelling--you really get to know and understand the characters and always get caught up in the lives. with a few exceptions, the script (by steve tesich) is good--in fact, tesich was a yugoslavian immigrant himself and based much of the script on his own experiences. all the acting is great--especially thelan and wasson--also reed birney throws in a strong, likable performance as louie, danilo's college roommate. and lois smith is very interesting in her role. and look quick for mercedes ruehl and glenne headly!basically, it's a real great story about immigrants, coming of age, love of america and covers the 50-80s perfectly.this film was (unjustly) maligned on its release. the studio didn't know how to advertise it (it is a hard film to market) and the critics stomped on it (pauline kaels' review in "the new yorker" was particularly harsh). it barely played in theaters (i was lucky enough to catch it in 1981 in its short theatrical run) and has simply disappeared. that's a shame. this is a movie that is just ripe for reissue. i'm not betting on it--but you never know! a definite 10 all the way!

...that maybe someday people will wake up to. people who can resist the urge to separate each and everything, and who see the 60s for what they were. people who can see that it was the individuals who made those times; not the other way around.the "forrest gump" comparison is a good one. both films look at the 60s, but "four friends" is about human beings, as opposed to caricatures. ff delves deeply into the very thing that fg (quite successfully!) tries to condense and classify as nothing more than a backdrop. but while "gump" files the 60s away in an attic like old toys in a box, "four friends" picks up and embraces each toy, thus blurring the lines between what you hold dearly and what you are.if you associate romance with shoe polish, you'll hate this film.

a great look at the 60s through the eyes of four friends from their student days in 1960 to their reunion 10 years later - a yugoslavian immigrant in love with the american dream and struggling to cope with the often violent reality; a prematurely balding undertaker's son; a soldier; and the crazy hippy girl they all love. good direction and a strong cast do justice to steve tesich's brilliant script; the dialogue isn't as snappy as in "breaking away", but the themes of growing up and father-son conflict are dealt with just as well, and there are still a few wonderfully comic moments among the shocks and drama.

horses on mars is an engaging animated short that takes a sometimes comical look at the process of evolution through the eyes of those yet to evolve. the story is personal, and at times sentimental, and is supported by strong digital animation and narration that involves the viewer in this science fiction story. i was fortunate enough to view this short in widescreen format at the 2002 sundance film festival, and must suppose that when transferred to the small screen, it will lose some of its ability to draw the reader into the no less thoughtful story and stunning graphics.

hercules the avenger is by far the best single entry in the muscleman genre i can recall. the charge against it made by critics - it is a cut and paste of two previous hercules films, with some added new material to make it appear fresh - misses the fact that this cut-and-paste approach solves one of the central problems of the sword-and-sandal movies. with most of these films, the middle third sags horribly - usually involving a sappy love story or arcane political intrigue or both (queen falls in love with hercules and her evil brother plots against them, etc.) it's often hard to hold on through this to watch the exciting finale. hercules the avenger cuts all that crap from the source films, and adds a rather brisk narrative of a hercules impersonator bullying his way into power. (it should be noted that this episode also functions as a distant but pointedly critical remark on the rise of fascism in italy.) this also sets up a fine final wrasslin' match between the real hercules and his impersonator.in a narrower focus, i might also add that further editing has improved individual scenes borrowed from the other films. for my money, the mutiny scene here is much better than it first appeared in hercules and the captive women, since it has been tightened with the reduction of several characters and their plot complications.there are also floppy monsters, creepy underworld atmospherics borrowed (literally) from mario bava, an entire city destroyed, and the usual amount of lovely babes in revealing gowns. since no one expects any of these films to compete with the seven samurai - or even with the magnificent seven - it seems a bit picky to hold the film's borrowing from other films against it.

eliza (elizabeth moorman) is a farm girl from the country coming to the city looking for love. she has met a man that has told her of an astrologist who will show her the stars. this is a journey of souls...eliza is put to the test, can she realize her true love when she sees him or not? tommy (tommy lee jones) is a construction worker trying to find himself in his native heritage. they show each other different ways of looking at things. all the while eliza is still looking for love and tommy is trying to protect the reservation that his grandmother lives on. this is a twisted story of looking beyond the obvious and finding beauty in the simple everyday things. the style is artsy and chock full of symbolism. the psychedelic camera styling might scare away the average moviegoer, but the deeper message and the interesting frames make this movie worth watching. it is a movie that explores the underworld of the weird, wretched and devastated individuals. this one strays from the path but certainly worth watching!

well done melodrama that tells the story of sally, tomboy dancer in the circus, raised by sideshow performer mcgargle (played by w.c. fields), he of the top hat, little mustache, checkered pants, and proficiency as juggler, pickpocket, and runner of carnival con games like three card monte and the old shell game. mcgargle has raised sally, who worships him as her "real father" since sally's mother (kicked out of her home by her father, a judge, when she married a "circus man") died and left sally orphaned. sally is feisty and loyal to mcgargle no matter what he gets up to - but mcgargle seems to feel a bit of guilt over keeping her in the circus instead of with her own family all these years. when they end up performing in a carnival in the town where her wealthy grandparents live, mcgargle uses the opportunity to "investigate" sally's real family, with the idea that he may restore her to them. but grandfather the judge takes an immediate disliking to sally 'cause he doesn't like a "show girl" - what a stern, narrow-minded man he is, a real piece of work that guy! and meanwhile sally is busy being pursued by a handsome and rich young man, son of the man who helped grandpa get his riches.this is a very good film with a few laughs here and there and a sort of odd editing style (i don't know how to describe this other than it shows long shots, then sort of jumps back a few seconds or changes angle suddenly as a close up is shown). carol dempster, who plays sally, is delightful here - quite cute and comical in her performance. w.c. fields, even without his famous voice, is very funny - just the way he moves and his amusing, comical reactions to things (like a small dog seen in one funny scene), we even see him juggling briefly in this. i love the few peeks at the old-fashioned circus and carnival that is shown here. the print of this featured on the dvd is very nice looking, tinted a light sepia tone, and the piano score for this is really excellent, performed by philip carli based on the original cue sheets.

this story takes place in wisconsin. i was half heartedly watching my tape when i heard the name appleton. i wasn't sure where it was taking place until i heard them say green bay & then i figured it was wisconsin. watching further confirmed it.anxiously awaiting the outcome i could really feel corrine's frustration. i did not know it was based on fact until the end. it left me glad but sad and wanting to know more.

a man and his wife are not getting along because of the wife's jealousy and drinking problems. when the wife disappears, her sister begins a vigorous search involving the local police, state government, and a television crime show. what she finds out stuns the entire community. good drama with lots of fine performances; based on a true story.

a great suspenseful thriller the acting is first rate and the plot keeps you guessing. this well performed and directed movie is based on a true story and well worth while joe penny is cast extremely well and ann gillian is convincing as the concernened and terrified sister. joe again prove he's acting ability is amazing and the ending well done. it,s worth watching i hope they repeat it soon on any channel, i will definitely record it. for penny and gillian fans it's worth your time. rent it if you can better still try to buy it i going to. perfect early nineties thriller watch thismovie it's great.

one of the most macabre, depressing, yet eye-opening docs. i've watched in awhile. there's no narration or story that's told, just a "third eye" type camera following around 2 couples of heroin addicts in nyc through the seasons. watching them shoot up on the floors of public washrooms then "clean" their needles in the public toilets... sometimes it's a bit too much and you need to hit pause just to go for a breather.anyone currently in recovery of alcohol/drug addition should watch this when they're craving - it really shows you to what you could be going back to! after seeing this it's a wonder how anyone could even try this drug to begin with.the only thing it needed was a follow up at the end to tell where these people are today. judging from what is shown in the doc., there's no hope for any of them. they mention wanting to get better and quit, but it seems the only end to their habits is to quit by way of dying.this definitely isn't for all audiences. i found myself kind of like watching a car accident - after i started watching it i just couldn't turn it off. i had to keep watching with a dark/morbid fascination of what it's like inside the lives of these addicts.

i watch this film with horror in my heart because my mother also was a crack head like michelle. i've been wondering where michelle is now. there has been times where i had to find my mother in places i was scared to be but more scared to leave her there! to see michelle act like that made me wonder where she was sleeping all that time?? i watched in hopes the it was never that bad for my mom! and what i want to know is... where did matt and tracy "tear that ass up"?! worst scene for me was watching tracy shoot up in an old navy dressing room!!!! u never who try clothes on before you and it looks like all of them except michelle has aids!!!! where are they know 2008? can we get an update??????????

"dope sick love" is a really remarkable documentary made for hbo about two pairs of heroin addicted lovers roaming the streets of nyc. i managed to catch it one night by accident and found it absolutely mesmerizing. there is no narration and we never see any interviews with the subjects, the camera just follows them around, like a third eye, completely detached. the people being followed don't even seem aware that they're being filmed! (or, at least, they don't seem to care). the footage is amazingly candid. some of the most candid i've ever seen. this is as real as it gets. the nuts and bolts of what its like to be on the street and addicted to heroin. we watch them score dope, shoot it, make up, hustle, and even impersonate cops to rob people, and about a million other tiny details that less observant documentary filmmakers would leave out.some of the footage is truly horrifying. like watching one guy frantically searching for fix he lost. i found myself praying that he would find it, just so that his misery would temporarily end. and when he does find it, the guy literally dances in the street.the cyclical nature of drug addiction becomes very apparent while watching this. everything is about getting the next score to these folks, yet the next score seems to be well worth the immense trouble they go through. i would love to get a copy of this, if anyone knows where it is available. highly recommended, if you can catch it on hbo.

tracy and matt, michelle and sebastian: these are the two couples whose lives of addiction, crime, and squalor are brilliantly captured in this raw and honest hbo documentary. they're in turns petulant, charming, repulsive, astonishingly stupid, and dedicated: to the drugs and to each other. they're also each very different: matt is a working class boy who clearly revels in his naughtiness, whilst prep school dropout tracy supports the couple with western union money from her moneybags father, who makes a surprisingly sympathetic cameo towards the end of the film. meanwhile widow michelle (whose hubby died of an od) earns her daily bread by posing as an nypd vice cop willing to cut her would-be johns a deal to avoid prison time, and sad sack companion sebastian lives off the proceeds. you'll be pulled into their stories and will wish the film went on for twice as long. unlike most documentaries of this kind, there's no coda providing us with an update about their progress (can matt and tracy really keep that brooklyn apartment? will michelle go back to bellevue for more detox? and can sebastian become any more pathetic?). as a result, the film seems incomplete, but that may have been the point. essential viewing, as long as you aren't completely averse to scenes of people shooting up.

the animatrix: a detective story is very well planned and has a great storyline to go with it. carrie-anne moss plays trinity in this animated cartoon. i really like the 'private detective' ideas created by the director.

this is one of nine shorts on the anime disk, "the animatrix." it is my favorite. the artwork is amazing. the black-and-white, somewhat grainy texture perfectly captures the mood that the segment is trying to portray. the story is tight, and the ending is true to film noir.overall, i gave the animatrix a "7", but this particular segment deserves a "10."

film noir meets anime... brilliant! this was one of the highlights of the surprisingly creative animatrix shorts. this was one of my favorites if not my favorite (i also loved world record). this is basically a reference to those classic film noir detective stories and movies of the 40s, except it's animated and involves the matrix. but by being animated, it is able to take the extreme camera angles, the detective life style, the shadows, and everything film noir to an entirely new level. the femme fatale? trinity. the detective in this story seems to be living in the 40s in his mind but stuck in a modern world, and everything becomes too much for him when his case suddenly involves science fiction and agents when a mysterious woman in black walks into his office...my grade: 9/10

the detective story is not typical for the matrix universe. it is a film-noir-esque private eye story, with a strong narrator and a very rich feel. rich, in terms of its visual appeal. the snowing scenes, the grainyiness, it all stuns the eye.but what about the story? it is interesting, even if it feels a little out of place. the agents hire a privat detective to track down trinity. he finds out that they tried the approach before, but with hazardous consequences for the hired detectives. still, he tries to locate her and eventually succeeds, through alice in wonderland references and hackers and chat rooms. then things begin to get interesting...all in all, this is a perfectly satisfying short animated movie.8/10

this is the fifth part of 'the animatrix', a collection of animated short movies that tell us a little more about the world of 'the matrix'. this time they introduce trinity (carrie-anne moss) in a story about a detective who is hired to find her. with great black and white animation and an interesting story this is again a great animated short from 'the animatrix'.

this is one of the periphery stories told by the animatrix that isn't directly relevant to the war stopping one glorifying plot of the films, but trinity, voiced by carrie, does appear in it. it features a private detective who is hired for big money to look for a hacker named trinity. we see his search which features other pis, only one who he meets, who has seemingly gone mad from his own experience trying to track trinity down. eventually he makes contact with trinity who he assumes to be a man of course - told in the narrative and something that firmly puts us in his own perspective despite what we already know - on a hacker chat-room, and solves a riddle which forces him in a hurry to catch a train. he forgets his hat but his faithful cat throws it to him in a moment of ludicrousness so absurd it's hilarious.he meets her on the train but the ruse is thereby revealed when agents attack; the agents were using him to get to trinity and trinity was trying to free the pis sent after her, which he doesn't know of course, and which isn't explicitly stated in the animation itself, something common to film noir titles, which often hint at plenty of interesting back-story, subplots, developments etc. but don't show you more then the core story and a limited point of view to create an extra air of mystery and intrigue.almost everything in this short is in black and white, the music is reminiscent of film noir and the offbeat, old fashioned yet dedicated detective is the perfect protagonist for a film noir title. the trivia section of this title's entry on imdb also helpfully presents a few references this title makes to hardboiled literature, something it also borrows heavily from, a genre of mysteries for detectives, gangsters etc. who engage in challenging conflicts readily and often. animated aptly by studio 4¬∞c and directed by shinichiro watanabe, it is an enjoyable variant on the usual matrix story.

the eighth, and thus second-to-last short of the animatrix ones, this is the only one quite like this. this takes two of the main types of filmed entertainment inspirations of the matrix, and combines them unbelievably well. this is immensely faithful to the trilogy in that aspect, the tone. the animation is a gorgeous, breathtaking anim√©. the style, which is omnipresent in this, is noir. the plot is fitting, and the story-telling, as well, as the music, is spot-on. the sound in general is fantastic, and really helps solidify the mood and atmosphere, along with the drawings and designs. the voice acting is impeccable. this is one of only two where people also in the movies reprise their roles, and both have anne-moss, who is the only of them appearing in this. this is one of the best of the nine, and also one of my personal favorites. this is about ten minutes long. the pacing is perfect. it never slows down terribly much, but it's not overwhelming, either. the ending could not have been more appropriate for this. this shares a nine and a half-minutes long making of with kid's story, and it's well-done and informative. i recommend this warmly to any fan of the universe and the two genres that this is made up of. 8/10

i've seen three of the animatrix episodes, and this is my favorite of all of them. the second renaissance provided a flimsy back story to the already flimsy universe. program was a stylistically impressive number, it just felt kind of silly. i guess what gives this one it's special touch is the direction from shinichiro watanabe, director of the incredibly popular (and for good reason) series cowboy bebop. it has some of the best elements of bebop: slick, sci-fi adventure, a no-nonsense, slightly apathetic hero working for hire, a bounty-head (more or less), and a chase scene, all wrapped up in an excellent film-noir packaging. watanabe's tarantino-style slickness comes through here full throttle.

this is one of the anime films from the animatrix collection, one of nine - the only one done in black and white, and the only one featuring trinity. richly textured and beautifully rendered in every way, and the animated version of trinity definitely does her justice. if you're a fan of the matrix, you will need to put this on your short list.

wow, its been quite a while since i've watched anything so mysterious in the way it is portrayed.a detective story uses old fashioned black and white images to portray a private investigator who dresses in an old fashioned trench coat and hat. the theme of this animation is reminiscent of that of sam spayed which was briefly mentioned by ash.sick of spying on cheating house wives because of his clients, ash was offered a chance to track down a "computer hacker" which he thought was a worthwhile chance for a four figure sum he could not turn down and the rest is history.the ending was a little bit bland but still okay. for those out there who like old fashion stories this is the one for you.

just how exactly do gay asians manage in a culture that generally refuses to even recognize the concept of homosexuality? for millions of gay hindus and muslims there seems little hope of ever leading a life that is accepted and endorsed by their otherwise very close knit families. this is the main point explored in chicken tikka masala - presumably named after the western spicy dish involving tender pieces of young chicken flesh! jimmy is a typical young asian brought up in britain by traditional parents with the common narrow minded and selfish views on marriage and grandchildren. like millions of others he is led into an arranged marriage that seems inescapable even though he is apparently completely gay and deeply involved with a very attractive young man with whom he lives. he knows that the truth should be told but fears for the consequences of that particularly so as his father appears to be terminally ill. and so he becomes embroiled in a web of deceit that becomes wider and wider as the plot develops.the film is beautifully sensitive and not at all judgmental or patronizing to any group portrayed. the acting is generally excellent although it might seem a bit ham in places as the director tends to search for humor rather than letting it blossom naturally. there are no prizes for photography or script but the film is made entire by the wonderful sentiment expressed at the very end - a sentiment that all fathers across the world would do well to learn from.

have just got back from seeing this brilliantly funny film.granted, part of the reason i loved it so was because i could point out people and places i knew ('i walk there everyday!', 'i work there!', 'i've had drinks there!', 'hey! that's our postman!' etc...). but, still, if you're out for a 'feel-good' with a bit of spice (excuse the pun) - this is just the right answer. relationships, culture and, most importantly, love are all woven together within the plot.with preston (where the film is set) recently being made a city, it is good to see this work featuring the place and adding to the feeling of uprise. it is also a brilliant representative of the many cultures in this part of the north.fabulous!

my comment is mainly a comment on the first commentator (the extra on the film) and his unhappy assessment of the film. i think his perspective indicates why an extra is an extra and a director is a director. the film was sweet, the acting sufficient, the experience of watching it a nice diversion from a busy work week. it wasn't "the hours" (acting), or "the matrix" (special effects), or even "the color purple" (direction). most movies won't be. but it also wasn't the crap fest that "vinny..." would lead you to believe. sorry guy, just my 2 cents.as to the movie itself, it was in the end very gay affirming (+ #1). it showed a world full of diverse and less than perfect people--you know, just like ours (+ #2)! it opened a door on one culture without excluding other cultures (+ #3). and i liked the music (+ #4).

this film is about a young indian guy who comes home one day and finds himself getting engaged to a woman. the problem is that he is gay. in order to stop the wedding without telling his parents that he is gay, one lie leads to another until it spirals out of control.this film is hilarious and got me laughing many times. sally bankes' acting is superb and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly. the plot is outstanding as well. i find the plot very realistic, and i can completely identify with jimi's feeling of being terrified, worried and upset. on the other hand, jimi's boyfriend, jack, is given much less attention in the film. i would have liked him to be given more lines in the film, and have more character development. however, as i guess the director wants to make this a more mainstream film, the love between jimi and jack was not developed in the film.it is great to watch a gay affirmative film. furthermore, this film preaches us to be accepting to other people's difference, be it sexuality, culture and the way of life. this film makes viewers think hard.we need films like this to give us a boost. thanks for making this film!

for people who are first timers in film making, i think they did an excellent job!! we have to support the emerging industry especially coming from up north. it was very popular when i was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs. it's a feel-good film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema! it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents. the film has just opened, i do hope it does well - people should support this little film. i think this 'vinny...' person is very bitter, about something! and getting too personal¬Ö? shame!! i say well done to all those involved¬Öhave a drink on me!! i look forward to you next venture.

typically spanish production - slow-moving, but with great sensuousness and sexuality oozing from the lead actress paz vega. (watch her in "spanglish"). great sets, lots of colour - you get to see cordoba, seville, spanish mountains and countryside. the plot tends to meander here and there, but if you follow closely (i managed to, even though the film is in spanish), you'll get the gist of it.it's about how one very highly sensual young gypsy woman, carmen, uses her feminine wiles to seduce men to do her bidding. carmen is being taken to prison after attacking a fellow cigarera at the cigar factory where she works. she persuades jose, the soldier in charge of taking her to prison, to let her escape. jose succumbs to her charms because she speaks basque (he is navarrese and speaks the same language). jose is punished by 1 month in jail and demoted to foot soldier. he later meets carmen at a party and they end up becoming lovers. but carmen refuses to commit to him, and continues her lascivious and flirty lifestyle. in a jealous rage, jose kills a fellow soldier who has been with carmen. they then have to leave town. life on the run turns jose into a bandit. carmen, meanwhile, remains the same, a wildly promiscuous woman. in the end, jose loses his mind and ends up killing carmen.the story is told by jose in prison, awaiting to be executed. the person he tells the story to is prospero merrime, a french writer and anthropologist, whose fancy watch (it plays beethoven's fur elise) was stolen by either carmen or jose.worth watching for the sets and for the delectable paz vega.

this movie is a quite fair adaptation of the prosper merime√©'s novel. in the novel merime√© himself is a character, don jos√© is from navarra (north spain, and historically a basque country zone, they can speak basque language). they are in seville (andalusia, south spain) and they only speak spanish with andalusian accent, in no way they speak basque, but carmen explains to don jos√© that she was living in navarra. you can believe it or not, anyway this is the book's version, then you can't be critical with the movie about this, be with the book! you have to note are different the novel by merime√© and the opera by bizet, and this movie is an adaptation from the novel, anyway in the opera don jos√© is still spanish from navarra, never he's french. why so many people keep thinking don jos√© is french? i don't know but i guess because the novel and the opera are in french although is supposed to be in spanish.the only important difference between the movie and the novel is that in the movie don jos√© also kills the "torero" lover of carmen and in the novel he doesn't (neither in the opera). i guess they wanted to keep the movie a little more gore! i think the movie is quite good, anyway.

there have been approximately 60 different films & television plays,besides the classic opera of this tale of a sex mad girl and her hapless soldier lover. this story has been done so many times, in various ways.vicente aranda directs joaquin jorda's screenplay adaptation of prosper merimee's classic novel & play.this is the story only of bizet's opera carmenpas vega is an exciting carmen,full of passion & the ability to drive simple men to do terrible tragic things. leonardo sbaraglio is the hapless soldier who is ensnared into carmen's poisonous web & led to doing bad things.jay benedict is the author prosper who tells this tale.there is not much action, but there are some very hot sex scenes.in fact this is almost an nc-17 film.since i have seen this tale so often in so many guises i was not overly impressed.it is a very well made film & will be of interest to those that may not know of it,my not overly enthusiastic review also could be that i miss the fantastic opera score by bizet.see this as you may like it more than i did.ratings *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) imdb 7 (out of 10)

this is a nice movie with good performances by paz vega and leonardo sbaraglia . of course vicente aranda is a legend in spanish cinema and surely one of the great directors in spanish cinema but i don't think this is one of his greatest movies even if it's fine. the screenplay plays with the introduction of merime√© as a character , it's a nice touch but it's unbelievable. the music is composed by jose nieto , national spanish prize in cinema. i mean this movie is very good in all the technical aspects .there are very good actors in supporting roles like antonio dechent , maria botto and others . i give it 7 out of 10 cause i think this could be a better movie but as it is it is not boring at all.

even for the non-opera loving public the name carmen is immediately recognized as an opera by bizet about a gypsy girl whose capricious loves destroy men. but as much as the opera is now considered a staple in every opera house repertoire, the real story of the wild gypsy lass as created by prosper m√©rim√©e in 1845 has never been told as well as in this cinematic version by the abundantly gifted spanish director vicente aranda ('juana la loca aka mad love','amantes', 'if they tell you i fell', etc.). incorporating the author of the novel as a main character seeking the story of carmen from one of her lovers - jos√© - provides just the right vantage for the story of this famous gypsy wild lady to be told. carmen (the amazingly beautiful and talented paz vega) works in a cigar factory in seville, a factory adjoining the military station where the very proper jos√© (leonardo sbaraglia) is stationed. carmen is tempestuous and in a fight instigated by a fellow factory worker bringing attention to the fact that carmen is a gypsy, carmen murders the co-worker and is arrested. jos√© is physically attracted to the voluptuous carmen and when carmen flirts with him he consents to allow her to escape - his payback is the promise for a night of passion with carmen. carmen keeps her pact, providing jos√© with his first sexual encounter, and jos√© is doomed. his lack of military discipline results in his losing his rank and being imprisoned for a while, but at his release jos√© encounters carmen again, kills a fellow officer, and in fear runs off to the hills to live with the smugglers and gypsies that are carmen's people. many incidents occur to try the passionate bond between the lovers, but when carmen's real husband is released from prison, destructive behaviors take over, behavior's that include carmen's infatuation and affair with a bullfighter and the passion of carmen and jos√© comes to a tragic end. one factor that makes the story (as adapted for the screen by director aranda and joaquim jord√† move so well is the role that prosper m√©rim√©e (jay benedict) plays: his questioning of jos√© completes the story that bizet's opera only outlines. the acting is superb, the cinematography by paco femenia and the excellent musical score by jos√© nieto contribute enormously to the success of this very fine film. this is a must for lovers of the opera carmen, and a splendid action drama for those viewers who admire historical pieces. highly recommended. grady harp

i thoroughly enjoyed carmen, better than original sin (angelina jolie & antonio bandaras), which share some thematic similarities, and which i also enjoyed very much. i felt the acting was stronger here (paz vega displayed a wider range, has more fire; and sbaraglia was also great). overall, their acting was more gritty, more believable (less dreamy than original sin, and both actors here had less 'celebrity status' and 'pretty face' to depend on to make the movie work. vega definitely sizzles, as to be expected.director vincente aranda has also built a detailed world (again, better than original sin) that lets you feel the grime and the daily goings-on of archaic spain - for example, people unloading goods from a cart on the street, workers changing the candles of the street lamps, all in the background of the action. whilst i greatly sympathize with the recent idea of redeeming our femme fatals (like brian de palma's femme fatale), carmen is a poignant, modern take in the tradition of the noir classic double indemnity, and is a delightful pleasure to watch. this is another fine example of the triumph of daring european cinema over glitzy and safe hollywood fare.

at school i was taught how some shots were called and there were two directors constantly mentioned : orson welles and sergei m. eisenstein. i didn't care that much then (i was a kid!) but now i know why, eisenstein is a genius and it is a shame to see what was possible in 1938 where as almost more than a half century we're stuck with countless blank movies! some say this movie isn't worth the genius of eisenstein (then they have to watch it over and over till they can say anything bad) or even worse that it is just some propagandamovie for the russians. let's say it as it is, it is indeed pure propaganda for patriotism but isn't "saving private ryan" or "the longest day" so? i could sum up so many movies in where america is being raised to the top so why not russia, and besides every war is fought for itrs patriotism why else would they raise flags? aleksandr nevsky is a must for anyone who cares about cinematography as almost every shot is a sublime picture. perhaps it's all overseen but i am in wonder why this isn't included in imdb's top 250 where as there is so many overrated oscarcrap in it as well.

from the beginning of the film i found myself laughing trying to keep quiet so i did not wake anyone in the house, this didn't continue so much throughout the rest of the film, i didn't find everything completely "laugh out loud" funny, but still i found certain things quite funny. at the beginning i had to hold in laughter when he drops the very crafty looking hand grenade down his sleeve. then there are scenes where you will just smile, like when the barber falls through a roof into someones apartment, i can see that being quite funny but in todays days and time that has been done quite a lot it didn't feel original, though at the time, i'm sure it was. i loved hynkels (hitlers) bursts of raging german with the nice subtle english translation.the final scene is wildly discussed because, well it's absolutely true, and so very intelligently constructed. though the film is sixty eight years old the final scene is still relevant today, if this doesn't show how great a writer chaplin is, then i don't know what will. the acting in this scene in particular was quite good, the barber transcended the message perfectly and makes you realise the serious nature of the film, at the same time enjoying the humorous side.another element about this film is the fact that this was such a brave film, that almost feels ahead of it's time. of course, chaplin did not know what was going to happen after 1940, he was not aware of the holocaust (obviously), he's also gone on record as to saying if he had of known he would not of made this film. the fact this film is so anti-hitler is interesting, it's more interesting that it wasn't anti-germany which would be very easy to have done back in those times, chaplin could of easily made this a propaganda film, but instead did something more, he made an honest film.i recommend anyone remotely interested in this film to see it, as well those who has studied or is studying hitler and wwii to watch this film. it's entertaining to say the least, it doesn't have an annoying out-dated feel that some films of the time did. unlike most "comedies" this film actually has a message it tries to bring to you, watch this film, you will be better off for having seen it.

with the nazi rise to power in eastern europe in the late 1930's, charles chaplin turned his attention to creating a reaction to it. the catalyst may well have been a propaganda publication referring to chaplin as a jewish sympathizer. in the great dictator, chaplin created a dead-on parody of hitler that is as funny as it is frightening at times. the film traces hitler's experiences in the german army from world war i up to the present day. simultaneously, chaplin plays a jewish barber who dresses like the tramp who comes out of a hospital after a long long time, only to discover how different the world is under nazi rule.paulette goddard, chaplin's wife at the time, plays a young jewish girl whose family is oppressed in a jewish ghetto. jack oakie has a great, oscar-nominated supporting role as a mussolini look-alike (benzini napaloni) who gives chaplin's hitler character, adenoid hynkel, a lot of fits. henry daniell is his usual staid self as garbitsch, chief adviser to adenoid hynkel. chaplin wrote and directed the film and received oscar nominations for his screenplay and his acting. the film was also nominated for best picture.chaplin made the film under tremendous pressure for some obvious reasons and some not so well known. he financed the entire film himself at great risk because of the subject matter, and there were no other major films made regarding nazi germany up to that time. the film spent about twenty-one months in production with chaplin even rebuilding a set and re-shooting a scene to get things right. by the time of the film's release in october of 1940, the war in europe was well under way with hitler conquering one country after another, so the film became much more topical at its release than when production first began.there isn't much plot in looking at the film in retrospect; the film seems more like a series of comedy sketches and/or mishaps strung together to get to a purpose independent of the film itself. several examples of this occur in the last third of the film with the meeting between hynkel and napaloni. the scene is very very funny, but it leads no where in terms of the plot. likewise, the escape of both the barber and schultz simply leads to the mistaken identity of the barber for hynkel in order to give chaplin (through the barber character) an opportunity to pontificate to the audience at the end of the film. on the other hand, what better way to make a point about the misplaced narcissism of aryan superiority than to have a jewish barber mistaken for hynkel? still, the film contains many high comic moments, such as the rally speech, the new war developments (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), the dancing globe scene, the coin in the pudding scene, and the entire scenario between hynkel and napaloni (including the barber chair scene) to highly recommend the film. one can also not forget the risks chaplin took in making his first talking film, an anti-nazi film, and financing the film himself. ***1/2 of 4 stars.

"the great dictator" is, arguably, one of charlie chaplin's most widely-known films. it is notorious for it's blatant satire of adolf hitler and nazism. until watching it, i only knew of it's fame. now i know how much the film deserves it.the film basically shows the exploits of the somewhat clumsy, ambitious, short-fused and impressive dictator of tomania, adenoid hynkel; and with him, his near and dear staff: field-marshall herring and herr garbitsch. also, it entails the exploits of an amnesiac, emotional and often clumsy jewish barber, a veteran of the first world war.stopping with the plot, i would like to say that this film has various qualities that make it both unique and wonderful. while the comedy is decidedly both verbal and slapstick and incidental, the entirety of the film shows how serious it takes nazism or aggressive nationalism as a theme with various interludes. chaplin's impeccable acting skills range far and wide in the film, he keeps revving it up and up until he simply explodes. paulette goddard's position as an ambitious jewish would-be revolter and henry daniell's delivery of a nasal, calm-as-death-serious-as-a-heart-attack lines makes for wonderful viewing.further, one aspect of the film is what makes it so special: it pulls no punches. it isn't "covert", it has no business being covert. it is an "overt", blatant, in-your-face, obvious lampooning of both hitler and nazism.to sum up briefly, watch it. just watch it, you'll see it.

this ingenious and innovate comedy packs many moments priceless and great sense of pace, though overlong. chaplin's satire with several classics scenes , he has dual role as a jewish barber and dictator hynkel, an offensive portrayal of hitler . then the barber is mistaken for the hitlerian tyrant and happen bemusing events. funny and extraordinaries acting of all casting, as the co-stars jack oakie as napolini(mussolini-alike), henry daniel as gasbstich(himmler-alike) and billy gilbert as herring( goering). chaplin's first spoken film is brilliantly photographed by karl struss.this splendid film contains numerous amusing scenes, the funniest are the following : 1) the one when during the wwi the barber-soldier along with a co-pilot are flying in a turned plane without aware 2)dictator adenoid hynkel doing overacting speeches including a twisted microphone 3)hynkel playing with an enormous balloon of the world 4)the jew-barber shaving a man fitting to hungarian dance number 5 of brahms 5) when hynkel and napolini each try to keep his body higher than other in a barber's chair; among them.hitler banned movie exhibition to the germans due to its satire of him, and put him in his death list after his proposed conquest of america.the movie is co-starred by paulette goddard, third of his four wives , they were married in 1936, although no announcement of the marriage was made later, one time finished the great dictator.the picture was released in 1940, when chaplin had survived a moral scandal by a paternity suit but a brush with the house of un-american activities was the signal for the usa to refuse him re-entry from britain and he fled to switzerland.

i once caught about a 20 minute portion of this movie on turner classic movies about 6 months back. i thought every minute of what i was watching was gold, and, because it was somewhere in the film's middle and i didn't want to spoil the whole thing if i were to watch it from the start, i decided that i would rent it immediately. well, the video store which i frequent did not have a copy, so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it. i had previous to that experience only seen some chaplin shorts, funny but not greatly artful, but after i saw the snippet of the great dictator, i checked out three of his other films, city lights, the gold rush, and modern times (city lights was great, i found the gold rush a little overrated, but still worthwhile, and i found modern times to be one of the funniest films i've ever seen (second funniest, behind keaton's sherlock jr., more exactly).finally, the whole of the great dictator. well, to be honest, it had its moments, both of comedy and of drama. but these moments don't always mix well. chaplin's comedy worked well when mixed with melodrama (city lights is the best example of this), but it didn't always work with social commentary. plus, the fact that there was dialogue lessened the impressiveness of chaplin's talent. don't get me wrong, i liked the movie as a whole, but i thought it of little consequence. i would have given it a solid 7/10 on the ratings scale...if not for the ending. the final speech that the jewish barber gives is enormously powerful. yes, it is adressed to the tempora et mores of 1940, but his message is perfectly applicable to the world today. the speech brought me to tears, and i consider it one of the best endings i've ever seen. final score: 8/10.

before i saw this film i didn't really expect to much from it, although my friend advised otherwise. due to this request from my friend i decided i was really going to watch this film. the minute i sat down to view the film i was absolutely blown away. from the credits i was falling of my seat; i just couldn't contain myself. the film is about hitler in all the glory of comedy. hynkel is the absolute double for the jewish barber, who comes back from fighting in the war. due to the heroics of the barber, he manages to save one of the germans and by doing that gets a member of the enemy on board, which helps in the struggle which the jews had. but things went wrong and stolz was arrested, but only then to escape to the confines of the jewish surburb, 'the ghetto'. due to this escape, the german army began searching which meant that the barber and stolz got arrested but again they escaped, only to be mistaken for hynkel and consequently takes his poistion. *****the speech that chaplin makes at the end is fantastic, it complies the morals which society could only dream about. in the speech it contradicts the whole meaning of the film because of the seriouness and sincerenity which it entailed, and it definately works, because i did walk out feeling guilty about how we live our lives, looking at the smallest thing such as being ignorant to someone to the biggest, most prominent things such as war.

here we have the inimitable charlie chaplin forsaking his slapstick past to tackle the serious subject of anti-semitism, and intolerance in general. he portrays two characters - the sweet, innocent jewish barber - a war veteran, and the raving and ruthless dictator, adenoid hynkel. the jewish ghetto in this country is not safe for long, due to the whims of hynkel and his armed thugs, who routinely rough up its residents, or leave them alone, dependent upon his mood that day or week. the barber is among them, but is befriended by his former commanding officer, schultz (reginald gardner), who seems to keep things quiet for a while, until hynkel condemns him to a concentration camp. he seeks refuge with the jews in the ghetto, most specifically the barber, and the feisty young woman, hannah (paulette goddard). the premise will be - who will be the one among these jews to put their lives on the line to get rid of hynkel and his cronies? we needn't guess too hard to know the answer; the barber is a dead ringer for the dictator, and he is outfitted in his image, accompanied by schultz, also in full military gear. hannah escapes with several of her ghetto friends to the country of osterlich, where mr jaeckel's (maurice moscovich) cousin has a farm, and they can live peaceably for a while. at this point, hynkel himself has been arrested by his armed forces, thinking him to be the notorious barber. the latter, meanwhile, has been escorted with schultz to a podium, to make a speech announcing the conquest of osterlich. the ensuing ten minutes is pure chaplin himself, speaking from his heart of tolerance, love and freedom, and denigrating greed and hatred. albeit chaplin started production on the film in 1937, it can be forgiven some naivete. he was allegedly unaware of the gravity of this persecution and hatred, and said had he known the full extent, he would never have made the film, because he most likely believed it would have trivialized the situation. he has a marvelous supporting cast: reginald gardner, henry daniell as garbitsch, his aide-de-camp, the always wonderful billy gilbert as the bumbling herring, paulette goddard, jack oakie as the dictator napaloni, his rival for conquest, veteran european actors david gorcey (leo's father), maurice moscovich, among others. the scene he choreographed with globe, with just a musical accompaniment is sheer, luminous inspiration, and luminous, as well, is paulette goddard at the film's end, smiling through her tears. i have seen this film before, but there is always something new in it for me. last evening, when it finished, i sat there in tears. i defy anyone not to be moved by it.

i was surprised and impressed to find out this movie was released in 1940, before the united states entered world war ii. on the surface, satirizing something as solemn and horrible as nazi germany could be misconstrued as rash. but chaplin's brilliance isn't limited to making a joke out of everything. in fact, the seriousness of his message wouldn't have been nearly as valid if not for the excellent use of humor in this movie along with the moments of stark drama blended in. drama alone wouldn't have had the bite and resonance that this film did. laughing at someone (adenoid hynkel) can be the best way to attack them, while laughing with someone (the jewish barber) can be the best way to love them. in the jewish barber's final speech, i forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago. they are words that have meaning now, and in any time of war. for this reason i believe the film did far greater good than harm, as it still has the same profound effect today.

..this movie has been done when hitler ( and mussolini who is as well in the movie) was at the top and many politics and even the roman church used to close eyes about brutality and evil of nazism. especially in usa there were many people who had not understood what was really going on in germany and europe ( charles lindenbergh for example ).it would be as today a big actor would made a parody of berlusconi or chirac. chaplin maybe made a lot of mistakes in his life, but this is really a masterpiece of humanity and imho a great demonstration he was a courageous man. the movie is funny and deep, the final speech has a terrible strength and is still updated. i think this movie is one of the best ever done.

hynkel, dictator of tomania, is a spoiled child who becomes angry when he cannot gets what he really wants... and what he simply wants is nothing less than the world...in one of the extraordinary scenes of chaplin art, hynkel performs a ballet with the 'world' which bursts when he thinks he has it in his grasp...chaplin also has some biting words on war and war films... in a scene at the beginning of the movie, which takes place during world war i, the tomanian messenger crashes the plane and thinks... he is about to die... in a state of delirium, he begins to say ridiculous words... the empty double-talk continue ascending into a brilliant take off on all the heroic death scenes of war films...in another scene when he becomes a fugitive in the jewish ghetto and assumes command of the resistance fomenting rebellion among the old men, he plans to kill the dictator... one of the group must kill the ruthless conqueror of austerlich... whoever is chosen will naturally die, but his heroic death will be rewarded and his name will shine like a star in tomanian history...the sequence in which he and four other characters eat cream cakes containing coins to determine which shall sacrifice his life to murder the dictator is a bitter hilarity filled with great fear...for all its disappointing shortcomings, "the great dictator" is still a significant movie for the ironic tones of the film adding something that neither chaplin nor anymore else could have given it: the irony of history... the necessity to murder hynkel presages the assassination attempt against hitler by his generals... the force of the original satire is only surpassed by history's imitation of art...with a splendid sequence like the duck-shooting accident which leads to the dictator being mistaken for the humbly jewish barber and vice versa, "the great dictator" is chaplin's first talking movie... this time 'charles' and not 'charlie,' wanting to say more through his movie and not through an amusing comedy, the last in which he uses his celebrated 'tramp character.'

the great dictator is a beyond-excellent film. charlie chaplin succeeds in being both extremely funny and witty and yet at the same time provides a strong statement in his satire against fascism. the anti-nazi speech by chaplin at the end, with its values, is one of filmdom's great moments. throughout this movie, i sensed there was some higher form of intelligence, beyond genuinely intelligent filmmaking, at work.

this film entered production before ww2 began, but was not released until it was well under way. with significant fascist-sympathy in the us, and chaplin himself being suspected as a communist sympathiser, the great dictator was a very courageous endeavour. such risks in film-making - thinly veiled political statements - would be almost inconceivable today. imagine the fallout if someone were to make an equally satirical film today which criticised the usa's foreign policy?this film is hilarious, poignant and tragic. the tragedy is that chaplin makes a plea for the madness to end, but it is already to late - for him and for us. a must see if you have any interest whatsoever in history, film-making, politics or sattire as an art-form.

absolutely fantastic! whatever i say wouldn't do this underrated movie the justice it deserves. watch it now! fantastic!

i loved that the mood was light and airy. i loved that the lead character wanted guarantees about his future, and that his roommate sets him "straight" of all people. i loved that they tackled the dynamics of how the members in the men's group dealt with each other, considering this was directed by a lesbian,the whole theme of masculinity was put out there, ridiculed, dissected and questioned. what makes a man? what makes one straight, gay, or bisexual? you aren't really sure if our lead character has decided on who he really wants; he's living in the moment and thrown caution to the wind. these, and other reasons, make me love this film.

i loved this movie! it was adorably touching and funny. finally, here's a story about a group of people who meet some challenges, flounder a bit, and then decide to just be themselves and end up happy for; when was the last time you saw that in a film? dealing with the fluidity of life, love, and sexuality, the characters are faced with real problems (albeit in often ridiculous situations like the men's group camping trip, and the explicit realatory liaisons) and manage to learn and grow without the movie getting preachy, darkly desperate, or too unrealistic. you'll love and care about the characters who, far from being hollow stereotypes, portray real people with just a touch of the truth behind their would-be labels.a good romcom for a saturday afternoon, and the only movie i've ever seen where sexual fluidity ends happily, and no one is forced to be anything they don't want to be. far better than kissing jessica stein, a good choice if your tired of watching gay movies that have some painful lesson and bitter lesson. or, maybe you just like a good british romp? james purefoy looks dashing as always, and tom hollander is deliciously funny. so go forth, watch, enjoy; you won't regret it!

never have i seen a movie like this; didn't plan on seeing it but it was worth the turn of the tv channel. i am mostly a scifi movie watcher,but i would be more than happy to add this one to my collection. it starts out as a one sided film with a simple love triangle, then became something a little different(can't tell more then that. but it does involve two guys and one girl. juts not the way you would expect). also, this movie starred hugo weaving from the "matrix" and "the lord of the rings" in a role i would not have expected...very funny guy. this movie is playing on here tv, but if you do not have satellite, it is worth a rent. so give it a try; you won't be disappointed.

i saw this film at the boston internation festival of women's cinema last night, and was saddened to hear ms. troche tell us (in her q&a after the screening) that she doesn't expect to see too much us distribution, due to her insistence on including all of the so-called "gay content". it was a fantastically entertaining comedy, and it just seems to me that american audiences might enjoy it in much the same way they enjoyed "the full monty", so it's really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a few shots of two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream theaters. wonderful cast, fabulous script, and of course, rose troche's direction make this one of the funniest films i've seen.

quite a ways away from "go fish". both were good films but troche had a bigger budget and cast to work with here. this film was very entertaining and easy to like. the acting was good lots of slow burn sexual tension.

bedrooms and hallways is the kind of film that makes you realize that the drama of life is hidden in the details. and that drama can be great fun too! even though your own love life and your own friends may not be as unique as the characters in this movie, every one is bound to recognize themselves and others in the colorful protagonists of this film. and that's the great strength of bedrooms and hallways, that the irony of life is that the most confusing things that happen to you can be the most interesting/hilarious/funny/sexy/...things too! hope you'll enjoy the film as much as i have!

it was a fun film to look at. though the chance this happened in your street is small, there are still a lot off recognizable situations that will ring a bell. the simplicity of the film and the humour do work. i must admit that you don't have to see it in a theater; it will do very well on a small tv-set. tip: see it with some close friends.

after a long wait, "bedrooms and hallways" made it to perth cinemas - not a commercial one mind you - and i thought it was fun, honest and took a swipe at those 'tribal scream' groups running around trying to find meaning in rocks and 'what's behind my eyes'. it is playing to full houses over here because it tells a story, has terrific acting and says something about the human condition.

i enjoyed this film immensely, due to pungent scenes (humorous as well as ironic, some even "tragical"), believable performances, witty dialogue and a heartfelt rendering of what it¬¥s like or rather c a n be like to be hetero- and/or homosexual & on the lookout for fulfilment of your desires. i¬¥m aware of the paradox here: homo- a n d hetereosexual.... this is something the film tackles on end, but never uses for caricature. if you¬¥re as open-minded as the people seem to have been who made that film, in the end it won¬¥t matter to you if those who lie in each others arms are of the same sex or not."mr. smith" from the matrix gives an admirable turn as a gay houses-salesman with "strange" appetites here, but that¬¥s not the only thing to marvel at. enjoy.....

by the acting in this movie, it is sometimes hard not to imagine that the cast are who they portray themselves to be. unbridled passion and acting at times make this a very enjoyable and engaging movie. wouldn't even have known about it except for hbo late night. and the biggest reason i like uk films much better than american ones are that the actors aren't afraid to act out what is needed.

this movie was a pleasant surprise because i didn't expect much. i didn't know that some of the actors have since become bigger stars in major pix. while moving on to the matrix is not a plus in my book (hated it), i'm sure it's a career plus for hugo. james purefoy is great in this and jennifer ehle sweet and wonderful. it seemed sometimes like a carnaby street romp 30 years later but i enjoyed the thrift shop janis joplin clothes mixed up with the modern mindsets of sexual and gender blur. the real estate agent who has an erotic relationship with his listings is loads of fun. the iron john mens' group meetings are a bit dated but i still loved them. it's a social satire sex comedy in the best way and reminds me a bit of the old "carry on" movies. the british know how to do sex comedy and it's an old tradition, unlike the united states which is too prudish to really understand that sex is funny.

i seriously enjoyed watching this movie for the first time some years ago and whenever it gets aired again somewhere (which luckily happens from time to time in european cable television) i experience the same thing, i'm moved, entertained and end up wishing there were more movies like this one.it all deals with leo (kevin mckidd) and his group of friends living in urban london, leo as a gay guy who follows a friend to a hilarious new age men's group and falls for straight guy brendon, played by dashing james purefoy, who turns out not so straight after all. thrown in as side characters are the equally great tom hollander and hugo weaving whose side story alone is worth watching the movie, simon callow as the leader of the men's group, turning in a great as ever performance. but it's really hard to pick some folks out here, because every character, the female ones like jennifer ehle's, julie graham's and harriet walter's as well, are exquisitely acted. maybe even kevin mckidd looks a little pale compared to his co-actors but it benefits his somewhat subdued character.the idea behind this movie is a simple one: there is never only black and white, classifications are difficult and may not always stand the test of time.leo identifies as gay but ends up falling for a woman as well who turns out to be his teenage sweetheart and brendon's long time girlfriend. brendon starts out straight but gets to learn that gay may be more than just an option for him and being bisexual might not be that bad after all. darren and jeremy (hollander and weaving) are gay and loving it and even the straight folks in the movie, like angie, leo's female roommate, get their fair share of love and funny moments up until the end of the movie. the comedy bits(especially tom hollander who's just hilarious) are funny and on point and the emotions are believable, as confusing as they may appear at times reading this summary.what i like about this movie is its genuinely positive notion. whether you're gay, straight, bisexual or simply not sure, this movie leaves you feeling that it's just okay not to be sure and that "not being sure" might be something worth living out as well! sexuality is portrayed fluid in this movie and none of the main characters seem to have a real problem with it, apart from all the gay/straight camp fights that you sometimes get fed with in other gay themed movies. i can only wholeheartedly agree with the subtext of the movie, that what you feel certain of one day, when you think you identify as gay, straight, whatever, can look very different on another. i have never seen (what to call it?) bisexuality or maybe just the absence of the segregating need for sexual classification being portrayed in such a heartwarming and true to life manner. this movie dares going where few movies go, gay or straight movies, by not playing on labels and stereotypical assumption of sex and relying on that. it goes further and assumes that there may be a life to sex after well-known classifications and i think the times are more than ready for that and other movies exploring postmodern themes like this one! and for all others who don't care about that, heck, it's just a funny comedy worth watching on a rainy saturday evening with some popcorn on your hands. give it a try!loved it!

an inspired choice of director for this latest brit-flick, rose troche, who burst on the scene with the budget-free tale of ny dykes, _go fish_ brings a gently jaundiced view to this tale of a londoner choosing the slightly inappropriate milieu of a male bonding society to declare his lust for a fellow seeker of masculine truths. the highlight for me is a scene where the society try to revert to being primitive hunter-gatherers but end up ordering a take-away. the film as a whole is wonderfully acted and troche, who'd never be accepted by some of the lesbians she portrayed in her previous film, relishes the bigger budget by indulging in some wonderfully lingering pan shots that contrast with _go fish_'s grainy hyperkinesis. a really enjoyable film

bedrooms and hallways was one of the funniest films of the 1999 melbourne film festival. from the uk, it is about a young crowd of flatmates and their various relationship dilemmas. much of the humour is centred around a new-agey men's self-help group where they pass around various implements like the 'rock of truth'. they also go on a 'hunter gatherer' weekend with hilarious results. trust me, you'll laugh your teeth out.

i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other. i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago. this movie contained an all-star cast, and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before. this movie was kind of long in length, but i enjoyed every minute of it. it is a movie that you can sit down with your family and watch, though we would have to cover the kids eyes a few times due to the discretionary love scenes. overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale. lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.

the family happiness is crumbling when, the from the beginning rich father ward (michael ontkean), gets poor and cannot support the family any longer. then the mother faye (jaclyn smith) has to take the role as the breadwinner in the family and starts to work in order to support the family and at the same time, periodically alone, has to manage the family life. not always that good, but as good as she can. the family life hardly gets easier when the father learns that the son lionel (joe flanigan "stargate atlantis") is gay and is living together with his lover john (joel gretsch "the 4400") also an old family friend, resulting in that the father makes clear to lionel that he is no longer welcome in the family. lionel is the one who meant the most to his sister anne (leslie horan) during her up-bringing, since the family neglected her. anne cannot stand the fact that their father have cut the cords with lionel and therefore she run away from home. as this wasn't enough, the son greg (brian krause "charmed") enlists in the marines and is sent to war. the storyline in this film can on some occasions feel a bit thin, in spite of that it still has a lot of realism in it, which makes it well worth seeing. since this film illustrates many sensitive relations and situations, i would believe that it is best appreciated by a mature audience even though it wouldn't hurt for teenagers to see it and get something to think about before adulthood.

once a year in america, saturday morning would give way to new cartoons, usually sometime in america. just about the time school started.i guess this was to make not having school on saturdays that more bearable.one friday night before the premiere of the new saturday morning cartoons, a movie came on."at the earth's core" i had not a clue who cushing nor mcclure were. clearly they were not from the same country, so i couldn't grasp why they were traveling together.i do recall seeing the mechanism in the fire-breathing monster's mouth.what connects this movie for me is the opening with the molten metal and then suddenly we get the band playing as we see the factory.how do you end a movie like this? the music again, and two bewlidered cops as the drill appears behind them.whatever reason, i remember watching this movie more that friday night than i do any new cartoon that came on the following morning.that was definitely the late seventies.it would be during jurassic park mania, cicra '93, i believe, before i would see this movie again.yes, people in costumes. there was the fire-breather again.still loved the ending with the two cops.finally, it would be nearly another decade before i would send off for the movie on dvd.now i would just watch the beginning and intro.oh, i do love much of the movie. of all these sci fi jules verne, hg wells, erb movies, this one stands as my fave.what i note now is that one of the cops begins turning around a wee bit too soon, then turns back, then he and the other cop are synchronized as they turn inward once again to look behind themselves at the drill.perhaps for me, this movie stands as the best of the saturday morning shows, which is why i enjoy it so much.

i'm serious as well, i mean don't get me wrong, if you haven't got a bent for this type of z grade, creaky creature feature {why would you be watching is my first thought?} then it's a rating of about 3 to 4 out of 10 tops, but to me it's a special kind of nonsense that takes me back to a nice time in my childhood. you know the kind, the memories that never leave you. eagerly taking it all in with youthful wonderment as doug mcclure and peter cushing tunnel beneath the mantle to do battle with a host of creatures and sub-human species'. and guys,! now we are all grown up we can admire most seriously at the wonder of caroline munro and her heaving cleavage. no wonder my older brother was keen to take me to the cinema to see this one!.yes the effects are bad, men in suits, strings pinging parrot monsters around and exploding rubber frog like thingies amuse us greatly. and yes, cushing and a surprisingly pudgy mcclure act as if they have truly been mesmerised by the evil meyhas at the "core" of our film. but it matters not, zany and clunky and awash in glorious colour, at the earth's core is a throwback to a special pre-ilm time when kids like me queued around the block to see such joyous nonsense. 8/10

rugged david innes (solid doug mcclure) and doddery dr. abner perry (a delightfully dotty peter cushing) drill their way into the earth's core in their spiffy mole machine. the duo discover an ancient prehistoric world populated by dangerous gigantic beasts and human beings who are used as both food and slaves by evil telepathic pterodactyl men. director kevin conner, working from a blithely silly script by milton subotsky, maintains a constant brisk pace throughout and treats the exceptionally foolish premise with astonishing seriousness, thereby giving this picture a certain clunkily earnest quality that's amusing and endearing in equal measure. the lovably hokey (not so) special effects are quite (unintentionally) funny. the cheesy array of cut-price creatures in particular are positively sidesplitting: cruddy guys-in-obvious-shoddy-rubber-suits pterodactyl men, equally rinky-dink savage ape-man brutes, and a hilariously ludicrous fire-belching frog thing who blows up real good. one gut-busting highlight occurs when mcclure mixes it up with a fat and clumsy giant reptile. another priceless scene depicts a dinosaur clutching a doll in its slavering jaws. moreover, we also get some rousing rough'n'ready fisticuffs and an exciting climactic slave revolt. it's a total treat to see cushing gleefully ham it up in a rare broad comedic part and become an unlikely, but enthusiastic arrow-slinging action hero in the last third of the flick. the ever-luscious caroline munro looks positively yummy as the fetching princess dia, plus there are nice supporting turns by cy grant as gallant warrior ra and sean lynch as treacherous coward hoojah. mike vickers' neatly varied score alternates between jaunty orchestral music and wonky droning synthesizer stuff. alan hume's crisp cinematography adds a glossy sheen to the infectiously inane proceedings. a complete campy riot.

shazam was okay, but hero high was my favorite when i was a kid, i mean before there was sky high(2005) and zoom(2006), there was hero high, a school for super hero's in training, teenagers with super powers would help police capture bad guys, and other times they would get in embarrassing situations like the greatest american hero(1981). it was a fun cartoon to watch, what was also fun, was the live action stage show called the kid superpower hour with shazam. the actors who voiced the characters, also dressed has there characters in the show. rex ruthless(john berwick), misty magic(jere fields), weatherman(jim greenleaf), captain california(chris hensel, who also sang the theme song), dirty trixie(maylo mccaslin), glorious gal(becky perle, who looks like the love child of superman and wonder woman), and punk rock(johnny venocour). the whole cast just went with anything, when it came to the jokes. the cartoon was a fun superhero comedy, i shore up it will come back in live action like fat albert(2004)

i'm a fan of zhang yimou and finally found this dvd title from the shelves of a shenzhen bookstore after a long search at many places.this is a huge departure from previous zhang yimou work, esp in terms of style and locale. the director himself has said that this is the first and only time he'll ever attempt to make a black comedy set in contemporary china. you may even say this work is experimental in nature, compared to his other well known big budget and formal pieces.filmed with a hand-held camera and wide angle lens throughout the duration of the whole film, the quick pace editing and high energy performance & naturalistic tone never let you go once it grips you from the start. it presents a very realistic account of modern chinese urban sensibilities, which in this case is set in beijing. if you appreciate and love this kind of black humor, you will love this film totally. also look out for hilarious cameos by zhao benshan (happy times)and the director zhang yimou himself.a last point of note: i find the characters in this film, as in all other zhang yimou films, exhibiting similar personality traits - stubbornness, always trying to beat the odds & up the ante. do let me know your thoughts on this.david lee

shuai is a burly and uncouth young beijinger with a punkish haircut, who ekes out a living selling cheap books from a stall in an indoor market. he wouldn't appear to have anything in common with the wiry, middle-aged, would-be intellectual, zhang - and yet the two of them wind up in a restaurant together discussing the pro's and con's of murder (the chinese title would perhaps be better translated as 'talk it over'). if that makes it sound kind of pedestrian, don't be misled: this film is profusely inventive in its plot, and mostly races along at breakneck speed (although the pace does flag quite badly towards the end).if you only know zhang yimou's worthy historical dramas like raise the red lantern and shanghai triad, or his more recent martial arts epics, hero and house of flying daggers, you'll be amazed; in fact, whichever of his other films you've seen, you'll be surprised, pleasantly surprised - this is far and away his most original, most quirky, most experimental work. it was shot within a couple of weeks on a minimal budget, almost entirely on location in beijing (and making use of many ordinary beijingers in the smaller supporting roles - there's even a fleeting cameo by the director himself), and mostly with a hand-held camera, in a jerky, hyper-kinetic style which is a million miles from the elegant formalism of his best-known films.ok, i live in beijing, so i find an additional delight in all the bizarre little details of everyday life that i am coming to recognise and relish (even though it was shot in '97, and things are changing so rapidly here), but i really think this film can be appreciated by anyone. i saw it, as i have so many other chinese 'comedies', at a movie club that screens sub-titled versions of recent chinese films for an almost exclusively expat audience; and it is the only one i can recall where the audience was laughing out loud. some non-chinese audiences might find it a little too strange, a little uncomfortable at times, in that it does include some violence, and, after opening as a breezy, offbeat romantic comedy, mutates into something much darker in its second half. it is, however, very, very funny.it's also superbly acted by the two leads, especially long-time zhang yimou collaborator jiang wen, who is probably mainland china's foremost film star, and has a brooding screen presence reminiscent of a young depardieu or de niro.watch this film - for proof that the chinese have a sense of humour that can translate to other cultures, for proof that zhang yimou is far, far more than a one-trick pony...... and for a thoroughly good time.

i could never imagine i would start loving movies like this. after seeing yimou zhang's 'hero', i decided to check his other movies, perhaps looking for something similar. the second yimou zhang's movie i watched was 'no one less' after which i realized what kind of cinema i'm now in. no wonder why i got 'keep cool' immediately. it is a simple, touching and brilliant piece of cinema, i pay my respect to the director.this movie shows that it's not the amount of money makes film good. it's all about what the director wants to show and how successful he is in doing this. the story is very simple, a typical extract of a typical daily life, moreover shown in a very simple way, the movements of camera also strengthen the impression and the feeling of the movie. i give a top rating to this film and impatiently waiting to see other yimou zhang's films.

i was born in beijing, china and moved to the united states at the age of 9. been home to beijing several times since and loved it each time. one of the many things i love about beijing is the people and the ambiance they bring to the city. "you hau hao hao shuo" (which translate more accurately to "if you have something to say, say it nicely") delightfully and truthfully captures that feeling of beijing. i suppose you would have to have lived in and kinda understood beijing and its people to get the most out of this movie, though you might enjoy it regardless.> the story is not complicated, intentionally kinda quirky, and captivating. i will leave it to unfold by itself and not tell you too much except some comments. each detail, from the pictures on the wall, to the decorations, the streets, and restaurants feels like home. (zhang yimou most likely shot everything "on location") but more importantly, the characters - our "hero", the girl, the kind-hearted but unfortunate "laptop man", and the night club owner are each native to beijing and lovable in their distinct ways. their conversations really capture the essence of each character. the story, mostly driven by situations and conversation (save the brilliant bafoonery near the end) is intriguing and always interesting.> i am 21 now. my parents and i love this movie. we are always so amazed by zhang yimou's ability to transform ordinary people into believable screen characters, and everyday life into extraordinary situations."keep cool" - different. hilarious. meaningful.

this is not the best movie you might ever see, but it still is very refreshing. of course, it has it's flaws, it has it's humbling moments and yet at the same time it's different from all the sh*t you're used to and is funny in a way only the french can give you this. you might recognize a little from the masterpiece amelie, when you see the opening. i give it 7 out of 10, but still reccomend it to you if you're tired of the usual bore you can rent in the videostore.

the claude lelouch's movie is a pretty good moment of cinema. one of the most touching films about family and loneliness, and surely the best interpretation of french actor jean-paul belmondo.

surely the best film directed by claude lelouch after "l'aventure c'est l'aventure". the jacques brel's life inspiration is really present. richard anconina and jean-paul belmondo played a really amazing duo and are really great in the psychological discovery of the two characters they are playing.

sam lion (jean paul belmondo) discovers he needs to take some time off as everybody around him relies to much on him and stages his own death. when he discovers those he loved ans still loves are in need, he gets albert duvivier (richard anconina) to help them. in search of his own past, of his own desires, this fabulous film by claude lelouch is a man's quest for himself at a ripe age.built like all lelouch films, the film's beginning with constant flashbacks may be puzzling, especially scenes where paul belmondo (who looks a huge lot like his father) is playing a young sam lion while sam lion stands in the same room - a flashback sequence which takes a second to grasp.one of lelouch's most elaborate works, l'itineraire d'un infant gate is a must-see tale of self fulfilment.

the only reason the duke is tops, one of several "race movies" made during the times of segregation, would be worth noting today is because it made the film debut of a 21-year-old singer named lena horne. she plays ethel andrews, a singer who has to leave her producer mentor duke davis (ralph cooper) in order to branch into the big time. davis, however, has to fake having taken the money for her services in front of her so she won't feel sorry for having done so. he then teams up with doc dorando (lawrence criner) for a series of medicine shows throughout the south. meanwhile, in new york, her new producers have bombed big time because they made her the whole show instead of simply the specialty act. davis finds out from the radio and offers his services as producer and band leader to bring his lineup of other specialty acts, many of whom make their one of their few or only film appearances here, for his chance at the big time with ethel next to him. guess what happens? while the plot is the kind you've seen in thousands of other movie musicals during this time, the fact this was made for a certain audience makes this one of the more fascinating features i've seen during this black history month. ms. horne's singing is on good display here and it's interesting seeing her so young before her professionalism takes full hold later in her career. among other supporting players there's an unconfirmed, according to imdb, appearance by lillian randolph, annie in my favorite movie it's a wonderful life and sister of amanda randolph who i just saw in the musical short the black network, as the woman with sciatica who complains of not being cured after taking the doc's medicine before duke explains it's for the feet! and as a longtime louisiana resident, i'd like to take note of two players from here in this movie: joel fluellen from monroe as a tonic customer and marie bryant from new orleans as the sexy dancer who appears near the musical climax. so for just lena horne alone, the duke is tops is worth seeing at least once.

an unusual film for an audience outside the usa. lena horne looks fabulous and so does ralph cooper. there is not added background of tap steps as in other musicals so you do not hear the beat of the taps which is great realism. music is muted to hear what dancing steps there are. acting is a little stilted and the casts speak slowly so that you think the movie is older than it is. costumes are daring for the time in the dance routines at the end. often feels like you are part of an audience at a stage show. what furniture you see is very modern which adds to the movies feeling of other worldliness. a must for all film buffs.

its a good film set in vienna about a cab driver, toni (donald buka), who steals a passenger's identity when the passenger is shot whilst sitting in the back of his cab. this gives him an identity as he is an illegal immigrant, but he needs to play out the role of the victim until he catches a flight to the u.s. with a ticket in the victim's name. mrs manelli (joan camden) rumbles him but she is accused of having mental problems by her husband, claude (francis lederer), a concert pianist. as a result, toni is let off the hook. claude does not want to part from his wife, but she runs away from him. there are several plot twists and eventually both toni and mrs manelli make a run for it together - they are both trying to escape from their lives in vienna. there is a tense, exciting build-up to the finale. are they going to get away.....??...unfortunately, the picture quality isn't fantastic and there is a line that runs down the middle of the picture for a while. the cast are all very good in their roles, especially francis lederer's portrayal of claude. also important to the story are heinth (manfred inger) as the cab company owner, marie (inge konradi) as toni's hometown girlfriend and the inspector (hermann erhardt). its a good film.

previous commentators have noted the similarity in appearance between this film and the third man, director carol reed's classic film noir starring orson welles and joseph cotten. this similarity strikes the viewer almost immediately. it is, indeed, high praise to be compared to robert krasker's academy award- winning cinematography in the third man. the plot of stolen identity also has been delineated fairly accurately but in rather ordinary terms. i found it highly creative and entertaining. as common as the "mistaken - or stolen - identity" device is in both theater and cinema, it is only a device and not to be mistaken for the plot, itself. consequently, while the viewer may have seen this device "a thousand" times, the plot of stolen identity is full of surprises and twists based upon this device. it is the unexpected turns that make this film much fresher, more original and engrossing than a plot synopsis might convey. stolen identity doesn't rely on the kind of suspense that characterizes most film noire, because there is no real mystery here. instead, it relies on constant, smaller surprises. in short, the mistaken identity device is rather common; but this plot is not.finally, although i was not familiar with the cast, i found the acting to be uniformly good, occasionally outstanding. i easily could have imagined other actors turning this film into a melodrama, with bombast, overblown gestures and obvious facial expressions. the acting is always more restrained and subtle. donald buka is especially restrained and credible, never "blowing his cover" with an obvious facial expression as we see too often in films that depend on the maintenance of subterfuge to sustain dramatic tension.the only disappointment in this otherwise fine film was the very weak development of the love story sub-plot. as it stands, it seems like an afterthought - a mild surprise, in fact - tacked on to the end. or perhaps during their shared ordeal, the actors simply couldn't convey a palpable level of chemistry that i could appreciate. this sub-plot should have been made more apparent as the story unfolded. all in all, i thought this film was a fine little gem, and i wondered why i had not seen it before. try it, you'll like it.

a quick paced and entertaining noir set in vienna just after w.w.11. donald buka is a refugee who can't find legal work because he does not have any papers. no papers means no work permit, which means no way to get a passport. he survives by driving a friend's cab at night. if he gets caught it means three months in jail. one night he picks up a fare at a big hotel and drives the man to an airline office. buka takes the man's luggage in and returns to the car. there he finds his customer has acquired an unneeded hole in the back of his head. what to do? call the police? without a work permit they will put the grab on him real quick. no, he needs time to think this out. he drives to a secluded spot, empties the man's pockets and hides the body. he now has an american passport and plenty of cash! he drops by an underworld contact to have the passport photo changed. now he just needs to go to the man's hotel and collect the man's plane ticket. his ticket to freedom! needless to say that would be too simple. waiting at the hotel is the dead man's mistress, joan camden. camden is on the run from her rather nasty husband, francis lederer, lederer is of course the swine who had bumped off the man in buka's cab. camden calls the police since she believes buka has robbed her lover. buka shows his new passport and manages to talk his way out of the mess. camden breaks down when hubby lederer shows up at the police station. lederer convinces the police camden has suffered a mental breakdown and she is released to him. she escapes again, finds buka, and the two decide to flee the country together. lederer again puts in an appearance and buka must decide if helping camden is worth his freedom. this film is much better than i'm making it sound. buka is best known as the low-life cop killer in 1950's "between midnight and dawn". the film was produced by actor turhan bey.

there's a "third man" look to the shadowy b&w photography of stolen identity, a thriller produced by turhan bey, ex-star of universal pictures during the '40s. it's an expertly filmed tale of jealousy that leads to murder when a famous pianist (francis lederer) becomes overly possessive of his wife (joan camden) and is soon intent on carrying out a scheme to murder a man she's having an affair with.a taxi-driver (donald buka) happens to be giving the woman's lover a lift to the hotel when he steps outside a moment to chat with a worker digging up the street. lederer uses the sound of the drill to muffle the sound of the bullet he puts in the head of the passenger from outside the back of the car. when buka returns to his cab, he finds a dead man in the passenger seat.enroute to report the murder to the police, he changes his mind and decides to switch identities with the dead man who has an american passport which means buka could realize his ambition to return to the united states. the stolen identity plot becomes thicker when the man's girlfriend (lederer's wife) shows up at the hotel to accuse buka of impersonating the dead man.it's the sort of plot movie-goers have probably seen countless times, but it gets a nice workout here, with plenty of tense scenes as buka and lederer's wife plan how to run from the authorities until a final confrontation with the murderer and the police.it's extremely absorbing, well done and holds the interest throughout with some excellent atmospheric photography of vienna that will remind most movie-goers of "the third man".well worth viewing.

hong kong, the 1920s. a young man from poor beginnings dreams of being a hero, and spends most of his time training and learning about kung fu and bodybuilding, much against his father's will. he helps a servant girl escape from a ruthless businessman, whose goons then come after them, and terrorizes the young man's uncle's noodle restaurant. the uncle turns out to be an old, reformed triad assassin, who now helps the young guy become proficient in martial arts. it's all-out karate kid style with "wash the wok" instead of "wax on, wax off". the kung fu villain is the ruthless businessman's son, who has a trademark scorpion style that looks cool although it is quite silly and surely completely unrealistic.but the story, which develops over time, has an epic feel, good characterization, great kung fu and is generally very entertaining. the young hero is very sympathetic and provides a good protagonist to root for. the romance dimension remains undeveloped, though, which is a bit disappointing. otherwise a great movie.my rating: 8 out of 10.

operation scorpio (akathe scorpion king) doesn't slip into top gear until the last 25 minutes or so, but when the action does hit top speed, it delivers some truly amazing martial arts scenes that demand the viewer's attention. that is not to say that the first hour is worthless¬ó just that compared to the final fight-fest, it seems a bit underwhelming.the plot revolves around yuk-su, a talented comic artist who dreams of being a hero¬ójust like those he depicts in his drawings. when yuk-su rescues a young maid, siu-yu, who is being sold into prostitution, he incurs the wrath of her evil boss, wa. led by sonny, master of scorpion style kung fu, wa's henchmen give chase to yuk-su and the maid. yuk-su's father intervenes but he is injured. after being rescued by some friendly bodybuilders, the three eventually hide out at a noodle restaurant, owned by their friend, master yat.yuk-su learns to cooks noodles, but also regularly sneaks out in order to secretly build his strength and learn kung fu under the tutelage of jean, the teacher of the musclebound hulks who rescued them. when master yat must leave on business, yuk-su is left in charge of the kitchen; however, he pops out to practise his skills with jean, leaving siu-yu to serve the customers. sonny and his men visit the restaurant and, disgusted by the noodles they are served, trash the restaurant.when master yat learns that yuk-su has been sneaking out, he tells him that he should have learnt kung fu from him; it transpires that master yat used to be a top triad assassin, until he decided to try and change his ways. under the guidance of master yat, yuk-su improves his skills, even learning the art of the shadowless kick! yuk-su eventually gets a chance to try and become a real hero when his friend, fatty, announces that his maid has also been sold into prostitution. with jean, they visit wa posing as french brothel keepers looking for new women. when fatty's maid is presented to them, she accidentally blows their ruse and at last the action kicks off big style. despite his best efforts, jean is badly beaten by sonny and he and yuk-su are forced to flee. on returning to the restaurant, yuk-su finds it ablaze; and worst of all, the bad guys have found siu-yu! yuk su, accompanied by master yat, returns to wa's place to try and rescue siu-yu...despite some fairly entertaining training scenes, the slow build up to the final action at wa's house is rather too drawn out and devoid of any serious fight scenes. it is a shame that the tedium wasn't broken up by a decent scrap midway, rather than saving all of the juicy stuff until the end.the last fight, however, is worth the wait in the end; won jin gives a jaw dropping performance as the high kicking sonny who scuttles, flips and spins with amazing skill and dexterity, and chin kar-lok gives a solid performance as yuk-su, the artist-turned-fighter. also particularly good is old-school kung fu star lau kar-leung (aka liu chia liang) as master yat, proving that this old-timer has still got what it takes to kick ass! although not a perfect film, operation scorpio has enough standout action in its finale to definitely warrant a viewing.nb. i may have got some of the names wrong. my dvd calls characters by different names than those listed on imdb.

i have been feeling a little disappointed by tarantino ever since death proof. but i insist it was only a little, because i can appreciate the amount of work in producing such an homage to stunts people. inglorious basterds has definitely propelled tarantino to the top ranks in my universe. this movie can be summed up (albeit inadequately) in one word : "raw". there is an intense emotion in every scene. revenge and justice seem to be the main themes, from the start of the movie one feels compassion towards the victims of the nazis, and is placed in tarantino's fictional dimension of the ww2 historical context. characters are unpredictiable, fun, scary, brutal, sexy, and other adjectives i am sure are escaping my mind that are just as fitting and positive. i won't go in to an appreciation of each character, but the other comments by fellow users sum up the appreciation of the various performances. dialogue has evolved from the classic tarantino "bad ass" provocative style as seen in pulp fiction and death proof. one can feel in the dialogues that tarantino is making more open references to other movies. indeed, many dialogues were near lessons in cinema to the audience, the setting partly takes place at a movie premiere ; a reference to a movie is close around every corner. it is nice to see that each language presented (german, french, and english) is employed rather equally and naturally. i speak both french and english very fluently, and am frequently disappointed in how english speaking characters in french movies act poorly, and how french speaking characters in english/american movies act poorly. amazingly enough, tarantino managed to make his actors pull off a natural and graceful performance from his actors. it helps put the audience in context of the historical context. indeed ; soldiers, spies and civilans rarely understood soldiers/spies/civilians from other countries.the visuals/photography are beautiful, with sceneries convincingly conveying a 1940s wwii europe. the outfits are perfect, and the violence orgasmically/realistically conveyed. no punches are held back, and the nazis are often shown being tortured. this makes the movie not open to all audiences ; the graphic violence can shock the more sensitive demographic. volumes can be written about this movie. but the movie is so good, that during the north american inglorious basterds premiere at the fantasia festival in montreal, i had to pee, but refused to go so as to not miss one single scene. i hope that image conveys how strongly i feel about this movie, and i'm a hard audience to please.

brad pitt sticks his index finger in diane kruger's leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants. funny, horribly so. the invented yarn takes "the dirty dozen" for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies. lots of fun. even "paris when it sizzles" is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog. i was thrilled by christoph waltzer's character and by his sensational performance. brad pitt creates a true original. i love the actor's lack of vanity. there's a quirk in the character that is pure brad pitt. tarantino visits a new universe but. fortunately, his hand. his brain and his heart are visible all over the place.

i must admit when i saw the preview for "inglorious basterds" i gave myself big expectations. this film did not disappoint.rarely when i watch a movie with such high-expectations do i have those expectations met or exceeded; this film did that and more. even more rarely do i clap at the end of a movie, this i and everyone else in the theater did.i have to say i am a little biased towards quentin, i grew up with "pulp fiction." i watched it when i was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film.however, since then quentin has not really lived up to his billing. his style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar, the quality honestly wasn't there (i never watched jackie brown, and then there's grindhouse). that is until "inglorious basterds." what quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by tarantino or sergio leone, but seeing how leone is dead, tarantino's the self appointed guy on this masterpiece.so let's look at the movie which i won't give away. the writing was spot on, a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie. not to mention this movie was set up in the classic tarantino mold, great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking action.the acting was superb!! christopher waltz deserves an oscar, seriously. i don't say that often, but honestly the man should get one for this movie, he spoke every language in this movie, and delivered with such amazing touch and poise. he stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressive.i have no problem building this movie up, because this movie is the best film i've seen all year, and probably all of next year. quite frankly the more i think about it, this movie may crack my top films of all time, and is quentin's best movie since "pulp fiction." take it from me, watch this film. i loved it doesn't do this movie enough justice.i watched it yesterday and i'm still blown away. thank you quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie. you're back on top again buddy. i can't say enough for "inglorious basterds!"

that's what i thought, when i heard about the cast of inglorious basterds. and i'm both from germany and into movies.that guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre tv series - and even there he didn't play the main parts. obviously nobody ever noticed, what he's capable of. now, thanks to qt, he got one shot to change that - and - let's put it this way - that was a bingo! he is the living proof of what a great caster tarrantino is.by the way: i think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a german - being able to understand everything. and the german dialog is written almost as good as the english.now i could repeat, what many others have written here before. i'll put it short: finally, qt is back.

..."inglorious" as our local theater decided to display its title on their marquee, minus the second word. it is terrific cinema.i don't hesitate to recommend this film to all but the over-squeamish. let them never know what they're missing.i did hesitate to give it ten stars because of my experience of tarantino's previous films. in every case, save "reservoir dogs," they have improved with additional watching.so although i gave it ten stars, i did so reluctantly. it leaves me no "up" to go to.yes christoph waltz is the nazi we've all imagined the worst to be. he is cultured, sophisticated, suave and most sadistic, the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who puts out his cigarette abruptly in a strudel, grinding it into the whipped cream as if he were grinding his heel into a victim.to understand tarantino's films, you need only have a sense of dialogue, color and pacing. the colors are as bright as necessary and when necessary, brighter yet. in the french farmhouse of the opening scene, they are muted and dark, but excessively so. outside a brilliant sun is shining, but in the one room of the house, everything is bathed in shadows and black.it is a brilliant setting for an interrogation by waltz, as the "jew hunter" of the ss, who dangles his host french farmer over the precipice of revealing what he cannot reveal numerous times, then pulls him back with obsequious lines of friendship and understanding.a second sadistic german, well-played by august diehl, later functions as important actor in the final plot twist. diehl's nazi major, who has an ear for german accents, is almost as good as waltz....almost.film classes will study much from this movie. they should look lovingly at the superb pacing. tarantino knows just how long to draw out a scene, building suspense in the manner of hitchcock, then at just the breaking point, suddenly coming to a resolution.for color, look for a final shot at a french theater, where its secretly jewish proprietor is staging a surprise for the upper reaches of nazi leadership.we see her, played by melanie laurent, awaiting the hated german dignataries who will arrive for a film preview of the latest deutsch film masterpiece, a propaganda piece about a german hero and his dubious accomplishments.laurent is framed on a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the gorgeous theater, her red lips and low cut dress reflecting everywhere the intensity of her designs on her guests. it is a single shot that would be worth an entire film.there are thankfully many more such images, many more paced scenes of exquisite dialog and suspense.in short, see it. i'm sure you'll see it again and again.

i like breillat's movies, but this one is the best i've seen at balancing animal warmth with sexual intelligence. anne parillaud is electric, and the script is amazing - especially considering it's supposed to take place on the set of another of breillat's movies. you don't have to agree with her take on everything to get a lot out of this. it made me think a lot about vulnerability and power. try to imagine a male director with jeanne's openness - not impossible, but a little mind-bending. the unannounced sexual undercurrents that are always present when humans get together to make anything is held up to bright light here, but not a cold light.

this film was very interesting to me, virtually a film within a film, which is about a very whimsical director who cleverly persuades an actress and and actor (who happen to dislike each other) in producing sexual chemistry on film. the director is faced with a fusillade of obstacles as she tries to get the two individuals to perform beautifully on film. sex is comedy is much more than a comedy, packed with uncomfortable quirky moments the movie also addresses the psychological and innate instinctual behavior of men and women in regards to the sometimes controversial act of sex. i loved this film, the character jeanne played by the beautiful anne parillaud performs wonderfully on screen as you share in her struggle to produce a motion picture work of art.

catherine brreillat is a french director who loves to provoke her audience. she takes us along to witness how a film is done on location. the movie in production seems to be based on herself, since the person at the center of the story is jeanne, a woman director, much like ms. breillat. jeanne acts as the alter ego of the real director.jeanne reaches an impasse at the start of filming. not only has she picked the wrong time to photograph this movie during a cold spell, as it involves beach locations that are obviously too cold for the actors and extras. jeanne has problems with the two principal actors, especially, the male lead who has problems accepting the way the director has decided to show him in the movie; the lead actress is no angel either.movie making, ms. breillat tells us is a process like no other in a creative work of art. first, there is the writing period, in which, in this case, jeanne, has written a screen play, that when it goes into production reveals problems the writer/director didn't think about. there is the problem of how she wants to photograph a love scene in which the young woman of the story has her first sex contact. what appeared clever in the written page, doesn't necessarily translate into an easy time in front of the camera. the actor is made to wear a false penis and has a lot of problems accepting the fact that a make up has to touch him in ways he never thought he would ever be touched by another man.the luminous anne parillaud is marvelous as jeanne, the director. she makes observations about the production, the actors, and the crew that fit well into the story being told. gregoire colin and roxane mesquide play the lead actors, with all the insecurity that some actors bring to a movie set. jeanne has to massage their egos in order to get what she wants in the end. ashley waninnger plays leo, jeanne's assistant."sex is comedy" allows ms. breillet to give us her own take on films in general. this is a great look at the way movies are done in a typical breillat style.

another fabulous movie from catherine breillat, this time about the difficulties of shooting a sex scene in a movie. using comedy ¬ñ a new genre for breillat ¬ñ we get a backstage view of filmmaking but in documentary style. the character who plays the director in the movie is based on breillat, the sex scene in question is taken from her earlier film ¬ëa ma soeur' as is the main teenage actress. but the film, like all of breillat's work, is not entertainment alone. it is peppered with philosophical observations on the nature of sexuality as well as demonstrating a devotion to ¬ëpurity' (as opposed to pornography) that is a cornerstone of breillat's work and a devotion to real emotion. we see the director character harangue the young lead actress and actor to bring the best out in them, hypnotising them into the parts they need to play, bringing out part of themselves that the director can see in them but they cannot see in themselves until they achieve the heights of acting that she demands of them. she makes meaningful movies, not titillation, but she shows the work that is needed to produce this, and so gives us insights both into the (decidedly french) film making process and the psychology of male ¬ñ female sexuality.

the accounts seem real with a human factor added to the mix. a lot of sadness. i'm sure glad that i wasn't him....another thing to add is that all the women in this show were not really pretty accounts of the real women. but, i don't think that it was about the women, although it was to jfk jr's passion. what a shame. any loss of life is a real shame.seemed like a good account of his life. i recommend it if you are into biographies and melodrama!

for pure gothic vampire cheese nothing can compare to the subspecies films. i highly recommend each and every one of them.

king vladislav (angus scrimm) of romania is a vampire, but a vampire of light who wants nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with mankind. but his son, radu (anders hove), is a cruel creature to his very heart (which is pretty obvious as soon as you see him). three female students have come to study local folklore, but find themselves drawn into the vampires legends at just the wrong time: vladislav has been killed.who can say anything bad about a film featuring a cameo from angus scrimm? i can't. i mean, i had some low expectations after seeing other full moon pictures ("puppet master" in particular, and "demonic toys"). but despite the really bad animated effects of the demons, this film was actually really well done and very fun to watch. plenty of blood, a good plot and backstory (the bloodstone story was surprisingly refreshing) and even some new angles on the vampire mythos, which you'd think would be dead by now. (maybe i'm wrong, but this is probably the first film to feature rosary beads being fired from a gun.) aside from vampires and blood, you get a share of nudity (gratuitous, but welcome) and i had to notice the excellent score from the composers (not sure who deserves credit, but those involved include stuart brotman, richard kosinski, william levine, michael portis and john zeretzka). this is horror 101 all the way. heck, you even get two sequels, which is the sign of a true horror film. (of course, some bad films get sequels, too -- did i mention "puppet master"?) the romanian theme was well-done, and the film even seems to have been made by romanians if i am guessing their name origins correctly. and the score -- the music -- really stood out for me as a nice change of pace, very mood-setting. i like richard band, but i'm glad another composer was given a shot because he nailed the atmosphere on the head. if you like vampire films and want a slight variation (one of the eastern european variety), this is worth seeing.

the subspecies series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever. there is something about them that makes them special i think it`s the feeling you get when you watch them .they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the 1700`s or 1800`s i think it has some thing to do with the set`s that are used if so then it`s working keep it up guy`s :).in a quick round up of what`s happened in the first part - radu was supposedly bannished from his home land years ago by his father and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birth rite. the blood stone and all his father has so he kill`s his father who is played by angus scrimm (the tall man from the phantasm movies). and takes the blood stone which has emense power to who ever has it because who has it need never kil anyone again because the stone is supposedly meant to drip the bloody of the saints and every time the radu takes a drop from it he is slowly going insane. (thats all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire aint bad enough). well radu`s brother stephan try`s to put a stop to his evil ways all while trying to stop himself falling inlve with a tourist who is staying at a house/fort which belongs to a friend of his.well one thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well you will have to see the movie to see what goes on from here on in.i will review/comment on the other sequels soon .the difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and this is not so this will not appeal to everyone but this has an atmosphere far superior to that of buffy although radu does not look as good as the wonder full sarah michelle gellar :).rating for this movie 10/10 a fine example of how a vampire movie should be done :).

first watched this film years ago with my daughter who is now 13 and fell in love with the vampire. we both thought it was a top film, then watched sub 11 then sub 111 now i find there is sub 1v which i cannot wait to get my fangs on, and also there is a fifth in the pipe line. if no one has seen the movies. these are the best of the best. i think it deserver's a thousands oscar's. i could watch these from morning to night.i would love to have a set of nails like he has, watch out girls. i love it as all the story lines continues from film to film. these ant typical vampire movies they are better. i would love to live in the life that is protruded in the films. it would make all my dreams come true

i was ten years old when i saw subspecies, i instantly had the hots for michael watson and laura tate, they really do have some great on-screen chemistry in the earlier parts of the movie. i ordered a copy back in 1993 from full moon and i learned this: ion and rosa, the servants, have much bigger roles in the screenplay along with the king. what most people don't know is that there was an alternate sequence that was supposed to occur in the ending scene: michelle and stefan get cornered into a room and michelle has the idea for stefan to make her a vampire to help fight off radu and her demonic controlled ex-friends. however, for some reason or another that scenario never made it on camera. another scene in the script, that can be confirmed from the original trailer shows stefan drinking blood from a wolf, or actually in the trailer you see him coming up with blood on his chin.this movie gets a 9 because it's one from my childhood and i have fond memories attached to the characters; even though my favorite characters were stefan and michelle i think anders hove's radu is pure feeling-evocative acting, so much feeling in his work there.

i have seen a number of horror movies to know that this one was one of kind. full moon pictures has a knack of giving this fan an entertaining night. for all the cheesiness of most vampire films, this is the one that has not only a good premise but has two good sequels. a must see.

i watched this on sky tv late one night, as i am a vampire fan. i must admit i half expected it to be a b-movie disaster but i was pleasantly wrong.subspecies is about a family of vampires. when a vampire lord dies, his two sons, the handsome and noble stefan, and his brother, the evil, hideous radu start a war with each other over their birth right, the bloodstone. the bloodstone is a holy grail of sorts for vampires and it bleeds the blood of saints, which give the vampire who drinks it an ultimate high.the fight for the bloodstone takes an unexpected turn when 3 college students turn up in the brothers' territory on a school trip and stefan has to protect them from his brothers lusts.like, i said, i went into this film not expecting much at all but it was one of the best low budget movies i have ever seen. the sets and locations (romania i think, been a while since i've seen it) are very nice and the music score did the film justice.most of the acting was adequate, but its anders hove as the evil radu that steals the movie (and all the subsequent sequels). hove's performance as the twisted vamp is truly breathtaking and bumps the film simply from okay, to pretty d@mn good!

"subspecies," like many other horror films, gets a raw deal on imdb. the majority of movie-watchers have a hearty contempt for horror, and when they occasionally rent horror films, they either want to laugh at them or cringe at excessively gory scenes. unfortunately, "subspecies" is not particularly laughable, and not that bloody, so it gets a low rating. that's too bad.of course, there's plenty to criticize here. the non-actors are flat, the subspecies are a poor special effect, and the nighttime scenes are too brightly lit. but what do you expect? for a straight-to-video horror film, "subspecies" boasts decent production values and more integrity than you might anticipate. the film's romanian setting is virtually unique (i believe it was the first american movie made in that country, post-communism), and the locations, both interior and exterior, are beautiful. the script has moments of intelligence, especially when it delves into local folklore (all bogus, i'm sure). somehow, the location filming and smartish script work well together - "subspecies" has its own very distinctive world. to risk damning with faint praise...it could be a lot dumber.fans of the more gruesome aspects of horror will no doubt get a kick out of the blood-drooling vampire villain, radu. he's pretty effective in this movie - powerful, with a memorable raspy voice - but i like him better in the sequels, when actor anders hove gives a more self-parodying, campy performance. a totally sincere radu is somewhat silly. other silly aspects include gratuitous nudity and the subspecies themselves, who are clearly only in the movie because producer charles band has a fetish for evil little creatures (see also puppetmaster and demonic toys).but i linger too much on the movie's flaws. for what it is - straight-to-video vampire horror - "subspecies" is perfectly fine. the sequels boast better production values, more violence, and somewhat more thoughtful story lines, so i recommend them even more highly. still, this isn't a bad start for the series.

this is a perfect example of a classic full moon pictures movie. any fan of horror/vampire flicks should definitely check this one out. original plot and good, easy to follow story. also, this movie has some heart-racing scenes that combine horror with action. as of now, the only sequel i have seen to this movie is part iv, which i have to say is almost better than this original.i give it 10 / 10fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master, slumber party massacre, skinned alive, sleep away camp, and other full moon pictures flicks. for other recommendations, check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section.

this is one of my all time favorite cheap, corny, vampire b movies. calvin klein underwear model...oh, i mean, stefan the good vampire, returns to transylvania to ascend the throne of vampiric royalty, but manicure-impaired and eternally drooling half brother radu has other plans. having killed their father the vampire king, radu now sets his sights on stefan, stefan's new mortal girlfriend michelle and her two pretty friends, and the all-powerful bloodstone.okay, the scenery is beautiful, and it should be as it was shot on location in transyl-fricken-vania for gosh sakes. the actresses are no great shakes and stefan the heroic vampire is about as charming as a refrigerated fireplace poker, but who cares? there's only one reason to watch this movie, and his name is radu! he's a physical homage to nosferatu and he has the best lines in the movie, all spoken in the raspy voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day. the cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film, as radu slowly approaches the camera and reveals his grinning, slobbering face for the world to see. i found myself cheering him on as he collected victims and taunted his perfect brother. but maybe i'm just a sicko. questionable taste in men aside, i highly recommend this film to vampire enthusiasts. it's original, it's fun, and radu is one of the best vampires i've seen in a long time...much more fun than the stiff, tragic, whining undead brats that endlessly grace the horror screens these days. radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes. he's what a vampire should be.

this is one of the best and moodiest vampire tales ever! i love this movie really. the character are great, even the locations and the story. indeed the picture isn't a big budget production, but it is absolutely worth seeing.ok there are some faults (especially the names of the castle and the locations) in this movie, but such mistakes are typically and are almost in every horror movie.the scenery fits perfect to the story and is close to reality,i can say that honest, because i visit them once when i was in romania in my vacations.in my opinion this is the best part of the subspecies series.

words fail me whenever i want to describe my feelings about this movie (and the sequels)... does it have flaws? sure it does... starting with the "subspecies" themselves,which were not executed well enough for a special effect.so why do i glorify these movies??? for the herd of movie mass-consumers out there,who care more about quantity than quality,about cheap fun more than about depth, crap like "blade" (it doesn't even deserve a capital letter),"underworld","dracula 2000","dracula 3000" and so on are good movies to munch popcorn to and drink a couple of cokes... what makes subspecies a superior effort for anyone claiming to be a vampire fanatic,on the other hand,is obvious: the vampire himself is romanian,the story is set in transylvania (the scenes filmed on location are more than convincing),and the atmosphere is not based on any "action-packed" chases or expensive orchestral music.radu himself is the source of the atmosphere... this is what a vampire should look like and this is how he should behave! add a breathtakingly gloomy castle with dark passageways situated in romania,include some typical vampiric elements ( such as the movement of the shadows on the walls when the vampires take to flight) and you have a work of art! in short,if ,like me,you 're fascinated with vampires and feel that their appearance as well as the setting should be sinister and dark,there's no better place to look in than in a subspecies movie... or in vampire journals,the brilliant spin off of the former...

a sparkling movie. bb is a marvel. she's sultry. she is a feminist. she is still very much in love.the movie features paris in the 50's. it is wonderful to look at the sites, the cars (ds!) and orly.a simple but very enjoyable romantic comedy. the music is horrendous. it almost dissonates. on the other hand it is hilarious. but it is probably the only thing amiss, at least looking at it with 21st century eyes.the movie comments on the french manner of treating infidelity. it is that sense modern. a movie like un elephant se trompe enormenent did it in an 80's way. but the basic premise stays the the same.thanks to makers for providing bb with this opportunity.

a wonderful little production. the filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-bbc fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. the actors are extremely well chosen- michael sheen not only "has got all the polari" but he has all the voices down pat too! you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. a masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. the realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears. it plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with halliwell's murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.

michael sheen shines like the afternoon sun in this brilliant portrayal of a comic genius. if you are familiar with kenneth williams' mannerisms and diaries then this drama captures the essence of them perfectly. when i read about kenneth hoovering in his swimming trunks i laughed and then it was brought to life on the screen, but this time i didn't laugh as it was put into perspective as the actions of a repressed and tortured man. it must have been such a lonely existence being in kenneth's skin, craving attention but shunning it when it truly mattered! the last 20 minutes are heart-breaking as you see kenneth gradually sink to the depths of despair and consider suicide as the only alternative. i have seen it a dozen times and still cry uncontrollably at the point where he bids goodnight to louie. i cannot recommend this drama enough. sexually explicit but it drives home the fact that kenneth couldn't let anyone invade his world and this is where the sadness of the man lies. for a genius who brought happiness to so many, it's such a shame that his private life was filled with such despair and sadness. pauly.

this is a "docu-drama" of (mostly) the later years of kw's life, with nearly all the parts played by actors (but spot which tv quartermaster plays himself!). it was made for the bbc4 arts channel but my guess is there will be syndication and dvd releases soon. kw is ably played by the excellent michael sheen, here repeating his previous stage role with great success. most of the supporting cast are also very good, and a nice touch is the recreation of period tv appearances with the new actors. this is not, however, light viewing - anyone familiar with kw's diaries and general unhappy demeanour will already know how twisted he could be in later life - so don't expect 80 minutes of carry on styled buffoonery, since the emphasis is decidedly downbeat throughout. recommended, but it's tragi-comic, indeed.

i was a huge fan of asterix comics when i was a kid and watched every one. i never heard about this movie when it was released but i watched it with my kids last night. i remembered the comic well enough to know that a lot was added to the story for the film. some of the changes i thought were a bit corny (like the nephew's 'modern' dancing, and the viking chief's daughter - almost everything about her), but i found most it amusing enough. most importantly, seeing the reactions as my kids watched it, confirmed that the film pleased its target audience. as a family film it works better than other asterix titles i've seen. many of the names that weren't in the book i found had the same appeal as ones that were. overall, an enjoyable family film, regardless of whether you're an asterix fan or not.

after another raid in an empty village, the chief of the vikings timandahaf misunderstands the explanation of his adviser cryptograf that "fear gives wings to the dwellers" and believes that fear actually makes the villagers fly. they decide to chase the champion of fear in gaul to learn how to fly and make them invincible warriors. meanwhile, the nephew of vitalstatistix, justforkix, is sent from parisium to the gaulish village to become a man and asterix and obelix are assigned to train the youngster. the stupid son of cryptograf, olaf, listens to a conversation of the coward justforkix with asterix and obelix and kidnaps him. while returning to the viking village, justforkix meets abba, the daughter of timandahaf, and they fall in love for each other. but the machiavellian and ambitious cryptograf plan to marry his son olaf with abba and become powerful. in the end, asterix realizes that it is not fear that gives wings, it is love.when i was a teenager, asterix was my favorite comic book and i read all the goscinny and uderzo stories. this feature film shows all the original elements and humor of the comics in a delicious and wonderful animation. the romance of justforkix and the gorgeous abba is delightful and the situations asterix and obelix get involved are hilarious. my vote is ten.title (brazil): "ast√©rix e os vikings" ("ast√©rix and the vikings")

having been a faithful asterix fan all of my life, i have to say that "asterix and the vikings" is probably the most well done of all the asterix films. its got some very funny jokes in it and the animation is superb. as many people have pointed out, it doesn't really follow the plot of the comic ("asterix and the normans") very closely, but in many ways that's just as well, because that book stands out in my mind as one which poked a great deal of fun at the culture of the sixties, and much of it is very dated today.what really rubbed me the wrong way, though, is how they incorporated a disney-style plot into the film which took much of the focus away from asterix and obelix. we have a misunderstood boy who doesn't fit in, justforkix. we have a tom-boy girl who doesn't fit in because she wants to be treated as equal to men, abba. they meet and fall in love, but their love is threatened because boy is ashamed to be totally honest with girl, but in the end their love wins out. this has been the plot of so many disney (and, be fair, other studios too) films that its not funny and the plot was old twenty years ago. i mean, they even gave justforkix a whimsical animal sidekick.not only did i find this derivative and clich√©d, but it really detracted from the story and left me dissatisfied.i think that it speaks volumes about how superb the rest of the movie was that i still think very highly of it, despite the way the plot got hijacked.

wow! it's even better than i expected! the best animated ast√©rix movie ever! and it feels so good to hear roger carel doing the voice of ast√©rix again! i surely recommend it to everyone who likes the comic books of ast√©rix! but i suggest that you go to see the french version, cause it surely is the best and you hear the original cast! did you know that roger carel has played ast√©rix for nearly forty years? i think he did a marvelous job! and the song from c√©line dion at the end fits rally good to the end credits! the music is good, the drawings are good, the actors are wonderful... in a word: a masterpiece! go to see it! you will not regret this!

... but i laughed. a lot.i saw 'ast√©rix et les vikings' at a public screening during the world cup. the sound was lousy, it was too bright to see the screen properly - but i still enjoyed myself immensely. the names of some of the characters had me rolling on the floor: smsix, abba, vikea... all not very witty, but in good ast√©rix tradition. some very good jokes, but also some that not everybody seemed to get.the only thing i didn't like were the voices of ast√©rix and ob√©lix, in the german version at least. the voice actors are very well-known around here, which was the only reason they were casted, really. they don't fit the characters at all.all in all, a good way to spend some time (and if it's free, like in my case, all the better) and to have a couple of laughs. 8 out of 10.

attending this film was an excuse to escape the work i had to do for my classes but it turned out to be one of my best experiences here in france. the film makes quick work of building multidimensional characters and has an excellently smooth storyline. the characters really did have the voices you would expect reading the graphic novels and the artistic talent exceeded my expectations the music was catchy and the comedy toying and lighthearted, almost a flinstoneish inclusion of modern items in playful manners. the film was attention grabbing, cute and action packed at the same time. a wonderful tale spun expertly. i'll be showing it to my french students.

since the last horrid ast√©rix film and the fact that we only get the swiss german version in cinemas, here, i went to watch it with quite a bit of trepidation... unfounded, as i was happy to discover ^____^the film is funny and modern, has good gags, a good animation, an amusing character interaction, a good voice cast (note: i can only speak for the swiss german one!) except for the viking chief's daughter abba (her name is great, despite the not very inspired voice actress)...i especially liked the character justforkix (goudurix in french, grautvornix in german. he's the young man who is supposed to be put in shape...). he's a very amusing portrayal of a mollycoddled, urban teenager; but he's very likable, despite the teenage mannerisms... xd the interaction between ast√©rix & ob√©lix and their young charge is fantastic and thoroughly entertaining.it shouldn't be compared to the old films, since this one is quite different... which surprisingly doesn't make it bad. on the contrary. when they tried to modernize the last film (twelve years ago), they completely blew it. this film, however, proved that it can be done just fine... ^-^i came out of the theater cheerful... always a good sign ^_~

like so many other reviewers on here, my memories of this show are universally warm. in fact, so fond are said cherished memories, that i recently purchased the dvd box set in order to revisit that happy and carefree period of childhood, whereby i used to sit utterly mesmerised, as i watched the ongoing quest of monkey, pigsy, sandy, tripitaka and later yu lung a horse/dragon/man (you'll really need to watch it to understand), when the much loved show initially aired on bbc 2 on friday evenings, as i recall.well, i'm pleased to say that even after all these years and now viewing this with adult i.e. more cynical(!) eyes, the show has lost none of its inimitable charm.simply wonderful entertainment, from the magical characters and their comical interactions with one another to the perhaps not so special effects (which actually serve to heighten the fun) and of course, not forgetting the hugely memorable opening title sequence from the first season, the passing of time has not in any way, shape or form diminished any of monkey's spellbinding charm.as monkey himself would probably say, 'oi! you there! go out and grab yourself some nostalgic fun.'

easily one of the best shows ever made, & it just gets better with age.for me , one of the chief reasons for this was the english adaptation done by david weir.a japanese friend of mine once told me that the show in it's original language was more whimsical & less flat-out hilarious that the version we all know.the fact that the show resonates so strongly for its non-japanese fans is , i think, largely because of mr weir's inspired efforts & some winning voice-over work.well done, sir!

in fact, the nature of the whole series is irrepressibly funny! but not always funny... there are moments of extreme poignance as the deeper aspects of human emotion are touched on. over and again, the series comments on the frailties of human nature and the life long, or in this case eternal, struggle to overcome them. monkey is both smart and stupid at the same time, his arrogance and reliance on his own martial skills lead him into trouble in almost every episode. pigsy is just plain gross. sandy has a philosophical turn of mind. he has many of the wittiest lines. the english translation is a delight. "ignorance can always be improved upon," drawls sandy in his laid-back manner, "but you can't do anything to help stupidity!" "who are you?" the group of travellers are asked. "we three kings of orient are," says monkey. this is not just for children, it is a magical romp for anyone who can suspend reality

monkey is surely one of the best shows to have ever been shown on tv. i remember when i was a kid, i'd go to my grandma's house every saturday morning and i'd turn on the tv so i could watch monkey. i loved it. it had kickass action scenes, cool special effects, a great story, a fantastic theme song that was guaranteed to never leave your head and hilarious dubbing. but it is kind of weird that it's set in china and the actors are japanese and filmed in japan, but that is no stop towards making this tv show lovable.monkey is about the adventures of three people: pigsy (toshiyuki nishida), sandy (shir√¥ kishibe) and of course, the unforgettable and most lovable character, monkey (masaaki sakai) who travel from china to india to get a bunch of holy scrolls in order to save the world.monkey is great fun and it's magic.

first off, the alien saves a little black boy as well as a mexican, despite what the imdb plot summary suggests. this film is the fulfillment of the purest of male fantsies, interracial rape. the main character in this film is a george michaelesque dope, who doesn't understand primal human urges like drug abuse and murder. in fact, every time he uses violence to solve a problem he has an internal conflict that physically hinders him. what a square. in any case, my favorite scene is when he writes the gang members a letter stating if they want the 500 bucks they get from the reading center for protection they must meet with him. at the meeting he is surrounded by countless chicano gangsters, but he keeps a cool head. in slow motion, he punches the wooden post of a stop sign that shatters upon contact. then, still in slow motion, points at the leader of the gang and says, "noooooooooooooooooooo, mooooooooooooore!" the gang members comply. cool, right? the beauty of this film shows through in these simple solutions to social problems like prostitution and gang violence.

alien warrior (or king of the streets) is one of those 80s gems you stumble across by mistake, then watch awestruck, marveling at how wonderfully silly and over the top it gets.a rather hunky alien arrives on earth (la to be exact) and stumbles into a world of drug dealers, gangs, and corrupt cops. he falls in love with the flaxen haired, beautiful teacher who only wants to help inner-city kids read more. he also manages to anger a coke-snorting drug kingpin who vows to destroy him.i fell in love with this film at first viewing... sure it's hokey, silly and low-budget. but you can tell the filmmakers had their heart in the right place, and damn if the thing doesn't work! i only pray it'll be on dvd soon.it's got a hot soundtrack, break-dancing, violence, nudity.... all with a positive, wholesome message! see it.

there is more to this movie than meets the eye. if you're looking for groundbreaking originality or easy comedy, you'll be disappointed. but for an entertaining 90 minutes, this is just fine.the cinematography is careful and precise. the sex scenes, which one comment decries as gratuitous, are anything but - every gesture contributes to the development of the characters.yes, some of the main characters are not exactly lovable human beings. but the movie makes an honest effort at showing their interactions in an honest light, without being sensationalistic (at least not for early 21st century urban standards). and there are many very amusing moments.

and a hard spot somewhere else. i haven't seen this movie since i was quite young, maybe 12 or 13, who knows. but what i do know is this is the movie that taught me how to masturbate. i kid you not. i have no idea if it is any good by any real standards of today, but for me, back then, it was everything.the only reason i feel comfortable writing this is because i'm sure no one will ever get around to reading it. i mean, really, who is going to look up this movie these days?i just discovered that i have not yet used up the ten line minimum for the amount of length i most take up in a review. i had no idea there was such a minimum length, but there i go, like a student trying to fill up a page in a journal, my ten lines. thank you very much.

why do i give this 1974 porn movie 7 points? because i watched it. and i found it hilarious! aliens, their weird spaceship, their weird helmets... my god, was that a sight. and all what these desperate alien women need is semen from the earth.and where do they look for it? in upper bavaria, germany. and that is where the main fun comes from: in europe (and more so in german-speaking countries), bavaria is seen as a traditional and backward region. and then the actors are so helpless with the alien women. well, there have been films about people being unable to deal with women like the "american pie" series.but what this film achieved is a true, funny weirdness. you constantly wonder how they came up with these crackpot ideas. but it was 1974, and looking back 35 years fills one with a kind of nostalgia. you've never seen a film like that.and if you don't mind seeing the casual pubic hairs and breasts, watch it once. it is a comedy essentially, not a porn flick.

if you are looking for an erotic masterpiece this isn't it. if you're looking for a comedic masterpiece this isn't it. if you're looking for something hardcore this isn't it.that being said if you are looking for an example of the fine art of european erotic comedy from the the early - mid 1970's this is it.i see many people complain about the quality please understand it was made in 1974. yes the women do not conform to the modern ideal of attractiveness. they are by no means ugly women but they do not have the same looks which are idealized in our silicone culture. yes the dubbing is not great but they are speaking german and anyone who speaks any german will realize it is pretty hard to dub over a word with 12 syllables.if you have seen the dvd prior to the latest release it is marketed with 2 covers of 80's and recently 90's adult stars. the film is an r film so those complaining about hardcore should have realized this, the film is edited from the original but it was also edited prior to its run in the drive-ins in the late 1970s.i first saw this film as a young man and judging by some comments there are many in the same boat who caught a glimpse on cinemax. many people become upset when later in life it doesn't live up to their previous memories. it's understandable considering the raunch and nudity packed into todays erotica.if you compare 2069 to a modern soft-core erotic comedy you may be disappointed. the film while outlandish is actually quite fluid and the jokes while generally innuendos and double meanings still hold up and can still garner a chuckle. if you compare it to a hardcore movie you will be further disappointed, compared to today you see very little.it is still one of the best examples along with bottoms up and the other cinderella of european erotic/comedic cinema of the 1970's.

don't be fooled: this isn't yet another tired example of the girls from outer space pretending to be the french ski team come to earth to collect as much sperm as possible genre, though the synopsis may suggest otherwise. this movie is a gem, an absolute jewel that has enriched my life from the moment i laid eyes upon it. hilarious, exhilarating, action-packed, and stunningly erotic, "ach jodel mir noch einen" is a euro-madcap tour-de-force, a grossly underrated bavarian classic.stop everything you are doing and run out to rent, or better yet, buy this movie immediately.

i will admit that this movie was awful, cheesy, sexist, badly dubbed, and poorly edited, but i loved it anyway. i first saw this movie when i was 14, and it has stuck with me ever since. fyi, this is very close to hard-core porn as i remember. it certainly got my juices flowing. this flick gives a whole new meaning to swedish erotica. it is a humourous take on human sexuality as seen by hot randy female aliens who are, i think, just looking for some spermatozoa for their dying race.

this truly is an australia cult classic. if you're one of the lucky ones to have seen it-- then you are very lucky. it has been released in most countries, but not in australia for some reason. i have a copy on dvd from the uk. not a great transfer, but i bought it, having seen it previously at a film festival. the directing is spot on and the performances rock! this is dark film scary film, but often times, very funny in parts. i urge you to see this film, there is a coolness about this you don't see in 99% of the typical aussie fare. the screenplay is very well crafted and sends you on a journey where you know it will end badly, but until the last ten minutes, you just can't pick how badly. great work from the four leads, especially lachy hulme. when its all said and done: great work on display!

my friend made me sit down and watch this film. this is out there material. "god the devil, heaven hell... and a restaurant thrown in for good measure.four guys and a prick. who dies? when and how?is that's the story. you'll never guess the ending for this one. a skillfully realized little gem of aussie cinema. hats of to the team that made this one.10 out of 10.

ok so some of the plot points might be a bit obvious but over all an interesting idea which works towards a tight ending. the acting is solid particularly lachy hulme who plays one of the central characters in this ensemble piece. he certainly has a screen presence and he is interesting to watch. it has a low budget feel which works for the sort of thriller/horror genre four jacks belongs to. the film doesn't try to take itself to seriously which adds to the overall charm. the character of phil(dave serrafin) has to be one of the most annoying character seen on screen since rupert pupkin/ king of comedy. worth adding to a weekend pile of dvds.

not many people have seen this film, and it is a shame because it is a work of art. the characters are brilliant, the dialogue is sensational and the use of themes leaves the audience wondering. i truly loved this film and can't wait to see more of matthew george's work.

this is an excellent film, full of complexity, themes and great dialogue. the characters are well drawn, with phil the biggest loser of all time.adam haddrick's character is the most vicious thing i've seen on screen since alec guinness's portrayal of adolf hitler in 'hitler: the last ten days.'i just wish they'd all got away with it. but without giving too much away, there are some situations you just cannot lie your way out of.

this movie was clearly an early attempt for a new director, but still succeeded in being original and entertaining as well as in some moments thought-provoking. however, i have to say the story would not have come across as well without the stellar performance of paul anthony as pip. he made the well written parts very believable and affecting, and the more weakly written parts much more bearable. also, i have to mention the performance by alan cumming. it was refreshing to see him in a part like this. he brought a weight to his role that provided a very grounding element to the film. as for paul anthony: who is this guy? why haven't i seen more of him? someone give him more roles, please!

i'm a 55-year-old fairly jaded gay white man. since i don't watch tv, i watch at least 250 films a year, most on dvd. i keep notes on all the films i see and rate them. since december 2003, i have seen only five films as great as eighteen. so, i've rated eighteen better than at least 700 other recent films. mr. bell is far too modest in his film commentary. eighteen is a great film. and, it also resulted in two "firsts" for me.i watched the film, the first time, and i was riveted throughout and weepy during the last half hour, something that's only happened to me three times before. (five minutes into the film i knew it was going to be very good.) when jason began reciting whitman, i lost it, and then... the kiss. well, that is one of film's great kisses, and that scene among filmdom's most poignant and unforgettable. when pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, i clapped. i cheered. i love happy endings. i wept.then i watched the trailer and the tla previews and thought, "okay, is this $800,000 or so indie really that great?" so, i immediately watched eighteen again, something that's only happened three times before. and, eighteen blew my socks off yet again, even more so. then i watched "the making of eighteen" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and mr. bell.so, i thought i'd watch eighteen again with the director's commentary. i have never before watched a film three times in one night. after the third time, at 3:00 am, i knew i had just experienced a great film; eighteen now ranks #10 on my top twenty films of all time. and, in the very small universe of great gay or gay-subtext film, there is brokeback mountain, eighteen, mulholland drive, and maurice.thank you mr. bell! eighteen is brilliant and fully-realized, with a magnificent cast, a wonderfully moving, understated score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touching, totally appropriate and hummable song. i can go on, but i won't gush too much more.this film should have received oscar nominations, certainly one for best picture. the performances, without exception, were all wonderful. ms. gill's lovely, sultry voice was a surprising epiphany. and sir ian mckellen? 'nuf said. awesome.eighteen is the reason i slog through over 200 mediocre to utterly horrendous films (some in the $150 million plus range) a year, to find that one treasure, that one exquisite, magical, unique and enchanting, perfect "faberge egg" enfolding an unforgettable heart.finally (i promise), my second "first" -- i've never before posted a commentary on any film i've seen.thank you again, mr. richard bell! breathtaking genius. give this man $100 million for his next film! he made $700,000 us into one of the top 50 films of all time. if i had the cash, i'd grant him $75,000 a year living expenses and match any funds raised for his next film. mr. bell is already a great director at 31-years old. can you imagine him at 45-years old?wise and witty, tender and brutal, poised, poignant, understated yet edgy, chilling and thrilling, mesmerizing, haunting, unforgettable: eighteen, the masterpiece.

i loved this show but then i don't remember ever not loving anything he did, starting with "americanization of emily". a town sheriff who keeps trying to steal the town blind and ride off to mexico, gotta love it. like everything he does it has a tongue in cheek flavor that brands it as a garner product. james plays the same character in lots of his shows and movies but somehow it never gets stale.p.s. re: killing off the main characterif i remember right the "good" brother was killed off and replaced with the "evil" twin in an effort to increase the ratings i.e.; make it more like every other western on tv at the time. i think this show was too far ahead of its time and i still miss it. tv without a jimmy g show is missing something.

this show was a really good one in many ways, although certainly an atypical western with the hero (?) riding around on a motorcycle rather than a horse, due to the 1914 setting, very "late" for a western, which tend usually to be set between 1866 and 1890. i remember some controversy about its cancellation at the time but didn't really watch it during its time on nbc. when i came to see it and love it was a decade later when i was in the army stationed in germany and it was shown every week from the beginning on armed forces television. by then, margot kidder was famous as lois lane but i'll also always think of her as nichols' girlfriend. in a lot of ways, nichols was a lot like maverick; both were much more attracted to getting rich with little effort than they were fighting. it was in the little tv magazine that they distributed at the px (not really an authorized edition of "tv guide" but made to resemble it as closely as possible without getting into copyright trouble) that i first learned the real story behind the cancellation. i really wonder what the next season with the more violent twin would have been like if they had really made it as planned. of course, by the time this show was made the "western era" of tv had been in decline for around a decade; someday i hope to be able to write that the "reality era" has been in decline for that long! while "gunsmoke" and "bonanza" were still running, they were both nearing their ends and it had been years since a new western had really caught on; i think that this trend did a lot to hold "nichols" back, and was the main reason that nbc executives doubted that it would ever find a large audience but to me, a good western, unlike a show set in contemporary times, is somewhat timeless, as are other "period" shows; changing fashions and the like do nothing to make them look any more "dated" than they were supposed to be, and i think that watching this show, 10 years after it was produced, is really what brought this point home to me. also, this show is an early pairing of garner and stuart margolin, who is really one of the all-time great sidekicks, and not just in westerns.

after watching "a texas tale of treason" you feel a renewed disgust for the nature of the hollywood beast. inside the interviews and conversations of all involved with the project there is a common sense of comradery and rebelliousness that spans backgrounds, social classifications, and even geography. this can be attributed to hard work on the entire production's undying commitment to the project and the love the of the story from the original film, and the complete creation of vacuum that is it's creator. the scale of people involved in "waldo's hawaiian holiday" was amazing to me, at a no budget, no glory production. there were no trailers or craft services, no amenities at all, and yet everyone involved stuck right there with it. if nothing ever comes of this project, antstuie productions have laid their foundation for being a serious, honest company that's never going to lay down and take it or sell out and make a movie just for the money. i'd like to see any l.a. director go through the guerrilla process to get a shot. more realistic true to life cinema is lacking in this time of cg and green screens. the masses may enjoy their entertainment spoon fed to them in nice bite sized censored calm bits, but there is a large group of people out here in the world that share the opinions and insights of the filmmakers that still make films for the love of the material or love of storytelling, not dvd sales or box office. i loved this documentary, and i hope that ifc has the cahones to pick it up and air it so that maybe, just maybe, one more person will decide to pick up a camera and film some real life so we the viewer can have even a temporary understanding that everyone everywhere is the same, and anyone anywhere can be a true storyteller.

this film would be particularly fun for anyone who has been in the film industry, especially in any indie capacity... those whose inheritance includes a film introduction may not appreciate it quite as much. i am hard to please in the documentary category. this doc is different though- its pleasure comes from an earthy realism of indie filmmaker punks who are a hoot to be around and watch. whether you've ever wondered what it is like to be in films, in front of or behind the camera, or whether you have worked your way through the sometimes painful and hard but rewarding indie world, you'll certainly get a kick out of this film.

watch this movie. it's truly a good ride through the difficulties of making a indie movie, and what happens when it blows up in the film maker's face. there's a lot of stuff about punk rock, and the philosophy behind that movement and it's relationship to this project. so if you're into old punk, american punk, you'll dig it.... but, beware, there's a ton of bad acting bits from the failed project that are incorporated... yet they do come off funny at times. and, actually, some of the best parts are listening to people who have never been involved in movie making pontificate and what they went through in the three year period that it took to put this together. so anyone out there that's about to make a film, especially if you haven't been to film school or worked in the field, you should watch this and learn from the film maker's mistakes.

after seeing a texas tale of treason, the measly correspondence efforts by cox could not even afford the massive collusion stu directed with no budget. it tells a story about dedication, sweat, whiz, fire and punk rock. i love it! my favorite parts are the interviews with marci (she's such a hot baby babe and she digs me but she just doesn't know it yet). the japanese clerk muffing his lines, that cracked me up. the sex scene was really cool. i am going to see if stu will come over sometime and do the box light wave thing when i'm doing it with my woman. the intro and of course my 5 seconds during closing credits. i know thats going to get me some chicks. i hope to see more from antstuie because i know i can expect the unexpected.

it's rare for a movie to both encompass the process of problem solving and a fantastically far-reaching moral quandary and be a fairly accurate historical movie, but fat man and little boy pulls off this trick.it's the story of the manhattan project -- the world war ii effort to build the atom bomb, told as the conflict between the two men who made it happen, gen. leslie groves and robert oppenheimer.the historical figures are a great study in opposites: military vs. civilian, practical vs. idealistic, emotional vs. scientific, brute force vs. consensus-based problem solving, immediacy vs. long-term vision. a fictional character, played by john cusack, is added as a sort of synthesis of the two historical figures, to show the humanity that oddly escapes the real people (and of course the obligatory love interest, played by laura dern). one looking for a straight documentary might criticize the lapses into melodrama (and occasional looseness with the facts, but that's hollywood for ya), but the purpose of fiction is to synthesize and galvanize events into more universal truths, so i think this can be forgiven.one of the great visuals in the movie is when oppenheimer witnesses the first atomic explosion: it's done entirely through his reaction, and considering the awesome visuals inherent in an atomic explosion, it's a brave and entirely effective way of describing in a single moment the ambivalent effect on humans of unleashing such power (the sort of thing lost in the typical hollywood shoot 'em up version of history.) the use of music is particularly excellent in the last third of the movie.fairly accessible and highly recommended as both a historical movie and drama of the highest order.

okay maybe it was because i happen to be in yangchun china when i saw this movie. maybe it was because i finally had something on tv i could understand or at least read the subtitles, or maybe it was just funny. whatever it was this movie was worth the time.i had just arrived for my foot and head massage when they gave me the remote so i could watch tv. usually i would turn the darn thing off but i stumbled upon this crazy movie and got hooked.the plot if you could call it a plot sort of revolves around a cooking competition and sort of is a love story and the food in this movie is the real star. if you like iron chef and many of the other cooking shows currently in the reality tv mode, then you will love the scenes with food in this movie.it goes fast and the subtitles are so fast you better be up on speed reading for this one. however the action is mostly slapstick so you don't always have to read the entire subtitle to get the idea.the main actress is lovely eye candy and the main actor isn't bad to look at either. they are both worth watching. finally if you have some time to kill and want a good laugh this isn't a bad choice for both.i don't speak a word of chinese but i was totally able to understand the cultural humor of this film. for those who do speak chinese maybe it is even better. overall i give this an 8 out of 10 and currently i am even looking to find a copy to have while i stay in china, and keep for when i come back home, it will be a nice reminder for me of my time in yangchun and a silly afternoon at the massage salon watching a silly movie.

this was a very funny, fast paced movie. i watched it more than once and am keeping my rental around to show others. i'd just like to take this opportunity to ask anyone in the know, how do hk producers choose their subtitle translators? i'm most curious. please direct me. again, to return to review, it is a really rollicking film with plenty of content, subtleties reminiscent of the classics, though full of slapstick. reminiscent, say, of the mexican comedies of cantinflas.the film does not disappoint fans of the director who have noticed that he chooses distinctly chinese themes, trying to get to characteristics rarely explored. the director's entire collection is way of getting a look inside the culture in a disarming way.and i don't see how his funny girl in chinese feast could be topped.

the first time i saw this movie was on a flight between guangzhou, china and los angeles. it was a real hoot and made the trip pass with much less discomfort than the normal 10 hour flight. i tried to locate a copy of it without success until i discovered a copy for sale on ebay. having now watched it twice, i recommend it as good entertainment. my only real criticisms are that the choice of english translation words for the subtitles is sub par, even by normal standards. also, the subtitling is little to small, blends into the movie too often and frequently travels too fast to read well.

this is a great film with an amazing cast. crispen glover is at his freakiest . his guitar solo is amazing. also watch out for a cameo by william burroughs. truly a cult classic. this is on my top ten list. don't miss this twisted film.

this film is on my top 20 comedies list. this is a truly unique film. to the reviewer who said "i must be really missing something."--you are correct. you are missing something. if you don't have the kind of sense of humor this film requires, that's one thing. but don't give it a bad review because you think it's "looney" but isn't intended to be. loony is an apt description of both what it intends to be and what it succeeds in being. i laughed much more often and much more intensely at this film than i do at most other funny films.michael almereyda brought out the best in his cast in this, his first big film, for which he was nominated for an independent spirit award for best first feature. crispin glover, as usual, is absolutely brilliant in some perfectly inexplicable way, and some of his very funniest lines ever were said in this film. glover is clearly the best comic actor working right now. harry dean stanton puts in an excellent comic performance. william burroughs is incredible in a small role. dylan mcdermott was ideally cast, and lois chiles is completely excellent.all of the above are perfectly funny in their own perfect way, but this is one of crispin's finest performances--up there with his performances in river's edge and willard. if you are a crispin glover fan, but have somehow overlooked this film, you need to stop whatever it is you're doing and see this immediately.but just remember to relax first, and maybe have a beer or something. this is a great film, but it is very unusual, and i recommend being in or inducing an appropriately silly state of mind before viewing.

i recently rented twister, a movie i'd seen several years ago on tv, and it has aged well; i found myself laughing out loud several times at it and as weird as all these people are, by the end i profoundly cared about them. this is the sort of little movie that is made for a cult audience because, rather like howdy's gazpacho (well, i think that's what it is), it's an acquired taste: you have to be attuned to its peculiar wavelength. the production values might be charitably called inexpensive and the pace and atmosphere take a while to get settled, but the film has a "look", especially in some wonderful shots contrasting the dry flatness of the land with the cluttery nouveau-riche opulence of the mansion interior: michael almereyda had a good eye even then. life with sodapop magnate eugene cleveland (harry dean stanton) and his household (two adult children, a grandchild, and a housekeeper) seems so detached from life outside we could be in gormenghast. everyone in this film is wonderful (especially suzy amis and crispin glover as the directionless genius siblings maureen and howdy), inhabiting their roles so comfortably after a while you just buy the strange premise, that somehow, having survived the tornado and being apparently incapable of happiness, these people are lucky, and yet don't know quite what to do with their luck. there are some truly great scenes: eugene's sudden confrontations first with his gold-digging children's tv host girlfriend virginia (an acidly pert lois chiles), then with his children; william s. burroughs taking target practice in the barn and telling a story about a mysterious jim; maureen's boyfriend chris proving himself by battling a shed full of wasps cloaked in a tablecloth and doily and old fedora; howdy, violet, maureen and chris all sitting on the couch (the latter three in appropriately lightweight summer garments, the former in a red blazer and black leather rock'n'roll gear) staring at images of deserts on the huge tv, and contemplating the future (the images were done by bill viola, who did the backdrop video installation for nine inch nails' last tour). crispin glover is predictably magnificent as howdy: as always, he remains perfectly in character. howdy has made a cult of his misery and brilliance; he's like the oscar wilde of kansas, striving to live up to his red velvet suit. whether he's thrashing away tunelessly yet loudly on an electric guitar, cracking a fullsize bullwhip while wearing an all-black cowboy outfit, demolishing a room, or even doing simple things like driving or pouring the aforementioned soup from a blender pitcher, he's mesmerizing. if you like his work, you'll like this.

this is a tv movie based on the murder of martha moxley in greenwich in the mid 1970's.based how much on truth it's hard to tell.this much is certain.it is based on the book written by mark fuhrman.anyway,the movie depicts the crime in flashbacks and its aftermath,including the arrest of a suspect,some 25 years after,who was never considered a suspect at the time.in the movie,fuhram of course is largely responsible for the arrest and closure of the case for martha's surviving family,in particular her mother.the narrative of the film is by the ghost of martha moxley,talking in the first person.this is a very effective device in this movie.to me,it adds more impact to the movie,and puts a human face on the murder victim(if only an actress playing the part)maggie grace plays martha,and i was really impressed with her.there is no way for certain to know mark fuhrman's motive in investigating the crime.it could have been out of a sense of justice and maybe he really cared.or maybe he just saw dollar signs from a future bestselling book.either way,it makes for an interesting movie.it's well acted and fairly fast paced.i don't think there was a lot of extra,unnecessary stuff in the movie,just what was needed to tell the story.one could argue that they left out things that would have shed a bit more light on the proceedings,and one would be right.also,one may argue that the ending was abrupt and again one would be right.but,as i said,for me,i think they told the story with at least most of the essentials.anything else would have likely required a miniseries.as an aside,there is a miniseries entitled "a season in purgatory" which came out 6 years ealier(1996)which this movie has some parallels to,even if only faint.however,if you like this movie,"then you may be interested in "a season in purgatory". it is my belief that "a season in purgatory" is in fact a fictionalized account of the same crime.anyway,for me,murder in greenwich" is an 8/10

if you like detective and police shows and you like suspenseful movies, then you will love this movie!! this movie is great! christopher meloni has amazing acting skills. you may think you know who the killer is in the beginning, but you don't. this movie is about the true story of the murder of martha moxley. watch the movie!!

i was quite impressed with the narration by martha and how it pulled on the emotional heartstrings of the audience as well as how it must have impacted the family. the forward-backward motion of the storyline was well-done, and normally i don't enjoy movies with the flash-back/flash-forward effects. i felt during the whole evolution of the movie that "surely tommy did it". it leaves you with a sense of how these people lived their lives almost totally devoid of each other and the consequences of not having any desire to answer the question, "it's 10 o'clock. do you know where your children are?" and furthermore, "what the heck are they doing?"!! or "do i care?"!! rich, spoiled brats literally getting away with murder. or so they thought.......

too bad they showed palm trees that could not be more inaccurate for connecticut in october ... this was filmed in new zealand ...this martha moxley case had been 'cold' for 20-25 years ... her family worked hard to keep it alive and when mark fuhrman decided he did not want to be remembered only for his involvement in the nicole simpson case .... which could have been deleterious to his reputation (if it already hadn't)... anyway, he followed along as the police tried to get enough information to write a book. ... with the use of flashbacks we can see the relationships martha formed .... unattended boys coming of age without a mother around to help and a dad who was always looped ...plus the fact that they portray the real martha as if she were a movie star... she was a cute sweet girl next door type. other than that, the other characters were really great, especially jon foster and toby moore, who played as michael skakel and tommy skakel respectively. they were good as well, the costumers had to keep it all in the 70s look and back up to the 90s ....it kept my interest even when i caught on about the skakel guy ....

this great tv movie told of the 1975 murder of martha moxley in greenwich, connecticut by a nephew of ethel kennedy. the use of the "ghost" of martha to provide some of the details was very effective and added a lot of heart to the story. christopher meloni seemed to capture the personality of mark fuhrman very well. furhman, who got so much underserved bad publicity in the o.j. simpson trial has certainly vindicated himself by his contribution of bringing the killer to justice after about 27 years.

i thought this movie was excellent. jon foster is one of my top favorite actors, he was perfect as micheal skakel. i found everything about it to be great, acting, costumes, production, directing, photography, script and music, etc.spoilers coming up! you have been warned!martha moxley, who they had tell the story in the movie was bludgeoned to death by her violent troubled neighbor micheal skakel. micheal did this out of jealousy of his brother tommy when martha rejected him and took tommy instead. thankfully though, they caught him years later and he was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. although, i think he should have been sentenced to "natural life" without the possibility of parole.kudos to the cast, crew and filmmakers. two thumbs way up.

in 1974, the teenager martha moxley (maggie grace) moves to the high-class area of belle haven, greenwich, connecticut. on the mischief night, eve of halloween, she was murdered in the backyard of her house and her murder remained unsolved. twenty-two years later, the writer mark fuhrman (christopher meloni), who is a former la detective that has fallen in disgrace for perjury in o.j. simpson trial and moved to idaho, decides to investigate the case with his partner stephen weeks (andrew mitchell) with the purpose of writing a book. the locals squirm and do not welcome them, but with the support of the retired detective steve carroll (robert forster) that was in charge of the investigation in the 70's, they discover the criminal and a net of power and money to cover the murder."murder in greenwich" is a good tv movie, with the true story of a murder of a fifteen years old girl that was committed by a wealthy teenager whose mother was a kennedy. the powerful and rich family used their influence to cover the murder for more than twenty years. however, a snoopy detective and convicted perjurer in disgrace was able to disclose how the hideous crime was committed. the screenplay shows the investigation of mark and the last days of martha in parallel, but there is a lack of the emotion in the dramatization. my vote is seven.title (brazil): not available

i'd heard of the case, but hadn't really paid attention during the whole hoopla of fuhrman writing the book, skakel being arrested, etc. however, this movie did an excellent job of detailing martha, the skakel brothers, the murder, mark fuhrman's involvement and the results of his investigation. i especially liked the flashback scenes with martha talking about her last summer. the actress who played her literally glowed with life and made it even more poignant that the real martha was probably like that. it made martha seem like a real person rather than a victim. i'd definitely recommend watching this.

having seen this without knowing all the hoopla surrounding the lead character, indeed without even knowing that it was based on real-life events, i must say i am impressed. "murder in greenwich" is an above average production for a made-for-tv movie - the acting is uniformly great, christopher meloni in particular putting in a stand-out performance and the teen actors excel in what are difficult roles. the idea of the dead girl narrating the movie is a stroke of genius which elevates the movie from merely good to excellent. the script is exemplary for what is essentially movie-of-the-week fodder and the cinematography is beautiful.

yes, it is a bit cheesy. but it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters. it's interesting to see david soul in a 'bad guy' role; i thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid co. robert conrad is a long-time favorite--i think he brings his character to life very well; and sam waterston has been star quality in everything of his i've watched--movies or tv. i watch this movie every so often but our tape (a vhs tv copy i got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it. this is a movie i think they should put out on dvd; maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after, but i'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there would be a market for a dvd version. i'll keep hoping!

it's interesting that someone made a comparison of the "fifth missile" to the star trek episode. it should be pointed out that the original star trek tv episode in which the crew of the enterprise undergoes a space madness while orbiting planet si 2000 is entitled "the naked time", not the "naked now". the "naked now" refers to the first regular star trek the next generation episode in which the enterprise-d encounters a science vessel. this episode, though, does refer to and is based on the "naked time" original series one.now, to the firth missile. while the reactions of the crew in the star trek episodes were based on those similar to alcohol intoxication, the crew's condition on board the montana was caused by a much more serious situation, namely the paint vapors emitted by the faulty bulkhead finish. there are few places where such a reaction could have more serious consequences than among a crew who has responsibilities as serious as a crew on a ballistic missile submarine, and of course this is what makes the film so suspenseful and such a thriller. the plot is very believable. at the same time, this film, along with "crimson tide", "the day after", "by dawn's early light", "the hunt for red october", "ice station zebra", and many other similar movies give us much insight into how easily things could go wrong and just how easy it could be for a nuclear holocaust to begin. thankfully such an event has not occurred and (god willing) such an event will not happen.

maverick director seijun suzuki finally was able to film his dream project, "princess raccoon" and in a way it's lucky he didn't try this in the 1960's. special effects and computer graphics certain made this sort of production easier to achieve than the old film matte technology would have.some familiarity with japanese history and theatrical traditions will help with the enjoyment of this film. much as familiarity with shakespeare's "the tempest" would help with peter greenaway's dense "prospero's books". these two films actually have a bit in common although, "princess raccoon" is much more colorful and easier to watch for someone without the background to fully appreciate it.while the art design, acting and direction are fine for most of the film, it seems to this viewer that the energy runs out in the last third of the film. most of the interesting sets have been already been introduced and the camera seems to step back for more of a filmed stage play experience.this is certainly a unique film experience and i recommend it to anyone who is interested in alternate forms of film performance. it's not really meant for children although nothing happens that would upset them. if the last third was better i would have given it nine stars.

i use "princess raccoon" (to give the film its not-quite accurate english title) as a litmus test for my friends' sense of humour. it either leaves them cold and baffled - as it clearly did several other commentators on this site - or results in doubled-up laughter, unassailably huge grins and occasional gasps of admiration.the laughter comes from the film's consummate mixture of parodies in contemporary style. targets include a bouquet of japanese and western classical stage drama forms, from kabuki to late shakespearian and spanish renaissance christian fantasy; the naff vacuity of the modern american and european musical, as witness a host of random tap- and rap- dance songs and some very funny banal lyrics, all choreographed with loving "amateur" clich√©; japanese anime and samurai live-action clich√©s; portentous buddhist ritual; and the overweening sweetness of viennese operetta. i've not laughed out loud so much at this type of film since ken russell's outrageous musical deconstruction in "the boyfriend".the grins come from the clever textual subversion of the japanese legend, told in a traditional 5-act structure reminiscent of the plays of the 17th century master chikamatsu. as in his work the narrative is advanced in a mixture of song, recitative, high-flown poetry and low comedy relief - here the pot-broiling of the incompetent ninja, ostrich, by peasants under the illusion that he is a tanuki-raccoon in human guise. all of this somehow does hang together, and even more remarkably does manage to engage the watcher's emotions through the welter of cultural references.in truth "princess raccoon" wears its pan-cultural garb with alluring lightness, and that's where the gasps of astonishment come in. visually - again, as with russell's masterpiece - the film is a treat, a riot of colour with its digitised backdrops of classical japanese images from screens and prints, over-the-top costumes and stage sets, mixed with some breathtaking live action sequences in summer fields and seashores. you'll love it or loathe it, but there's no point castigating chalk for being cheese; and "princess raccoon" stands, first and foremost, as a wickedly funny as well as affectionate put-down of our contemporary cultural vacuity, in both east and west. bravo!

one hilarious thing i'll say off the top, is i'm not the biggest seisun suzuki fan. i've actually seen a fair number of his works (thanks to a retrospective the film festival had) and i found his films just a wee too yakuza-driven for my tastes. so, i went into princess raccoon wary of what i was going to see. boy! was i knocked out! 'raccoon' is suzuki's attempt at a musical, using the elements of japanese opera mixed in with many modern elements (both audial and visual), raccoon is a treat from start to finish. the lead actor, joe ogdari, proves that he's one of the hottest actors in japan these days in this role. i have to admire that the younger japanese actors still take roles that take place in feudal-times japan, dressing up in samurai gear to full effect. the story itself does get a bit confusing, if you don't follow it really closely, but even if you don't, prepare yourself for the treasures that princess raccoon has.

this movie takes the voice of terror and makes it better. holmes is protecting an inventor in switzerland and is on the trail of professor moriarity, who has become a nazi. this is a better version of holmes in a wwii world. rathbone does a great job with holmes as a spy and a detective. see this if you liked the voice of terror.

sherlock holmes films from the classic universal era tend to range in quality. this range goes from very good to above average, with none of their output being abysmal, or astoundingly brilliant. sherlock holmes and the secret weapon fits snugly into the middle ground quality-wise, and, as ever, it's an enjoyable outing that fans of the series, like myself, will enjoy very much. this film sees holmes in the middle of a world war 2 plot by the evil nazi's to steal a swiss scientist's invention, which could turn out to be a key element on the battlefield. the world war 2 sherlock holmes films don't tend to be as good as the ones such as the scarlet claw where holmes is conducting private investigations, as they're usually dogged by too much propaganda or a plot that is more to do with the war than the mystery. this one, however, pretty much stays away from both and by putting the focus on holmes and his investigation, the film works much better. perhaps universal saw what brought down the earlier voice of terror and changed the focus because of that.basil rathbone once again puts in an excellent maverick performance as the ace detective and while nigel bruce doesn't feature as much as normal, it's nice to see him when he does. the two don't spent much time together, which is disappointing because their chemistry is always one of the best things about holmes films; but this does allow more time for holmes to showboat in various disguises, which is always lots of fun. dennis hoey's lestrade is definitely my favourite of the secondary characters, and while he's not as funny as usual; his facial expressions are great, and his presence helps to emphasise how great holmes is. his scene with watson in a car following paint drops on the road is my favourite moment of the film. it's good to see holmes' nemesis, professor moriarty return, even if it does seem like he's just been thrown in for the hell of it. lionel atwill's performance isn't as good as george zucco's in the adventures of sherlock holmes, as he never really convinces that he is indeed a brilliant mind; but seeing him lock horns with the protagonist is fun and it's nice to see him in the film to offset the world war 2 themes, which are never as interesting as holmes himself. the film starts off as more of a thriller than a mystery flick; but once it gets going, it's hard to put down and this is a more than solid entry in universal's oeuvre.

i watched two very different holmes adventures this morning, but you would be amazed at the similarities.the was presumably the first collaboration between basil rathbone (if i were king, romeo and juliet) and nigel bruce, and director roy william neill. it was not their first sherlock holmes adventure, as they did one a couple of years before this.the made an excellent team, but i prefer the hammer version, which i will talk about later.holmes relies on a lot of disguises to do his work, and i am constantly amused by the mannerisms displayed when they figure something out. they always seem to dash on when they find a new clue.the story itself about keeping a bomb site from the germans in wwii was interesting and kept you focused on the mystery.

a brilliant sherlock holmes adventure starring the brilliant basil rathbone and nigel bruce. despite many other actors brilliantly playing holmes and watson and making a great job of it- rathbone and bruce will always be the best two.holmes takes a professor tobell from switzerland to london. tobell is wanted by the nazi's. he has a bomb sight that could win the second world war. his bomb-site has been split into four parts, each hidden in books. tobell agrees to give his bomb-site to the british government. on the night of his arrival, tobell goes to the house of his girlfriend. he has drawn some figures of men, if tobell was to disappear, the lady was to give the drawings to holmes. on his journey home he is attacked, but a policeman stops this and the attacker runs away. tobell is happy for the british government to use his bomb-site but refuses to give it to them, tobell wants to look after it. the bomb-site is split into four parts, each part completely useless without the other. he gives one part each of this bomb-site to one of his scientist friends. then holmes's greatest fear happens, tobell goes missing. holmes visits the young lady tobell was with the night he was attacked. she tells him about the drawings. the drawings have been stolen. she says only one man came in during the time tobell left, to fix the light-bulb. the man she describes is professor moriarty. he is working for the nazi's. seen as he has the drawings, holmes is done for. but he finds the writing pad he used and using science, he manages to see what tobell drew by looking at the next page on the pad. he sees it's code. he sees it's the name of four scientists. the first three he works out the code for, but he can't work out the fourth. the three scientists he has worked out have been murdered and the bomb-site has been taken. holmes can't work out the fourth scientist, but neither can moriarty. disguised as a sailor, holmes manages to get in moriarty's office. moriarty sees straight away it's holmes, puts him in a box and has him thrown in the sea. but watson and lestrade insist they search the box and find holmes in it. it's now obvious moriarty is at large. holmes manages to work out the fourth code, a frederick hoffner. holmes gets round to his house straight away and get hoffner and the decisive fourth part to safety. holmes now needs to get moriarty charged for working with the nazi's. he pretends to be hoffner. moriarty works out the fourth code and gets two men to go round and get hoffner. they take him back and he comes face to face with moriarty. meanwhile tobell is not in a good way, he has been tortured and tortured to get the name of the fourth scientist. moriarty has had it with holmes now, he has got him and his death must be a long one for holmes. the idea is to put him in his hospital, put a needle in his vein and watch him die of blood loss, drop by drop. watson runs in and saves the day though. moriarty gets away, but holmes was only careless enough to leave moriarty's trap door open. moriarty plunges sixty feet.so, moriarty dead. no. he makes his final outing in the film 'the woman in green' but in 'green' he is definitely dead, a suicide, he jumps off his roof. it was moriarty's second of three appearances in the rathbone series, a different actor playing him on each occasion. his first appearance in 'the adventures of sherlock holmes' was played by george zucco, his second in this film he was played by lionell atwill and henry daniels plays him in his final outing in 'the woman in green' the first three holmes films made by universal were set in the war as holmes triumphs over the nazi's. 'the voice of terror' was the first, then this film and then 'sherlock holmes in washington' then it was back to victorianish times, with definite relations to edwardian and georgian (george the fifth and sixth) times. this film had a close link to the sherlock holmes short story 'the dancing men' which can be found in 'the return of sherlock holmes' a great film, though obvious propaganda, it was a brilliant holmes outing.

it's one of the paradoxes of basil rathbone's wartime anti-nazi sherlock holmes films (voice of terror, sh in washington, and this one) that while the plots and settings are mostly terrible, he is so good in them. despite a bizarre wind-swept hairstyle meant to make him look younger, he blazes through every scene with so much bite and attack that you hardly register how flimsy the plots are. here he also has great acting rapport with lionel atwill, who makes a wonderfully repulsive professor moriarty -- a heavy lidded cockroach with nice hints of sadism and depravity (it may not have been acting, kids). at the climax, changed into a lab coat in order to drain rathbone's blood "drop by drop," he's as over-the-top sinister as seinfeld's arch-nemesis newman. the movie itself is ancient kiddie matin√©e fare, but it benefits from director roy william neill's attention to staging and atmosphere. it also looks fairly sharp in the dvd's ucla restoration -- don't even think of buying any other edition, all of them faded, choppy public-domain prints.

basil rathbone and nigel bruce as sherlock holmes and dr. watson respectively, the second of the universal series, where it's again established by means of a written prologue that the famed detective is legendary and spans time. this helps to comfortably set things up here in the "present" era of the early 1940's.in this offering, holmes goes through a few different disguises (with rathbone's very prominent features, is it likely that people really wouldn't recognize his true identity?) as he protects a physicist from the hands of the nazis as well as from holmes' greatest nemesis professor moriarty (now played by lionel atwill). the scientist has developed a bomb sight which will greatly aid in aerial bombardment, and he's promised his plans to the british. but moriarty wants to get hold of it so he can sell them to the nazis.a good entry boosted a bit by the participation of the properly villainous atwill now cast as moriarty (though george zucco was no slouch himself in the adventures of sherlock holmes). it's always intriguing watching holmes and his greatest enemy engaging in witty banter together ("the needle to the last, eh, holmes?").

beginning in 1942, the sherlock holmes character as portrayed by basil rathbone was set in the then 'modern' britain. many holmes purists have praised the first two entries in the series (produced by fox), but dismissed the 12 features that followed. i for one was never an avid reader, and thus i appreciate these films as they are without any initial bias. in fact, the setting of world war ii for this entry places it as a period piece with the british propaganda evident throughout the film. the execution of the modern holmes is handled with much more care than the previous entry (sherlock holmes and the voice of terror)and fares much better for two reasons. first, roy william neil is on hand to direct (and would be for the rest of the series), and second although holmes is pitted against the nazis, the inclusion of professor moriarty makes this feel more like a battle of the intellect between two rivals. lionel atwill's performance has been criticized by many as being far inferior to that of george zucco and henry daniel, but i feel as if its more the script than the character interpretation. especially after seeing that atwill was very capable of being much more diverse and enthusiastic in other horror roles. basil rathbone on the other hand is exceptional in this entry. he seems to be enjoying himself in the role of holmes, but for that i blame the writing. for example: the introduction of holmes in the voice of terror tries to hard to immediately establish how superbly intelligent holmes is as soon as he is on screen, whereas this film shows holmes' brilliant deductions, but also his shortcomings. even in the climax holmes initially has the upper hand, only to then have his blood slowly drained from his body. now there are a few flaws in this film i thought i might point out. first the opening; aren't the germans fooled a little too easily? maybe its just me, but the book seller just waltzes into the bar, says he's gonna get tobel to not only answer his door after weeks of hiding, but allow him to come in and then go for a walk with him? what!? second, tobel certainly seems to put everyone around him in danger. leaving the secret bomb parts with genius scientists. leaving the note with his fianc√©. like what was he thinking? he was endangering them all. i thought he was this superb scientist trying to save england? and isn't the whole concept of 'use it on them before they use it on us' a little harsh. obvious propaganda. third, just how in god's name was holmes supposed to fit in the bottom of that chest? its really small! in fact the entire execution of holmes finding moriarty in the ex-con disguise really doesn't explain itself that well. i have seen this film well over fifty times and there are still parts like this that i find are executed in a very confusing fashion. fourth, okay so holmes finds out the first three scientists are dead then immediately assumes that moriarty couldn't know the name of the fourth man because he wasn't dead yet. well if holmes didn't know the name then how could he assume that? the guy could very well have been face down in a lake. lucky guess. fifth, again with the confusion. when holmes is supposedly dying on moriarty's operating table, how can he recover so quickly? he sure was acting like he lost a few pints of blood, but not enough to stop him from saving the day. now despite these flaws this is a highly entertaining film. the disguises are well done, the mystery of the dancing men is well done (especially the back-to-back scenes of holmes and moriarty each figuring out they were over analyzing them) and dennis hoey as inspector lestrade is always a plus. and as a final note, the interrogation scene still kinda bothers me, i always thought that was one of the most well done sequences in the whole film. overall, this film holds a special place with me as it was the one that solidified my rathbone as holmes obsession. a classic. 7/10.

i liked this probably slightly more than terror by night though not enough to give it the extra *. the beginning is just brilliant, as we peek in on nazi agents scheming to get their hands on a new bomb sight and its inventor in a small swiss village, only to be foiled by a disguised holmes who spirits the scientist back to london. once there, he does everything he can to keep the scientist from falling into the hands of the man behind it all -- not hitler, but worse: holmes' arch-enemy moriarty. of course the scientist disappears, leaving a tantalizing coded note, and holmes goes in pursuit, once again in disguise. a climax in moriarty's dockside lair is suitably exciting, and we can all guess that all ends well, can't we? slightly over-the-top patriotic message as the credits roll. now that i think of it, the fine sense of place despite the obvious sets, rathbone's use of disguise and the way in which so much plot is crammed into just over an hour -- what the heck it gets that extra * and is my favorite of the 5 rathbone/bruce films i've seen to date.watched on dvd, part of the "50 mystery classics" set from mill creek entertainment. many of the transfers on these el cheapo box sets are of very poor quality, but holmes fans take note that the rathbone/bruce films (there are 4 on this set) are all quite watchable and reasonably sharp.

basil rathbone and nigel bruce return as sherlock holmes and dr. watson in this superior tale of holmes battling the 3rd reich and the mastermind genius of professor moriarty. the film opens up in switzerland as holmes is in disguise as an "old bookseller." he must bring dr. tobel and the tobel bomb site to england before the germans can kidnap tobel. holmes succeeds and the germans recuit the evil professor. moriarty manages to outwit scotland yard and lestrad "dennis hoey" by kidnapping tobel. the only clue left by tobel is a list of "dancing men." who will break the hidden code of dancing men, holmes or moriarty first? can holmes prevent the bomb site from falling into the german hands thereby saving england from the precision bombing techniques developed by tobel's bomb site? watch and enjoy.

the book "the railway children" is a children's book published in 1906 by edith nesbit, an early british socialist who had very strong views about the importance of family values for the upbringing of children, and the story it told was presumably intended to be contemporary. somewhat surprisingly, it seems to retain a significant appeal for today's children a hundred years later.a film adaptation of an edwardian classic children's story with the principal roles those of the children, does not sound very exciting to most film-goers in this day and age. but a really great performance by jenny agutter who (near the start of her long and distinguished acting career) played the part of the oldest girl roberta (bobby), combined with remarkable work by the script-writer and director lionel jeffries and outstanding photography by arthur ibbetson, have made this a film that is still not to be missed, and one which most of its viewers find quite memorable. it is remarkable that this book, set in the year 1905, was filmed five times between 1951 and 2000, (four of them by the bbc for british television), and all of these versions are not only still greatly admired but also very highly regarded (something that user comments on this database will confirm), even though this may seem almost inconceivable for a nostalgic period story designed to appeal primarily to children. since i have not seen the four bbc tv versions, these comments relate exclusively to the 1970 film version produced for showing in cinemas. unlike most films of children's books, 'the railway children' may appeal more to adults than to children. the structure of family life has changed so much in the last century that many children may feel totally lost by the way in which it is depicted in the film, whereas many older adults may find it has a considerable nostalgic appeal. perhaps compensating for this, the children featured in the film are full of life and vitality, whilst the adult characters although well rounded tend to mostly be 'stuffed shirts'. the story is a mature one, which deals with love, support and encouragement, it is not only timeless but capable of appealing to all ages. it can fairly be described as sentimental and more than a little idealised, but it is never in any way mawkish, and that rarely justified adjective 'uplifting' fits it like a glove.spoiler ahead.the film starts with its upper middle class edwardian family celebrating christmas in a comfortable and fairly spacious london home when two unexpected visitors call and take father (who is a senior government officer) away with them. mother has to move to a very small cottage alongside the railway in a remote part of yorkshire and the children gradually build a new life mainly associated with the railway and the few trains that pass. this life proves quite eventful in small ways and the elder daughter bobby grows up rapidly as she takes over more responsibilities from her mother. at one point she averts an accident to the train when her sharp eyes spot that a landslide has created a natural hazard. father's story is never given much emphasis, but he is never forgotten and it gradually becomes apparent that he is incarcerated and suspected of treason. finally these suspicions are cleared up (we are not told how or why) and he reappears unexpectedly at the local station to rejoin his family.for many years this film was not available in any home video format in north america, but anchor bay created a dvd from it three years ago, so they clearly recognised that this quite simple film has not yet lost its appeal. for anyone who has not got one already, i would very strongly recommend rushing out to buy a copy of this dvd whilst it is still available - you would be most unlikely to be disappointed unless you have become totally cynical, or your minimum requirements for a film include buckets of blood and/or intense sex scenes.

perhaps once in a generation a film comes along that is perfection. for me, "the railway children" is that film - a timeless classic that was directed and performed most beautifully. it depicts all that is worthwhile in humanity and climaxes in the conquest of love and faith over cruel injustice. every performance is a gem, though bobbie stands out and, like judy garland as dorothy before her, jenny agutter makes it impossible for us to imagine anyone else in the role.the world is all the better for this film and the children of today would be much the better for watching it.of course, like so many young men of my generation, i fell hopelessly in love with jenny agutter and her hold was as strong when i had the great good fortune to meet her a few days ago - the bewitching smile and voice like dripping honey were still there to send me weak at the knees as they first did all those years ago!

...apparently bernard cribbins ad libbed nearly all of his lines. if you can sit through the 'daddy! oh my daddy" bit without blubbing then you really need to get in touch with your inner child (trust me. i'm a 41 year old bloke).

this is a film that i love above all others. i try to revisit the main film locations in oakworth and oxenhope whenever i can, which help to re-establish those magical qualities that this film seems to embody so uniquely - recalling a gentler and more mannered age, with its unspoken assertions that people really do matter, that family life is not just another disposable, and that life really is worth living (though sometimes, we may doubt that). in short, a film that soon brings tears to my eyes, helped perhaps by the deeply evocative music - some tunes are jaunty (like the perks' tune, played on a trombone, sometimes with spoons), the stirring melody when the family first set off for yorkshire not knowing what lies ahead, and the haunting little tune played on a solo clarinet (or is it an oboe?) that precedes sudden child-felt changes in fortune.this is as much a film for adults as for children, appealing to the eternal child in us all - a key that effortlessly reactivates those deep and apparently long-lost values and feelings buried inside us, which are normally swept aside by the demands of modern everyday life. this is a film about basic human goodness and decency in which we the viewers are left to make of it what we will, and there are welcome touches of humour sometimes added for good measure, such as the arrival of the aunt or, on a more earthy level, the bedroom scene on perks' birthday - "all right bert - as it's your birthday!" i must know every scene, every line of this film, and yet so great is the magic that each time i watch, it is like i am opening a box of delights for the first time, savouring each moment - sometimes humorous, sometimes....well, very different. as peter says in the film: "it's perfect - more perfect than you know". and so it is!!!

the railway children is perhaps my favorite film of all time simply for the brilliant acting of the cast,the warm,humane interaction of the 3 children and the people they encounter living near the railway in the beautiful english countryside. jenny augutter is especially believable in her role as 'bobbie' the older sibling of her sister phyllis and brother peter.the adventures they discover and relationships formed in their new home and surrounding area are very real and fascinating.the scenery is lovely,the trains a part of britain's vast history and the soundtrack is very moving. this heartwarming film never fails to bring tears to my eyes,each and every time as well as makes me homesick.i often wonder if i should have been born in that era as i think i would have fitted in just fine as people treated each other with such chivalry and decency.in short i consider this film somewhat of a masterpiece and a must see for anyone who considers themselves a 'sensitive or caring type'.edith nesbit wrote this story around the beginning of the 1900's and what a wonderful story it is.more kids today need to read this or see the film instead of playing violent video games.if we had more films of this nature ,the world would become a better place.

this almost perfect cinematic rendition of edith nesbit's popular children's novel follows the lives of roberta (bobbie), phyllis, and peter, and their mother, after their father is unfairly accused of treason and sent to prison. they go to live in an almost uninhabitable house in the country which stands near a railway line ¬ñ mum writes stories to make enough money for food and candles, while the children spend much of their time around the railway station and, specifically, waving to one particular train to 'send their love to father'.always an involving and clever novel, the characters are here brought to life under the perceptive direction of lionel jeffries (better known as a fine character actor). jenny agutter plays bobbie, while sally thomsett and gary warren are her sister and brother. their mother is dinah sheridan, while the other memorable characters are played by bernard cribbins (perks the railway-man) and william mervyn (the old gentleman on the train).'the railway children' is gentle entertainment from another age, but does its job beautifully. as we watch bobbie grow up with the worries of an absent parent jostling against her own needs both to be alone and to have fun, we can only rejoice when events come together at the close of the picture. throughout we have a sense of time and place ¬ñ be it from the steam trains, the university paper chase, or the red flannelette petticoats worn by the girls (and used to avert disaster!).

this wonderful film has never failed to move me. the colour, convincing cast, and stunning scenery all make big contributions. this production, unlike the later remake by carlton, is more impressionistic, and presented more from the children's own perspective. it focusses on certain episodes from e. nesbit's charming story rather than trying to make a somewhat more documentary "warts-and-all" style that carlton adopts. above all, the superb musical score of the late johnny douglas underpins the story throughout, adding extra emotional depth. the net result is a truly formidable combination of sensory experiences that cumulatively present the poignant story of "the railway children".one uncomfortable factor for the viewer to ponder throughout this film is how things have changed since those times - and in many ways, for the worse! yes, maybe many of us no longer have to use outside toilets and travel in horse-drawn carts, but what about the quality of life in general? consider the foul-mouthed celebrities who now "grace" our tv screens. their language is now apparently considered perfectly acceptable. consider, too, the fragile "here today, gone tomorrow" aspects of so many of today's "partnerships" plus all the single mothers - whatever happened to that institution called "marriage", when people accepted each others' flaws but still remained together, loving their children? these details add extra piquancy when watching this marvellous film.i hope that, as generations pass, children will still be able to enjoy this film. not to mention certain adults!

i avoided this film as a boy because i thought it would be boring¬Öno fights or shooting, cops, robbers, cowboys or indians. it was definitely not a cool film to like. so i didn't see trc until i was in my twenties and found it one of the most beautiful, captivating films i have seen. all the actors deliver the characterisations perfectly and each emotion is drawn from the viewer scene by scene. the filming and direction are deceptively simple but feel so natural and drew me completely into the story. my two favourite scenes are bobbie's birthday party and the scene on the station platform near the end, directed and edited to perfection. the quality and phrasing of jenny agutter's voice when she calls: 'daddy! my daddy!' wrenches emotion from the viewer. tears are welling in my eyes as i think of it.this adaptation isn't just a movie it is a piece of precious art, as well as being the perfect example of what all film makers should be striving to achieve¬Öcreation of an emotional experience.

this covers just about every area of the creative process, and goes through the three stages chronologically, with the main focus squarely placed on the production. there are documentaries that go into more detail, and cover the other two groups better. this consists of artwork, behind-the-scenes footage, clips of the movie, and many interviews. with a running time that comes in at just over two hours the audience is entitled to a lot of information, given that this is nearly the same length that the film itself is. it could be argued that a lot of the time is spent on the people, with the craft and the result of their collaborative efforts coming in second. this is well-done, with tight editing. it gets into the technology some, and reveals how certain effects were achieved. this spends a lot of time on the physical training, in preparation for the fighting and such. you do get nice candid shots of the people, crew and actors alike. the ultimate matrix 10-disc set of this also holds nearly three hours of music, in a simple system, with individual track selection and a play all function, about 38 minutes worth of bts material in addition to the title itself, in various featurettes. the original release, however, has several very brief extras, including clips of the making of the sequels, a preview of the animatrix and yuen wo ping's blocking tapes(a complete run-through of a couple of the biggest martial arts sequences, with stunt performers and almost the exact cinematography, with the same shots and angles of those bits in the finished silver screen effort). the language is quite strong, but rather infrequent, nearly non-existent. i recommend either version of this to anyone who enjoys the concept, and/or wants to know about how they put the first one together. 7/10

long trailer? whoever said that has got to be joking. this has got to be one of the most in depth behind the scenes or making of documentary ever made. how can it be a trailer when several minutes are spent telling the audience how the movie was conceptualized and then brought to the studios? this documentary also spends lots and lots of time detailing how stunts were done and the new technologies created to achieve them. then it shows us how woo ping's team came up with the fight scenes along with blocking tapes that pretty much put to shame the actual scenes with the actors. there is stuff mentioned about matrix reloaded, but there's hardly anything really. if you are a real fan of the matrix, you have to see this documentary. the original documentary in the dvd is good, but incomplete compared to this one. for instance, it never explained why keanu wore a neck brace in the original documentary, but that is explained in revisited. the revisited dvd also shows carrie ann moss spraining her ankle during the lobby scene and being really distraught because she feels like she's letting the crew down. and that's just the tip of the iceberg. so ignore that "just a long trailer" review and go check it out for yourself. you won't regret it. casual matrix fans need not apply...

i am salivating for the sequels. i needed something to keep me from going insane with tension, anxiety (what if it isn't as good?!), and constant lack of information. i needed something to calm me a little, something to pass the time, other than, of course, the matrix. this was just the thing. i found it informative (like the part about keanu's neck...) and some of it was funny. i pitied carrie-anne soooo much when she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys. i found only one problem with it. given that 95% of the people there were as a matter of fact male, they just kinda let their mouths run wild, and there was language in it. it's not near as bad as the shawshank redemption's cussing runs, but that one scene were keanu is describing a bad day, plug your ears if you are little. >it was entertaining and was just what i needed. it is what all matrix fans who are going nuts need to keep them quiet. they mention a tiny bit about the sequels, and someone almost gives something away, but he catches himself in time (shoot!). it gives you almost no spoilers, but it is great to have if you are a matrix head like me. there is no spoon.

this is truly a kung fu classic. this film appears to have influenced martial arts films for decades. the spanish guitar background music, the competing schools, the impossibly high leaps onto the edges of rooftops, catching thrown spears, cheating in tournaments, the secret training for an exotic karate technique, themes of patience and perseverance, and more were copied by many later films such as "the karate kid" (1984), "hero" (2002), "kill bill volume 2" (2004), and "kung fu hustle" (2004).i feel lucky to have first seen this film in 1972, shortly after it was released, just before kung fu films became mainstream and before bruce lee became a household name. i saw it with two buddies of mine in a downtown san diego theater frequented by sailors, and although the scenes of the glowing red hands and gouged eyeballs got some laughs, clearly the audience was getting into it, as was our little group. it was a very memorable movie for me. decades later i could still recall several specific scenes, even after i had forgotten the film title. this film is extra special to me now because one of those two buddies with whom i first saw it (sailor kenneth lee hines of the kitty hawk) has since passed away, so this film serves as a memento of that day together before we took judo and karate lessons in subsequent years.relative to kung fu films, i'd rate this film as 10/10. but since i have to keep the larger film audience in mind, i'll more objectively rate it as 8/10, due to obvious technical flaws. i just recommend that neophyte viewers consider those technical flaws to be proof of its vintage nature and of its authenticity, and then merrily proceed to enjoy its testosterone-charged mayhem.

"five fingers of death" started the american kung-fu movie craze but i remember seeing it for the first time as "king boxer" in chinatown, nyc, without the bad dubbing and few americans. i also was fortunate enough to see the american premiere of "five fingers of death" on times square, nyc. what a contrast this turned out to be...same film but different audiences.in chinatown, this film took on a more serious tone to the viewers. it was because of hearing the real voices of the actors(in chinese) that made this movie more believable. chinatown theaters were showing violent kung fu films for years(1972's "boxer from shantung" beat them all in gore), so the action choreography & story were the main attraction. rival school plots were not overused yet so the storyline seemed fresh. every great kung fu film had wonderful, dastardly villains you wanted to see get their comeuppance and ffod had them too. the star, lieh lo, was a known actor in chinese theaters. the mostly chinese audience enjoyed this film immensely. the audience buzz while leaving this film gives the final satisfaction to me.on times square, this film was an action comedy...probably unintentionally. i enjoyed it here too but for different reasons. the crowd was ethnic and quite energetic. from the start, the movie made you laugh. as soon as the audience heard those strange british accents come from those chinese actors the movie turned into a violent and gory cartoon. most american audiences saw this kind of gore in a horror film not in an action film. the action sequences blew the audience away. unfortunately, the movie studios saw that they enjoyed it so much that, bad dubbing and unnecessary violence became a kung fu flick formula.i had fun seeing this movie with an american audience but enjoyed it much more in chinatown. some films can pass the test of time but the dubbed version of ffod can't. the original "king boxer" is still enjoyable...a classic!

the patriot is a well thought out, well produced film, that will draw the viewer into the story directly, and keep them involved to the very end. granted, it is not in the same vein as under siege, et. al., but this is definitely the trademark film of what might be described as seagal's second era of films. not so much action movies with a nod to a story thrown in for good measure, but a good story, matched with a point, and injected with some of seagal's unimitable action sequences. is this the kind of film that hardcore action junkies will enjoy? probably not. but for those of us who not only like our action, but also can appreciate a well told story, this is a big step forward for seagal. it's almost like the transformation clint eastwood made as he tried to step out from underneath the shadow of his "dirty harry" series. either man, had he continued in the singular direction they were headed, would have forever been keyholed in in specific role and guaranteed the brevity of their careers...

i really enjoyed the patriot. this movie had less violence and was based on a real life threat that could inevitably destroy our civilization. one line in the movie from wesley mclaren (seagal) stuck out in my mind to be very true of our society, "western medicine is in the practice of prolonging illness and i am in the business of curing it."

it seems that all people didn't like steven seagal: just take a look at his nomination list, there are only razzie awards nominations (with one win) for him, but i think he didn't earn anything of it. i saw good movies with steven seagal, i saw bad movies with steven seagal. and the patriot (1998) is one of his best movies, nearly as good as under siege (1992) or hard to kill (1990). the patriot shows his activities to protect nature. surely, this movie is not a great one, and i must say that there is more violence than i like, and why must seagal's best friend l. q. jones die the death of a victim? the role of dr. mcclaren is one of seagal's best performances. he has, as always, a very good charisma. and in summary, the patriot is good entertainment-and with an average rating of only 4 points the most underrated movie of all time.regards, hans-dieter

man, i think people have forgotten how to watch a movie. everyone thinks they're a critic. they comment on things that the average movie goer doesn't even know or think about.i enjoyed the film. it was what i was expecting therefore was not disappointed. steven gets a bad rap for putting his views into his films but that's also a reason to watch. what's even more funny is the people that complain about his films, say he's the worst and that we shouldn't watch his films, yet watch his movies anyway. all so they can comment on how bad they are. who's the dummy? if you don't like his work, don't watch it. then you won't have to subject yourself to this supposedly painful event.stop comparing movies to other movies and watch a movie on an individual basis and you may begin to enjoy films again.

basically, this is a very good film. it is very different from seagal's other films though, which unfortunately may turn off some of his fans. unlike some of the other films, this does not feel like a 'seagal vehicle'. you get to see plenty of the other characters as well and all of mr. seagal's actions are not the same as we've seen before. the concept of him being an 'intellectual' in something other than bombs and other weaponry is a nice change. although there are some unrealistic parts to the film (some more obvious than others), in general you can let them slide since the film is fun to watch.it boils down to this: if you are looking for a classic seagal action film, sorry, but you're going to be disappointed. watch it anyway for the fun of it. if you're open to seeing seagal without the action, it's well worth a look. i personally believe it is some of the best work he's done in quite a while.

many people are making fun out of steven seagals acting abilities. and i really see why if i remember fire down below. well...ok his other films are acceptable (regarding to his acting!). after reading reviews about the patriot i didn't expect anything from this film. i barely came through fire down below and i read a lot that the patriot was even worse. so i was really surprised about this one. in my opinion it is one of his very best movies. if it had have more action sequences and a couple more fighting scenes it would be the best. i liked the story the directing and the actors. cammilla belle was just incredible. she will have a great movie-career in the future. the few action scenes were very well made. and steven seagal was very believable in his unusual role.

of all the actresses in film today, kristin scott thomas would be my choice if i had to select one for stranding on a desert island.i could watch her simply, say, sitting in a chair for a couple of hours. so it's difficult for me to be objective completely with respect to one of her films.however, i did enjoy this movie and its story, per se, more than that indicated by the average ranking among the many persons previously commenting on this site.harrison ford is not one of the actors, though, whose performances i enjoy most. but he's one of a handful who have reached the level of moving from 7 figures to 8 per film, so who am i to argue?ford though is often droll in his acting style, and sometimes seems to be in serious need of an antacid and a shot of caffeine - and "random hearts" is in this grouping.his obsession in probing the losses, which both he and thomas have endured with regard to their linked spouses, is understandable, given his profession as a detective - but not to the level presented here. although not far, it crossed the line into the "annoying" category. however, most of the scenes after he and thomas became involved were interesting and well-played.this film could have been a 9*, but i'd lower it a couple of levels, based upon ford's overall performance, and and another, because it contained a bit more of the extraneous sub-plot elements than seemed required.

from the late sydney pollack comes a grown up love story about human nature,pain,passion and betrayal. police sergeant dutch van den broeck(harrison ford)is devastated when he learns his beloved wife has been killed in a plane crash,he's even more upset to learn of her affair with the husband of a famous congresswoman kay chandler(kristen scott thomas).he arranges to meet her and see if she knew or like he had no idea.they start to befriend each other then out of their mutual pain and distress begin an intense affair(which could be seen as healing for them both).however will the memories of the dead and pressures from their respective jobs drive them apart and cause more harm than good or can they escape the past?well you'll have to watch random hearts and find out.a moving and well acted film with a great cast.

random hearts is a very well directed, well scripted and perfectly cast actors for the primary roles. i found it to be so intense, that you have to stop and wonder in almost every scene harrison and kristin are together, how their characters deal with this horrible situation they find themselves in. very talented acting from both of them. a lot of people i believe who did not appreciate the movie for what it was, did not get the point of the movie or could not even fathom a situation like theirs.(please skip this next part if you have not seen the movie yet)i loved the ending, which was a great surprise which tied the whole movie. it was relieving to see how these two good persons can come out actually happier in the end.

i must be getting old because i was riveted to this movie from the first time i saw it. i'm watching it again right now on hbo. it's a very simple film about 2 people that fall in love after they found out that there spouses were having an affair. plot is very thin, but the actors acted very well in this movie. in the mix of kristen scott thomas running for congress and harrison ford being an internal affairs cop, these two meet, under unfortunate circumstances and fall in love. i love the soundtrack. perfect fit. one thing i can't figure out, this movie had a budget of $68 million dollars. were was it spent? the plane crash or harrison ford's salary?

random hearts snuck up on me. criticized for the implausibility of a) the premise and b) the pairing of an ia cop and a congresswoman, as well as for its slowness, the film felt just fine to me , and even ended up being surprisingly absorbing. i found my interest engaged as the film cut back and forth between ford's and thomas's lives as they first found out about, and dealt in very different ways in very different environments with, their spouses' deaths and the subsequent revelation that they were involved with other people. it could happen; two people's philandering spouses could be on the same plane, the plane could go down, the survivors could be brought together by the aftermath. so what if it's improbable? improbable is not the same as far-fetched. so..what if it did happen? why not speculate? ford's and thomas's performances are believable and nuanced. instead of finding their coupling implausible (opposite sides of the tracks--give me a break) i felt it driven by a grief and betrayal neither party knew how to deal with. the script does not bring them together too soon or too easily, and the end of the film does not resolve their relationship conventionally, either. where i find it unsatisfying is when the dialogue brings up interesting wrinkles in or insights into the ramifications of the situation, personal and professional, but never seems to pursue any of them very far. and if you make the mistake of thinking about it too hard, harrison ford does seem about 10 years too old for the part.for five and a half bucks at wal-mart, with full length director commentary and behind-the-scenes featurette, the dvd is well worth owning. i don't think i would pay $20 for it on a bet, but my wife might. ok, ten...

i admit i have been a fan of harrison ford for many, many years now so it didn't surprise me that i enjoyed his performance here. but i also enjoyed the way the storyline developed and thought the casting was well done. i don't know whether i "buy into" kristin scott thomas as a congresswoman but she is a fine actress and a beautiful woman. i took notice of her in the first mission impossible. although her part was small she stuck out on the screen.here her and ford play people whose spouses are killed in an airplane crash. they are seated together and this is where the plot takes off. apparently ford, a police detective in wash d.c., discovers that his wife was having an affair. he further discovers that the affair was with the husband of a new england congresswoman.the story takes on many subplots as ford and thomas find themselves drawn together by revelations of their marriages, the uncovering of deceipt, and the pure grief and anger over the loss of a loved one.i think the movie is worthwhile either renting or catching on cable.

true, there are some goofs, for the one who wants to find them. they're not important, though.the primary feature of this film is watching veteran expert actors do their craft. kristin scott thomas is beautiful and plays well the part of a strong woman, but one who has been hurt. same for harrison ford, who, for the ladies, is just as beau as kristin is belle for us guys.their hurt at the hands of their adulterous spouses brings them together in an awkward manner, but one in which they find support in each other. how they evoke their hurt feelings and their humanity within on th screen is why these are such sought performers. the viewer cannot help but feel what they feel, nor can one help wanting to cheer them when they're together.yes, there are several action scenes involving angry corrupt cops, but they only spice it up a little, and are not a significant part of the movie.for the lover of music, dave grusin provides a superb jazz based background, featuring trumpeter terrence blanchard. like the actors, grusin shows why he is one of the most sought musical consultants in the movie business. blanchard shows why he's one the premiere trumpeters on the scene.not a movie for the lovers of guts, blood, and gore. but for those who want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside, watch a beautiful english actress with big expressive blue eyes who can act, like harrison ford, to the endless soothing accompaniment courtesy of dave grusin and terrence blanchard, this is a move to watch with someone you love. preferably in bed.i thought it deserved at least an 8.

as a fan of history, mythology, and fantasy "mystic knights" show pulled me in from the get-go. it has semi-decent scripting, the costumes are fantastic (there are exceptions), it has pretty good acting, and the heroes and villains all play well off each other.scripts--half a script is pretty great, the other half falls flat, but its all mixed together, meaning many episodes turn out so-so. also, some of the key players are repeatedly being given dead lines (king conchobar and angus for instance) they need to be given something... more. i'm not sure what but the writers should be able to come up with something. acting--apart from some over acting by villagers (horrid lines they end up putting too much effort into), casting did extremely well in choosing their leads and so on. everyone, good and bad, works well together! costumes/weapons--the everyday clothes that everyone wears are spectacular! mystic knight armor that falls short are deirdre's and garrett's. a chainmail bikini would probably have better protection in her case... and wouldn't look as plastic; his looks like bunch of snap-it-together pieces of brown plastic, when it should look bronze. ivar's trident looks like it was bought at a discount store and while garretts weapons look cool, they also look plastic.recently "mystic knights" has taken on too many "power rangers" traits, if you watch the show, you'll know what i mean. as the series progresses, though, it should find its niche and perfect its style. overall, it is a wonderful show that all ages should enjoy (most of my friends and i watch it and we're all 20+). the plot thickens and twists, though it gets a bit juvenile in places, and everything just keeps getting more interesting. it might be of some interest to fans of the movie "willow" or the t.v. series "the adventures of sinbad". a lot of adventure, a dab of mystery, a dash of romance, a sprinkling of forces at nature... check it out! (my score: 7/10)

this show is a show that is great for adults and children to sit down together and watch. the stories are a little slow for adults but they are still good. there are lots of children in my family, boys and girls, and it is hard to get them all to agree on what to watch, but they always agree with each other when they want to watch the mystic knights. it is a wonderful show and i hope that they will continue to keep making it. all of the kids in my family and myself think that vincent walsh is the best of them all. we have seen that he has done lots of other work and think that he is doing a great job. we wish all of the actors, actresses, writers, directors, and producers the best of luck and would just like to say keep up the good work.

years ago, i didn't love and respect the films of jimmy cagney nearly as much as i do now. i noticed that many of cagney's films done with warner brothers in the 1930s lacked realism and his acting style was far from subtle. however, the more i watched these films, the more i found i was hooked despite these aspects. in fact, i now kind of like and expect them! fans of old time hollywood films probably understand what i am saying--teens and other young whippersnappers don't! well, when it comes to entertainment, the mayor of hell never lets up from start to finish. while the idea of a shady character like cagney played taking over running a reform school is ridiculous, and while all the changes he made also seemed far-fetched, it all somehow worked out and delivered solid entertainment.the gang of tough thugs were pre-dead end kids and instead of the likes of leo gorcey, huntz hall and billy hallop, similar roles are played here by frankie darrow and farina. yes, i did say "farina". this black actor was already famous for his roles in the our gang comedies and was, believe it or not, one of the highest paid child actors in hollywood. all he needed to give up in return was be named an insipid name and act like a nice stereotypical "negro". here, he actually was pretty good and the usual black stereotypes are a bit more subdued than usual. however, some will cringe at the very funny but horribly offensive court scene involving farina and his dad, fred 'snowflake' toones. with awful names like "farina" and "snowflake", don't say i didn't warn you.apart from this small complaint and a plot that is tough to believe, the film is exceptional and fun. the kids do a great job, as does cagney and dudley digges in a truly despicable but exciting role as the evil warden. also, as an added plus, you get to see perennial warner stock actor allen jenkins in his first role for the studio.

this is not a 'real' james cagney vehicle since his screen time is unusually slim. frankie darro plays tough kid jimmy smith, the leader of a gang of street thugs that is sent to reform school with a few of his hoodlum friends. cagney plays patsy gargan, a gang leader himself, who is given a token position as a deputy commissioner. when he finds out first hand of the brutal treatment dished out at the reform school, he is compelled to make some major changes with the help of the reformatory nurse(madge evans). the mayor of hell is fast paced and is still entertaining after all these years. the cast is well rounded featuring: dudley digges, arthur bryon, 'farina' hoskins, g. pat collins and allen jenkins.

frankie darro was a wonderful child actor who excelled at playing pugnacious little toughs with gigantic chips on their shoulders. he appeared in a couple of top films of the early 30s - "the public enemy" (1931), a ground breaking crime drama and "wild boys of the road" (1933), a topical depression era movie about kids who ride the rails. he was essentially a younger version of james cagney. although short of height, his willingness to do his own stunts kept him employed in a series of programmers when the bigger studios had no more use for him."crime school" was supposed to be a remake of "the mayor of hell" but it had far more humour in it and featured the dead end kids and humphrey bogart as a very laid back deputy commisssioner. "the mayor of hell" is really a combination of "hell's house"/"crime school"/ "boy's town". even though cagney didn't make his appearance until around the 25th minute his impact (as usual) was immediate. he plays a hot headed gangster who is on the payroll of a political group run by the mob.jimmy smith (frankie darro) and his gang (including "farina" from "our gang") run a car washing racket but bite off more than they can chew when they rob a general store and push the owner through a plate glass window. they appear before the juvenile court and are sentenced to go to the state reformatory. it is painted in glowing terms - a model school where boys are given a chance to learn a trade. in reality, it is a hellish place run by a sadistic warden, mr. thompson (outstandingly played by dudley digges). the only compassionate person is dorothy griffith, the live-in nurse (played by madge evans)."patsy" gargan (james cagney) has been given the job as the new deputy commissioner, as a favour. on his arrival at the school he witnesses a failed escape attempt and after talking to dorothy, realises the school needs sweeping reforms. he is soon running the school and brings in a system of "self government" - rather along the lines of "boy's town". even though cagney doesn't have a lot to do, the picture is carried along to it's gripping climax by the energy of darro. after "patsy" is temporarily out of the picture (he accidentally shoots a mobster and has to leave the state), thompson returns and his brutal treatment, resulting in the death of a boy ("skinny") turn the rest of the boys into an angry mob. they burn down a barn and thompson falls to his death - "patsy" returning just in time to quieten the mob with some sobering talk.sure, all the boys seemed to get was a stiff talking to for their crimes but i do disagree with one of the reviewers - thompson was more than just a "meanie". his sadistic treatment resulted in a boy's death. there is a scene at the beginning where the boys are served some inedible slop - thompson orders ham and eggs and keeps piling the butter on his bread while talking to dorothy. allan jenkins plays "uncle" mike and sheila terry, although billed only as "a blonde" has one of the most memorable lines when she pouts and says "i thought there was going to be young boys here, where are they?"!!!highly recommended.

"the mayor of hell" has the feel of an early dead end kids film, but with a much harder edge and very few light spots, preceding the first appearance of the dead enders by four years. james cagney has a full screen opening credit, even though technically, the 'mayor' of the movie's title is actually portrayed by frankie darro, one of several boys sent to reform school during the opening scenes. darro's character is jimmy smith, a young tough who's befriended by 'patsy' gargan (cagney), and is elected to the position when gargan takes a chance at humanizing conditions at a state reformatory.warner brothers made a lot of these types of films, attempting to provide a conscience of sorts in an era that only too well knew about the effects of crime and poverty. this movie is quite gritty, with no apologies for ethnic stereotyping, as in the submissive posture of a black father in court or the way a jewish kid gets to run a candy shop in the reform school. the rules at the reformatory are simple enough - work hard and keep your mouth shut; step out of line and you answer personally to warden thompson (dudley digges).cagney's role in the story seems somewhat ambiguous, since even though he makes a serious effort to improve conditions inside the reformatory, on the outside he's still nominally in control of a criminal racket. the film's attempt to juggle this dichotomy falls short in my estimation, the finale attempts to wrap things up in a neat package as gargan awaits the outcome of a near fatal shooting of one of his henchmen. not exactly the kind of role modeling one would look for in a film like this.warner brothers would sanitize some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake titled "crime school", featuring humphrey bogart in the cagney role, and billy halop in the frankie darro part. if you're partial to the dead end kids you'll probably like the latter film better, since it also offers familiar faces like leo gorcey, huntz hall, bobby jordan and gabriel dell. however the ending is somewhat muddied in that one too, with bogart's warden character involved in a cover up of a prison breakout. both films offer a romantic interest for the lead characters, in 'mayor', madge evans is a reform minded nurse that falls for cagney's character.curiously, a lot of james cagney's early films aren't commercially available, so you'll have to keep your eyes peeled for a screening on turner classics, or source the film from a private collector. personally, i can't get enough of this kind of stuff, and find intriguing points of interest in the films of all genres from the thirties and forties.

i bought this in the budget department last week. i had halloween and halloween ii already, and since i aim to collect every horror film ever, i chose this. after all, the 1st two were good.this film is pretty intelligent to tell the truth. it seems to create the correct atmosphere, and has a nice "history of michael myers". it uses the old locations from the original, and the main character is the kid whom laurie strode babysat that fateful halloween in 1978...the climax also is fairly satisfying. anyways, it is a lot better than h20, which frankly, is absolute crap.

this sequel is brilliant and is the last film donald pleasance (dr.loomis) worked on before his death. i loved the new direction the film took with the story instead of just michael myers wanting to kill his family. i love this whole series and apart from the first and second movies this is by far the best.
