i think this movie is underrated. to me it felt like a gulp of fresh air. some people complain about the implausibility of the plot, overlong sequences and lack of sex (the latter being, i believe, the main reason for "implausibility"; and how come there are no drunken teenagers talking dirty?!); but it's just not their thing, and good for them if they can't relate to the story. the performances are great; i'd really like to see more of the actors in other movies. the emotions are genuine. the whole unrequited love thing is presented with uncanny subtlety. and it does give you the tingly feeling you expect to get from a good movie.

this is a skillfully crafted piece of cinema that deals with a teenage boys confused sexuality.the cut scenes within can be lengthy but the cinematography is beautiful.this film would not appeal to many people, especially those who are queasy about gay teenage relationships, but the more open minded can sympathize with the puzzled protagonist.

about as hilarious as 50s british comedy can get, the belles of st trinian's has almost a gag a minute... and at 91 minutes makes for a terrific time. other films i equally recommend of the same period are the titfield thunderbolt and the green man. in fact any film with alistair sim or terry thomas, george cole, richard wattis or joyce grenfell or any combination is a delight. in st trinian's we get a double dose of sims playing two roles with that hilarious disdain he constantly lets ripple across his face. joyce grenfell as ruby gates (oh dear! that name!) plays her 'jolly hockey sticks' constable-incognito to hilarious perfection. possibly the best laughs come from george cole as flash harry (who comes out of a bush when whistled at) and various visits to classrooms by ms fritton (sims) reacting to explosions ('oh poor betty!") or science lab gin production ("just send a few bottles of that up to my room"'). every part of the film is funny from the characters, their costumes the antics and the setting. there were sequels but the first three are the best: including this one, blue murder at st trinian's and later in color the great st trinian's train robbery.
