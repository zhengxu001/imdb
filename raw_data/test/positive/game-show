the quintessential housewife and perfect mother, donna reed (as donna stone) could do it all. settle spats between the children or neighbors, take care of her hard-working pipe-smoking pediatrician husband, alex, and still have a stack of pancakes, three types of breakfast meat, and a tall glass of milk and oj ready for the kids every morning before breakfast.over the course of the past fifty years, we've lost sight of the idealistic stay-at-home mom, family meals together at the kitchen table, and preparing dinner for a hard-working husband when he comes home from work.i wish the show were available on dvd- i'd discontinue my cable altogether!

i just finished watching following and i thought it was great. i rated it 8 out of 10. i plan on watching it again with the director's commentary and then again in chronological order.i rented this movie because of my fascination of christopher nolan's more recent movie memento. following has some similarities; this movie was probably the blueprint for memento. even the music in some parts is very similar.shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel. the story and dialogue is really good. the performance of the actors is believable.christopher nolan made this movie on a really low budget. i look forward to his next release insomnia, a big budget movie with my favourite actor al pacino.

the title role of this western is played by robert walker, jr. he's a young gun who with partner david carradine gets separated after doing a contract hit on a mexican general. in eluding their pursuers carradine and walker become separated. walker comes upon the camp of lawman robert mitchum who takes a liking to walker and makes him a protégé and reclamation project of sorts.this is the first of two films robert mitchum did with writer/director burt kennedy. the second was the more humorous the good guys and the bad guys. not that young billy young does not have its moments of hilarity. but it is a tripartite story involving the walker reclamation, mitchum's hunt for the bad who killed his son and a romantic triangle involving mitchum, angie dickinson, and town boss jack kelly.the film abounds with nepotism. david carradine is john's son. dean martin's daughter deana is in this, walker is the son of robert walker and jennifer jones and mitchum's son chris plays mitchum's son in some silent flashbacks.robert mitchum got his start in westerns and always looks right at home in them. angie dickinson essentially repeats the role she had in rio bravo. walker had a brief career playing rebellious youths and doing a good job at it. i've often wondered what happened to him. he looks hauntingly like his father. maybe he didn't want to come to such a tragic early end like his father.and it that wasn't enough, mitchum fans get to hear old rumple eyes sing the title song at the beginning of the film.

if sicily is a territory of the baroque, with its doubling of perspective, that's part of this movie's challenge to realism. and it's an exuberant pleasure here, outdoing fellini with not one but three film directors, plus of course the actual bellocchio, who has made some really great movies and shouldn't be touchy about his honor. there is a variety of takes and casting improvisations on manzoni's "i promessi sposi" with, somewhere there, actual marriage. sicily is also taken to be a territory of skulduggery (you already know this version of the island, so there's no spoiler involved), a comic version of which makes the picture worth seeing for sergio castellito's work with guard dogs on the floor of the great hall of a palazzo.

there is something that one of the characters (the aging film director who pretends to be dead) says which may summarize all the film: "in italy it's the dead who rule". true! this is a country without a future, in the hands of old and jaded men. and bellocchio's cryptic portrait of the country, pivoted on the apparently senseless story of a director who has to film marriage parties to earn a living, manages to say a lot about what is not working here. but foreigners may miss the point, as it's not clearly expressed. i understand that australian or canadian people who watch this may get bored and wonder if there's a meaning--well, there's a meaning, but it's clear only to people who live here today, and keep their eyes wide open... like bellocchio. surely it's not one of his best films, and it's not as powerful as buongiorno, notte, but it's worth seeing... for italians who live in italy.

this film was a wonderful romp, intelligent, playful, mysterious, full of surprises, with humor in odd places and a tremendous energy. the famous film director (the protagonist) and the events he tries to manipulate through film all become entangled in fascinating ways as he is nearly out-maneuvered by a prince who has never heard of him. there are wonderfully rich images throughout and paths suggested but not followed (exactly what is going on with the somber wife of the pedestrian tourist wedding director?). the ending is so much the better for being untidy. realism and logic are not what you should be looking for here. if we are going to turn our weddings and our imaginative lives over to film directors, we should be prepared for a wild ride, this film seems to suggest.

this is the last episode of the goldenboy ova series. kentaro finds himself working in an animation studio, which is rather interesting if you don't know anything about the way anime studios were run. besides episode 3, this was probably the least risqué, but it had a nice girl interest, as well as a surprise reunion from others in the previous episodes. my only complaint about this episode is it seemed a little too short, but at the same time this may have only been because it was the only original script for the show that wasn't based on one of the manga chapters. but it ended well, leaving us with the nice feeling that kentaro is permanently 25, studying on. definitely watch the rest of the series all the way through, you can buy the whole series for like $17, you can watch it all the way through in about 2 1/2 hours, or watch your favorite episode if you have 20 minutes free time (which i do if i have a lunch break at school.) good series, check it out.

finally! other people who have actually seen this show! it is the funniest anime i have ever seen, but most people have even heard about it. it is just hilarious. 'and so kintaro will continue to ride his trusty bike and maybe one day, he will save the world....or maybe not'. tare just some classic bits in it 'and so he will ride onto the next city...because he has no choice since his brakes are broken (study study study)' and some of the lessons that he writes down in his little notebook, 'today i had a very educational experience. i tried to look backwards, but unfortunately i was already looking that way. it hurt. todays lesson, the human head cannot turn 360 degrees.'

this is one of those movies where i just want to move my feet and dance around the house. it's a very positive and happy type of music. the movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy. gary busey did a great job as buddy holly. buddy holly kept on going even tho his pastor, his parents and the nashville record producer told him no. buddy holly didn't give up on what he liked. i didn't know much about buddy holly until i watched this movie. i've been to the surf ballroom where he last played but didn't give much attention to it until i watched this movie. it's an incredible movie with lots of fun so get on your feet and see this movie.

"the buddy holly story" shows the famous singer's beginnings in the dunk lubbock, texas, to his rise to stardom, to his tragic death in a plane crash. strengthened by the fact that gary busey, as holly, plays his own instruments, this movie is the biopic in its purest form. there are some things that seem a little hackneyed, namely the people of lubbock considering rock 'n' roll to be the devil's music, but the masterful performances outweigh any weaknesses. if there's only one thing that's for certain in this great big world of ours, it's that buddy holly's music will never get stale. whether it's "that'll be the day", "peggy sue", or another one of his songs, they still sound great after all these years. he remains one of the greatest singers in history.just to show what lubbock really thought of their most famous son, they didn't name a street after him until 37 years after his death! what a bunch of ingrates!

the movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts. but it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the *feeling*.as keith richards remarks in paul mccartney's movie about holly, there's some buddy holly in almost all rock made since his day. the tragedy that took him is dealt with gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music.gary busey does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music. as a long-time holly fan and rocker, so do i.

i am 17, and a biased muppet fan, and while i love treasure island, christmas carol and great muppet caper, the muppet movie absolutely deserves to be up there with the best of them. it is enormously entertaining, thanks to the snappy script by jerry juhl, and the film looks lovely, with some beautifully staged musical numbers. speaking of the songs, i really liked them, sure they aren't the best song score out of the muppet franchise, but they were very nice to listen to, especially never before. never before is now one of my favourite muppet songs along with first time it happens and professional pirate. the muppets as usual were fantastic, particularly the always delightful miss piggy, and the chemistry between kermit and fozzie was great. and what a brilliant human cast- from bob hope to orson welles, from madeleine kahn(the same wonderful actress who brought us hilarious movies like what's up doc?, blazing saddles and clue) to cloris leachman, from steve martin to richard pryor, all of whom made memorable guest appearances, if careful not to overshadow the muppets in a fantastic film. 10/10 bethany cox

who doesn't remember the muppet movie???kermit the frog is now an american culture icon. what child doesn't appeal to this character?as the first actual muppet film, the movie simply called, the muppet movie did very well. kermit takes a hollywood agent's advice and goes out of his home swamp to respond to the ad. along the way he meets up with a pig, a bear, chickens a rock band and a few other quality puppets. watch for dozens of cameo appearances like madaline kahn, steve martian, richard pryor, mel brooks and several more. i grew up watching this movie and i loved it.

uzumaki, is a visually stunning film, and i don't think anyone is going to be able to argue that. but, unfortunately, the story somewhat falls flat.the film nevertheless is very entertaining. it uses it's wild style to tell a somewhat non-existant story. the film almost works, just based on it's characters and style, but in my opinion, leaves something to be desired.

i enjoyed this film very much. it effectively combines humor, fantasy, and a few moments of horror with a solid film making effort from higuchinsky. brilliant visuals and a very original story concerning spirals. my only complaints are that it had its dull moments and wasn't as daring as it could have been. still, i give this a solid 8 out of 10. the u.s. should take note of this and other fine japanese horror/fantasy films that have come along recently and have them available on region 1 dvd. actually, asian cinema in general, have some of the finest films that have been unnoticed by the american public because they're hard to find. i strongly recommend people to go look for these treasures, they're hard to find, but once you find them, you'll be glad you did.

this movie is ageless and would probably appeal to children today, even if there isn't a jedi in the entire thing. of course, elizabeth taylor was the most beautiful child in the world and her acting is great too. even mickey rooney is good; so are anne revere and angela lansbury. the world was a different place when this movie was released, and it certainly is a great place to visit.
