du rififi chez les hommes is a brilliant film which studies criminal minds and allows viewers to have a better understanding of criminals who are fundamentally not different from ordinary folks like us.what director jules dassin shows is that criminal do have families and they care a lot for them.that is why they adhere to a strict code of honor. for them a family is not only made up of wives,mistresses and children but also include casual acquaintances and close friends.contrary to what many might find it hard to believe,jules dassin has not tried to glorify crime in his film as rififi makes it clear that crime never pays.it shows that all kinds of bad activities result in some kind of human loss.apart from its philosophical stance rifif is worth watching for its technical finesse.while watching one of the film's most brilliant sequences about breaking of a safe,one would find it hard to believe meticulous precision with which criminal minds execute their plans.this is a scene which nobody has dared to copy in hollywood.

at first i didn't think that the performance by lauren ambrose was anything but flaky, but as her character developed the portrayal made more sense. amy madigan seemed too terse for her role and didn't really tie her daughter's characters together, even though it was apparent that her character was disengaged with the character played by lauren ambrose.christopher lloyd is a hit as usual and carried off his role to encourage the story line. his character development left the audience wondering why he was chastised by the younger characters and could have been accomplished more directly with the overwhelming glue to this somewhat vague story line was play by taylor roberts. her comprehensive delivery of a simplistic character held the movie together. in this pivotal role, taylor was able to encourage a realistic family relationship between the characters while acting as the antagonist for all of the other relationships in the film.

i was surprised to like this movie since i'm from the "check your brain at the door and have fun" school of film viewing. however, this film touched my heart. i have friends like mentally retarded emily. i have friends like unsocialized evie. and i've been in evie's shoes, chasing away opportunity out of fear and out of devotion to others.amy madigan's disappointment in her daughters was almost palpable on screen and the awkward moments where she tried to bridge the gap with evie were raw and painful to watch. and perhaps i am denser than most, but i never saw the twist with evie's father coming. usually i cotton on to those things rather quickly.my reservations are similar to others posted here. i thought christopher lloyd's wonderful, sympathetic character (a very different role for him, i thought) was underused. what happened to him once he realized what was going on with the poetry? would he, like james, try again??? second, the ending, such as it was, didn't seem to resolve or accomplish anything. i didn't expect the pieces to be picked up and all the ends tied neatly, but i felt that i was left at odds with the characters, that there was no real healing taking place here or any real efforts at healing being made.otherwise, exquisite and lyrical and disturbing and, for some, very, very true.

we have a character named evie. evie just wants to be a good person. she's nice, friendly, smiles often, but is strangely brutally honest. evie also has a secret. her idiot-savant sister has been reciting original poetry, which is getting the community excited about the sister writing. unfortunately, it's evie's poetry. while their mother starts being happy again and the boy next door shows his interest in evie, evie just tries to figure out what she really wants to do.what to keep in mind while watching this movie is who evie really is. for such a brutally honest person who doesn't mind telling ivy-league types that she doesn't respect them, it would seem odd that she would be able to pull off a lie. for someone so happy and cheerful, she's quite emotionless when it comes to certain issues. those aren't character flaws, they're plot development, and they mean a lot more than they at first seem.mostly this is something of a melodrama: a character lies, the other characters' personalities propel them through drama as relationships are held at risk. but in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold. the acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.the directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good. they're acceptable, and evie's world is wreathed in color and light, which makes for some very beautiful images, but it's not very consistent. it's not really so much of a flaw as a result of a low production value, but within that same value is some genuine storytelling and a real care for the characters. so while it isn't a perfect movie, it's certainly an enjoyable one.--polarisdib

i have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed with it, despite the lack of excitement in the plot. the acting was very good by everyone involved. amy madigan played the part of a guilt ridden mother who is tired, yet well intentioned and determined to make up for her younger daughter's condition. yet, in the process, she has neglected her older sister, who is more interested in playing with her savant-syndrome sibling and living in a world of escapism.the men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles. christopher lloyd, in a very understated role, shows us why he has such versatility. he plays a teacher who is dedicated to his profession and literature research, yet starved for a meaningful relationship. he and madigan connect very well in their scenes together, yet both know nothing more can come from their friendship. their wordless goodbye is nothing short of brilliant, an acting lesson for aspiring performers.and in a small role, fred savage is fun to watch.you can tell why this movie was based on a play, it's probably very good on stage. on screen, it's not particularly exciting, but it's nonetheless very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties.

true, this is not john sayles finest film (brother from another planet) but it is not entirely forgettable either, if not for any other reason than its message. like batman, wild thing's parents were murdered in front of him, leaving him to fend for himself in 'the zone,' a corrupt section of an unnamed city where greed and violence reign supreme. instead of falling in with the likes of chopper (robert davi) wild thing fights for justice, using his powers of tai chi and eerie cat impressions, occasionally lighting himself on fire. he becomes something of an urban legend, a modern day robin hood, and a hero for the ages. 1987 at its finest, wild thing lives

i think this movie is underrated. to me it felt like a gulp of fresh air. some people complain about the implausibility of the plot, overlong sequences and lack of sex (the latter being, i believe, the main reason for "implausibility"; and how come there are no drunken teenagers talking dirty?!); but it's just not their thing, and good for them if they can't relate to the story. the performances are great; i'd really like to see more of the actors in other movies. the emotions are genuine. the whole unrequited love thing is presented with uncanny subtlety. and it does give you the tingly feeling you expect to get from a good movie.

this is a skillfully crafted piece of cinema that deals with a teenage boys confused sexuality.the cut scenes within can be lengthy but the cinematography is beautiful.this film would not appeal to many people, especially those who are queasy about gay teenage relationships, but the more open minded can sympathize with the puzzled protagonist.

about as hilarious as 50s british comedy can get, the belles of st trinian's has almost a gag a minute... and at 91 minutes makes for a terrific time. other films i equally recommend of the same period are the titfield thunderbolt and the green man. in fact any film with alistair sim or terry thomas, george cole, richard wattis or joyce grenfell or any combination is a delight. in st trinian's we get a double dose of sims playing two roles with that hilarious disdain he constantly lets ripple across his face. joyce grenfell as ruby gates (oh dear! that name!) plays her 'jolly hockey sticks' constable-incognito to hilarious perfection. possibly the best laughs come from george cole as flash harry (who comes out of a bush when whistled at) and various visits to classrooms by ms fritton (sims) reacting to explosions ('oh poor betty!") or science lab gin production ("just send a few bottles of that up to my room"'). every part of the film is funny from the characters, their costumes the antics and the setting. there were sequels but the first three are the best: including this one, blue murder at st trinian's and later in color the great st trinian's train robbery.
