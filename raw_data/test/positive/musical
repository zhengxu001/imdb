i have never read sarah water's book. although i have not read the book, the 3 hour movie is very interesting. it begins with an interesting storyline with a twisted ending. i have to say these 2 actresses are amazing. sally hawkins is stunning successfully portrayed the character in love with her mistress and betrayed by her love. their romance slowly blossoms as they spend more and more time together. the love making scene is very tender and emotional, well acted. the end is quite intriguing and these 2 ended up together after all they have been thru, which is a bless. overall, it is a great movie to see, a very interesting plot with excellent performances.

after watching tipping the velvet by sarah waters i decided to watch fingersmith, the characters were just as good in both performances, though missing rachael stirling in the adaptation of fingersmith.the story line overall was of a good choice, the twisting and the unravelling of the characters were amazing! excellent watch only missing rachael stirling!if you do enjoy the romance of two girls this isn't one of the best films to watch. it takes on a different spin from tipping the velvet but just as good. would recommend it to everyone!

london 1862, a young orphan named susan trinder (sally hawkins) grows up amongst the petty thieves known as fingersmiths, under the guidance of mrs. suckerby (imelda staunton).one evening, richard "the gentleman" rivers (rupert evans) pays them a visit.rivers has an elaborate plan to defraud the wealthy heiress, maud lilly (elaine cassidy).susan agrees to help for a cut of the money, and is quickly installed as muad's maid.upon arriving, she discovers that maud is virtually a prisoner in her own house, as uncle chritopher (charles dance) controls every detail of her life.as the plan begins to unfold, susan finds herself developing an intimate relationship with the lady of the house.adapted from the novel by sarah waters.

the story was well plotted and interesting by itself. however, it is difficult for me to write the review of this film without spoiling you. to avoid that, i am not going to talking the story here.i regard this film as a good adaption of sarah water's book, as compared with the previous one "tipping the velvet". i read the book first and then watched the dvd later. the film did retain most of spirits of the main characters in the book. of course, due to the time limitation, the film in the last 30 min seemed to be in a rush to cover the part iii of the book. therefore, it couldn't illustrate well the scene when they all met in the the kitchen of mr. ibbs's place and those after that (even the book seemed to me to be a rush on that kitchen scene). despite that, the film actually did a good job in representing the story. it really worth watching. it's still unclear when bbc-america can broadcast this film. that's pity.ps: noticed that the ages of maud and sue were set to be 20-21 instead of 17-18 in the book; the latter is more reasonable while the former is more close to the ages of actresses.

i'm not exactly sure why i ordered "fingersmith" from netflix -- probably, because i enjoy bbc dramas, it was on a list of recommendations. i had no idea what i was about to see. the plot, which i will only describe in general so as not to spoil it for anyone who will see it after reading my review, has more twists and turns than a mountain road in the rockies, of the sort that customarily appear in "caper" movies. they are very unusual in a period drama. not having read the novel (and i do not intend to do so), i was totally unprepared for the surprise that ends the first segment on the dvd and equally surprised by the subsequent twists and turns. nonetheless, it is extremely well acted by the two young principals (by sally hawkins,in particular, as sue and by elaine cassidy as maud) and, in key supporting roles, by imelda staunton as the mother figure in a house of thieves and by charles dance as the rich uncle who collects pornographic materials and who rescues young maud from the mad house where her mother lived to be his secretary. the lesbian affair between maud and sue is the "big news" in the movie, but really not its centerpiece. the centerpiece is a plot to steal the fortune that maud is due on her 21st birthday. the turns and twists in the plot add tension, though not much credibility, to the movie. however, no viewer is likely to doubt that maud and sue will somehow end up together -- improbably -- as the credits roll. although one has been raised as a ady, and serves a collector of pornography, and the other is a pickpocket posing as a lady's maid, the author obviously means for them to live together in the end. it's a bit difficult to swallow, since each has conspired to cheat the other. despite these reservations, i liked movie well enough. it does not quite deserve the praise that others have lavished on it. the most fearsome and interesting scenes take place inside the madhouse where one of the two young women has been confined until she is able to escape and return to london to bring the story to its unexpected conclusion. sally hawkins (sue) is a very impressive young actress, able to convey her character's cascading and changing emotions with her facial expressions and her eyes. no doubt we'll see more of her. i certainly hope so.

wow! where to start?this adaptation of sarah waters' third novel is one of my all-time favorite movies!!!!!i'm not to big on fiction novels (seriously i never read fiction), but the book is just as fabulous as the film! or should i say the film is just as fabulous as the book?! i just love this story!!!!!anyway, i put off watching this three hour long film (2 part series on dvd, 3 part series on tv/book) for about a year and half. it simply did not look that interesting...boy was i so wrong! i became immediately immersed into the rich and suspenseful plot...utterly enthralled! just like the book, you cannot stop watching/reading. it grasps your attention for the entire 3 hours...and when it does end...you wish it hadn't.the story just flows so beautifully and you'll be wondering where the time went.the lesbian subplot was just icing on the cake! the parts i love most are the subtle facial expressions and glances/eye contact between the two characters. you really feel their desire for one another and yet they cannot act upon it.....until they must. may i point out that the "lesbian theme" is an important part of the film, obviously, at the heart of the film is a genuine unexpected love story, but it is most certainly not what the whole movie is about. for me that's what makes this story so unique and intriguing. i've never read or heard of anything like it. sarah waters is pure genius!the twists and turns it takes leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. seriously! my hands were clasped on to my couch with every surprising plot twist and i even yelled out several times ("oh my god! no way! that did not just happen! did it?")...i never do that!the only negative thing i have to say about this film is that i wish they'd added more from the book. but obviously having the adaptation be restricted by time they couldn't add everything that i would've liked. how awful it is though...i think i'm just being brutally selfish now...forgive me. the last 20 minutes does seem a little rushed. however, they put all the important bits in where even if you only watch the film and choose not to read the book you will be most satisfied with the outcome. the actors are just superb! brilliant even! sally hawkins (sue) and elaine cassidy (maud) have such great on screen chemistry they steam up your television set. simply electric! the emotions...the desperation...the struggle each of them feel is expressed seemingly effortless by these wonderfully talented actresses. rupert evans plays such a good bad guy as gentleman. i found myself seething every time he came on screen, but loving it because he's just so damn cute and somehow still charming even though you want to wring his neck. imelda staunton gives yet another fantastic performance as mrs. sucksby. she's such a warmhearted actress you cannot help but love her...even when the character she's playing isn't as delightful. everyone else in the cast were perfect! they really represented the characters well and were just as i imagined them to be after reading the book.this is a must see for any film buff! actually, anyone and everyone should see this movie and read the book! chances are you won't be disappointed!10/10 stars from me! there are only four other films i have given that same rating too. its very rare for me to actually enjoy a film so much that i give it 10/10. this is one of those films. fingersmith is truly a masterpiece!

bbc's 3 hour adaptation of the novel by sarah waters..."fingersmith". life is tough without money, especially in dickensian london. dark deeds lead to despicable dilemmas.is love really just a luxury for the rich and free ?? elaine cassidy as "maud lilly" and sally hawkins as "sue trinder" both give fantastic performances as the leading ladies asking this question ... of each other ...whilst rupert evans shines as the delightfully bad "gentleman".. with great support from imelda staunton's "mrs sucksby", david troughton's "mr ibbs" and charles dance's "uncle". the plot twists and turns and i wasn't sure i could be led to care about characters able to hurt and use each other in this way... but somehow.. i do care... and thats because of the quality of the performances... love feels like love .. hate feels like hate... betrayal .. confusion.. well hopefully you get the idea and hopefully you will get the dvd and enjoy.( elaine cassidy is just great in this.. gorgeous in fact.... i have to declare i am in her fan club... hi elaine : )

this movie is definitely one of the finest of its kind,. a victrion age story of love, and, grit. the depth of its story line is one that will stir the inner most emotions of love, and hate, with some very interesting twists, this is a must have movie for not only the lesbian audiences, but, for all viewers. i can't say much more or i will spoil the experience for a new, young audience who might just be coming out. another fine work for sarah waters. it also is a great way for sally hawkins to win over audiences who only get a brief glimpse of her talent in another sarah waters work, in "tipping the velvet".. it is also a must see..

the chemistry between sally hawkins and elaine cassidy was incredible. they were thoroughly convincing and genuinely likable in their roles. imelda staunton played the conniving mrs. sucksby brilliantly. despite the fact that she was a dastardly opportunist, she somehow managed to have you sympathizing with her in the end. rupert evans played the slime-ball gentleman with sheer charm and snark. he was a scene stealer. the story itself was very unique, as was the manner in which it was told. the victorian england setting featuring two lesbian lead characters was intriguing and delightful. there were some fantastic and unexpected twists and turns that really kept the audience engaged in the story. a wonderful cast and excellent story made this film superb.

historical drama is one of the areas where the british just can't be beat. so while i'm not a huge fan of the genre, i can usually be persuaded to watch something lite this if it's british and with decent actors.i have never read anything by sarah waters, which is of course something i should do. hence i didn't really know what to expect from this. i had heard that there would be a lesbian love story, but not much more. while watching it i found it to be a lot more interesting than i had anticipated. without saying too much the twists and turns of the plot are unexpected as well as well-crafted. although there were almost a twist too many somewhere, it took me a minute to get everything straight.production values are good, the actors are very solid and the pace is decent, although i found it to be a bit slow in the last half-hour. that might just be me though, i usually have a problem with movies dragging on after the plot is more or less finished. all in all though, this is a fairly enjoyable three hours. i recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas.

this tv adaptation of sarah waters' novel was so lovingly done i can hardly find the words to appreciate it. not since "tipping the velvet" (also highly recommended) have i seen such a performance by the lead actresses, this time by sally hawkins and elaine cassidy. they acted with their souls, and this is what gets across to the audience! the supporting actors were well chosen, too, they made a great ensemble.for those who think the story is just about a lesbian relationship - no, this is only one part. the other main theme is the betrayal of the person you love. and the plot has some further surprising twists. so the movie should be interesting for straight people or guys like me as well.

i never dreamed when i started watching this dvd that i would be totally mesmerized by it within minutes. the story was completely absorbing and entertaining. the acting was superb. the biggest surprise of all was how i would be so completely enchanted by the love these two young women radiated across the screen. their initial physical encounter for me was by far the most tender, romantic, delightful, vicariously enthralling love scenes i have ever witnessed on film. i literally stopped breathing. i could not believe the chemistry between the two actresses. with no nudity or graphic sex, they conveyed more passion and titillation than any american production could ever hope to evince. bravo to the author, the screenwriter, the director and the cast.

i watched this movie recently and fell in love with it. i loved the storyline and the actors. it has a little of everything. i was completely taken by the unfolding of the story. it has so many surprises along the way. i highly recommend it. in fact, i loved it so much that i ran out and bought the book. i felt i had to read it in order to appreciate the art in the writing behind the movie. i also wanted to make sure i didn't miss anything that was in the book but kept out of the movie. i recommend people who love the movie to read the book because there is enough difference in the book, especially in the second episode, to want to read it. it has become my favorite movie. i am now a sarah waters and elaine cassidy fan!!

this movie was incredible!!!! i did not know the back story on it so i needed to let it unfold before me on dvd. it had many twists and turns but still kept the story fresh and exciting. the acting by elaine cassidy was in a word brilliant as well as sally hawkins. the storyline is rich with plausible occurrences as well as fresh ideas from the present.there is truly something about ms. cassidy's eyes that leaves "a mark." this movie is a refreshing look on the way in which we look at the 'victorian times' and how we view that society. a very worthwhile watch.

it is always difficult to bring a 450 pages book down to a three hours film. i read the book before, and i found the bbc production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible. the qualities of the book haven't been lost: the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in london in the 1860s, the cold and obscene cruelty in which maud is brought up, the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking, the unexpected and surprising twists of the story, the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from sue's point of view then from maud's one. the main actors do very good, and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed, with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other, because they still love each other.for each of her books the author, sarah waters, has thoroughly investigated what life was like in british 19th century. while in tipping the velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, in affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits, in fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in london and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research. this is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth. i highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful victorian atmosphere, vivid emotions, and suspense.

this was indeed an amazing adaption. i missed the first episode so i unfortunately missed out on the bonding between the characters and the smooth flow of the storyline. but as soon i watched the second and then the third instalment i was just blown away. i ordered the dvd less than a week later and unable to wait for it to come i went straight out and brought the book. from the moment i opened it i was hooked, i just couldn't put it down. i decided to finish the whole book before i dare watch the dvd at all. i preferred the book because it got inside the characters minds, you could understand totally where they were coming from and what there role was within the story. they missed a lot out of the adaption which was disappointing as the book is a master piece and i think they could have done it superbly if they had been able to stretch it over a longer period of time. but considering only being able to be fitted into a 3 hour slot i think it was done excellent. it followed the main twisted storyline brilliantly. and the actors which were enrolled as the main characters where amazing! the love making scene was pure beautiful. it was so tender and loving and just showed how natural homosexual love can be. i was totally blown away with both the book and the tv adaption! i loved both of sarah waters previous novels and also found the tipping the velvet adaption quite enjoyable. but when i read and watched fingersmith i knew none of her previous novels/adaption could beat it. sarah waters has indeed exceeded herself this time! i recommend that you watch this adaption! if tipping the velvet wasn't your thing, then don't let it put you off this one. fingersmith is a whole new ball game. it is a beautiful yet dark twisted story about love, greed and betrayal...a must see!

i'm usually disappointed by what the media dubs "lesbian" movies these days: murderous bisexuals; psychotic murderous lesbians; women who experiment with other women, but end up with men at the end; ridiculously good-looking women who only get w/ each other to turn men on, etc.thankfully, fingersmith is on a very high pedestal above this garbage. it is a credible love story acted marvelously by every cast member, down to the least of the supporting actors. aside from having a very engaging central conflict, the romance between the heroines is well developed and believable thanks to cassidy and hawkins.i have also seen tipping the velvet, but fingersmith is far superior to the former, both in character/conflict development and the quality of the acting.fingersmith is both satisfying and enjoyable to watch, offering lesbians everywhere a great follow-up act to bound.

i had never read any of sarah waters' novels, or watched tipping the velvet. i only heard about fingersmith when i was flipping through "the l word" websites. the storyline of fingersmith interested me, yet i passed it away, thinking "lesbian in victorian period, that never ends well, i have enough of those lesbo series and movies that go no where"however, during christmas my local dvd store gave fingersmith a discount, i brought the dvd, and my life has never been more colourfulthis mini series deserves to be cherished and praised. the acting is so great that i call it rare. sally hawkins, elaine cassidy, rupert evans, imelda staunton, and many more that i can't name all, brought light and darkness to their characters. just by a little gesture, a little look, a little touch, they made their characters real and as a viewer, i couldn't help it but take them home, keep them close. fingersmith, sets in victorian area, is a story of sue-a thief who loves and lives with her "family" of pick-pockets. little did she know that her fate is linked to maud lily-a somewhat shy, timid girl grows up in a mansion miles and miles away. maud's mother left her a fortune, but maud herself can't touch it, unless she married. worst of all, maud's uncle makes sure she never will by keeping her prisoned in the house. enter mr gentlement, a charming, good-looking thief with a heart as bad as any. he wants maud's fortune for himself, and in order to do so he sets sue up as maud lily's maid, asking sue to persuade maud to elope with him. as time goes by, things would be simple, if sue didn't fall in love with maud. and things would be simple, if the story was what i have just told. i do not wish to spoil, so i would like to stop there. but i can asure you that everything is twisted and turned before you can even aware of what has happened. once it happened, you then question what would happen next. on top of that, the story is filled with passion unlike any others. there are no self-searching, sexuality questioning, "oh my god do i like girls" moments, because the girls in fingersmith are buried so deep in their own darkness that they barely be able to care. the story with such twisted plot moves as smooth as water, running passionately, but strangely calm. weeks have passed since i watched "fingersmith", yet maud's eyes still haunt me, and sue's words still warm my heart "you pearl, you pearl, you pearl", she said. and such pearl it is.

having read the book prior to watching this adaptation you would think that it would have lost some of its thrill. however, the story is so clever i could never tire of it. sally and elaine really put their hearts into their roles and brought out so much of the characters. i fell in love with the story and the women all over again.beautiful to watch thanks to direction, settings and costumery. despite the plot speed of television, i don't feel that anything important was lost in transit. it had me on the edge of my seat throughout with lots of wonderful stomach-trembling moments. enjoyed it thoroughly. this is the kind of television i have been waiting for.

i love sarah waters's fingersmith, and was worried about the tv adaptation as i'd been disappointed by the bbc's version of tipping the velvet (which although beautiful to look at was let down by keeley hawes not being able to sing, and rachael stirling not being able to act). fingersmith is a very tightly plotted novel with breath taking twists and turns and i wondered if this could be done justice to in just 3 hours.i needn't have worried. the adaptation was excellent, very little cut out, and went along at a cracking pace (although i did wonder whether if you hadn't read the book, would you miss things?). it had the look and feel of a bbc classic costume drama and i kept having to remind myself that this is a contemporary book.the acting was stellar. sally hawkins acting her heart out as sue trinder, and elaine cassidy, a slow burner, who by the end of the story was incandescent as maud lilley. the love, the passion, the realisation of the acts of betrayal both would have to perform, were written on their faces. it was a joy to watch.i hope rachael stirling was watching: that's how you play a sarah waters character!

having read all of sarah waters books i was eagerly looking forward to a bbc adaptation of fingersmith. especially since tipping the velvet had been done so well by old familiar andrew davies.i was not disappointed with the results, in fact i think this might be on a par with ttv; both romantic and entertaining. and not as so many ignorant people would have you believe, a pointless lesbian romp. having been a fan of elaine cassidy's since seeing her guileless turn in felicia's journey i thought she embodied both hard deception and a growing fragility as maud. her transformation was believable and impressive to watch. i recognised sally hawkins as zena blake from tipping the velvet, a small role primarily so i didn't have as many expectations but she was astounding in the role of sue trinder. her eyes were mesmerising conveying everything from rage to absolute despair. the two of them acting together, combining these talents made this drama unmissable. of course imelda staunton was amazing as usual, she is unmistakably a national treasure and the supporting cast were all of a high standard. even the direction from the fairly unknown aisling walsh used contrasting yet beautiful shades of blue for briar and brown for london.however as much praise must be given to ransley the script writer. to turn a 600 page book where every line is of the highest quality into a three hour extravaganza is a huge feat. he illuminated the main revelations at a steady pace whilst giving us plenty of back-story and character development at the same time. he has my full admiration.in conclusion, a brilliant adaptation where all involved gave 100% and making this one of the best bbc dramas i've seen.

haggard: the movie is the real life story of ryan dunn, and his girlfriend who cheated on him, also with the help from his two friend, 1. a skate boarder who lives for nothing, and, 2. a trying-to-be funny scientist (which doesn't really work) played by bam margera and brandom dicamillo.the film haggard the movie also has a lot of the characters from jackass, etc, but to say it was written by bam margera and co. this is a very weak attempt, seems to me like it was written when he was bored, or as a project with they did not pay a lot of attention to.the films also stars bam's girlfriend jennifer rivell, who plays glauren, ryan's girlfriend who basically cheated on him, again very bad acting by jennifer, another actor that some people may be interested in is steve a.k.a hellboy, played by rakeyohn, which his character does not seem to be with the story, again bad acting, also this character does not really have a lot of lines in this film which basically makes it very boring. but worst of all, is raab's character, the voice sound like a smoker who basically has throat cancer, also i think he could have been improved! overall i think the characters in this film aren't with the story, like in one scene, it would be on one certain character, a minute later, a different scene, different character.to say that this is supposed to be a film, sort of a documentary, its not played by the characters as a documentary, the acting makes you think that its a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare time.towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character ryan dunn, although a lot of the attention is on bam and brandon.in conclusion this film is ok, if you laugh at things that aren't very funny, stupid stunts, terrible acting and the occasional nude scene!, also i think there there are too many scenes of just no talking and just music! 7/10

alright, let me break it down for ya... haggard is probably one of the funniest pointless movies you'll ever see. it's got a mixture of a unique storyline about a guy having girl troubles and everything going backwards for him mixed in with countless humorous scenes that will keep you laughing throughout the whole movie, basically, if you've seen jackass or the cky series, you'd know what to expect for humor, considering it has most of the people from those movies. overall... i just had to give it a 10/10 because its one of my favorite movies of all time.~f0rs4k3n(p.s.) haggard rules!

i just bought this movie yesterday night, and i love it. everyone did great acting in it, especially ryan dunn and bam margera. the whole plot was great, and as dunn said in the extras on the dvd, they made it seem like he was reliving the whole thing all over again. this movie has made my number one spot in my favorite movies! i can't stop replaying scenes over and over again, just to see it again. i've never done that with any other movie. i would definitely recommend this to other people to watch, because it is such a great movie, and if you like bam margera, it's a perfect movie for you!! the little montages that they show in between every scene are just great. i think that those have to be my favorite parts of the movie. they are very sad, with mostly music from the band 'him,' which of course is my favorite band.

i bought this movie just to see bam because i was really loving him, but after seeing this i don't like him much. i mean, his acting was good and everything i guess, but whenever it showed the totally unnecessary skate scenes i was just saying to myself, "alright, we know you're a professional skateboarder, now can we get back to ryan dunn?" dunn, rake, and brandon really made the movie in my perspective.i noticed that jenn rivell, (obviously), and missy rothstein were both in haggard, but who bam was dating at the time? anyways, i actually enjoyed haggard and i think it's really like no other movie i've ever seen. it's sort of in it's own category.

while some of the things in haggard are dumb and unnecessary, the overall package is good. haggard follows ryan dunn and his friends valo (bam margera) and falcone (brandon dicamillo) trying to win back glauren (jenn rivell), ryan's ex. the story is followed and developed surprisingly well, it doesn't wonder off and become an episode of jackass or viva la bam, although it does have a side story which doesn't hurt the main story.and, for all the bam fan boys (and girls) there are multiple sequences of bam skateboarding, perhaps the weakest aspect of the film. phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances, even don vito got a bigger (but pointless) roll.if you are hoping to see a comedy and escape bam's craziness, then stay away from this movie, otherwise, enjoy the time you spend with it, if you can find it. there are some truly funny scenes in this film.

i have seen this movie, just once, and i'm looking forward to see it again and again. dear david (from beligium), why did you bother to write a comment on this movie? i only think we can think about you (after reading you comment), is that you're provably a non-sexual person (like erika in the movie), and you are not ready for the new cinema that is coming up. i guess you are a bit old, and sexual expression is not part of your "visage". the cannes film festival is by far the best movie festival, and i'm is my pleasure to say, that this film was awarded with: best actress, best actor and grand prix. isabelle huppert is magnificent, as always, who would do this movie like her? one of her best performances ever. the music is fantastic, and once more michael haneke puts reality in the big screen. it's like a dogma95 kind of movie, because of the topic. try to see it.

a milestone in cinematic history, 'bronenosets potyomkin' is one of the handful of great films out there that richly deserves to be called a classic. it was the picture that made sergei m. eisenstein a figurehead of film-making at the time. and today, it is still remembered as the wonderful piece of cinema it always has been.'potyomkin' is a film that needs to be seen as one entity, not to be picked at. don't just watch those clip shows where they only present the 'odessa steps' sequence and then move on to 'citizen kane' or 'the godfather', see it all in it's glorious 75-minute running time to really understand and enjoy it. don't expect every infinitesimal detail to be perfect though, i mean the acting of the '20s silent era makes 'scooby doo' look like a master of understated realism, certain plot points may seem illogical and some of the battle sequences look dated, but it is still an immensely enjoyable movie.the most memorable moments in the film are the mutiny on the battleship, vakulinchuk's body falling off the ship, the sailor under the tent at the end of the pier, the mother holding her dead child, the baby carriage on the odessa steps and the lion rising up to roar as further carnage ensues. for each new pair of eyes that look upon it, 'the battleship potemkin' comes alive once again.

battleship potemkin is a celluloid masterpiece. the direction ofeisenstein is truly a sight. the film chronicles a ship of disgruntledsailors who are tired of being mistreated by their superior officers.eventually, the sailors finally have enough of the abuse and send theofficers packing. during this time period, there was a shortage of filmstock in the soviet union. the goverment wanted to get their messageout to the people so they started a national film company and one ofthe members was sergei eisenstein. the films were shot on minisculebudgets and the shortage of film stock forced eisentein to be carefuland selective with the footage that he shot. in the end, eisenstein hadto reuse footage in order to make a feature length picture.the most famous of the action set pieces in this film is the muchtalked about massacre on the steps. this scene was spoofed in bananas and most recently in brian de palma's the untouchables. if you want tolearn film-making, i strongly advise you to watch battleship potemkin.it's one of the essentials.a+

quite a lot has been said about this film and its landmark importance in forming the language of film. if you are interested in film history, to truly understand the innovations eisenstein brings to the medium you might try viewing potemkin along side most any film made before it (those of d.w. griffith offer a good contrast). it should be allowed that eisenstein was not the only montage theorist and the principles of montage editing would likely have been discovered by another given time. however, even today, few directors have approached the skill with which eisenstein created meaning through the combination of images at such an early point in the evolution of the medium.if you are not interested in that sort of thing, potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made. you should see it, buy it, and tatoo it to your chest.

if you're a film student, or were one, or are thinking of becoming one, the name battleship potemkin has or will have a resonance. sergei eistenstein, like other silent-film pioneers like griffith (although eisenstein's innovations are not as commonplace as griffith's) and murnau, has had such an impact on the history of cinema it's of course taken for granted. the reason i bring up the film student part is because at some point, whether you'd like it or not, your film professor 9 times out of 10 will show the "odessa stairs" sequence of this film. it's hard to say if it's even the 'best' part of the film's several sequences dealing with the (at the time current) times of the russian revolution. but it does leave the most impact, and it can be seen in many films showcasing suspense, or just plain montage (the untouchables' climax comes to mind).montage, which was not just eistenstein's knack but also his life's blood early in his career, is often misused in the present cinema, or if not misused then in an improper context for the story. sometimes montage is used now as just another device to get from point a to point b. montage was something else for eisenstein; he was trying to communicate in the most direct way that he could the urgency, the passion(s), and the ultimate tragedies that were in the russian people at the time and place. even if one doesn't see all of eisenstein's narrative or traditional 'story' ideas to have much grounding (kubrick has said this), one can't deny the power of seeing the ships arriving at the harbor, the people on the stairs, and the soldiers coming at them every which way with guns. some may find it hard to believe this was done in the 20's; it has that power like the passion of joan of arc to over-pass its time and remain in importance if only in terms of technique and emotion.of course, one could go on for books (which have been written hundreds of times over, not the least of which by eisenstein himself). on the film in and of itself, battleship potemkin is really more like a dramatized newsreel than a specific story in a movie. the first segment is also one of the great sequences in film, as a mutiny is plotted against the captain and other head-ups of a certain ship. this is detailed almost in a manipulative way, but somehow extremely effective; montage is used here as well, but in spurts of energy that capture the eye. other times eisenstein is more content to just let the images speak for themselves, as the soldiers grow weary without food and water. he isn't one of those directors who will try to get all sides to the story; he is, of course, very much early 20th century russian, but he is nothing else but honest with how he sees his themes and style, and that is what wins over in the end.some may want to check it outside of film-school, as the 'stairs' sequence is like one of those landmarks of severe tragedy on film, displaying the ugly side of revolution. eisenstein may not be one of the more 'accessible' silent-film directors, but if montage, detail in the frame, non-actors, and bolshevik themes are your cup of tea, it's truly one of the must sees of a lifetime.

written by science fiction veterans gerry and sylvia anderson. this space fantasy is aptly directed by robert parrish. experienced american astronaut colonel glenn ross(roy thinnes)agrees to a manned flight to the far side of the sun. the mission is to be controlled by jason webb(patrick wymark)and his euro sec space agency scientist john kane(ian hendry)will accompany ross. the two will explore a newly discovered planet that is in the same identical orbit as earth...except it is always hidden on the other side of the sun. ross is the only one to make it back to earth and has a very incredible story to tell. special effects may be better than the story line. nonetheless fun to watch. the cast also includes: lynn loring, loni von friedl, george sewell and herbert lom.

this movie is a gem...an undiscovered gerry anderson classic.the origins of both "ufo" and "space 1999" are obvious from this movie, including the cast list which includes the late ed bishop and george sewell who both went onto "ufo".it is unfortunate that anderson, despite his many tv successes, did not get a chance to develop his talent on the big screen. just think what he could have done with the movie version of "thunderbirds" (which he quite rightly disowned himself from!).i'm sure if you give "jttfsots"/"doppleganger" a fair chance you'll appreciate it's good qualities.

this movie has been a favorite of mine and is entwined with the christmas holidays for me for two reasons: (1) growing up in the 1960s, everything was space-related from advertising to television programs and even santa claus found himself in spaceships during that era; and (2) i saw this movie during a christmas shopping trip when i was ten years old and it brought back fond memories of my favorite tv shows when i was even younger ("supercar", fireball xl5", and "stingray",). therefore, i am a tad biased when it comes to this movie for personal reasons.that said, as a long-time student of film, this is mainly a movie for fans of gerry anderson (and barry gray; oh, that gorgeous score!) whereas the casual movie-watcher will be put off by the future-vision-from-the-past (dig those wild cars, commercial aircraft, clothes, etc.) and the so-called "plot twist" which will cause some to groan. however, if you can look past the post-"2001: a space odyssey" desire to make a science fiction film with a "far out" story line, and if you enjoy imaginative special effects, then you will enjoy this gem from an era when man had just walked on the moon and people were still looking up at the stars in wonder and hope for the future rather than looking down at the banal trappings of the actual 21st century.

i'm a huge space buff, and at nearly 44, i've just discovered this flick for the first time. i came at it in a roundabout way from space 1999, then ufo. i went hunting for other anderson creations and found this was their first live-action work. what a home run! i actually heard about this movie many years ago, but never knew what it was called, so i'm happy to have found it by accident.these andersons were nothing short of amazing in their writing, the execution of the completely believable and realistic-looking models, the quality of acting, etc.i don't think it looks dated at all. let me tell you... i'll take good old models over the fake-looking cgi crap of today any time! seriously, most of the rocket scenes looked pretty real. they had it down to a science! if you choose to think of what you are looking at as real, it isn't hard to actually believe it.also, the amount of detail in set designs, the beautiful photography, the whole look... man, i wish i could go back to that time! they knew how to make great movies in the 60's. personally, i've lost all interest in hollywood movies today. anybody with a budget can do cgi. i hate it! bring back the models! think of all the people that style employed! anyway, i am ranting. :-) if you like good sci-fi that's very well-done, you will do yourself a service by watching this.

i first saw this in the 70s on syndicated tv and admired its production values, which were high tech for the time. the remastered video is rich and colorful, far more intense then the pale 35 mm tv prints. this movie deserves more attention: it paved the way for ufo, space: 1999 and even star wars with its detailed miniatures and cleverly conceived gadgets. sure, the story of an alternative anti-matter planet earth has been recycled a hundred times since star trek, but the beauty of this film is its self-conscious european flair for design: from the rolls royce space engines to the "euro sec" letterhead business paper, jfss or dopplegangers as it was called in europe is enjoyable for the imaginary vision of europe in space in the shadow of the superpowers. gerry and sylvia anderson's ambitious epic gets a little tedious when the american astronaut finally realizes that he is on the doppleganger earth, and everything is literally downhill after the poetically graceful shuttle boarding sequence. a mediocre story is helped along by a grand and lyrical classical score by the late great barry gray, the john williams of britain.

i have fond memories of watching this visually dazzling film as a child in the late 70s/early 80s on wor-tv (now upn-9) in ny. though a product of the swinging 60s, this film has hardly aged. the effects are just as wonderous as 2001, and in some ways superior (the model work is flawless). with an attractive cast, great color photography and set design, and an evocative score, jttfsots is a winner!

the movie takes place during the year 1940 and the french are about to loose the war.the movie includes all genres: comedy, romantic, murder and history. it is probable the historical part may be not as probable as the rest.it is not, however, a big laugh movie but the occasional large smile!

[minor spoilers follow]steve allen opined that topical humor about serious events might be found by many to be acceptable based on the formula: tragedy+time=comedy. 1939 before the german assault on poland was hardly a fun period and subsequent events, including the blitzkrieg (following the sitzkrieg) which took germany to the channel, resulted in the heroic evacuation at dunkirk and gave the world the sickening spectacle of a supine france prostrating its honor before the nazi conqueror.the stuff of romance, comedy and a big dollop of serious drama? yep. director jean-paul rappeneau, with a well-matched and outstanding cast, creates in "bon voyage" a pastiche of events and scenes from history and from imagination that is hugely entertaining.viviane denvers (the sloe-eyed and beautiful isabelle adjani) is france's top actress as war clouds gather over europe (what an overused cliche, sorry). a veteran self-venerating bedhopper with many affairs to her credit, her inner motivation seems to be "whatever is good for viviane is good for...viviane). following a premiere of her latest film after which a minister in the incompetent reynaud administration, jean-etienne beaufort (gerard depardieu in an unusual role for him), signals his interest in her, she goes home only to tiredly encounter an ex-lover who doesn't understand the word "no." she decisively resolves that issue but then frantically and histrionically enlists another former beau, the still besotted frederic (gregory derangere), to help deal with the mess in her flat. frederic is a novelist-in-expectation.a comic accident that once again highlights, almost as a public service message, the importance of working windshield wipers puts frederic in jail on most serious charges. fortunately the breakout of the germans from their static positions forces a wholesale transfer of prisoners to the south of france but our boy escapes, making his way there privately rather than as a ward of the state.the panic and fear in france as the germans swept to victory is well portrayed and a new twist enters the story. who should frederic encounter but the truly gorgeous young research assistant, camille (virginie ledoyen) who is accompanying the obligatory jewish refugee scientist, professor kopolski (jean-marc stehle). kopolski has some bottles of "heavy water" he needs to get to england. of course the germans musn't latch on to this vital ingredient for you know what (this part is pure fiction-there was never any heavy water in france in 1940-just perrier). and camille is so winsome as well as dedicated.what next? peter coyote as a supposed french journalist, alex winckler. be tipped off as to his name. he's really an officer in the abwehr (german military intelligence: a spy). and he used to bed viviane too (and wants a reprise of their affair). apparently the kind kopolski is the only major male character who doesn't want to have it off with the actress.what follows is a series of adventures and mishaps that are seamlessly integrated to produce a very fast-paced and enjoyable film. partly a tribute to and a bit of a spoof on "casablanca," this is is a remarkably funny movie (except for the heavy nazi bits).isabelle adjani deserves kudos for the best portrayal i've seen in years of an adorably cute total narcissist with few if any redeeming features. and depardieu, disloyal to reynauld and ready to jump ship and join the traitor, petain, is convincing as a man whose ardor for viviane exceeds his diluted sense of duty to the republic. as a human being in power at a critical moment in french history, beaufort is mundanely vile.not shown in too many theaters, "bon voyage" should be available for purchase or rental soon. see it!9/10

the most vivid portrait of small-town oddity i've seen in a long time -and i'm not just talking about australian films. this piece of work seems to have been made "under the radar" and really, it's an entirely fascinating piece of work, that has a worldliness mostly unseen in recent aust. film making.at times it is rather slow and strange - it seems to meander hither and thither not really sure if it's a thriller or a 'head-movie'. but the stunning aspect of the film by alex frayne is its iron fisted, ruthless direction. it never wavers, it is highly controlled, precise and absolutely self-assured. the cinematography is some of the most artful, beautiful and lyrical i've seen. the sound is all psychological, the music builds the tension.by the third act, the story is ramped up and episodes collide and converge - don't attempt to piece together the puzzle of the last 20 minutes, it's a bit of an impost - but by that time the film has you a bit of a trance, a sort of hypnosis, and you've been sold a riddle - that has no real answer.

talking about competition features at the split film festival, we have titles from all over the world. china, korea, canada, usa and australia and many of these stories are indicating that the world is really valley of tears. modern love...thats for sure. in that movie by alex frayne, two younger married people and their boy are traveling from town to the coast to visit the grave and house of the man's uncle who raised him a long time ago and who died in mysterious circumstances. the coastal village seems like something in an american horror film where the village is bizarre and people are uncommon mutants. but episodes in alex frayne's pastorella can't be described as horror in the normal way. in fact this is an extreme interesting drama where we are seeing relationships and horror through flashbacks and much more. in this story and through obviously psychological facets of the actors we are shown a peep show of film some charmingly eccentric australian film-making. thus is the the case of frayne. always something new and fresh. visual intelligence and unique sensibility of some australian directors is astonishing good. frayne's movie is super. there is something in the australian landscape that shows their movies so special as we have see in frayne's modern love and in ray lawrence movies lantana and jindabyne.it seems it will be the same in future titles of alex frayne.

i saw this on the accent underground release with the short films. i found the film at first boring and old fashioned and switched it off after the first hour - i was a little drunk and tired.i went to bed, and no kidding i had a nightmare about this film within half and hour of falling asleep. i couldn't stop thinking about why, so i got up, switched the tv back on, loaded the dvd and saw the rest of the movie.well done alex frayne sir, you've managed to implant your film into this old, cynical movie goers head, and that takes doing. so 10 out of 10 to you.i can't say i 'love' this film of yours, but it has made a lasting impact despite its flaws and low budget etc.

this is a great family film dealing with down to earth people who enjoy their local interests dealing mainly with horse racing. lloyd bourdelle, (walter matthau) is a farmer who also raises quarter horses and has a young son named casey bourdelle, who loves horses. lloyd is able to raise a full grown horse who he calls "casey's shadow" after his son and this horse breaks all speed records and is a possible winner of a million dollar race. sarah blue, ( alexis smith) becomes interested in this horse and offers to buy the horse for $500,00 dollars, however, this horse receives serious injuries to his legs and lloyd receives a serious set-back which upsets the entire family. walter matthau gave an outstanding performance and this is a great film to view and enjoy.

a wonderful family movie & a beautiful horse movie. 75+ %entertainment. casey, buddy, kelly marsh are very interesting and lovable characters. the horses are real beauties.has the horse racing as a backdrop for showing how luck is sometimes nothing but some good commonsense. shows how kids can do stupid things for stupid reasons. shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. the very realistically portrayed characters transform the unrealistic theme of the film into something everyone can relate to.andrew rubin puts in a wonderful performance as buddy,the sensible elder brother. somewhat reminded me of aidan quinn(eyes, speech delivery, facial appearance). casey makes you fall in love with the character because of the earnestness. sarah blue is also nicely portrayed by alexis smith. lloyd bourdelle, the father, is played by walter matthau and he is the character.though there is room for improvement in the movie, its a very enjoyable, feel-good movie.

walter matthau can always improve a mediocre film, and this movie proves it. he turns in a very realistic performance as a small-time horse trainer and single father, not sugar-coating either role.he can be, by turns, soft-hearted and doting, then iron-handed to his boys, and we can see the same dichotomy in his approach to horse training (we see that he doesn't want his young prospect racing horse overworked and hurt in small-time races, but he seems to be willing to risk the horse's life when he gets into the big time).this is just one of matthau's wonderful performances, and one that i highly recommend.

a good movie for horse enthusiasts and most others. it's a horse racing movie, and it's a "little man gets his chance" movie, and it's a "how far would you go?" movie. walter mattau once again proves his adaptability as an actor. he fits right in as lloyd bourdelle, a louisiana cajun horse bum. this movie gives you a rare screen glimpse of lousiana cajun horse drag racing. he has a young quarter horse who is a top racing prospect. "had nothing but a filling station and a good horse." the bourdelles seize the opportunity to make it big by taking the horse, shadow, to ruidoso, new mexico, to get ready to run in the all-american futurity. but how far will lloyd go to win the fame and fortune? also memorable from this movie are scenes of lloyd spitting tobacco juice and waiting for his truck to start.

there are too many people on this board who have obviously missed the subtle wit of this series. this show is great because it's a hilarious parody of itself. guys who are self-proclaimed studs are given a fair chance to convince us of their seduction abilities until they "hit the field" just to expose their complete lack of "game" on national tv  it's absolutely hilarious and the guys who are actually skilled are extremely compelling to watch as they effortlessly seduce the pretentious women that frequent these trendy nightclubs! it celebrates unique charisma when deserved and mocks delusional douchebags when deserved. either way, it's always entertaining because, unlike other dating shows, it perfectly captures the authentic awkwardness and excitement of a "pickup". i highly recommend this show to anyone with a sense of humor.

this has to be one of the best and most useful shows on tv. keys to the v.i.p. demonstrates some of the best seduction techniques and the humor that goes along with the techniques that are not up to par. to the person who wrote the negative comment, i only have one thing to say. stop hating on us because we are better looking and have more game then you. have you ever seen the inside of a club or do you just watch it on tv. and your so called female friend. she is not attracted to us because if guys like me saw her in the club, we would just walk right by and talk to the hot girls, like the ones on the show.stop hating watch keys to the v.i.p. and improve your game

i can't say this show is perfect. perhaps all the previous commenters remember the old tuesday 10:30 slot taken up by the childish humour of butch elvira curt ("there's a space shuttle humping a 747!"). oh the glory of scrambling to hit any button on the remote to make it change.face it, comedy can't pull a showcase and create the comedic genius of the truly canadian trailer park boys. but hey, they try.this show is by far one of the better original shows. however, none of the following will find themselves laughing at the apparent "players" who showcase their stupidity in picking up girls:a) "dumb" girls - obviously, they can't realise that they are just like the girls on the show. oblivious. jump on the man meat, you can call yourself a whore tomorrow and get his name. he looks good, he must be popular and nice. hahahaha!!! oh but you'd never do that! nobody would... if they knew it was happeningb) unsocial guys who think women like nice guys - obviously seeing these guys succeed at what you fail at or don't even get to experience is going to make your primal rages boil. watch more closely, they get shot down most of the time. they say stupid crap.c) girls with respect for one another - obviously seeing your separate distinctly female species get caught up in real world situations is wrong wrong wrong. nobody gets played. women are not objects, they can't be played, because they are all very faithful angels who are going to clubs to converse politely with one another without fear of guys trying to pick them up.oh wait... hmmmmmmmmas much as everybody will say that this show is not funny, and that it doesn't teach you anything, i have to take the opposite side. the show is very good at detailing the way relationships work for both men and women. the way they think, and the way they think each other think, and social hierarchy. its funny to see and hear the guys make absolutely idiotic comments to things the women say ("my grandfather died recently" "oh... well are we having fun tonight?").besides, its a club. the place people go to have fun, and get laid. no matter who you are, you're going to a club to get or give attention to someone. guys go there to test their game and pick up girls. girls go there to flirt with guys and find the one that sweeps her off her feet the best. lighten up!if you're a guy, learn a thing or two about different approaches and the different effects they have. if you're a girl, learn what these "studly" man whores really think like, and learn to tell them apart from genuine guys. next time you get broken up with by one of those douchewads, realise its not because of him, its because you're dumb and thought he was the greatest guy ever when he was quite clearly a dick to you the whole time

sure, it seems like there is only about 17 minutes of actual content in each episode, but it is certainly fun to watch. you might find yourself cringing in your chair as buddy sticks his foot in his mouth and gets shot down, or chuckling and shaking your head when some ridiculous line actually works. the panel of hosts have more of a good-natured, friendly (dare i say canadian) style of commentary compared with cutthroat us reality programming. i think the people who complain about this show don't get the joke. they are taking the show more seriously than the show takes itself. keys to the vip is a great caricature of reality shows, sports tv culture, and the club scene. i hope they do another season, and i'd be interested to see if a us version appears. it's certainly a fun, original premise.

this is a great show despite many negative user reviews. the aim of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh. two guys compete against each other to get a girl's phone number. simple. the fun in this show is watching the two males try to accomplish their goal. some appear to hate the show for various reasons, but i think, they misunderstood this as an "educational" show on how to pick up chicks. well it is not, it is a comedy show, and the whole point of it is to make you laugh, not teach you anything. if you didn't like the show, because it doesn't teach you anything, don't watch it. if you don't like the whole clubbing thing, don't watch it. if you don't like socializing don't watch it. this show is a comical show. if you down by watching others pick up girls, well its not making you laugh, so don't watch it. if you are so disappointed in yourself after watching this show and realizing that you don't have the ability to "pick-up" girls, there is no reason to hate the show, simply don't watch it!

the show itself basically reflects the typical nature of the average youth; partying and picking up chicks is the common weekend goal at the clubs. people frown upon the show due to its "perverted" idea of picking up girls using technique and strategic characterization, but truth be told, practically every young guy is out doing it at the club. overall, the show really appeals to the younger population, as we like to see the outcome of a "player's" performance at the club, as the show offers a comical approach made possible by the judging panel. 10/10; a cool, fun and thrilling series that allows the audience to really interact. good job boys.

the fact that reviewers feel very intensely negative towards the show is an interesting fact all its own. if you dislike it so much, don't watch it.certain reviewers assert that you have to be dumb, dim-witted, or plain old primitive to enjoy this show. au contraire, my friends. i am not claiming that all the contestants are smart. there are smart ones, and there are dumb ones. but i would argue that they probably have a higher average iq than the average reviewer on this website. thats right, i said it. there is a lot to be said for the science of seducing girls. i'm sorry, but please withdraw all sticks out of your asses, and realize the reason you hate these guys is that they threaten you.those oblivious to social sciences, and more specifically, the science behind mating are clearly going to miss the boat completely.one thing is clear: the clubs aren't the only places to meet girls. i personally think that the worthwhile women don't even go to clubs, so that they won't fall prey to men like the ones we see on the show. but what are men like these???? apart from the ones whose games stink, they are the epitome of men. they are men who meet women in the most difficult situations. these are men who take ownership of their own sexuality. these men don't beg for their girlfriends to not break up with them, and these men don't say "ok" to the phrase "let's just be friends". sound familiar???? in fact, these are the very guys you're afraid of when you take your special long term girlfriend to the club. we all are. these guys know what women like. (again, only the ones who have "game")and even the ones who are bad...they are worth a laugh! if you have gone out to a club, and actually interacted with the people around you, you should find this show entertaining. look, i am at a loss for why there is so much hate for this show. my best guess is that it aggravates the insecurity in men who have had bad experiences in clubs, or threatens men who believe women are beautiful self-less creatures who just want a nice guy to buy their attention.i personally love this show. it is pure entertainment, and best of all, its real. it is a very perceptive take on the most recent state of sexual psychology. sex roles have never been so different from before, and this show provides a very real view of that,i think it actually takes some intelligence to take away something positive from this show. this show appeals to a certain target market, and if you're outside of that, then i guess you shouldn't tune in to the show. we could say this about any other shows though, couldn't we?grow up,apollohelios

i'm sure all of the canadians on imdb are all too familiar with canadian content, and how much of it is... well, shall we say, lackluster. there are a select few canadian shows that are actually worth watching, however, this is definitely one of them.simple premise. two guys picking up girls in a bar with certain guidelines and rules, add in some witty and clever commentary from a group of surprisingly likable self-proclaimed "alpha males" and you have yourself some very entertaining programming. each episode is solid. if the "players" are sub-par, there are some awkward moments to be had, and there is some gentle fun poked at them. if the "players" are good, it leads to moments that you just have to stand up and applaud, and some comical praise lavished at them.the premise is kind of trashy, i know, and as a guy who usually takes pride in the fact that i'm elevated himself above typical, terrible reality television, it takes a lot for me to admit that this show is actually funny and enjoyable.one thing that must be pointed out is how the comedy network did a terrible job marketing this show. for the longest time, i didn't even know the premise, and all i knew was that there was somehow a shirtless guy who "loves cougars" involved. however, after actually watching the show, i was surprised by how surprisingly slick it looks for canadian content (despite a pretty lame opening credits sequence). so give it a chance. i have yet to find someone in the target demographic (18-30 year old males) who have actually watched the show (and not just the annoying commercials) who hasn't liked it.bring it back for a third season, comedy network. it actually has a good premise, as opposed to some other canadian shows you've had (cough*girls will be girls*cough). i usually reserve 10/10 ratings for "works of art," but i just have so much fun watching this show and i think that it has been unfairly judged my many, that i just had to.

this is a absolutely masterful stroke of genius by paul thomas anderson the writer/director of this movie. it really examines the pluses and minuses of the world of porn and consequences for your actions living in a world literally fueled by sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. only of the finest casts assembled with mark wahlberg, burt reynolds, heather graham, julianne moore, william h. macy, philip seymour hoffman, don cheadle, philip baker hall, and others.

"boogie nights" is a masterpiece it tells a great story with flair an great direction from a very talented director. this film features a cast which turn in outstanding performances. though the subject matter is very controversial but it is handled with great care by very talented people. this movie has an unexpected emotional impact also, you will remember it long after it is over.

what a movie! it has undeniably entertaining subject matter (unless you're a prude) and a mature, funny, and complex script from paul thomas anderson (magnolia, hard eight). pt anderson will undoubtably be around for some time. the evidence is here in this epic and ambitious masterpiece. every character is expertly played and touching and fully-shaped. from burt reynolds as jack horner (the director) to julianne moore (his movie-star) and mark whalberg (as dirk diggler) they all are fabulous. and the story? wow! honest look at business and failure and consequences and family. one of the best movies of all time! i give it a >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>a+

sometimes the academy doesn't recognize the potential of some films, or doesn't nominate them because they are controversial or strong. sometimes they are nominated, but don't win anything (i hope this doesn't happen this year with "american beauty"). this is exactly what happened with "boogie nights", which was the best film of 1997. the academy preferred to give the best picture oscar to "titanic", a purely commercial and hollow film, and other awards to the overrated "good will hunting" and the irritating "full monty". the other pictures which were nominated in the main category were "l.a. confidential" and "as good as it gets", great movies, but "boogie nights" is still better and should have been remembered in more categories.this amazing film tells the story of eddie adams (mark wahlberg, in a surprisingly great performance), a 17 year old barman who takes the attention of jack horner (burt reynolds, in a redeeming acting), a director of porn films. eddie has a special 'gift', and this helps him to get into the world of porn movies. he changes his name for dirk diggler and starts to make a huge success. but fame... doesn't last forever. other characters also have their parallel stories- amber waves (julianne moore, perfect), buck (don cheadle) and others, including rollergirl (heather graham), an actress who accepts to do anything, but she has to be wearing her roller shoes.what could have been a banal, trivial film, turns into a perfect, memorable one in the hands of paul thomas anderson. what makes "boogie nights" such a great film is its execution, added to a clever, well written screenplay, great soundtrack, etc. each character is very well developed, and each of them has his/her importance in the context. each feeling, weakness, fear, emotion is explored, resulting in a masterpiece of the modern american cinema."boogie nights" is a strong, impacting picture that should be seen by everyone who really likes cinema. under a plot that seems banal at first impression, there is a wonderful story of highs and downs, things that we face in our lives. it is an amazing portrait of the end of the '70s and the beginning of the '80s, exactly an age of highs and downs. that's what makes this film so special and a true masterpiece. 10/10

the three names that mean the most to this film are burt reynolds, mark wahlberg, and julianne moore. these three deliver the strongest performances, but the entire cast does a wonderful job. the film although about the porn industry does not let itself get out of hand with it's own sexual premise. on the other hand there were many scenes that involved drug use and although important to understanding the characters lifestyle, i think there was some overkill in this department. paul thomas anderson has not done a great deal of directing, but he may have been picked for this film based on his 1988 work "the dirk diggler story." one thing that was brilliantly portrayed is the family like atmosphere between the characters as they work, live, and party together. although not a typical family they certainly seem to care for each other. the wonderful soundtrack really helps give you a feel for the period during a time when disco was the rage. there are many disco favorites on it and some other wonderful songs as well.the story is about a gifted young man named eddie adams (wahlberg) that gets invited into the porn industry. he changes his name to dirk diggler and becomes and adult film star almost overnight. jack horner (reynolds) is the director that takes his films very seriously as he believes his work is more than just pornography, but that they are true art. however dirk becomes overly dependent on drugs and soon heads down a dangerous road where he stands to loose everything. although a greater focus is placed on the character dirk there are subplots for the other characters and their trials in life. you will find yourself wishing for and hoping their situations improve. all-in-all a well done film.

this is a classic that will be able to hold up with drama's to come simply because of the fact that it is shot with a 70's style and it's a story about the 70's. it is funny, action-filled, entertaining and sad at the same time. it has the effect to pull you into the lives of these poor folks and the consequences for their actions. 4 stars!

some time ago i saw this when hbo was showing it and from what i saw of it, it seemed like a good movie. so i'm in blockbuster today and i see it there with the dvd's and i decide what the hell. so i rent it. after i finished watching it i was in shock of how good it was.this movie just touched my heart. everything in it was so amazing. the stories, the actors, the dark humor, the music!!! oh don't get me started on the music in this film. pt andderson is one of the greats. definitely the best thing to come out since quentin tarantino(a god.)after i finished the first viewing i watched it again with anderson's commentary (i was suprised on how such a cool guy he is.)anybody who is interested in movies at all should watch this movie, if they haven't already. anderson is obviously a film lover. in the movie he rips off so many other directors tecniques. such as the pool scene with the camera following the girl through the water. obviously ripped off from "i am cuba." but i have no beef what so ever with that. the film is very respectable with it's ripoff's.i recomend this film to anybody who can deal with some of the content of the film(porn.)10/10

sometime ago i watched a video of paul thomas anderson in which he express the big interest that he has in porn films and how this industry could've produce better films and in consequence a complete genre and not just sex in video tape. paul thomas anderson put his own believes of porn industry in the character played in a terrific way by burt reynolds. his name is jack horner, a director whose biggest dream is to make a "real" film that can keep the viewer in suspense because of the great dramatic story and, at the same time, exciting with the beauty and with the "big cocks and tits". soon as he meets eddie adams (mark walhberg), he believes that he has found the new star for his films. and that's how the story of the young eddie in the porn industry begins.the film begins with a sequence inside a night club where we can see all the persons that will be part of eddie's life and later we can see them outside the porn industry, living their daily routine. but soon we can see them inside the porn industry and after only one party, the story of the new eddie begins, the story of dirk diggler. all of them will taste the real success with dirk as the main star, winning lots of prizes and helping jack to make real his biggest dream with a series of films about brock landers, the new character of dirk. this sort of exploitation films are an amazing success and for jack are his firsts "real" films. but here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the "horrible 80's" when there is going to be $ex, drugs and rock & roll for dirk and pals. but we all know that the excesses can destroy any person and the erectile dysfunction can destroy any porn star and here the film focuses in their lives after the total success and how everybody is having a real bad time with many problems due to society's bad look to porn industry and to a period with many excesses. in dirk's decadence, after trying and failing in the music industry, there's a brilliant sequence that can resume in a perfect way how the things are going for dirk and his friends. that sequence is the one of his first drug deal, with the appearance of alfred molina, which ends in a total mess. is funny for us and a terrible experience for dirk and pals but there's always a solution if you get back in what you know and when dirk is back, brock is back.well i haven't mention most of the characters in my sort of a summary but i must say that all are amazingly well developed. the cast is just superb with the best performance that i have seen of mark walhberg. julianne moore has a powerful performance in a really moving character; reilly, macy, hoffman, heather graham, guzman, etc are just memorable, all of their characters with funny and sad moments.finally, i really love the amazing cinematic style of anderson here with a unique view to the porn industry of the late 70's and early 80's. i used to say that "magnolia" was my favourite of anderson but right now, after watching all except "sidney", i can't say that i have a favourite because i love them all!ps: somewhere i read that this film is the "scorsese film" of anderson so i'm more than sure that if you love "goodfellas" and "casino" you will love this one too. i f*cking love "boogie nights"!

this picture's following will only grow as time goes by. better than any of the best picture nominees in 97 and it rewards repeated viewings. i've seen it three times now so i know. anderson was compared to some of the great american directors (altman, scorcese, tarantino) and he may have those influences but chances are, after a few more films, he'll be considered part of that short list himself.one last note: julianne moore's "amber waves" will resonate in the memory long after other 90's movie characters have faded. the best performance of the year -in any of the four categories.

altman and scorsese have twisted sex together in one of the greatest american films of the past 20 years. boogie nights didn't make a huge initial splash, and i still don't think it's received the credit it deserves. the immediate clamor surrounding the film ("some porn movie with marky mark") was wholly without merit. what paul thomas anderson has created is no less than a stunning representation of the pursuit and subsequent loss of the american dream (if such a thing still exists).for those of you who have been living in a box (or a confessional) for the past 8 years, boogie nights tells the literal rise-and-fall tale of young eddie adams (wahlberg). eddie is just a dopey kid from torrance, california who wants something more out of life. his room is soaked in muscle-bound, naive americana. his dreams are far bigger than his potential, but not quite as large as his...special gift. his bald-headed southern gent quickly raises the attention and eyebrows of the booming, omni-present adult film industry. jack horner (burt reynolds as the film's twinkle-eyed papa bear) gets wind of eddie's hidden talent and decides to put him in a movie.before you can say "deep-throat," eddie has changed his name to dirk diggler and exposed his massive member to a wide-eyed public. fame and fortune make dirk's acquaintance, as do a bevy of local porn celebs. his friends and co-workers become his makeshift family, but it soon proves to be a sunday picnic like no other. as the feel-good 70s give way to the coke-addled, video-friendly 80s, dirk & co. begin a dangerous backslide. anderson put everything he had into this glorious, moving epic. it sizzles and never fizzles. nary a frame of this monumental picture is wasted, and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after elo fades from the soundtrack. see this one immediately. and then watch it again.and again.

a small town kid working in a big city becomes a huge star and then spirals out of control. it shows you the rise to fame and then fall from fame and back to a little rise. great cast of actors, and a great director = a great, great movie called boogie nights.p.t anderson. an amazing director who made boogie nights amazing. from the moment the movie starts to the moment it ends you can feel how beautiful this movie is. some scenes are breathtaking, literally. a great story, a great movie. mark whalberg was fantastic, philip seymour hoffman was wonderful as he is in everything. thomas jane also was magnificent and although he only had a small part he played it to perfection. there is one scene in this movie i can't get over, "the drug deal gone bad scene" it was amazing, music acting and cinematography combined to make it amazing. i hadn't seen boogie nights and thank god i did, its so well rounded and i am now a huge fan of pta (paul thomas anderson).do whatever you have to do and watch this movie.

boogie nights was without a doubt the best film of 1997. i could watch this movie over and over and over and still love it. i'm in no rush to watch that overblown romance/disaster epic titanic again. the fact that boogie nights did not even receive a best picture nomination just goes to prove how predictable and narrow-minded the academy is. only atom egoyan's the sweet hereafter and robert zemeckis's contact came close to being as great as boogie nights. no other filmmaker in recent years has come even remotely close to making a film as good as tarantino's pulp fiction -- until now. paul thomas anderson rose to the challenge and succeeded. just as tarantino gave john travolta's career a kick, p.t. anderson has given burt reynolds the kick that his career needs. boogie nights will also undoubtedly make stars of don cheadle, heather graham, and john reilly. overall, a wonderful film. the best since pulp fiction. maybe even better.

'boogie nights' uses its protagonist, dirk diggler, as a metaphor for accumulated celebrities from a decade in america's shameful past, which was comprised of an unexpected rise in pornography, therefore resulting in an abundance of corrupted youth. its lead character borrows traits from a various assortment of genuine actors, involving himself in many illegal affairs that have been dabbled in by celebrities in hollywood, and all-too-often exploited by the press. it seems like the sort of tall tale that might appear on an e! true hollywood story special. drugs, sex and violence -- the american dream. but what goes up must come down, and the bigger it is, the harder it falls.dirk diggler's dreams are huge, as is another valuable asset on his body. dirk's real name is eddie adams, a californian who dreams of becoming a star. he believes that god gives one great talent to every individual on the planet, and his gift is a rather unusual one. after falling out with his mother, eddie leaves home and meets the sleazy jack horner (burt reynolds), an adult film director who offers him work. eddie eventually becomes a major porn star, representing the leading "actor" in most of horner's films. with newfound success, eddie is told that he needs to invent a new alias for himself, and so dirk diggler is born.eddie/dirk himself is primarily based on infamous porn star john holmes, whose life story was adapted in 2003 with 'wonderland', which starred val kilmer. 'boogie nights' is unarguably the better of the two, proving that movies about pornography can be made without disgusting its target audience: regular cinema-goers.the film takes place in 1977, an era of artistic pornography -- filmmakers truly believed that they could compensate for the low points of x-rated features by adding deep stories and mesmerizing atmosphere. in a way, the film's director -- paul thomas anderson -- implements a very artistic approach to the project, resulting in a gratuitous and artistic movie about a period in american history when smut was indeed both gratuitous and artistic. anderson's style is so deep, and so distinct, that we soon feel as if we are reliving the era first-hand. not a moment goes by where we are unconvinced of the time range dealt with in the film.all was not happy on the set of 'boogie nights'. prior to filming, anderson approached reynolds repeatedly, asking him many separate times to play the role of horner. eventually, reynolds agreed, but claimed that the film was horrible and the worst role of his career, publicly disowning it, before being nominated for a best supporting actor academy award and suddenly shutting up. a year before, anderson had suffered title disputes over sydney/hard eight. he preferred the latter title for his film, and new line cinema thought the former was more marketable. he essentially lost the battle, and anderson wisely avoided title disputes this time around by inserting the words "boogie nights" into his movie through the mouth of a character.the casting of the film is one of its finest aspects. the paul thomas anderson regulars are here, as well as a whole top-notch cast of first-timers. to name some of the more well-known stars: john c. reilly, phillip seymour hoffman, luis guzman, william h. macy, heather graham and julianne moore. but the entire movie essentially borders down to mark wahlberg, as eddie, who is surprisingly convincing in his role. wahlberg, previously known for his singing career and disappointing hollywood pursuits, has all the necessary traits to portray such a character. this is his best role to date.anderson knows how to captivate his audience and take complete control of every scene. when jack horner first meets eddie, anderson slyly uses stars in the backdrop, a sign of things to come, and hidden symbolism as finely acute as it can be. the opening scene is three minutes, a long tracking shot that follows jack and amber into a night club, where most of the characters are first introduced. it reminds me of the discussions regarding tracking shots in robert altman's 'the player' -- it works so brilliantly in boogie nights, and is the first indication that anderson knows what he is doing behind the camera. his style is fast-paced in the vein of martin scorsese, where shots zip around quite quickly but never seem rushed. incidentally, anderson references two classic scorsese shots -- the closing de niro mirror speech from 'raging bull' and the tracking nightclub scene from 'goodfellas'. anderson is a young, growing director who is remarkably mature in story and direction, despite his age. whereas his first feature film, 'hard eight', was noticeably wise and poignant, 'boogie nights' is even more so.'boogie nights' began as an effort of love on paul thomas anderson's account. having filmed the extraordinary hard eight in 1996, anderson's film is pragmatic to such an extreme that it almost seems genuine. boogie nights invigorates us with its gratuitous content, occasionally bordering on the verge of pornography, only it is far more sophisticated than such trash. it is a blazing, wonderful modern-day masterpiece that is as mind-numbingly explicit as it is wild and stylish. arguably anderson's best film and among the greatest -- and most important -- projects of the last decade.

everything that you need to know about the pornography of the late 70s and early 80s is all wrapped up in paul thomas anderson's boogie nights. although the film is completely fictional, it is actually supposedly based on the story of porno kingpin john holmes.in southern california in 1977, eddie adams (mark wahlberg) is working as a busboy in a nightclub. one of the regular customers is pornographer jack horner (burt reynolds) and two of his starlets, amber waves (julianne moore) and rollergirl (heather graham). jack and eddie meet and jack realizes that eddie is well...a little...gifted.so eddie stars in jack's films under the pseudonym of "dirk diggler." he becomes a "big" porno star (no pun intended) and seems to be on top of everything. then comes the 80s when video replaces film and jack's porno empire begins to collapse, along with dirk diggler and everybody else working in the field.boogie nights is a really well-filmed drama. there is a little bit of violence, but p.t. anderson makes it more stylized. and it kind of is a scathing approach to the degradations of pornography, especially when vhs became the standard medium for making pornos.a lot of bizarre and unique characters are introduced. william h. macy has an interesting role as someone working on the films, whose wife keeps having sex with everybody. i especially liked don cheadle's role as buck the stereo salesman. the best performance is boogie nights was definitely burt reynolds. a 90s classic!

what has to change in today's attitude towards films like boogie nights is the approach. the approach is awful! comparing it to pulp fiction, seeing only the pornography, and all its aspects.. come on people, there is more than that in this beautiful motion picture. and to all the sceptics, hasn't paul thomas anderson proved himself worthy time and time again? magnolia is one of the main reasons i watch american films at all and still have faith in this "industry" that film-making is today.. and what about there will be blood? that is a film that will stay in film history whether u like it or not! yeah, you! the so-called consumer.. you know something: f#*k you! you don't deserve this, you don't deserve anything. so many artists today struggle to get recognition and it has become increasingly difficult to make serious films, even mainstream, because people just wanna see celebrities doing stupid stuff.. like that sell-out britney spears.anyway, this was very painful for me to say because i don't want to see this, i don't wanna believe that today all it matters is the adding up of numbers.. sales revenue and sales return.. i want to see magic, the magic that fellini, bergman and kurosawa brought and created through the language of cinema.. because thats what pta is doing.. he is creating magic!!

i rented boogie nights last week and i could tell you, when i watched the film i had a blast. if you think that when you watch the film you will get sicked by the porn. i mean yes, if your not a porn person who can't bother being by it, than this isn't the film to see. but the thing is, the whole film isn't really about porn. well halfway through the film is about the porn industry but the other half is about the character development and the bad situations these characters go through. the actors played there roles perfect, especially mark wahlberg, john c. reilly, and william h. macy. the sex scenes, of course are terrific but mainly focus on the character's hype in porn films until there struggles. excellent film, one of the best! hedeen's outlook: 10/10 **** a+

the brilliance of this story delivers at least one skillfully crafted message to each viewer in the audience. this story is about success, it's about failure. it's about the choices you make in life and the choices others make for you. the story deals with self realization and determination on a scale so large, no camera angle could cover it. within the grasp of each scene is resides an element marked for depiction within your imagination. keep this in mind as you watch the movie; it's more than eye candy. the sexually suggestive, rarely explicit scenes serve only to distract and entertain you during the tedious process of character development.

boogie nights is one of the best films to come out of the 90's and i'd go so far as to say it should be in the imdb top 250. i can actually understand why many would dislike it, due to the subject matter. i personally feel however as many do, judging from the aclaim this film's received by viewers and critics that it's topnotch film making.the direction and acting in this film surpass good and reach the level of brilliance.there is not one scene in this movie that isn't amazing. the individual characters reach out and touch you. given that this is a movie about the porn industry, one wouldn't imagine the sex scenes could be handled with such sensitivity but they are. the direction is among the best i've ever seen-and i've seen a lot of films.the film isn't about one particular personal individual's story, it's about many.it's a character study about people who have many layers to them and who maybe in an industry most would find alien but who still dream the same dreams and have both bad and good to them. boogie nights draws you into their story from the beginning, and though the film is long(i believe almost 3 hours) you honestly don't even notice. and when it ends you kind of don't want it to....i'm not easy to impress, meaning there aren't many movies i'd give a 10 of 10 rating to but this is one. beyond the multiple character study, is the use of music in the film. i have never, in all my years of seeing movies seen music tell a story as well as in this movie.there was such flawlessness to it, you know it's not something your gonna see everyday.burt reynold's performance was perhaps the best i've ever seen him do, and mark wahlberg is incredible(i'm astounded there are still people saying he doesn't act well. i don't know how anyone viewing this could possibly think that)but the person who really surprised me was heather grahem(rollergirl) who is absolutely fantastic in her role, in particular the one memorable scene with burt reynolds in the limo, towards the end.again, i'll echo other imdb reviewers in saying this movie is not for everybody. but i still think this was topnotch.10 of 10.

boogie nights is full of surprises, nothing quite prepares one for it its soul. yes, it does have soul, whilst tackling the tackiest of subject matter, with both a wry smile and respect. brillantly cast and wonderful character development, the performances somehow combine the best of stage acting with improvisation within a cinema verite style.the plot proved richer than i expected and the underlying themes are teased out quite profoundly as each "b grade" human being is brought, through crisis, into perspective.a sociologist's dream case study, the film resonates the raw truth of what we all know about self-esteem, parental love and lack of it, attention/love deficit and its manifestation in adulthood, the desperate need to belong. something for everyone here.. almost camouflaged as issues of untouchables and their separate milieu but of course they are universal.the film works on a number of levels. the ironic loop is that the milieu portrayed exists only because of the voyeur, who happens to be watching the film...boogie nights is non judgmental of its subject matter and characters, a rarity. it deserves every accolade it has achieved and more.

one of the things that i like about pt anderson, is that he has the guts to take talent that most people push to the side or have pushed to the side and makes them stars. case in point, a washed-up... burt reynolds delivers a great performance in this film. and if proving adam sander can be a great actor (punch drunk love) wasn't enough... here comes mark whalburg... like you've never seen before.i think many people pass up "boogie nights" cause they are anti-porn, or just flat out hate the adult industry and can't overlook that aspect of this film. but underneath that is a great story about characters losing everything and battle to regain themselves. there is a beautiful film... and it's too bad that enough people see that.

this is not so much of a review as it is a testament that it has been proven, yet again, that the academy rewards money, not artistic accomplishment. and i must say i am saddened that this usually artistic and intelligent band of imbd members have left this off the top 250. boogie nights is powerful, raw, and gutsy through script, direction and acting. very few movies can claim this triple crown.

paul thomas anderson's stylish and compelling take on the 70s porn industry follows eddie adams, aka dirk diggler (mark wahlberg), through six years of sex, drugs and disco. his chance meeting with pornography director jack horner (burt reynolds) starts his career as one of the greatest adult actors of the time. dirk's character is based on real-life porn actor john holmes, who, like dirk, was renowned for being extremely "well-endowed". this is where dirk finds initial success.the main themes in boogie nights are the obvious ones relating to a film of this genre; pornography, drugs, sex, betrayal, violence and music. boogie nights deals with the pornography theme with some control. it is not overplayed and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal, but mentally explicit when they take place on screen.throughout the film cocaine is abused enormously, and the film's setting, los angeles 1977-1983, reflects the popularity of the drug at that time, which the film captures perfectly. however, boogie nights does not promote cocaine, as there are some scenes involving addiction and overdoses. for example at jack's party, they find a girl who has recently, and graphically, overdosed; blood pours from her nose and she begins an unconscious fit. the film, before this scenes, has been fairly upbeat and comic, but from this point it foreshadows the darkness that it will occur.the music scenes are executed brilliantly, from superbly-staged disco scenes to a down-and-out dirk singing terribly in his new music career. the soundtrack too is excellent, featuring tunes from the emotions, elo, the beach boys and the unforgettable sound experience. the standout scene in the whole film comes down to the music; dirk, redd rothchild (john c. reilly) and todd parker (thomas jane) visit drug dealer rahad jackson's (alfred molina) house in order to make some quick cash from selling phoney drugs, but night ranger's sister christian, which is playing in the background, increases the intensity of the scene incredibly, proving that music can bring so much more depth to a scene. boogie nights is filled with those kind of scenes, which makes the film even more fantastic.the standout performance in boogie nights is burt reynolds as the enigmatic, yet moody, film director. in the scene where he attacks a young guy for slating his movies, it is a complete shock for the audience, because before this point he has been pretty mellow and content. other notable performances are julianne moore, heather graham as the beautiful rollergirl, john c. reilly, and mark wahlberg, who delivers the performance of his career.boogie nights is also a surprisingly original film, using common themes but filmed in its own sharp and realistic way. anderson's approach has been fully captures these characters in a time when nothing seemed to be going wrong, or at least until the 80s arrive. from then on, things turn very dark indeed, and all signs of the recognisable characters and situations from the first part of the film have gone. this does not, however, reduce the high level of engaging entertainment that this film offers.boogie nights was not a box-office success, earning only £2 million at cinemas in the uk. but this is not the film's, or the director's concern. anderson recognises quality, not popularity, which is evident in his three other films, hard eight, magnolia and punch-drunk love. i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a simple parable filled with excellent and variable situations, because at the end of this film you will realize that boogie nights is a simple morality tale, but one which will stay in the mind days after you watch it. boogie nights is at once shocking, hilarious, devastating and both visually and audibly outstanding.

boogie nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples any would-be filmmaker should take a long hard look at. sure, you could spend loads of quality time reviewing the clasics from hitchcock to scorsese; but lets follow suit for the modern generation and study half-heartedly.where to begin, i suppose one could look at the film as simply a story, perhaps even docudrama which focuses on the late 1970's porn industry-and what an industry it was! the other half could focus on the incredible detail one brillant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and *ahem* rubber. but honestly, boogie nights brings back the pure, no-bul!shi$, in your face kind of cinema i haven't experienced since the film greats of the 1970's...ironic...or stroke of genius. the story is full of richly detailed characters, all of which you either can relate too, love, or hate; but the impact is clear-you are feeling something for them. among the characters the two performances which stand out are: burt reynolds as director jack horner, and mark wahlberg as eddie adams/dirk diggler. julianne moore is also brillant, as is heather graham...but if i focus on any one actor it would have to be john c. reilly. john's performance is a perfect balance of comedic timing and character driven emotion...i'm a sucker for the line "ever see the movie star wars?...people say i look like han solo." anyway, the look of the film is incredible, the director of photography and director/writer/producer, have come up with a vibrant colour, and flashy style that compares to martin scorsese, and stanley kubrick(in terms of his perfection of his craft); but with creating his own unique look, and pushing the edge with the longest single shot i'ver ever seen...that being the new year's party sequence.the music, like in any great film, is a character of its own. at times, it consumes oneself with sorrow or grief...but mainly its all about fun, dancing, and having a good time; the spirit of the 1970's. ok, back to the performances.burt reynolds plays the character of jack horner, a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of "film" means to his genre. the awful transition from shooting on film to recording on magnetic tape. the lose of his art, as it were...and the changes in mentality to the people he works with. walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocense and sexual bravado needed for the character. for all those individuals who have seen burton's planet of the apes, pay no attention to the performance of wahlberg in that film...rent boogie nights and see what a difference a good script can make!julianne moore plays the would-be mother to all, and with that comes the torment and anguish she feels, as life imitates art; and she loses all those close to her. heather graham is the eye-candy, but later holds her own, and steals some of the scenes from even the great mr. reynolds himself. each character is multidimensional, rich with life, and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the part.the film itself is often funny, tragic, exciting, and provides a uncompromising look into the turblulant lifestyle of the fast-pace 1970's. it makes no excuses, and tells no lies; and offers the audience a trip back. but even more importantly, the movie gives us a grand example of how films should be made; and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in film.

i've seen both movies and i saw without a doubt the re-make is the best, i know a lot of people would disagree those who have become fans of the original will most probably not like this re-make, but i thought it was well thought out and definitely scary, it was so good i'm going to see it again tonight, the original creeped me out because they kill the children, i mean who does that in movies anyway....but in this one the children have at least half a chance...the only bad part about this movie is when the babysitter (jill) walks towards the sounds she hears and runs outside into the bushes to check for someone, clearly no one in their right mind would do that whilst babysitting, so that is the only thing i found wrong with the movie, and even so they probably had to put that in there to build suspense, i don't want to give too much away for all those who have not seen it, i recommend you do instead of listening to all these people saying its crap and worse than the original, it would be a better movie for teenagers, as it displays things that most of us are scared of, but when i was in the movies there were at least 10 adults over the age of 70 in there watching it, and they enjoyed it, if they enjoyed it i think you will to! i give it a 9 out of 10!

i was skeptical before going to this because of the horribly assembled trailer which made it look like an equally horrible movie. i was nicely surprised by how much i did not waste my money. i believe the films success comes from how creepy it really is and how the environment of the house is. little things like the sensor lights create a true uneasy feeling. the shadows and ominously cold feeling of the house make it easy to tell that no matter how much you know horror films, anything could happen in the film. the acting is by no means perfect, nor were they bad. the main character is convincing even given the annoying teen dramas that surround her. in the end, i was thoroughly impressed with the film in most aspects.it is definitely a film i would recommend.

i would be interested to hear from the director, barbet schroeder, as to why he decided to make more his first film, and more specifically what his interest in hippies- or rather this form of the euro-hippie paradise- and about their demise. the film is, at least, true enough to keep one interested, but in its own kind of truth it's strange, biased. it's a given heroin (aka, "horse") is awful stuff, rotten, the conclusion for many a dumb-headed drug user that sees that as the be-all-end-all, because it basically is: after that everything else stops, that becomes the life, and it's either a continuous run for more of the same or death. more starts off as something concerning a romance between a new york girl and a german man, but it becomes something else, for better or worse (sometimes both in the same scene).it's basically about two "young" people, estelle and stefan, who meet in a city where stefan has come as a sort of wanderer away from his home country. she's wandering too, sort of, and is maybe too friendly with a big-time pusher named wolf. they end up on a remote island somewhere nearby and, after a somewhat daring grab for some "horse" by estelle, they also find a pad in the form of a seemingly remoter house along the seashore. schroeder's comment on youth and sex and drugs isn't too simplistic, which makes the film actually lucid and intelligent so many years later. it's both direct and subtle, more about the characters and then about the fact that what he's depicting could in other hands just be a propagandistic hippie-exploitation picture. perhaps most pleasantly, and this is just a guess, schroeder uses as inspiration the sort of long sequence from bergman's summer with monika: two kids in an inexorable connection, some good some definitely not so good, set against (too?) perfectly shot landscapes.on the one hand, i should mention that there are problems, some big ones in fact. the performances aren't very convincing throughout; a few scenes strike some power or have the actors in a good connection with one another, but klaus grumberg overplays himself even if he is an ornery german by nature (in that case i would've preferred klaus kinski in the part to make it crazier but deep enough for the subject matter) as does farmer to her own degree. and there's gaps of naiveté in the screenplay that keep it from being as deep as it really thinks it is. on the other hand, there are two big things going for it: nestor almendros, the great cinematographer (i.e. days of heaven) is dp and is a big boost for a first time director like schroeder. nearly every image is seen with an awesome purpose or artistry, be it a shot of the cliffs by the sea or sun or something as simple as the seemingly natural light of a room.the other thing is pink floyd, probably the main reason i and many others have heard of the film in the first place (years before i knew really who schroeder was i saw the "more" soundtrack whenever i looked up pink floyd albums). it's very good music throughout, occasionally the mind-blowing variety that gives them the reputation they deserve. some of it, too, is a little tedious, even as it is a movie that concerns free love and lots of drugs and sometimes both at the same time. i wouldn't rank it anywhere near as high as a meddle or animals, certainly not dark side, but it too helps to elevate the subject matter another notch, particularly when one least expects it or in low tones or floating in and out of buildings as stefan or other walks on the streets. it's almost better atmosphere than the movie itself deserves, but overall more is still worth watching as a period piece- dated, but potent, like a less ambitious but more substantial zabriskie point.

a german freshman, stefan hitch hikes to paris during summer break were he falls for a mysterious young woman he meets in the paris freak scene. he then follows her in the famous isle of ibiza, the hippie joint were meets wolf, a man who throws hitler-jugend knives, owns bars and hotels and keeps estelle under his thumb with dope. the couple tries to escape wolf, stefan gets hooked with dope and jealousy for estelle, who's groovy and a free spirit. great photography and music, plot is quite usual for the period but it's not an exploitation kind of movie, cold and dramatic. the moral is quite strong (he was looking for the sun...) but i would not say it's a film against drugs even it puts enphasy on drug use.

"more", maybe, is mostly remembered for the excellent soundtrack composed by pink floyd -in 1969 they weren't superstars yet. actually they made an album with the film music, no fan can miss it!but this is also the first film of german-french director barbet schroeder: it's a cult movie. when it was released, censorship everywhere cut several scenes of sex and drugs. it is also one of the first films to treat explicitly the theme of drug slavery.a german boy travels to paris and meets an american girl: they fall in love. together they search for sun and exoticism. but it's a too high price love: she initiates him into drugs.in the sixties anti-drug campaigns were not like today, there wasn't much information. on the contrary, in many milieus taking drugs was a sort of spiritual experience... so it's quite surprising to see a film of that period which describes a nightmarish heroin experience.the film is simple, not vulgar at all and shot in a "cinema-verité" style. actors mimsy farmer and klaus grünberg are very convincing. "more" is a document of the end of the sixties -and a document of the end of the hippies illusions as well.

like most people, i was interested in "more" solely because of the pink floyd soundtrack, which has turned out to be the only pink floyd album that i still listen to after all these years. it was quite a surprise to run across the film in a local video store, in a digitally remastered version. it was an even bigger surprise to find that it is a pretty good movie.visually it is quite beautiful, especially when the two main characters are cavorting on the rocks on the spanish island of ibiza. and the use of the soundtrack music, which as far as i can tell is exclusively by pink floyd, is excellent. it was a joy to watch the film with my copy of the album alongside me, mentally ticking off each track as it was used in the film. dave gilmour's brief "a spanish piece" was the only one i didn't hear, and several tracks are used quite prominently, especially "cymbaline," "main theme," and "quicksilver." that latter track is tedious on the soundtrack album but works very well during the title sequence of the film, resurfacing at least once later on. maybe now i can appreciate it on the album, now that i have some visuals to accompany it in my mind.the plot of "more" is a little hard to take at times, especially in the early going, when the film appears to be merely a vehicle to demonstrate the hipness of those involved in making it. but eventually the film proves that it has much more than that to offer, as the plot becomes more focused. why does stefan take heroin? why does anybody take heroin, fully knowing the possible consequences? the film does not attempt to answer that question directly, but stefan's heroin use seems a logical extension of his single-minded pursuit of pure pleasure.i strongly recommend this film to any pink floyd fan who has an appreciation of the vastly underrated "more" soundtrack. i also recommend it to anyone who has an interest in sixties counterculture and how it was portrayed in the media. i have no idea how realistic this movie is, since i am too young to have experienced the sixties firsthand, but it does seem to capture the spirit of the times in a way that no other movie does.

has there ever been an angel of death like mimsy farmer in barbet schroeder's 1960s heroin opus? sort of jean seberg with a hypodermic. pink floyd score. despite some ultimately insignificant weaknesses, a classic, shamelessly ripped off by erich segal/noel black for their inept jennifer on my mind (1971), although tippy walker, playing a similar character, is herself very junkie-appealing in the latter mess. more, though, is terrific, a great 60s drug movie and, simply, an important document of its time. very much a cult film so join the cult.no american movie then, as far as i can remember, charts the same territory. mimsy's an astonishing archetype, elevating this into mythic realms. not for the faint-hearted. great sex scenes too.

there has been a political documentary, of recent vintage, called why we fight, which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation. it is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq. yet, a far more famous series of films, with the same name, was made during world war two, by hollywood director frank capra. although considered documentaries, and having won oscars in that category, this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop, more in the vein of leni reifenstal's triumph of the will, scenes of which capra recycles for his own purposes. that said, that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries (such as the bbc's lauded the world at war) lacked, nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable. they are skillfully made, and after recently purchasing some used dvds at a discount store, i found myself with the opportunity to select a free dvd with my purchase. i chose goodtimes dvd's four dvd collection of the series.rarely has something free been so worth invaluable. while there are no extras on the dvds, and the sound quality of the prints varies, these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago, when racism was overt (as in many of the classic warner brothers pro-war cartoons of the era), and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts. the seven films, produced between 1942 and 1945, are prelude to war, the nazis strike, divide and conquer, the battle of britain, the battle of russia, the battle of china, and war comes to america.overall, the film series is well worth watching, not only for the obvious reasons, but for the subtle things it reveals, such as the use of the plural for terms like x millions when referring to dollars, rather than the modern singular, or the most overused graphic in the whole series- a japanese sword piercing the center of manchuria. yet, it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars. the lesson of world war one (avoid foreign entanglements) was not applicable to world war two, whose own lesson (act early against dictatorships) has not been applicable in the three major wars america has fought since: korea, vietnam, nor iraq. the fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today's information-clogged times. it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today, but at least you'll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position, nor will you be the last.

with all of mainland europe under his control hitler prepares for the last obstacle in his way before heading for north america, great britain. with an overwhelming edge in aircraft goering's luftwaffe looks unstoppable on paper. once in the air however the raf tenaciously disrupts the paradigm by blowing the enemy out of sky air at a seven to one rate. the battle of britain rages on for a over a year as the island nation is bloodied but unbowed providing crucial time for their american allies to produce more arms for the inevitable struggle. using more staged footage than the three previous documentaries in the why we fight series the battle of britain has a more propaganda like feel to it with the dramatized (some with unmistakable warners music score ) scenes glaringly obvious to newsreel. in an ironic twist amid the devastation caused by german air attacks beethoven's seventh symphony is employed to underscore the visual suffering. the story itself is one of remarkable courage by a defiant nation who refused to buckle under to the devastating attacks inflicted upon it by up until that point an invincible war machine. it is the 20th century version of the 300 spartans.there have been more exhaustively researched and better looking commercial efforts done on this battle since this film but the immediacy and motivation the battle of britain provided then will always make it a more valuable document of england during its "finest hour".

britain and france declared war on germany in 1939, but by then, almost all of europe had fallen under the advance of the nazi war machine. entering the war, britain virtually started from scratch, with scarce supplies and with an air force that was outnumbered by germany ten to one. but the will of the brits was firm, emboldened by their new prime minister winston churchill who declared - "we shall never go under".on august 8, 1940, the battle for britain was on. however for the first time since hitler's declared stance to conquer the world, he hit a wall. though massively outnumbered, the british royal air force went on the offensive, and in the span of twenty eight days in september and october of 1940, german luftwaffe casualties climbed to two thousand three hundred seventy five lost planes and crew. hitler's rage was seething, but he had to call a momentary time out. responding later in the year, hitler launched a massive fire bombing of london on christmas day of 1940. when i say that there has never been a disaster movie to rival the real live footage of london in flames during this assault would be an understatement. perhaps the most surreal effect of this chapter in the "why we fight" series would be seeing british citizens emerge from their underground shelters following the bombing raids to resume what was left of their life above ground. even as you watch, there is no way to comprehend the living horror these people must have gone through, as the city of london was left in virtual ruin.yet the nazis were stunned and stymied as well. everything hitler wanted to believe about freedom and democracy was now turned on it's head. instead of being weak willed and complacent like the french, the british were not going to give up without a fight. and fight they did, taking the air battle to germany and responding in kind with attacks on the german homeland. it was a turning point, forcing hitler to rethink his strategy.

the frozen limits is a big screen vehicle for the artists known as the crazy gang. they were a group of british entertainers who formed in the early 1930s. in the main the group's six men were bud flanagan, chesney allen, jimmy nervo, teddy knox, charlie naughton and jimmy gold. hugely popular in the variety halls the group were also darlings of the then royal family. the plot here sees them as the wonder boys troupe who set off to seek their fortunes in alaska after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper. only problem is is that when they finally get to red gulch it turns out they are 40 years too late!i often cringe when i see the statement "it's very british" because it implies that those not of the british isles may struggle to get it. the reason it bothers me is because in this www/internet age i have garnered a ream of non british film loving friends who have been known to split their sides at the best of ealing, will hay and the imperious terry-thomas. so, then, is it true that something such as the frozen limits is unlikely to be appreciated by a non british audience? well yes it's true, so much here is topically british, but really it has to be said that the classic movie fan is pretty well versed in history, and when all is said and done the visual mirth here is universal. with the anarchic "not" so wild west make over an absolute winner. a winner that has every chance of being more appreciated by an american audience now than it will be by a british audience. not all the comedy works, and in truth the "big 6" are trumped big time by a film stealing moore marriott. but there are skits and parodies here that deserve respect and a nod of approval from more illustrious comedy acts. you are unlikely to nearly fall off your chair like i did because of an ovaltine gag, but if you be a classic comedy film fan? i feel sure that you will at the worst acknowledge there's some very talented people at work here.now then, dose the mounties always get their man? 8/10

i felt cheated out of knowing the whole story. while there could be a twist, this twist was so significant, that i felt betrayed. i believe it could have used a better writer who could weave all the elements of the story together better. the writer could have revealed more of the 'twists' throughout the movie, rather than all at once at the end. that aside, i believe that the actors did very well with what they had, particularly matt damon, who actually had a little character in his character, little quirks that weren't egotistic or like a smooth criminal who always knows what he is doing. the other main characters were their own separate entities who just happened to converse with one another. the cohesiveness of the group in ocean's eleven was gone.

despite what its critics ensue, i enjoyed immensely for precisely what it is. eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum. soderberg has done the artsy hard edge stuff before, won oscars, is at the top of his game. ocean's 12 is light, commercial, fluffy, steve's day at the midway if you will. i am generally not a fan of zeta-jones but even i must admit that kate is stunning in this movie. it's ending screams of an upcoming trequel and i will be one of the millions who flock to see 120 minutes of george and brad and matt parlay through clooney's digs in lago di como as they swindle some rich bad guy again and again. if we tolerated 3 installments of the lord of the rings, i ask if we can drool over clooney's salt and pepper lid just one more time?

"strike force" or "the librarians" is a fun action movie that doesn't it take itself too seriously. william forsythe stars as simon, who is looking for a missing daughter of a wealthy client. he meets up with sandi (erika eleniak) who is also looking for someone-her sister. but there are evil bad guys afoot. the most evil of them all is marcos canarious (andrew divoff). marcos likes to kill people. so now, simon and sandi have to team up to bring down the villains. the whole cast is great, with divoff stealing the movie. there are also cameos by ed lauter and burt reynolds. if you are looking for a good action film, watch this and have a good time.

i just called my brother paulie on the phone and he said he was watching hoods and it was funny. so, like i said, never go against the family! the demand for more lines is ok since i like to express my own opinions quite frequently. if something is misspelled it's most likely my eyesight and not my brain. this gives me yet another chance to take my shots at "the departed". when one knows exactly what is going to happen in the last scene with no prior knowledge, that usually means it wasn't all that suspenseful. all you need is a good directer,the same guy i believe who did my favorite mob movie, "goodfellows), but in a completely different way.and then just throw in jack the great and you got yourself an oscar. easy as pie. i have to see hoods to make sure it wasn't better than "the departed" gibbs

hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie!?!? although i haven't seen "dahmer" (2002) i can say that following what the media put out about jeff this is a pretty accurate depiction. i have studied the jeffrey dahmer case and learned all i can about this man. this is a low budget movie but it shows the mentality of a serial killer. if you can get past gore and see what the underlying story of a sick mind. i loved this movie! just brace yourself for low budget and no blood. its a story as seen through the eyes of a killer and his actions and thoughts from childhood up through his arrest. my favorite line is : "if they had bothered to look in the back seat it might have saved a lot of lives" enjoy!

this film is the most traumatising and painful horror film i have ever seen in my life. to know that this film is based on a true story and watching jeffrey dahmer(carl crew) brutally murder his victims is enough to bring a tear to my eye. i admit this was a low budget film with not the best dialogue, however it explained why jeffrey dahmer was a psycotic maniac. as he was so selfishly/inwardly emotional his emotions and selfishness went so far deep into his brain that it resulted into him becoming a murderer. every person that he lured back to his apartment, he was attracted to and had feelings for, and the reasons why he murdered them wasn't only for the thrill of killing them but because he couldn't cope with the fact of them leaving him. in the scene when he killed his first victim by bashing an object at the back of the guys head from what i noticed wasn't because he wanted to kill him but because he was devastated with the idea of the guy leaving him. it was from thereafter that he got use to the homicidal behaviour and made killing his hobby - for both evil and emotional reasons.the scene when he was talking while crying on the phone with his mother and telling her how much he loved her and the love he showed to his grandmother and how he didn't want to move out of her house did show that he did have love in his heart. one scene that i found quite spooky and strange was when a priest overheard jeffrey in a pub inviting a guy back to his apartment and then phoned jeffrey up in a phone booth within the pub so that the guy would lose patience and change his mind on going home with jeffrey. when the guy left the pub, the priest then hung up the phone and was was laughing at jeffrey. i also found that carl crew played a remarkable acting performance as the role of jeffrey dahmer. his evil and cold blooded facial expressions before he massacred his victims were so real, i was shivering in my seat. his facial expressions reminded me of the way vincent d'onofrio (private pyle/leonard) in the film 'full metal jacket' looked just before he gunned-down the general in the toilet barracks.if your an emotional person i wouldn't recommend you to watch this film but if your not, than go ahead and watch it.

this is a tough film to review, since several factors need to be taken into account. let's filter the more judgmental..ok, are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of jeffrey dahmer? can you withstand an independent, low-budget film? are you objective enough to not dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look? well, if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one. this film is an almost 100% accurate dramatization of dahmer's adult life and subsequent murder spree, and is styled as an autobiography. it isn't a glamorized, unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film "dahmer" (2001) was. the movie begins with dahmer, played quite convincingly by carl crew, sitting in the police car as they raid his apartment. his thoughts of what got him there are presented to us in a past-tense, narrated style that accurately explains much of dahmer's psychoses and motives which led him to commit murder almost 20 times. we get to know the character, both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life. it isn't anyone's fault but dahmer's that 17 people died, but being a criminal psychology student, i was pleased to more than just his animalistic side represented, truthfully, in this film. you see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship, but of course we witness the side of him that everyone remembers. it should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence, with much of it suggestive in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain. you do see two deaths that i remember, one being a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of acid. while you don't see anything graphic, this cruelty and the convincing acting of both crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene. and while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low, you will see the results. there is a prop hand and head or two, but it seems as if this was to disturb the viewer and doesn't look to be exploitive. besides, these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations are visible. although acceptable, they look enough like fakes to not be too disturbing. the film actually concludes before dahmer's death in 1994, due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior. that's about the only big difference from the real story, and the information that remains is, as i've stated, very true to the facts. the film quality could be better, the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet, and the acting of several characters is a bit hammy, but it's not overboard. in my opinion, this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of america's most remembered serial killers. i think it's safe to say the film is memorable as well, and i respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a believable manner, aided by a thoroughly excellent carl crew as dahmer.

i think the romance of this movie helps couples develop a deeper appreciation for each other. although i saw one goof in the early part of the movie, it was fairly well done. the plot can make you cry if you think about the situation enough. i loved it..watched it twice already and highly recommend it!

i will start by saying i have always been a bonnie hunt fan.... she always adds life to any character she plays, and she did a wonderful job in her directorial debut.i have to admit this is a chick flick... but keeping that in mind, it is a wonderful story, it touches on many emotions and elicits all sorts of reactions.this film depicts real life like people with real life like situations. (tho i have to exclude the coincidence that is the major part of the film)it's a love story.. not just of a man and a woman, but the love of family, friends, and loved ones past. (even pets).i really enjoyed it. well worth the rental or the purchase.

this film is great - well written and very entertaining. david duchovny shows, once again, that he is much more than fox mulder, and the performances by the old men are funny as can be. old married folks (like me) will appreciate the connection between two hearts.

there are so many positive reviews on return to me that my opinion is not necessary to encourage you to watch this movie. however, i feel the need to express my admiration for this unique movie. bonnie hunt has proved that she is not only an exceptional actress but also a marvelous director and script writer. this movie has everything and is full of humanity, tenderness, sense of humor ... don't miss it, don't wait any longer. and, regarding the poor reviews don't pay any attention. some viewers forget that this type of movies have to be watched with your heart, not only with your eyes. if some viewers prefer notting hill or you've got mail that's their mistake. for me, return to me is a true gem, an unforgettable movie.

this movie is so cool. it told me to enjoy every moment in life to its fulness. i think that bonnie hunt (jerry maguire) writes well and i am so happy that she gave aging actors opportunity to have such big roles in the movie. that is really neat, in a society that worships wealth, health and youth, it was nice to see a movie about normal people. the movie reminded me a lot of "while you were sleeping" which i really love. if you don't like this movie you should work on your sensitivity skills.favorite quotes: megan dayton: "i'm just saying, for safety, don't shave your legs,because then you definitely won't let it go too far." grace briggs: "megan, it's a first date." megan dayton:" i married a first date. i'm sure you plan on being level-headed, but once you're in the moment, the male brain seems, i don't know, everything they say suddenly seems brilliant. hairy legs are your only link to reality." favorite scenes: megan (good will hunting) riding her bike. all the scenes in the garden. the conversation and comradery among the grandpa and friends in the restaurant. please do not miss this movie it will warm up your heart!

this is a true "feel-good" movie, full of genuine sweetness and admirable people. although the premise requires a significant suspension of disbelief, it is worth the trouble to do so. the director, writers, and actors truly convey what it feels like to be in love.

i love this movie. at first, i didn't expect much of this movie since i didn't hear anyone talk about it and it seemed like it went on video soon after it had just opened in the theatres. i also didn't think david and minnie would make a good on-screen couple. (i've expected a lot out of on-screen couples since i saw "you've got mail" and "sleepless in seattle" with tom hanks and meg ryan.) personally, i think joely richardson should've played minnie's part and vice versa. i don't know, i just think joely should've stayed in the movie longer with david. they seemed perfect for each other. but it just figures that in a movie, the girl next door always gets the guy. :) (like in "while you were sleeping".) i was very wrong though. this movie was fantastic!!! everything was done brilliantly. bonnie hunt did a great job of directing. the lines were perfect with the wise cracks everywhere.***warning: spoilers ahead!!!***i love how everything intertwined with each other. for example, in the beginning, elizabeth and bob were talking about going to italy, and in the end, bob meets grace in italy. sydney (the ape) doing the hand thing with grace like he had done with elizabeth is an example too.***notice: spoilers end now!!!***one thing i didn't like about the movie was it was a little unrealisitic. well, i just don't think a man could get over his wife in a year when she was the only woman he had ever been with his entire life. you'd think he'd isolate himself from the world for years before even coming out of his house to talk someone. instead, he goes on a blind date a year later and falls *instantly* in love with a woman he's never seen in his life but feels a connection with.over all, it was a splendid movie. it had me crying two or three times, and it had me laughing countless times (the scene in the restaurant with bob's picky date for bottled water was hilarious!). it is definitely up there with great romantic-comedies like "you've got mail", "sliding doors", and "while you were sleeping".go rent it today!!

return to me is a charming gem of a movie. with an absolutely star studded cast, who can go wrong with this modern day fairy tale? it also includes many, many jokes written by the funny girl herself bonnie hunt, who wrote and directed this film. david duchovny is also very good, showing a different approach then from his everday alter-ego mulder on my favourite show the x-files. a great date movie!

a bit "the movie in the movie" case, or as the theme is virtual game here, which is the reality or even more frightening which reality is the "real" one.as any cronenberg there are organic things, like the pod and that wonderful idea:the organic gun, a weapon made of bones and tissues that shoots teeth. if there are some slower moments, the sets, designs and ideas are there with some thoughts of revolution. can be not liked because the way the movie is happening is quite unusual and sometimes disturbing, but it's definitely worth it.

my favorite science fiction, incredible ride through mistrust and the warping of reality. probably the best performance i have ever seen jude law play. incredibly original with interesting character developments and a story line that twists and turns so rapidly that it takes a couple of minutes after the film to fully grasps its genius. even more fun watching it again for the end changes the beginning.

now being a fan of sci fi, the trailer for this film looked a bit too, how do i put it, hollywood. but after watching it i can gladly say it has impressed me greatly. jude is a class actor and miss leigh pulls it off better than she did in delores clairborne. it brings films like the matrix, 12 monkeys and the cell into mind, which might not sound that appealing, but it truly is one of the best films i have seen.

existenz is simply david cronenberg's best movie. all the people compare it to the matrix. they're not even similar. if you enjoyed cronenberg's other works just a little bit, you'll love this one...

this movie is breath-taking and mind-blowing. but i think maybe it can only be appreciated by die-hard rpg funs. it is like a game. one problem is the plot is too game-like and just has too many twists. the twists are excessive. jude law gives a very good performance. i really like him in this movie, just as jerome in gattaca and gigglo joe in a.i.

the bottom line is: if you come looking for a sci-fi thriller/horror film, the matrix is what you'll like. if, like me, you long for the rare true science fiction film involving characters with depth and provocative thought about where science will take us, then you need to see existenz.

existenz was a good film, at the first i was wondering what is going on, organic "pods" made out of mutant reptiles which connected you and other players to a surreal virtual reality game via a umbilical cord, well it seems a little odd.but once it gets going its a pretty good film, with a few twists with a great open ending and the good aspect of weridness throughout the film is entertaining too see as your not sure whats coming next.security personnel throw away the metal detectors; they have bone guns !

existenz combines director david cronenberg's traditional love of blood and gore and exploding heads with the more confusing aspects of a reality twisting david lynch film. and it actually works effectively. i won't bother trying to give even the bare bones of a plot synopsis here because it'll only cause more confusion. all you need to know is that the film is about a virtual reality computer game that is so incredibly lifelike that it becomes difficult to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality. the film almost seems to abandon its technology fearing point at the end, but then it throws in the final twist in the very last line of dialogue.there's also some very gross sexual imagery based around the 'bio-ports' in the protagonists backs, as well as some very gross acting from jude law. he manages to come off as naive and stupid and boring and any other annoying habit you can care to think of. jason jennifer leigh comes off much better, and everyone else can be called a supporting character, including willem dafoe in a functional, if unspectacular, role as a money-crazed mechanic. overall, existenz is a very effective sci-fi film about the possibilities technology can present and the possible consequences it will receive.

warning: plot spoilerthe always-abnormal movies of david cronenberg certainly are an acquired taste. fans of his earlier films will probably like `existenz', but it definitely isn't one for the squeamish. all of the usual elements are here. a game pod made out of skin (hooked into your back), buckets of blood, a gun made out of bones, and a manic mechanic to name but a few. the result is good in parts, bad in parts, and just plain weird in others. but one thing the film has is undeniable originality. despite the excessive use of weirdness it does prove a point- virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people. in the movie, a character shoots someone dead claiming that he was `annoying' (assuming that she was still in the game). but it leaves the question as to whether that really happened or if it was an occurrence in this stunningly life-like game. `existenz' leads to a conclusion that can be responded to in several ways. despite some extra gadgets and gook, it was simply your classic `it was all a dream or was it' twist. it is a smart surprise and answers a few questions, but giving that the entire film was leading up to this moment is a bit disappointing. at only 97 minutes it could have went on a bit longer too. in a peculiar way the film raises moral issues but answers them in a violent and rather inappropriate way. jennifer jason leigh appears here in her first big role in quite a while. but her character doesn't have enough qualities to make her jump off the screen or even give her a likeable character. jude law on the other hand (equipped with a curious american accent) is good as your average joe sucked into this abnormal world. we see the film through his perspective.`existenz' is far from flawless but it certainly is a movie experience to remember. there's tonnes of weird characteristics to match the similar styles of david lynch (what next? - being consumed by a question mark?!?!?!). it definitely isn't for all tastes but it is rewarding enough to recommend. my imdb rating: 6.2/10.

so let's begin!)))the movie itself is as original as cronenberg's movies would usually appear...my intention to see it was certainly jjl being one of my favourite actresses. she is as lovely as usual, this cutie!i would not say it was my favourite movie of hers. still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow. the rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array. ;)recommend with confidence!))))

i always believed that a film that's plot is centred around a virtual reality video game never sounds as though it's going to be anything special but existenz proved i couldn't have been more wrong. this film is unbelievable and, whilst highly entertaining, offers so much more than that. from start to finish, this film has you conceptualising to the point where you can have so many ideas, you can not make a final conclusion. david cronenberg has a talent for this as he does so many things.existenz is pure cronenberg; the way it's written and the way it's directed is very unique to his style and that can only be a good thing. cronenberg set himself a clear target with this film and that was to keep the audience guessing which he did with apparent ease. his fondness for the grotesque is not as predominant in this film as it is in the fly or naked lunch but there are still some elements such as the game pods and how they are made that can make the audience wince. with regards to his earlier work, existenz is more a combination of videodrome and a less violent scanners, a pretty awesome combination. setting the film in the not too distant future was a really good decision as it allowed cronenberg to be extremely imaginative with the films surroundings and also enabled him to visualise more concepts, allowing for less inhibited writing. it was important that the film didn't become over confusing and cronenberg avoided this very well by keeping things relatively simple. besides, if he wanted to make an unwatchable film, he'd know how to do it a lot better than this.existenz boasts an extremely talented cast of character actors and all perform very well. jennifer jason leigh gives the standout performance as the game designer who spends more time out of reality than in to it. leigh is sexy and commanding in her role as allegra and she really gets her teeth in to the role. the emotional range she shows in the film is particularly impressive, making her completely believable (if you can believe anything). jude law is also good and is very convincing in his character's fear of implantation. the chemistry between these two is very electric and gives the film an extra bit of flavour. ian holm and willem dafoe are just two of the great actors in support who add further depth to the film with very colourful performances. the cast of the film isn't huge but existenz definitely has the 'quality is better than quantity' ethic which works very well.as well as being entertaining and thought provoking, existenz touches social issues such as control and loss of self. this further demonstrates the film as an intellectual vessel and could also explain why it wasn't a huge hollywood hit. existenz has so much to offer and although it isn't to everyone's taste, those who like cronenberg's work or who like science fiction will almost be certain to like this film. it is one of those films that needs to be watched with an open mind but it really is something special.

the producers of this picture are hungarians. it's not by crazy artistic momentum that x and z are capitalized in the titles considering that the word 'isten' means 'god' in hungarian. - by the way, david, isten is the word for god in hungarian... - hum... is that so ? let's consider this movie as 'a history of violence' science-fictional sibling. both films have in common the strength of blowing up respective genres ; thriller and drama in the 2005 one and 'none fx-ed as hell' science fiction in the one we're looking at right now. everything he does have a meaning and is surrounded by details : the nod to phil k. dick (who wrote "in the days of perky pat") by creating a 'perky pat' fast-food restaurant. the nod to stanley kubrick by using 2001's naming pattern ; as ibm became hal (one letter down in the alphabet) in the 1968 movie, in existenz 'classic lubricant spray' wd-40 becomes xe-60 (one letter up) when allegra cleans up pikul's port. the nod to david cronenberg by using videodrome's witty kind of formula ('death to...' & 'long live'..) and by taking another medium for central theme of a picture (tv in videodrome, video games and virtual reality in existenz in 1983, you penetrated a tv set. in 1999, you're penetrated by a game. welcome to canada!)the nod to good taste by getting peter suschitzky's cinematography, howard shore's music and ronald sanders's editing (a team that wins). for everyone born in the early 80's with a super famicom, a genesis or an arcade stick in the hands, this movie rings a bell. enough with the nods. the plot ? "jennifer jason leigh stars as a game designer (allegra) who creates a virtual-reality game that taps into the players' minds" as we can see on the movie main details page. that's the story in the story. to me, this picture is about a 'reality demonstrators' young couple infiltrating the 'brand new virtual game' presentation session to destroy its programmer. i assume that what we see in the last five minutes is reality, if there's such thing as reality. jennifer jason leigh is always playing a game designer in the game they're in and the end of the movie is the reality, with video games freaks giggles, big hairy dogs, 'cronenbergy realistic' plastic textures (helmets and stuff) and 9mm handguns. what you see is true. they play transcendenz during an hour or so (in this game, there's a game (existenz) in which jjl plays existenz's genius programmer and jude -pikul - law a marketing trainee associated with allegra's game), they play existenz because allegra is very concerned about her pod's health (the thing you plug your nervous system in, in order to play), she has to plug herself and pikul in then wins the game (transcendenz) and back in the reality they kill yevgeny nourish, transcendenz programmer.playing existenz and transcendenz is about facing your essence, face your subconscious while its creating a virtual reality you'll have to overcome in unexpected ways to win the game (by playing the game, the girl playing allegra, the 'reality demonstrator' turns into allegra, a 'virtuality goddess').what game would heidegger have played to feel his abstract da-sein term ? to be truly engaged in the world ?and what about nietschze (yes friedrich, god is dead and you know what ? willem dafoe stands for him! - god, the mecanic -) ??? yes we do construct a narrative for ourselves, and losing this thread we follow from one day to the next disintegrate people as personalities ; existenz's discusses the fact that reality is the whole perception of itself by anyone who engaged it truly. and we could sometimes get some neat stuff ; a perception of virtuality in virtuality in reality.

after his earlier movie "videodrome", which definitely shows similarities to this movie, director david cronenberg again ventures himself in the world of virtual reality, in which truth and fiction mix. it's virtual reality taken to a whole other level."existenz" is an highly original movie that is well directed and acted out but above all very well written. the movie features a fascination and well thought out concept, which gets greatly executed by director david cronenberg."existenz" is a movie that knows to constantly fool you. just when you thought you figured things out, another surprise awaits around the corner. things are never like how you think they are, especially when the line between truth and fiction gets explored. you just never really know what is the reality and what is the game-world, right till the ending. it makes the characters and events all very unpredictable and also provides the movie with a great ending that will leave you thinking even more.the movie has a perfect kind of game-play storytelling, mostly with its character appearances and its puzzling events. they have to complete a certain step or task first before they can continue in the world and find out what their purpose in the game is.the movie knows how to create a perfect balance between realism and surrealism, without ever going over-the-top with either one. the storytelling keeps the movie as simple as possible, though of course the movie isn't always that simple to follow because of its events, dialogs and unusual environments.the movie is not only just weird though. i was actually surprised to see that "videodrome" has an higher rating on here, thought it's a far more inaccessible and 'odd' movie. the movie is also still made entertaining and has a good fast pace. it doesn't ever allow the movie to get stuck in its more philosophical moments and deeper meanings. it also makes this movie perfectly watchable for people who normally don't watch this sort of movies.the movie is good looking, with subtle effective special effects a great visual look, that also provides the movie with a certain required 'gaming' feeling.the movie is well cast, with jude law in a role you don't too often see him in, that of a shy insecure person. it once more shows how actually versatile law as an actor is and that he is way more than just another pretty face from hollywood. jennifer jason leigh also was a great female lead. she hasn't really played ever that many big parts in big productions but with this movie she shows why she nevertheless always have been regarded as a big movie star. the movie also features some other well known actors, in much smaller roles, such as ian holm and willem dafoe.an highly original movie that is well worth watching, especially if you have seen "videodrome" previously.8/10

existenz is an exploration of reality and virtual reality, wherein characters run from realm to realm, landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they know not the goal of or exactly where it's leading them. within that virtual reality game is more layers of virtual reality games, calling into question which reality they arrive from is the "real" one.of course it's not spectacular at hiding the fact that it's not going to reasonably answer to a true reality, instead tossing the idea of whether it's real or a video game into question even up to the end. i'm not even sure cronenberg pretends that twist won't be there, it's so incredibly obvious in a sense it's kind of disconcerting.the problem with this film though is its base nature, in a sense. cronenberg is questioning reality and criticizing game play. yet the same things that he uses to criticize game play makes him revel in it: the violence, the discontinuity, the lack of focus and in a sense, the pixellation even if there isn't such pixellation in the film. i have once heard someone state that cronenberg's violence is actually a criticism of hyperviolence in media, but he hides that well with the fact that he derives such incredible pleasure in ripping new orifices into humans, animals, and amorphous piles of biological sludge.what is brilliantly written and done about this movie is the use of video game conceits (not being able to say exactly what you want to say during cut scenes, relative lack of surroundings or surroundings that don't make sense, only a few people around where it feels there should be many and vice-versa, all of that stuff) along with the motif of penetration. it definitely deconstructs the video game reality in a way that's nauseating and absurd, but it does it even better by replacing video game electronics with literal "pods" of biological matter that squirm and shift and are, frankly, disgusting to the one of the most horrifying degrees. for what it's worth, this film causes a reaction in you.but what for? it criticizes virtual reality, but it's a movie: it is its own virtual reality. it seems to criticize the banality of video game plot lines and character design, yet it maintains that banality. it definitely seems to worry over whether killing a video game character is more okay than killing an actual human being and how video games can be confused with reality and cause people to not think about the consequences of their actions in real life, and yet i say again, it derives the utmost pleasure from ripping people, objects, beasts, things, and organisms into bloody shreds.so whereas it has a key focus of angst, it doesn't really do anything with it, not really. only what it does do is present that angst in such an original way it can't really be denied its own moment of splendor.in a sense, it'd be much easier to just hate this movie for being gory and violent, because there's no good reason i can see for loving it and yet i can't disregard it as mediocre or bad. it'd be easier to simply not be able to take it, but since i can, there's nothing i can really do with it. i do believe it is a little excessive, it really didn't need to go as far as it went, but cronenberg's intentions are so mixed up and confused i don't know if that was cronenberg's flaw or cronenberg's point, and i don't think there's really any way to figure it out except maybe ask him directly.--polarisdib

an absorbing exploration of virtual reality, although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended. this film deliberately takes you through several layers of artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues about which layer of virtual reality you are in, positing an ontological confusion for the viewer to ponder. also can be seen as a satire of video games-- the whole movie though may fall into the fallacy of imitative form here. it seems unable to escape from the video game genre which it imitates; thus the satire becomes problematic. a number of interesting ideas crisscross throughout though: the biological mutant is one; the interface of technology and biology, the cyborg urge to transcend reality-- and philosophical allusions such as the title's to heidegger, along with existential questions: i.e., the game characters are partly scripted or determined and yet partly free to alter their fate, and they wonder at how strange that feels in the game. one character then notes that this existential confusion is just like real life, thereby erasing again the distinction between the virtual and the real. likewise with the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble around in a world where you don't know what will happen next and you're not sure how to play since you have to stumble around just to find out the goal and the unknown rules. a virtual game within the game is titled "transcendenz". also a critique of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of real violence. even the heroes at every level of ontological existence find themselves confused about violence. they don't like it but it is thrilling and part of the "game", which then they fear is real. the game creator, the god of the system, is assassinated in the end; yet that very scenario is played out in direct parallel to a video game we've just witnessed-- and the onlookers believe that it is still just part of the virtual reality. in the end, the film does not resolve the doubt about whether or not this is "real" but the point is clear (to me anyway). existenz means da-sein: you are there. you are thrown into a set of rules and mysteries at every level. ontologically, virtual reality recapitulates reality. and its common game motifs express, like a royal road to the unconscious, our own fascination with violence.nevertheless, while cronenberg affirms these philosophical allusions in an interview about the film, he claims that he is very much against the "reality ... {underground name of terrorist group} portrayed in the film both in the game and in the 'real' level." seems that cronenberg himself did not put that much thought into the film, though his impressive education comes through. the interview in cineaste gives the impression of a middle brow intellectual who's trying to be avant-garde by inclination. cronenberg is simply on the side of free imagination -- the clichéd bourgeois modernist credo-- despite the acknowledged ambivalence there. (my impression here might be due to one limited interview.) still, cronenburg seems to miss the point that his film betrays the fallacy of imitative form (here imitating computer games while doing a satirical critique of them, but a critique that is unable to "transcend" the same form) probably because he actually thinks that it is "imaginative" and radical. yet the film's imaginative world is less bearable, and more jejune, than our own all-too-real world. it remains trapped in the computer game worldview.

"we're both stumbling around together in this unformed world, whose rules and objectives are largely unknown, seemingly indecipherable or even possibly nonexistent, always on the verge of being killed by forces that we don't understand." so says ted pikul in the film. which for some people sums up life and 'existenz' probably is a film about existence. what is real and what is unreal and how you tell the difference. or not. the last line of the film is superbly ambiguous.the film seems like a shaggy dog story (indeed it has a real shaggy dog in it) but it takes you along on an interesting ride, full of provocative cronenberg touches that will make you look at amphibians, game pods, fish, spines and bones in a new light. some bits are quite icky. it takes place in a rural setting where the gas station is called 'gas station' and a chinese restaurant is called 'chinese restaurant.'the film has an engrossing texture that is leagues away from your usual big budget science fiction movie.you can read many things into the film and it repays watching more than once.the main actors are jude law who is ok and jennifer jason leigh who is great. some roles don't suit this very talented actor but when she has a good role like this she is unmatchable. her unconventional beauty and fascinating voice suits the part of allegra. (looks great in a short black skirt too.) there are other familiar actors but they are not given much to do. it looks good, sounds good and a howard shore score complements the film very well. cronenberg is possibly the alfred hitchcock of the sci-fi/horror genre. no matter what film he makes he is always worth watching.

david cronenberg's `existenz' is a well designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. it addresses the problems of a culture that is plugged into technology that it can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between the organic and the mechanical. the movie shocks the audience with its replacement of mechanical technology with organic, metabolismic one. in this context the technology is able to be part of human body. after playing the virtual reality game of `existenz', the real world feels like a game and as a result, human behavior change in order to apply violent game-urges even when the game is over. in existenz, technology has evolved from machinery to biological organisms that plug directly into the human nervous system; an idea that reflects marshall mcluhan's belief who is a well known media theorist, that computers are extensions of human consciousness. like telephone is an extention of the ear, television is an extention of the eye, telegram is an extention of the central nervous system high-tech virtual reality is an extention of human consciousness. in existenz, technology is biological and thus more human than it is in our world. but as technology becomes organic, humans become more mechanical and therefore less free, unable to resist their game-urges. existenz is a virtual realty simulation of man's existence. jean baudrillard describes a mediated society in his book of simulacra and simulation, which all power to act has been transformed to appear. the world has passed into a pure simulation of itself. in existenz it is obvious to see baudrillard's mediated society with the themes of the invasion of the body, the loss of control and the transformation of the self into other.while you are in the existenz, consciousness slowly replaces with another identity, your role in the game, which is a reflection each individual's real life subconscious. while you gain the control of your hyperreal life step by step, the aura of your real life disappers. for baudrillard, `.simulations or simulacra, have become hyperreal, more than real.' our hyperreality, like cronenberg's world of computer simulation, `.now feels, and, for all intents and purposes is, more real than what we call the real world.' (baudrillard) the purpose of the game which can basically be called 'experience' is quite metaphorical. because you can not even know what is experience unless you experience it. as existentialists say that, life without an exact explanation is absurd, the game of existenz is absurd too. cronenberg, ironically reflects the absurdity of our lives. for instance, in the game, the other roles just stand still unless you ask them a pre-programmed question. and when you put their aimless funny looking state of being into the representation of our lifes, the exposed absurdity really shocks.the theme of the game is to understand what it is for? this hidden metaphorical question creates anguish over the people who play existenz. they have no doubt about their existence, however they do not know the underlying reason of their existence. the essence.existentialists have held that human beings do not have a fixed nature, or essence, as other animals and plants do; each human being makes choices that create his or her own nature. in the formulation of the 20th-century french philosopher jean paul sartre, existence precedes essence. `choice is therefore central to human existence, and it is inescapable; even the refusal to choose is a choice. freedom of choice entails commitment and responsibility. because individuals are free to choose their own path, existentialists have argued, they must accept the risk and responsibility of following their commitment wherever it leads.' perhaps i should mention, `existenz' deals with the concept of freedom of choice too. you achieve your final role in the game by taking right decisions. if you don't than the game becomes irrevelant and boring. so, you begin to interrogate the game, your existence rather than your essence. you suddenly become schzopfrenically alianated from the game and realize your position outside the game. well as a last word, existenz is a well designed reverse simulation of life thus existentialism.

who should watch this film? anyone who has ever taken acid, read philip k. dick, thought the premise of the matrix was better then the special effects, has an interest in philosophy, or likes having their sense of reality messed with. i laughed out loud at this film, just because it was so outrageous and so spot-on. this film is great. this film is cool. it is better than the matrix, by a long shot (i didn't fall asleep in existenz, for a kick off: action/special effects films bore me stupid, and despite a plausible philosophical gloss, that is exactly what the matrix is). existenz is gross, it is disturbing, and it is funny. david cronenberg has done some shonky stuff (rabid) and some works of genius too (videodrome is another one worth checking out, as is stephen king adaptation the dead zone). but this is one of my all-time favourites. i can't remember the ending- which is a good thing, cos it means i can watch it again. or perhaps i never watched this film at all. maybe it's an implanted memory. or maybe it 'really' happened to me. i don't know. at any rate, it is now seamlessly stitched into my overall illusion of reality, and i'm glad.

david cronenberg, much like colleague david lynch, is an acquired taste. a director who plays with themes like reality, perversion, sex, insanity and death, is bound to get the most extreme reations from audiences. he proved this with films as the fly, naked lunch, crash and exitenz (capital x, capital z) and more recently, spider. it's best to see existenz with a clear mind. try not to read too much about the plot, or it'll be ruined for you. what i can tell you is that cronenberg takes you on a trip down into the world of videogames that acts as a metaphor for any kind of escapist behaviour. living out fantasies is something people always dream of, but how far can you go into it, before reality gets blurred and the fantasy takes over and turns into a nightmare? those are the themes touched in existenz, an exploration of identity, the human psyche, physical bodies being invaded by disease and most importantly, reality itself.the story and directing are excellent. cronenberg knows his trade very well and succesfully brings to life an artificial world, avoiding the usual pitfalls and clichés linked to stories such as this. the film shows some pretty disgusting stuff, but is unusually low-key in the gore department in comparison to cronenbergs other work. the shock effects he plays on are never over the top and the plot progression is very intelligent and creative. it's not the most intellectual movie ever, but it will leave you thinking about it, wondering and pretty confused.the acting gets two thumbs up as well. both protagonists, jennifer jason leigh and jude law, play their parts perfectly and cleverly portray their character's shifting moods and identities. the dialogue may seem a little stale and clinical at times, but that is part of the effect cronenberg was going for, to create a disaffected and alien atmosphere that puts you quite at unease. supporting actors as ian holm, don mckellar and an especially creepy willem dafoe lift the movie even higher with their disturbingly familiar performances.this movie takes some getting used to, but if you can appreciate the dark tone, blood-curdeling imagery and existentially warping story, you'll love it.

everybody seems to compare this to the matrix and the 13th floor, and when i first saw it i would have agreed -- i was expecting the matrix and was a little disappointed. but upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely.the thing to keep in mind is that the matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in. the 13th floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in. existenz is not an action movie at all, and is not (as many seem to believe) about "reality" or any such "deep" concept. it's about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial (both in its origin and in its behavior) world of make-believe.the most chilling moment in the movie is when allegra geller repeats her "scripted" line. it's at that point you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily surrendered their free will in order to participate in a story. this is made even more frightening at the end when d'arcy nader (or rather his player) comments on the possibility of spending one's life in the game. i sympathize completely with the "realist" philosophy, that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the end goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence. living "in the game" is not living at all, but is a tempting way to spend one's time on earth. as allegra comments about the real world, "there's nothing going on here." might as well jack into someone else's imagination, and pretend to be doing something interesting. (although i have to ask whether cronenberg considers this a self-indictment, considering that he himself offers up worlds to be experienced in 90 minute snippets.)upon leaving the theater after first watching this movie, i thought it was one of those movies that was watchable only to see how it ended. but having seen it a couple more times (thank you scifi channel) i've realized how much deeper it goes. seriously, if you've only seen it once, it deserves another viewing.

this film is the most impressing turkish film that i have ever seen. probably "okul" is the first turkish horror film. i must say that i were excited while watching the movie because of some reasons, the first reason is that the story is impressive, i mean that at the end of the film you realised all the details about movie, this makes the film attractive and the other reason is that no turkish man made such a movie like that before. this shows that turkish film improves itself by time. although the first trial to make a horror movie, it was really successful. i advice all of you not to miss this movie...

i've watched the movie actually several times. and what i want to say about it is the only thing that made this movie high rank was the burak altay's incredible performance, absolutely nothing but that. not even those silly model named deniz akkaya and some of these popular names at times in the movie... burak is definitely very talented i've seen a few jobs he made and been through. even though this is kind of horror movie, he's doing really good job in comedy movies and also in dramas too. i bet most of you all saw asmali konak the movie and tv series, those two would go for an example... all i'm gonna say is you better watch out for the new works coming out from burak then you'll see.. keep the good work bro, much love..

okul is the first of its kind in turkish cinema, and it's way better than i expected. those people who say it's neither scary nor funny have a point, it's not all that great indeed. but it must be kept in mind that everyone involved with the movie is rather amateur, so it's basically a maiden voyage. and comparing this one to sinan çetin's other films such as the 1st class garbage "propaganda", this movie is pretty damn good.one thing that must be said: it deals with the highschool students' life in turkey very realistically! that's exactly how it goes! the scenes that are meant to scare are somewhat cheap, and hollywoodish. most of them even if not all. but that religion lesson scene made me laugh in tears, and emre kýnay performs the best acting of this flick as a religion teacher.it's not a waste of your time, go and watch it! you'll find it rather amusing especially if you know turkey enough to relate to turkish youngsters' school lives.

this movie coming from turkey where you can't find any tradition of horror movies. first i was afraid of watching just an adaptation but after seeing it i have changed my mind. it has original scenario.a love movie using horror thema. most of the players are not famous young people but their performance is proofing that a new generation is coming. maybe this is a sign that turkish cinema is coming back after 20 years.

a ghost story on a typical turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects. taylan biraderler(taylan brothers) had made their first shots on a tv-show a couple of years ago, as far as i know. that was kind of a turkish x-files, they had very nice stories but lacked on visual effects. this time it seems they had what they needed and used them well. this movie will make you laugh that's for sure, and as well it might have you scared. it has a nice plot and some young, bright actors in it. if you are a high school student in turkey you will find so many things about you here. there are many clues in the movie about its story and ending, some you understand at the moment, some will make sense afterwords, the dialogs were written very cleverly. so these make the movie one of the best turk movies made in the last years. do not forget, this movie is the first of its kind in the turkish film industry.

here's one of the more pleasingly scuzzy 70's blaxploitation grindhouse items; it's a pervasively low-rent pimp opus which comes across like a sleazier version of "the mack." john daniels, the studly womanizing hairdresser hero mr. jonathan in the immortal "black shampoo," gives an excellent steely portrayal of the baron, a ruthless, business savvy, forever on the make all-powerful flesh peddler who much to the dismay of his bitter, brutal italian rivals reigns supreme over the sunset strip. when not locking horns with his fellow no-count criminal pals or doing his best to avoid being busted by the local vice cops, daniels is leading a sweetly average existence as your standard garden-variety suburbanite dude (complete with caring wife and loving kids!) in some typically humdrum california small town.the glaringly absurd premise alone promises top-rate trashy greatness of a decidedly grade b schlock picture variety (george theakos deserves kudos for his hilariously ludicrous script). matt cimber's commendably tactless and tasteless direction delivers the junky goods by the slimy bucketful, thus making this film a hugely enjoyable serving of celluloid grime. among the assorted squalid delights to be savored herein are plentiful gratuitous female nudity, coarse dialogue, beautifully gaudy me decade threads (halter tops, felt hats, sparkling day-glo jewelry, loud seersucker suits), an intensely funky r&b score by smoke, some hopelessly pathetic acting (the little old lady who lives next door to daniels is excruciatingly shrill), a memorably nasty turn by patrick wright as a sadistic goon, a couple of cool action set pieces (the climactic slow motion barroom massacre seriously cooks), more lurid travelogue footage of the sunset strip than you can shake a feather boa at (said footage allegedly includes "the actual hookers and blades of the sunset strip in hollywood"), effectively dark'n'dingy cinematography by ken gibb, a few sicko sexual fetish tableaux, some raw explicit violence (a prostitute has one of her breasts cut off!), and amusing supporting performances by familiar schlock feature perennials richard kennedy and george "buck" flower as a pair of racist, corrupt, browbeating police detectives. sure, this movie ain't art, but it's certainly artless enough to qualify as a deliciously grungy chunk of entertainingly sordid cinematic swill.

this new movie by jeskid is awesome! check it out and you'll be amazed. the story of emily waters, once a girl from a broken home, whose only means of escape from an abusive father was through her sketchbook. until one night her drawings manifested into reality and saved her, and now using this power she fights against those who would do evil. both live action film and hand drawn animation blend together to create a unique and original experience that will shake your soul and blow you away. the music is incredible as well, it really intesifies the emotional experience and draws you deep into the conflict. directed by jesse cowell and animated by erica langworthy, starring the beautiful marissa parness, with music by nico audy-rowland, daniel collins, jeff strathearn, matt sisco, and selcuk bor. support this film and support jeskid, he is a very talented guy. go see his film shades of grey as well.

jesse yet again delivers, after almost 12 months of hype about his upcoming production it finally reaches the dark world of the internet with more than a brilliant approach to amateur film making.dbp is a original, nail-biting commentary on a troubled child growing into an even more troubled adult. if i had more than two thumbs, i would give more, but i think two will be enough.great work from all cast, especially by marissa and elizabeth, the character of emily as an adult has given me shivers so far and i'm afraid of where she'll go next.an excellent watch

this was a modern tv classic! the story goes like this, bob has a girlfriend named alicia. bob and alicia are in love and want to get married. bob has a bud named owen who he works with. owen is jealous of alicia. he likes hanging around with bob. now owen hangs around with bob and alicia. bob and owen have a secretary named heather. heather is very accident prone. she is also, if you haven't guessed it, is kind of lonely. she too hangs around with bob and alicia, and owen. sometimes alicia wishes bob didn't have any friends.by the end of the first season, it looked like owen finally found himself a real longlasting girlfriend. bob and alicia went driving on the night before their wedding, making out in a tiny car and then getting stuck. way out in the middle of nowhere! what happened next? what about poor heather? did anyone get married?? sorry, series ended.not even a plea from tv guide made fox think twice about putting it back on the air. it was a great show with a great cast. i loved heather too. she looked cool in those glasses and was hilarious. i miss this show a lot. this is like reading a good book with the ending missing......sad.

i enjoyed this show, it was on in the uk, but not at peak time, and they seemed to move it all over the schedules so i wasn't able to watch them all. i was surprised when it didn't return and had no i idea why, still don't know, but i guess that's not important.great performances from the two leads, they were very believable as friends. the two supporting actresses also added well to the mix. i guess it was part of a whole load of shows that were lifestyle centred, friends being the obvious main one, but sex in the city came along a few years later.the characters, get take out coffee, they drink at nice bars , that sort of thing, a little woody allenish in a way.

jon cryer reprises his role as a neurotic guy in two and a half men, which he perfected in this series. he longs to have a good relationship with a girl like his coworker has developed, and the tet-a-tet between him and his partner's girlfriend's best friend are pretty funny. then they realize that they're attracted to each other and start dating. in one of the funniest lines on tv ever -- i think in the final episode -- he and his partner are discussing that he wants to propose to the girl. his partner prepares him for the moment by suggesting: "what's the worst that can happen? she says no."armed with newfound optimism, he proposes to his date over dinner. to which she replies, "god, no!"i laughed so hard i cried.

`rock star' is not on its way to any `stairway to heaven' category as one of the best rock films of all time, but it does make you `jump' from time to time because of its high-level energy. the film's theme is on a die-hard rock group fanatic who actually becomes the lead singer of his favorite band. the story is based upon the true story on what happened to the heavy metal band judas priest. if you think this movie is filled with a witty screenplay and intellect direction- then you got `another thing coming'. however, what did `shook me all night long' was the fine acting of jennifer aniston as the rock star's devoted girlfriend. i could not say the same about the rock star himself; mark wahlberg was much better as a porn star than a rock star. i did enjoy the 80's retrospect journey the movie intakes. it reminded me of my teenage years where everything `smelled like teen spirit'. i guess the film is worth a viewing, but for you to have a better time watching it make sure you bring along some `girls, girls, girls.' *** average

this is the second movie about 1985, the other one was 'the wedding singer'. whilst the 'wedding singer' was portraying the pop side of the 80's, 'rock star' is all about metal.mark wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute band of some famous rock act of the time and jennifer aniston plays his girlfriend. when his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in a day.the story doesn't get too dramatic and it only scratches the surface of the life of a rock star. sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it is full of rock'n roll! the music is fantastic and the concerts are directed brilliantly! the whole concert feeling is very well captured, since they used real audiences (no cgi here).great direction and a brilliant performance by marky mark, who acts like a true metal dude!'rock star' is all about fun and if you had anything to do with the old metal scene, you are going to love this movie!10/10

i loved this movie. it is a very simple plot and from what i understand it is based on a true story. growing up in the 80's with hard rock/hair metal may have something to do with my love of this film but even aside from the music it is a really fun movie to watch. give it a try, you will like it unless you are the hardest of critics and only like movies of "citizen kane" caliber.

i saw this last night on turner classic movies (tcm). i had never heard of it before, and was quite surprised to find it so engrossing.bogart does a star turn as a city-wise cynical editor who reluctantly goes along with his greedy radio-network boss in this incisive "b" programmer. about 12 years before he played similar city-wise cynics to perfection in movies like deadline usa, knock on any door, the barefoot contessa, and the harder they fall, bogie already had the star qualities down pat.in order to boost ratings, and bring their somewhat high-brow programming to a more popular level, wubc, "the voice of america", pushes a tell-all radio mini-series about a woman who was acquitted 20 years ago by a plea of self-defense of killing her husband. not willing to be discreet in order to save the woman's and her husband's reputations, the station uses underhanded methods to reveal all to all listeners, and as luridly as possible.as a time capsule, i also found it very illuminating of male-female mores in the workplace in the mid-1930's. although beyond henry o'neill, i'm unfamiliar with the supporting cast, the players were uniformly excellent, and the direction was taut.if you like this kind of movie at all (e.g., a face in the crowd, an inspector calls, etc.), don't miss the opportunity to see this one.

after a couple years of searching for the humphrey bogart film, "two against the world", it unexpectedly showed up as a tcm offering under the title "one fatal hour", a first national film from 1936. bogey's character is sherry scott, the man who runs wubc, a radio station whose program lineup is losing listeners. the owner bertram reynolds (robert middlemass), is a pathetic executive who calls the shots at the station, but hides behind his decisions by pawning them off on scott.in an effort to boost the audience base and revenues, reynolds has the idea of reviving a twenty year old murder case, and offering it as a fifteen chapter radio play. scott enlists the aid of dr. martin leavenworth (harry hayden) to write the play and present it on the air.the pembroke murder case involved a woman who was acquitted of murdering her husband, the circumstances of which are not made clear. however gloria pembroke has married, and is now living as martha carstairs (helen mackellar), married to a successful banker (henry o'neill), and their daughter edith (linda perry) is about to be married (on the same day no less as the radio play is to reveal the identity of gloria pembroke). about to be faced with the devastating effects of this revelation, martha and jim carstairs embark on a crusade to have the program stopped. simultaneously, edith's future in-laws respond by demanding that the marriage not take place.without revealing the final outcome, the film takes a devastating turn to jolt the viewer. edith carstairs confronts the principals of the radio station, vigorously admonishing scott and the sniveling reynolds. while accepting his share of the blame for the outcome, scott partially redeems himself by quitting his job, firing his secretary, and hauling her out of the office, recognizing her for the conscience he once had. with an entirely abrupt finish, the film leaves one as disoriented and unsettled as any movie that doesn't have a happy ending. with about a dozen films under his belt, humphrey bogart gets a chance to take center stage here with intriguing results. with no name supporting players, bogey rises to the occasion by taking charge in the confines of the radio offices, and runs the show as if it was his own. in an interesting bit of characterization, he expresses his exasperation by crossing his hands over his bowed head, predating by a half dozen years a similar effect we'll see him do in "casablanca". for bogart fans, it's a genuine treat to catch an unexpected nuance like this.

this telecast of the classic musical "sweeney todd" does not do the production justice, but is still quite enthralling.firstly, the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the production design, from the wheeling multi-set to the startling trapdoor. then, the staging is excellent, right down to the slashing.the main failing here is in the performances people give. oh, they're believable, all right-- but it is quite frustrating when nobody seems to be hitting their cues on time in a song as fast-paced as, say, "kiss me." in fact, the actress playing johanna is not only off-tempo to a dismal degree, but also slightly off-key. and angela lansbury's slightly overdone cockney accent is a bit irritating. one more thing, too-- what, exactly, is so bad about judge turpin's performance of "johanna" that it is banned from the american theatre, but not the cannibal anthem "a little priest"?otherwise, this is an excellent production. it's a thrill to watch people do what they love-- and i'm not even peripherally talking about "meat pies with a twist".

george hearn really went all out and over the top which in this case was great. i've heard the len cariou version but it was too tame. george was great in that character - very expressive.angela lansbury was perfect for the part. she gave a great performance. she gave the mrs. lovett a great devious and comical personality which balanced out the dark story.i love the dark humor when angela lansbury sings her songs as well as her physical expressions and the angry emotions of george hearn in his songs of rage, vengeance and distress.i've watched this play 20 times since 1985 when i saw it on pbs. i bought it on video (after copying it in 1985 on my own)when it came out in 1990 and i definitely bought a copy of the dvd when it came out in 2004.

i saw this play on showtime some years back in the comfort of my home and when the final note was struck, i wanted to jump off the sofa and give the production a standing ovation. as it was, i shed a tear that it was such a bunch of fantastic performances and songs. for my birthday, my kids bought me the vhs version as well as the cd of the play with len cariou in the sweeny todd role. i've shared the play with many...some finding the subject a bit sick, but none having anything but praise for the songs.i've always loved the interplay in songs with angela lansbury and george hearn as well as hearn and edmund lyndeck as judge turpin.i must own the dvd.

the genius that is stephen sondheim was never more prominently displayed as it was in his 1979 "musical thriller" sweeney todd, a gothic, gory, grisly, yet delicious musical concoction about a demented barber who returns to london to exact revenge on the evil judge who not only had him permanently exiled from london, but who is also raising his daughter as his own and plans to marry her to "shield her from all the evils of the world." the barber finds love,sympathy, and assistance from a lonely pie shop owner who has her own agenda where todd is concerned. this musical rocked broadway and won nine tony awards, including best musical and best actress in a musical (angela lansbury). the production was filmed in its entirety in 1982 with angela lansbury recreating her broadway role as mrs. lovett, the daffy pie shop owner who finds a practical use for the heads that todd makes mincemeat out of. george hearn, who replaced len cariou on broadway, is electrifying in the title role, so much so that you have to wonder why he wasn't originally cast in the role. lansbury and hearn are riveting from start to finish and commit 100% to their ghoulish characters aided, by a first rate sondaheim score, probably the closest thing sondheim has written to an opera. lansbury shines on "the worst pies in london" and "by the sea". george hearn stops the show with "epiphany" and is also compelling during "pretty women", a duet he sings with judge turpin, the man he has sworn revenge on. cris groendahl is vocally impressive as antony, the young sailer who rescues todd and falls for his daughter johanna. betsy joselyn is a little over the top as johanna and really pushes vocally to the point that during "green funch and linnet bird" she actually drives her voice off-pitch during a couple of moments. the rest of the cast is first rate, especially edmund lyndeck as judge turpin who gets to perform "johanna" in this production, which was cut from the original production and ken jennings as toby, whose gorgeous tenor fills the auditorium on "not while i'm around." but it is breathtaking musical score by stephen sondheim and the mesmerizing performance by lansbury an especially george hearn that makes this night of gothic musical theater an experience that stays with you long after curtain call. not for all tastes, but if you're game and have strong heart, sweeney todd is a joy for all music theater lovers and a must for fans of stephen sondheim and angela lansbury.

last year, i fell in love with the tim burton's version of sweeney todd so i wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and i found this one at the library. though i think burton's is best, probably because i like film a lot better than theater, this is still a great production of the story. i haven't seen any of the other versions but i am trying to get my hands on them.after seeing johnny depp as todd, it's hard for me to imagine anyone else in the role, but george hearn does a fantastic job. angela lansbury is great, as always and all of the singing is fantastic. i found myself singing along. this is a play you won't want to miss, but try and see it before you see the film version so you won't have a biased view like me.

i own this video as well as the concert version of the musical with patti lupone and george hearn with the san francisco symphony orchestra. george hearn is fantastic in my book as are angela lansbury and the composer, stephen sondheim. this musical is operatic in scope and shows much ingenuity in composition. i certainly hope that this vhs becomes available on dvd!! hearn's performance is spookily sympathetic. the one annoying performance is the young woman who sings the role of joanna. i believe this performance was at the dorothy chandler pavilion in los angeles, rather than on a broadway stage and am not sure that the minimalist set was utilized in new york, as it was in this production. but i found the scaffolding being dragged across the stage to be quite effective to "portray" the streets of london. i highly recommend this movie.

"sweeney todd" is in my opinion one of a few "perfect" musicals. like "my fair lady" and "west side story" it has a wonderful, intelligent score. it offers the two leads and several supporting characters interesting roles. it has a timeless theme, revenge. it has a good deal of humor, and is just as powerful when presented simply or on a grand scale."sweeney todd" tells the story of a simply wronged man during the industrial period in england. it shows mans' inhumanity to man, how in sweeney's own words, "there are two kinds of men. there's the one staying put in his proper place and the one with his foot in the other one's face." in an effort to correct the wrong that was done to him, mr. todd devices a plan to seek revenge. with the help of mrs. lovett, who owns a meat pie shop under mr.todd's barbershop, they set out to have "those above, serve those down below".i was fortunate enough to have seen the original broadway version eight times (six with cariou and lansbury, the other two with hearn and loudon). i saw the revival with bob gunton and beth fowler, and several other concert versions.while the technical aspects in this production are lacking, to say the least, i believe that this filmed production version is the best. lansbury and hearn were the two best in these roles, and they have a wonderful time playing off of each other.very good supporting work by ken jennings and edmund lyndeck. although betsy joslyn and cris groenendaal, as the young lovers have absolutely no chemistry, and are basically unwatchable.9 out of 10

the story of sweeney todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like charles dickens, and more contemporary writers like edward gory. as a musical, it naturally becomes more like the musical les miserables. both deal with the grim effects of poverty in the industrial revolution, and the breakdown of organized society. but this musical is different from les mis in one very important aspect: stephen sondheim, the songwriter who can adapt to any style. to be sure, he's had his successes and failures, but one thing about his shows you can always count on: they will be something unique. who would have thought someone would write a musical about a barber who slits people's throats and makes them into meat pies? sondheim did, and he did it marvelously. the entire show is set in a factory, to suggest the ever-present catastrophic effects of the misery of those at the bottom of society, and this serves the needs of the show perfectly. the catwalks and railings are moved throughout to suggest streets and walkways and bridges. techniques are borrowed from kabuki and noh, with the visual stagehands and set changes. then, to top it all off, cast the great angela lansbury as the gruesomely practical and humorous mrs. lovett, and george hearn, with his operatic baritone voice, as the murderous todd, and you've got yourself a stellar musical vehicle. the rest of the cast moves smoothly through the clichés of the love story perfectly, except for johanna and pirelli, who sound a bit too forced. if the johanna and pirelli from the broadway show could be here, it would be perfect. hearn acts while he sings more than len cariou on the obc album, and the accents don't sound as forced here. through it all sondheim's score never fails to underline the dark seriousness of the story. as i said, he can adapt to any style. in follies he imitates the '30s '40s style of showtunes, in pacific overtures he captures the subtle art of asian music, into the woods knocks off the 32 bar disney style songs, and assassins covers a history of american music. here, however, he does wonders in making his score distinctly english, from parlour songs to operatic duets and soliloquies to society waltzes to gilbert/sullivan style patter. and yet still, the show remains deadly serious, even though it provokes more laughs than any musical comedy. in it still, is a grim warning on the evils of taking revenge. here is where this movie makes a mistake, in cutting the judge's solo in which he flagellates himself out of guilt for his crimes. without it, the judge is just a conventional villain, and this movie's point is that there are no straight villains. both todd and the judge learn, too late, the horrors of having to accept responsibility for their actions, and todd loses everything in his obsession. this is well brought out by the chilling reprise of the grim yet rollicking ballad of sweeney todd, ending the show with todd and lovett rising from the grave to tell us that the end is the same: in a world full of sweeneys, vengeance begets only vengeance. "attend the tale of sweeney todd. he served a dark and a vengeful god. to seek revenge may lead to hell, but everyone does it, and seldom as well as sweeney, as sweeney todd, the demon barber of fleet street."

what is worth mentioning that is omitted in the other reviews i have read here, is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behaviour of gays in the era portrayed in the film. while courtenay's character is evidently gay, he is not the only one: the often talked about mr. davenport-scott is the other, and the reason that he is never seen, the reason alluded to that he has disappeared seems to be that he has been detained by the police for homosexual activity - a criminal offense in england at the time.we can read under the surface that this recent event has unsettled norman, courtenay's character: and we can also see in a passing remark by oxenby, the edward fox character, the quick renunciation of any connection to such a person when the law is involved: the fear of association affects many of the characters, and is part of the portrait the film paints of a time and the people who inhabit it. the abandonment of courtenay at the end by sir has been anticipated all the way through, if this subtext is included: it also makes sense of both the otherwise inexplicable omission of his dresser from the list of those he gives thanks to. the flamboyance combined with the fear of exposure produces the combination of yearning and fear that courtenay has to 'step into the footlights', as he does when he makes the announcement about the imminent air raids, a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous, but that is both a symbolic and literal depiction of the man's inner torment.so while the drama is of the decline of finney's sir, a great deal of the tragedy of the film and play comes from the 'fatal flaw' of courtenay's gayness, and makes this a film about him, as the title suggests.the art direction, pacing and cinematic style of this film seem to come from another time, more distant than the eighties and, in some ways, even than the second world war. the implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order, and the sympathy of the character racked and ruined by the cruelties of that order, of necessity trapped in the enclosed world of the theatre; and the knowledge we have of how much of it all would be swept away after the war makes this film all the more poignant, for all its flaws.

i watched this series after i had seen the naked gun films. i found it much better than the films, and i thought the films were great! this series literally glues you to the television set in anticipation of the next pun, sight gag, or funny situation (the all night wicker place, club flamingo). i don't think i've ever laughed as hard at a tv series in my life, even after seeing the movies first and thus knowing some of the jokes. i think its a shame that only six episodes were produced, but i agree that the writers would be very hard pressed to maintain this level of comedy for any more episodes. overall, the series is a must see for those who like puns, bad jokes, and slapstick sight-gags.

i thought this movie was amazing. i was a bit skeptical since i really had no idea what it was about, but it was beautiful story. i cried a lot and i also laughed out loud.i think it is very important that there are movies being created that are about the holocaust and how it affects people (it only happened 60 years ago!) i have been to germany and eastern europe and i have studied the holocaust, so this film meant a lot to me. i think this film did an amazing job capturing this story (i wont go into detail, i do not want to spoil it) but i definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a movie that, i know this may sound cliché', but will change your mindset on things.

this movie was one if not the best movie i've seen in the past year i highly recommend it it starts off as a very funny movie but as the film progress's turns into so much more. do yourself a favor and see this film. i saw a screener of this movie but i am going to buy it not only for myself but for several true film fans i have the unfortunate feeling this great film will be widely unrecognized as is the case with so many other non commercial films this is a comedic yet heart wrenching movie it will make you laugh it will make you cry it will make you think and yes you will think about it when its over and isn't that what a good movie is!

i saw this last night and voted it an "8". since then, it's grown on me and i'd give it a "9".the film has (at first) a seemingly slightly disconnected facade between the first and second halves. the first half is a comedy and there's little hint of the ragged truths of eras, life, wars, religious intolerance that will become revealed in the second half. while at first it may be a little disconcerting because it's a slightly unfamiliar narrative sequence, on reflection it works.the acting was good (hultz in the role of alex, the interpreter, was especially great).i've scanned most other "user comments" and see that some who've read the book are pleased with the movie while there are a few who are not. both feelings, of course, are valid.for me, a retired family therapist and one-world believer, the film was relevant on two different levels.the first, as history, gave a powerful reminder of how commonly polarizations happen -- with demonizing and trying to exterminate any of those with a smidge different moral value system than our own. the second was that in demonstrating the first, it also revealed something in common to each of us, all our families -- that each of us must go back to our roots to more fully understand ourselves.t.s. eliot expressed this exquisitely in the 4th of his "four quartets" when he said: -- "we shall not cease from exploration// and the end of all our exploring// will be to arrive where we started// and know the place for the first time." jonathan goes on a fulfilling journey that any of us would find fantastically illuminating -- to explore and discover our roots; what were those people going through then, who were they -- really! -- before, when, and during the early years before and after we were born? etc. so the film at first gives us the impression of a comedy, then shifts to give us a lesson in history and human deficiencies, but through all that it also gives us -- subliminally -- a message about each of ourselves. all of us would be abundantly rewarded to go back and understand the place from which we first started.

having not read the book, i was more open to the fresh interpretation that each director gives to their medium (which is film, not "to the letter" reproductions of literature)on this particular film. i was happy that the holocaust that occurred in russia (and it's neighboring countries) finally received some attention. the nazis were particularly cruel to russians and russian jews. if you read the histories and see the monuments built in smolensk and nearby regions you will understand this movie and why many kept silent when they should've spoken up.it was certainly time for this to be chronicled and i hope that more stories will come out of this. it's high time.

if you've ever been to ukraine, this movie is absolutely hilarious. from teenagers wearing gold chains, listening to hip hop and break dancing on the side to jokes about air bags in cars and waitresses in total shock over meeting a vegetarian, this movie really captures bits and pieces of ukraine that you would never know unless you went there. i spent most of the movie nodding my head and thinking, "yep. that's exactly right." it's a lot of fun if you understand russian too because the subtitles just don't always do it justice. the actors are so believable and elijah wood does a great job playing a socially inept jewish kid. my favorite character is definitely sammy davis jr. jr., the grandfather's "seeing eye dog" who is really a psychopathic border collie. the characters are so eclectic and likable that you believe that they are real people.

anyone who appreciates fine acting and ringing dialogue will lovethis film. taken from ronald 'taking sides' harwood, it's a funnyand ultimately excoriating analysis of a relationship between twovery 'actorly' types. albert finney is sublime as the despoticshakespearean actor who barely notices the world war ragingaround him, so intent is he on the crumbling fortunes of his theatrecompany and his own psychological and emotional breakdown.tom courtenay is matchless as norman, the 'dresser' of the title,whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but selfless.really a must see.

"sir" has played lear over 200 times,but tonight he can't remember his opening lines.sitting at the mirror,his eyes reflect the king's madness. his dresser prompts him gently,mouthing the words.there is an air of desperation about both these men.the great actor knowing his powers are slipping away,his valet cum major domo cum conscience cum surrogate wife - aware of his boss's decline into madness and knowing he is powerless to do more than ease his passing. "the dresser" is really a love story between the two.over the years they have become mutually dependent on one another to the extent that neither can conceive a future without the other. set during the second world war,it concerns the fortunes of a frankly second - rate touring shakespearean company comprising an equal number of has - beens and wannabes led by "sir", a theatrical knight of what might kindly be called "the old school".whatever part he is playing he grabs centre - stage and bellows out over the footlights,bullying his audience into applause.but,somewhere inside him,buried most of the time deep beneath the ham he regularly dishes out,there still remains an occasional glitter of his earlier greatness.it is to catch a glimpse of this that his audiences fervently hope for. mr a.finney very cleverly concentrates on the ham,often to the point of caricature,and,just when you are ready to dismiss his performance as mere hyperbole and bluster he will produce a moment of exquisite subtlety and vulnerability that makes you realise that a great actor is playing a great actor. the same goes for mr t.courtenay.it's easy to write off his portrayalof norman as an exercise in stereotyping.here we have a middle - aged effeminate rather than camp theatrical dresser sashaying his way through life,enjoying the company of "the girls" and loving the wicked insider gossip rife in "the theatre".there were - and i strongly suspect still are - many men just like norman in the profession.infinitely kind and patient,knowing more about the plays than many of the actors,they run backstage with wisdom and affection.i believe the vast majority of them would hoot with approving laughter at mr courtenay's portrait. i saw "the dresser" on the london stage where,against the perceived wisdom,mr courtenay's "norman" was rather more subdued than in the movie."sir" was played by the great mr freddie jones to huge acclaim from the audience.it was a memorable performance that overshadowed mr courtenay's,reducing him rather to an "also - ran" as opposed to an actor on level - billing.the idea that "sir" and "norman" might be almost incomplete without each other went right out of the window. "norman" was reduced to being his puppet,which i'm not sure was what ronald harwood intended,but made for breathtaking theatre. messrs finney and courtenay redress the balance in the movie,restoring equality to the relationship. both men have come a long way since their early appearances in the british "new wave" pictures when they became the darlings of the vaguely leftish,"middle - class and ashamed of it" movement.when the british cinema virtually committed hari - kiri in the 1970s they quietly concentrated on the theatre apart from a few roles to keep the wolf from the door.with the renaissance of more substantial movies,they re - appeared,blinking in the unaccustomed bright light."the dresser" marked their return,still fizzing with energy and talent, shouting to the world at large "we're still here".it's not a big movie but is assuredly a great one.

this is a movie that deserves another look--if you haven't seen it for a while, or a first look--if you were too young when it came out (1983). based on a play by the same name, it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring shakespearean repertory company in england during world war ii. it deals with his stress of trying to perform a shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors--the young, able bodied ones being taken for military service. it also deals with his relationship with various members of his company, especially with his dresser. so far it all sounds rather dull but nothing could be further from the truth. while tragic overall, the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high throughout. the two male leads both received oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly so. i strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama, theater--especially shakespeare, or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity. the backstage goings-on make up another facet of the movie that will be fascinating to most viewers.

this film has its detractors, and courtney's fey dresser may offend some folks (who, frankly, need a good smack upside the head) -- but the film is top notch in every way: engaging, poignant, relevant. finney, naturally, is larger than life. courtney makes an ideal foil. i thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads, and courtney's character provides plenty of dark humor. the period is well captured, the supporting cast well chosen. this is to be seen and savored like a fine cordial. i only wish it were out on dvd already...(*sigh*)...

i'm certain that people from usa don't know anything about the rest of the world, but i think they mustn't talk about what they don't know. and they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the usa. the only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the usa and islamic nations. in france, for instance, the age of consent is 15. in brazil it's 14. in spain it's 12. so the teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years old by the time of production, aren't doing anything illegal. nudity isn't considered big deal in almost all civilized countries. and only a freak could consider a teenagers' love as child molestation.

a remarkable film, bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings i had when i was much, much younger. i loved it, and the elton john music. i remember seeing in in the movies when i was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) i've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released.the dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me, and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back, i confess, however, that my kids (in their 20's) have not experienced a similar emotional rush. a generational thing?why is it not on dvd?

my family and i normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.the trailer of "nasaan ka man" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. the movie exceeded our expectations. the cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. jericho rosales was really very good, so's claudine barretto. the fact that i despised diether ocampo proves he was effective at his role. i have never been this touched, moved and affected by a local movie before. imagine a cynic like me dabbing my eyes at the end of the movie? congratulations to star cinema!! way to go, jericho and claudine!!

this is a great tv movie with a good story and many comic moments thanks to the excellent cast.the only problem this movie has is that it hasn't stood the test of time as well as it might have.despite this, it's definitely worth viewing, particularly if you are an alan alda or ruth gordon fan.

i am trying to find somewhere to purchase a dvd/vhs copy of the movie "isn't it shocking?" i was 7 years old when i saw this movie and i lived in the town where it was filmed. a couple of items from my family were used in the movie as props and a couple of my friend's homes were used in a couple of the scenes. the filming pretty well took place in the town and surrounding community. i have only seen the film once originally and i would like to get a copy so now i can show my family the film. i have done extensive searches online with not luck and i was wondering if anyone would have any ideas on trying to get a copy of this movie?

this is a very sweet coming-of-age movie, very funny, and russell crowe is amazing! those who know him only from gladiator will be surprised to see the range of his acting abilities. arthur baskin (his character) is one of the best onscreen nerdy virgins i have ever seen1 watch this movie--how can we get it re-released in ntsc format?

love in limbo is my all-time favoirite movie. (set in w.a) it is hilairious and has an excellent cast including a group of three gorgeous actors, russell crowe (as arthur), back in the day when he actually looked hot with short hair and no facial hair. aden young (barry mcjannet), and craig adams as ken riddle.ken is a senior high school student obsessed with sex and becomes expelled for selling pornographic drawings to his classmates. he starts a new job at his uncles clothing factory and becomes close with another new guy barry mcjannet, who buys a car so that they can go out and pick up chicks. they become mates with the goody-twoshoes geek arthur baskin (crowe) and the three guys drive up to kalgoorlie to vsit a brothel and lose their virginity......watch it, its a classic!! for so long i have been trying to get a hold of a dvd or soundtrack, anyone let me know if you've got em.

i came across this movie in an australian hotel room at 3 am. my brother and i were channel surfing and who do we see but a young russel crowe. but not the telephone throwing russel crowe we had come to know and quasi-love back in the states. this movie, much to my surprise, was amazingly creative and hilarious. it stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences, including a slick salesman,prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. if you are lucky enough to come across this film i would strongly suggest picking it up. i have to say this movie was amazingly entertaining and i thank the fine people of australia making it...

cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'the great pretender' at production stage. i was living in oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... it was me that showed these guys how to speak scottish and after all this time, i only realise now one was russell crowe !!! it has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as i left oz the following month after wrap up party. at that time russell crowe was not the demanded actor he is now and i had no idea it was him until i saw the previous comment then thought back to the days during filming..... amazing... truly delighted with myself now !!!

this story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. as a boy, i enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. books like "call of the wild", "white fang", "the frontiersman" and "my side of the mountain", influenced me tremendously. i wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when i saw this movie on television in 1975. i wanted to be just like "trapper". however, as i got older i found i was just too domesticated to live like that. nonetheless, i still romanticize about living that kind of life. i agree with some other reviews of this movie that the storyline has the simplicity that is quite prevalent in "disneyisque" type movies, but if you can look past the mechanics in which it was made and see the heart of the story, the true themes, then i think you find yourself pleasantly touched. i make it a point to watch this movie once a year. after thirty-one years, i still get a chill running through me when i see torrent of snow rushing down the mountainside and hear the echoing, haunting laugh of the trapper.-good luck old-timer and stay free-ps if you want to read more about the true story, i found this link on the mad trapper of rat river:http://www.mysteriesofcanada.com/nwt/madtrapper.htm

director: tay garnett, ford beebe, cast: mike mazurki, vic christy, fritz ford, tay garnett.based on the number of comments i see on imdb, this seems to be a forgotten movie. this seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that i remember. my mom took me and my little brother to see this film at the garland theater in spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and i still remember it.i am going by memory here but i believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him. i believe it to be set in 1800's alaska. a narrator tells the story of the trapper played by mike mazurki. really, this is a very good film with a great setting. it could be compared to the 1981 film death hunt with charles bronson. the two films have a very similar story line. the main difference between the two is death hunt is an adult orientated film whereas challenge is a family friendly film. mike mazurki and tay garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which i find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of alaska. this was the last film made by tay garnett before he died which was just a few years later. they both had been around since the silent era.

"challenge to be free" was one of the first films i saw as a child. it was also one of the first vhs tapes that i owned. i hadn't seen the movie in years, so yesterday i decided to stick the tape in and watch it. wow. the story is as powerful now as it was the first time i saw it. i think now that i am older i can better apreciate the values that are implanted in the movie. (self-reliance, the value of freedom, and the love of nature) it is a "b" movie, to be sure, but it's one that you'll remember for years, especially if you see it as a child.

this twisted comedy is well acted and directed. very funny and the production quality is outstanding. it is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards.everyone can identify with calvin having a bad day, bad week, bad life. travis davis plays the role superbly! richard moll as tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. the old man adds to the humor of the story. and who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish!this short will bring lots of laughs. and don't miss the credits as they are playing at the end!

when i watch a short like boy-next-door, i find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. on the one hand, i'm happy. i'm watching something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. on the other hand i find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. tv and films are so consistently packed with easy, condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity. then you see someone like davis, who, without the "benefit" of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem. producers and network suits need to turn to the travis davis' out there for material and stop awarding deals to people simply because their resume or agent may demand they should. boy-next-door has, hopefully, gained the attention of the right people to facilitate more work from davis. it's really fun and very well done!

had the pleasure to see this film at the big bear film festival where it won the audience award. and i have to say, it was well deserved because boy next door is a very funny short film! the script is well written and keeps things escalating. it also has a great current of suspense coursing through it. you don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him. the jokes are quick and unexpected. the plot keeps us guessing. the dialog feels very real. i thought the direction was first-rate and the director travis davis shows a lot of potential for making it big in the world of studio comedies. not small praise considering he also is the lead actor of the film, so he had to do triple duty on this, writing, directing and starring. if you get a chance to see this film on itunes, it's worth the download. it'll make you laugh out loud a few times. and that's more than most shorts offer these days.

"boy next door" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. in just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. kudos to travis davis for pulling double duty as both director and star. he's the funniest nebbish since woody allen. and what a treat to see richard moll back again. if you thought all he could do was play "bull" the bailiff on "night court", think again. this gem of a film showcases the brilliantly funny writing of stephen garvey. remember that name. forget charlie kaufman, steve garvey is the true current king of quirky comedy.

i just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow nyc, or any big city of mid-century america. the colors, thecars, the clothes and the coming of the womens movement. it reflects thecomf-cozy attitudes of relationships between men and women in thecorporate world. in some ways, things gave changed and in others, theyhaven't changed at all. women still want what men have today, but theynow have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them. inmy opinion, beautiful women will still throw themselves at men inpursuit of thier goals! the laws we have now against harrassment andall, were passed by unattractive women who wanted an equal chance tocompete with prettier women who might be getting the positions soleybased on thier looks and puting out! the real competition isn't betweenmen and women, but women and women! i liked the look and feel of the movie but the world hasn't changed asfar as what real

watching this hilariously retro but very entertaining career girl tale, i was floored by joan crawford's first appearance. all i could think initially was, "my god, it's the same face as michael jackson in his notorious booking photo!" about 34 minutes into the movie, diane baker and hope lange get out of a cab in greenwich village. as they walk down the street, you can see part of a sign in back of them for the stonewall bar -- scene of the epochal "riots" that are considered the trigger for the modern gay rights movement.speaking of baker and taxis, i had to laugh when she gets into one and tells the cabbie, "56th and sutton place, please -- and be careful of the bumps." can you imagine the reaction to that from a driver in today's manhattan?! she says that, of course, because she's pregnant and doesn't want to hurt the fetus. but that doesn't stop her from jumping out of a moving car when she finds out bob evans wants her to have an abortion! well, they had to find a way for her to lose the baby (1959 and all).sue carson is delightful as mary agnes. why was this her only movie? there is no biographical information on her in imdb.

a sincere tribute to suzy parker, who's just passed away. not only is tboe one of the cheesiest movies ever made, but miss parker's performance is, in this cheesy-movie-lover's opinion, among the worst performances of all time. her last scene is especially overplayed. i loved it!

the best of everything. just what is the best of everything? it is different for everyone but for most of us it is love. but alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love. this story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. but as the saying goes,"we are the captains of our own ships", and so it goes for our lives. we are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives. once we make those choices then we must live with them. as we watch this story and as we see these women making choices that most likely change their lives forever, we wonder, would we make the same choices as these women or would we be wiser? who knows?

fun bad movie which should amuse. one of joan crawford's last performances as the driven successful editor vs. all those young beautiful eager beavers fresh out of the elite seven sister colleges. great '50's ambiance of new york. wonderful period costumes and hairdos. terrific art direction. trite story, but rousting tearjerker. interesting cameo by robert evans as a rich cad.

this is an engrossing woman's drama that men can enjoy. the plot follows a young woman (hope lange) who goes to work for a publisher after college. we can forgive her jump in position from secretary to editor (hey, it's hollywood) and a few other flaws. here is one of the few films in which once big time producer robert evans (here, beautifully depicting a rat with women) appears. it also features a mature joan crawford and terrific supporting cast. check it out.

great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. great production design, appealing stars, great lines ("miss bender, i don't care if you beat it out on a native drum!", says joan crawford's amanda farrow to hope lange when lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). if you've seen this movie panned and scanned on tv and not in the letterboxed version on pay-tv or amc (american movie classics) you haven't really seen it. hopefully, this guilty pleasure of a film will be made available soon on dvd in a letterboxed version and with it's original 4-track stereophonic soundtrack. great opening title sequence that really catches the mood of 1959 new york while johnny mathis sings the "best of everything" theme song in an echo chamber surrounded by a chorus of violins and another chorus of background screamers. miscarriages! insanity! office romance! bitchy cold-hearted bosses! thwarted love! it's all here to enjoy.

the dvd release of this superior made for tv bbc drama is a more than welcome addition to my collection. great acting, gripping story, and wonderful direction all add up to one of the best bbc dramas in years.

what can i say? you expect only the best in drama from the bbc and messiah is not an exception to the rule.messiah is a great thriller, a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. police officer red metcalfe (ken stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events, before more lives are lost.but be warned - despite it's '15' rating (in the uk), messiah is a bit of a gruesome film. some of the murder scenes are similar to those in se7en, and one or two can be really stomach-churning. but if you can withstand that, sit back in your chair and enjoy... although you'll most likely be on the edge of it or hiding behind it.rated '15' by the bbfc for moderate violence and strong horror.

when i read the synopsis for "messiah" in the television guide, i was not prepared for what was in store. the story follows dci metcalfe trying to solve a case of grisly murders being taken out across london. he soon realises a pattern, there is a serial killer on the loose, killing people with similar names and jobs to those of the 12 apostles and their killings are identical to their matching apostle. the two part series kept me right on the edge of my seat, with metcalfe closely pursuing the killer, but always missing him within a couple of seconds and discovering the gruesome mess he has left behind of his ill-fated victim. "messiah" is sure to cause a great deal of controversy, but nonetheless it is the greatest piece of drama the bbc has shown in a long time.

guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the cannes or other film festival and one said "hey, guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria." welllll...it kind of sort of worked. clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example bjoreling's nessun dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the dvd you got more than your money's worth. not every director succeeded but more did than not and the flick seems to improve with each viewing over the years. my favorite is the eerily beautiful love duet from die todt statd; okay a young naked elizabeth hurley is eye candy but her husband singing to her, his wife's ghost, is incredibly beautiful with the love music second only to otello and desdemona's "gia nella notte densa" in all the operatic repertoire. could the flick been better, sure, what couldn't not have been but it's well worth a view especially of you're in a hyper-romantic mood.

i saw this movie in the early 1990's when it had been out on vhs for a little while. at the time, i found it to be interesting, and was especially struck by the ken russell segment, with the visions of the accident victim in triage and surgery.last night, at a 2nd-run showing of the latest indiana jones movie, the vision of john hurt prompted an unexpected flashback to "aria", which i had not thought of in years, and the sudden memory of the russell piece itself was enough to cause an outbreak of tears for a little bit.if i can make this observation, i note with interest the love-hate reaction that people have expressed to the russell segment, and i have found this interesting difference in other movies that delve into deep trauma and its aftereffects. some get it, others do not, interesting.i see by the comments and the rating that the overall work hit people in various ways. this is how it affected and affects me.

definitely worth watching.ten different directors each present a segment based on their favorite opera aria. you don't need to be an opera lover to watch this film. (although, of course, if you hate opera, you're really going to have a bad time with this!)not surprisingly the segments range from brilliant to only fair. most of the fuss seems to be over godard's contribution -- whether you think he's brilliant or pretentious, his segment won't change your mind.some of the pieces have a clear narrative; others are more a montage of connected images.none of the pieces is more than 10 minutes or so; if you're not happy with what's on the screen, wait for the next segment, and think about how much culture you're soaking up.keep your eyes open for performances by buck henry, beverly d'angelo, elizabeth hurley, briget fonda, tilda swinton, and john hurt. (the buck henry segment alone is worth the price of admission).

robert altman, nicolas roeg, john-luc goddard--you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? these and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream, but created it. for those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera--how often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film? it is the mood that counts. this is what i believe the directors of these movies were doing: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. for the most part they succeed wonderfully. with all these operas, who is going to like them all. we could have used more beverly sills.finally, what is art (even opera) without a few naked women?

10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). i'll do each one separately:nicolas roeg (dir)--giuseppe verdi (music). a story about an assassination attempt in 1931 vienna. theresa russell (roegs wife) plays a man! not bad--very beautiful and exotic. russell is great.charles sturridge--verdi. no story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.jean-luc godard--jean baptiste lully. horrendous. pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing. filled with gratuitous female nudity. the worst!julien temple--verdi. buck henry, beverly d'angelo and anita morris star in this funny, if obvious, story about a cheating couple. pretty good.bruce beresford--erich korngold. short, lush and romantic. very good.robert altman--jean-philippe rameau. dull. a yawner.fran roddam--richard wagner. this has bridget fonda in her film debut. beautifully done love story with a fairly explicit sex scene. ken russell--giacomo puccini. really strange but ok.derek jarman--gustave chapentier. lyrical look at youth and old age. very sweet. the last is by bill bryden doing "i pagliacci". he has john hurt (!) dressed as a clown lip-syncing to caruso (!!!).when this came out it almost got an x rating (for the abundant nudity and the sex scene). it was given an r with a strict warning attached saying the r rating would be heavily enforced. after the film bombed that warning disappeared.the idea isn't bad and 6 out of the 10 segments were worthwhile. worth seeing even if you don't like opera. just avoid the godard segment. i'm giving it an 8.

i'm an opera buff, and operas are full of sex, blood and death. it may help to know the librettos of the operas the arias are from to really appreciate this film -- my mileage is very different than tug-3. i am a classical music lover, and i liked this film.i loved ken russell's "nessun dorma" segment, and would actually like to see him produce turandot, because opera is supposed to be overwhelming, truly multi-media experience , but then i loved lisztomania. i love *turandot* and knowing the libretto so well may be why i don't find this segment the travesty that tug-3 did.the buck henry/ rigoletto segment is probably the most approachable for the average viewer -- they are likely to recognize the tunes, and its a classic bedroom farce. i like bedroom farces, so the silliness didn't upset me.the "liebestod" segment is so outstanding that i recommend people watch this for that piece alone. "depuis la jour" was, for me, beautifully spiritual. and the caruso recording of "vesti la giubba" (aka i pagliacci) with john hurt as the clown was wonderful. but people just wanting naked women may feel there is too much music and not enough bare flesh and sex.

sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art-house, live-action fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. omnibus films are always a problem, but i have always had a keen interest in them. i will now rate the segments individually.nicolas roeg - "un ballo in maschera" - this segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. it is difficult to follow, mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a hackneyed one, at that). the photography is unaccomplished. the best thing about it is the bit of lesbian homoerotica that it never does enough with. this segment made me very nervous about continuing. 2/10.charles sturridge - "la virgine degli angeli" - an unclear segment, but it hardly matters. the film has the best cinematography of the bunch, mainly because it is in a stunning black and white. the segment is dreamlike and beautiful. 7/10.jean-luc godard - "armide" - i chose to brave this much-maligned film for the godard and altman segments. with godard, i was much more impressed than i thought i would be. i can't claim to have seen all that many of his films since he made so many that almost no one has seen, but, judging from what i have seen, this may be his best work since the 60s. it is the funniest segment in this film, and the most artistically accomplished. bravo, jean-luc! 9/10.julien temple - "rigoletto" - a very funny segment, it is also quite predictable. still, this story about a husband and wife who are cheating on each other at the same resort is wonderfully filmed with long, complex tracking shots that depend on precisely timed choreography from the actors. it also has a great self-referencing joke about omnibus films themselves. the final scene is very weak. 7/10.bruce beresford - "die tote stadt" - this short segment involves too lovers in (i think) venice. it is pretty, with some nice shots of doves flying about the city. it is slight, but nice. 7/10.robert altman - "les boréades" - not one of the better segments, unfortunately, this is more of a music video than a concept short film. it involves the occupants of an insane asylum attending a theatrical performance. the music and images work well together, so at least i can give it credit for being a good music video. 7/10franc roddam - "liebestod" - somewhat unfortunate for beresford's segment, this segment is very similar to it. as you might assume from my phrasing, this one struck me much more. it is about a young man and his girl going to las vegas on a fatalistic voyage. 8/10.ken russell - "nessun dorma" - maybe the most visually striking segment, it plays in a fantasy world more than in reality. it is a beautiful tale of a fallen angel. 8/10.derek jarman - "depuis le jour" - i have heard a lot about jarman, and this is the first piece of filmmaking i have seen from him. hopefully, i'll see more in the future. this one is also music-videoish, but it is better than altman's segement. it mainly concerns an old woman remembering her younger days. the editing and the use of different film stocks to represent both time and emotion are very beautiful. 8/10.bill bryden - "i pagliacci" - the sad clown, possibly one of the most famous arias (particularly memorable from an episode of seinfeld), this serves as the material separating each segement and the finale. it is simple and effective. 7/10.overall, i give it a solid 7/10. it isn't anywhere near as bad as you've heard.

john barrymore plays a gentleman who is also the thief, arsene lupin. while no one knows for sure this is the case, the inspector (lionel barrymore) is sure of it but cannot prove it. so, lionel spends much of the movie following john--hoping to catch this brilliant and slippery thief.although i liked the film, i really think i had higher expectations for it and thought it might be better than just a very good time-passer. that's because it paired john and lionel barrymore in the film and since these brothers were such dynamic actors, i think i expected sparks and magic but instead only caught glimpses of it here and there. now this is not to say this is a bad film--it certainly isn't. it just didn't rise to the level of being unforgettable or a film i strongly recommend you see. thanks an adequate script, the film is pretty good but i was surprised to hear no french accents at all in the film even though it was supposedly about french people! also, there just wasn't much life in the film until it was nearly complete. the ending was indeed excellent and entertaining--so good that it elevated the film from a 6 to a 7. it's nice to see it ended on a high note.

a remake of the 1916 silent film, based on the 1909 novel by maurice leblanc. the detective series would be made into numerous plays, films and tv series in the uk, the us, and france over the years. this 1932 version starred the smashing barrymore brothers john (as the duke) and lionel (as detective guerchard). they would also star together in grand hotel, dinner at eight, and several others over the next couple years. sonia (karen morley) shows up in the duke's bed during a party in this pre-hayes code film; first the lights go out in the bedroom, then they go out in the main ballroom, then the search is on for the crook and the missing jewelry, as well as other missing valuables... you can tell talkies hadn't been around too long, as they still use caption cards several times. also watch for a new kind of safe that doesn't need a combination. well-thought- out plot, no big holes, but no big surprises here either. not bad for an early talkie film. clever ending.

believe it or not, the mona lisa actually got stolen once, and was missing for nearly two years. in 1911, leonardo da vinci's 'la gioconda' (better known as the mona lisa) was taken from the louvre by a petty thief (and former louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native italy. his actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.) the mona lisa was quietly returned to the louvre on the very last day of 1913, remaining there ever since except for occasional loan-outs. when "arsène lupin" was released in 1932 (twenty years after the theft), most moviegoers would have recalled that 1911 crime, and their knowledge would have lent some plausibility to this movie. "arsène lupin" is quite enjoyable, with mgm's usual high production standards and jack conway's usual briskly efficient direction. this movie does not lack for pleasure; what it lacks is plausibility.john barrymore is the master criminal of the title: he specialises in perpetrating 'impossible' crimes, which he makes even more difficult by announcing them in advance ... but of course he always commits the crime and fools the gendarmes. tully marshall has a good scene as one of barrymore's victims. lupin has a penchant for elaborate disguises, which enables barrymore (a u.s. 'grade a' ham) to indulge his own penchant for tomfoolery. john's older brother lionel barrymore is guerchard, the javert-like surete detective sworn to catch lupin.karen morley was an extremely beautiful actress whose private life was filled with populist political activities; on screen, she was most impressive in working-class roles that fitted her own political beliefs (such as her fine performance in 'our daily bread'). in "arséne lupin", morley's naturally dark hair is bleached a horrid blonde tone, and she's all tarted up in posh outfits that make her look uncomfortable rather than sexy.spoilers coming. eventually, lupin decides to steal the mona lisa from the louvre. he slits the painting from its frame, rolls up the canvas, and then smuggles it out in a flower basket. we see john barrymore casually brandishing a tightly-rolled piece of cloth which is allegedly the greatest work of art in all human history. i had to laugh at the filmmakers' error. in real life (but not in this movie), da vinci painted the mona lisa on a plank of poplar wood, so a thief would have difficulty rolling it up!eventually, guerchard captures lupin and hauls him off to le calaboose. the scene between john and lionel barrymore in the police car is sheer delight, as their genuine affection for each other spills out into their characters' dialogue. i would have found this scene implausible with any two other actors. as it is, i can't imagine anyone but the barrymore brothers playing these roles. well, maybe dennis and randy quaid, but just barely.don't look for a good plot line here, but "arsène lupin" is a delightful example of old-style movie-making. i'll rate this movie 8 points out of 10.

a cranky police detective suspects a french duke of being the infamous thief arsène lupin.john & lionel barrymore costarred together for the first time in a motion picture in this intriguing crime drama. alike and yet so different, they are the perfect counterpoint to each other. john plays his role with suave sophistication (when not in disguise) and lionel is earthy & common in his portrayal, each obviously having a wonderful time trying to out act the other. helped by a generous script, the outcome is pretty much a draw, with the viewer the clear winner.although upstaged by the two male stars, karen morley is intriguing as the mystery woman john finds naked in his bed. tully marshall gives a colorful performance as a silly nobleman with much to lose to the master criminal. henry armetta & george davis are very enjoyable as two seriously inept security guards. john miljan provides a sturdy presence in his small role as the police prefect.movie mavens will recognize an uncredited mischa auer as a guide in the louvre during the climactic scene dealing with an attempted heist of the mona lisa.

having reviewed 3 of the 4 perry and croft sitcoms, i thought i would get them all done now. dads army, is my all time favourite sitcom, it ain't half hot mum is also a classic as is you rang m'lord. i don't regard hi de hi as a classic, but it is still funny.it's about a holiday camp, similar to butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. it is ran by jeffery fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock. the staff include fun entertainment manager ted, his sidekick spike (he ended up being thrown in the swimming pool nearly every episode), yellow coat gladys, careless maid peggy who longed to be a yellow coat and the punch and judy man mr partridge who hates kids. situations occurred mostly round the swimming pool, where someone would be thrown in every episode (with there clothes on of course).not a classic, but still funny. jeffery fairbrother left half way through, so this, a bit like only fools and horses, outstayed its welcome. jimmy perry was actually a red coat at butlins.best episode: peggy's big chance, series 2, episode 2.

i very nearly did not see 'hi-de-hi!'. i think it must have been the title that put me off. in those days, the welsh language editions of 'the radio times' only used to print titles of certain shows without imparting a scrap of information as to what they were actually about. 'hi-de-hi!' suggested to me a bad quiz show hosted by leslie crowther or worse an inane u.s. import. but i managed to catch a later episode, and was surprised to find it written by jimmy perry and david croft.as was the case with 'dad's army' and 'it ain't half hot mum', perry based it on personal experiences, in this case his time at a butlins' holiday camp. before cheap air travel came along in the '60's, these camps sprang up along british coastlines, providing entertainment for working class families and earning millions for their owners.( as a matter of interest, i worked in one such camp in the '80's as a chef - barry island, south wales - known to all and sundry as 'shag land' for reasons i won't go into! )set in the late '50's, it began with university academic jeffrey fairbrother ( simon cadell ) taking over as the entertainments manager of maplin's, a job he was ill equipped to handle. his staff included resident comic ted bovis ( paul shane ), his sidekick spike ( jeffrey holland ), miserable punch and judy man mr.partridge ( leslie dwyer ), snobby ballroom dancers barry ( barry howard ) and yvonne stuart-hargreaves ) diane holland ), and the unforgettable gladys pugh ( ruth madoc ), who lusted after fairbrother at every opportunity. bubbly su pollard stole the show though as cleaner peggy ollerenshaw, whose driving ambition was to be a 'yellowcoat' ( all the important staff members wore them ). a number of sexy girls occupied these coats too, most notably nikki kelly's 'sylvia' and statuesque rikki howard's 'betty'. we never saw joe maplin, the owner. he communicated to his staff in the form of ungrammatical missives, which poor jeffrey was forced to read aloud. "hi-de-hi!" was the campers' greeting, usually met with the equally inane 'ho-de-ho!. one fan was the late sir fred pontin, who told perry and croft that he recognised most of the characters from real life.i always found bovis the most convincing of these as well as the most tragic, like archie rice he was the comedian whose big break never came, reduced to cracking corny gags for the amusement of drunken late-night audiences. he took advantage of his position to indulge in a few perks, and in one memorable episode fairbrother's patience snapped and he sounded him out: "lies, ted! all lies!".as with every other perry/croft series, the cast were excellent, particularly cadell and shane. ruth madoc's prissy 'gladys' got on my nerves ( no wonder anne robinson hates the welsh! ), but leslie dwyer's misanthropic 'mr.partridge' and felix bowness' jockey 'fred qulley' more than compensated. the visual gag everyone remembers is drunken mr.partridge spotting a pantomime horse riding a real one along the beach. looking at the bottle of whiskey in his hand, he decides to stick with it and instead throws away the banana he had been eating! with its frothy blend of '50's nostalgia and saucy gags, 'hi-de'hi' was a big hit for b.b.c.-1 in the '80's, resulting in a massive increase in bookings for butlins and pontins. it went downhill when cadell left to return to the theatre though. i never took to his replacement, squadron leader clive dempster ( david griffin ). worse, leslie dwyer's death robbed the show of one of its best characters. kenneth connor was brought in to replace him as 'uncle sammy'.the period setting occasionally caused problems; in one episode, sylvia and betty had to dive into the pool to rescue peggy who for some reason was dressed as a shark. the revealing costumes they wore were wrong for that era. still they looked great in them so who's complaining? in another, ted sang the tom jones hit 'delilah' to campers. it was not composed ( by les reed and barry mason, incidentally ) until 1968.maplins closed its doors in 1988, and the last shot was that of peggy ( now a yellowcoat ) all alone in the camp, jumping into the air and shouting ( what else? ) 'hi-de-hi!'. i don't rate it as highly as perry and croft's other shows but its popularity is undeniable. it was probably one of the last british sitcoms to generate tremendous public affection, mainly because it featured likable characters in a recognisable setting. goodnight campers!

i get really fed up with sitcoms; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. on the other hand, hi de hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny. i have just purchased the second set of the series, (series 3 -4)and i am surprised at just how much i am enjoying it all - again. i have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait. the gems that have come from this series and the respect that the actors achieved through it speak for themselves. croft and perry created some pure gold some of which shines through hi de hi.

based to some extent on writers, david croft and jimmy perry's, own experiences as butlins holiday camp entertainers in the uk during the same timescale the programme follows, "hi-de-hi!" epitomises the 'slapstick, postcard humour" of post-war britain. set in the fictitious seaside town of crimpton-on-sea, "hi-de-hi" chronicles the comedic goings on within the maplins holiday camp - one of many dotted along the british coast owned by the mega-rich, but never seen (on screen) joe maplin.although the actual show began in 1980 with the pilot episode and ran until 1988 when the bbc deemed it too tame for it's cutting edge comedy department, seasons 1-5 focused on 1959 while seasons 6-9 spotlighted 1960 - a time when the old style british holiday camp began to fall into decline. during the first 5 seasons, jeffrey fairbrother (played brilliantly by the late, great simon cadell) was the camp's entertainment manager; a well meaning, yet slightly pensive ex-university professor breaking free of his upper class background and venturing into the "real" world to head his team of entertainment staff who were in stark contrast to his own laid-back personality. from season 6 onwards, fairbrother was replaced by clive dempster (played by david griffin when cadell quit the show at the height of it's popularity), an ex-raf war hero who, in many ways, was similar to cadell's character in background, but more a scoundrel than a gentleman.however, the real stars of "hi-de-hi" throughout the nine seasons were ted bovis (played superbly by paul shane), a stereotypical working class, ale drinking, bawdy comic - someone who could never resist an opportunity to fiddle the campers; gladys pugh (played by ruth madoc who's currently experiencing a career comeback with appearances in the hit bbc comedy, "little britain"), chief yellowcoat (what the entertainment staff were called because of their bright yellow jackets) and sports organiser - but more importantly, the one person who saved jeffrey fairbrother and clive dempster from embarrassment by covering up their inexperience in running a holiday camp; peggy ollerenshaw (su pollard), the slightly dopey, yet lovable lowly chalet maid with a burning ambition to become a yellowcoat, and spike dixon (jeffrey holland), ted's innocent protégé learning more about 'show business' than he hoped for.as usual with a croft & perry production, the assembled cast of characters were a bunch of misfits played superbly by the actors involved. mr. partridge (played by the late leslie dwyer, who was in his 70's by the time he left the show), the alcoholic child-hating children's entertainer; fred quilly (felix bowness), a former champion jockey with a dubious past; yvonne & barry stuart-hargreaves (dianne holland & barry howard), the snobbish former ballroom dancing champions who were in the twilight of their careers; and sylvia and betty (nikki kelly and rikki howard), the two main girl yellowcoats who were always looking for the type of fun joe maplin would never allow in one of his camps."hi-de-hi" typified the slapstick era of the late 50s with it's saucy and, to a certain degree, vulgar "tongue-in-cheek" humour (jokes about people sitting on toilets and anecdotes about 'women with big knockers' were the order of the day). but despite it's whiff of "carry on" funniness, it was always so innocent and became something of recommended family viewing back in the 80's. of course, the critics of the show remarked that the show had outstayed it's welcome by a good couple of years, but i disagree. while the early seasons focused mainly on bawdiness and slapstick humour, the latter series of "hi-de-hi" saw more thought put into the scripts and the main characters (especially spike dixon & gladys pugh) were able to grow with more sensitive story lines. that said, there were a few criticisms of the show. clive dempster was no jeffrey fairbrother, and the former didn't quite have the on-screen chemistry with gladys as jeffrey did (i personally think it would've been more believable if gladys had married jeff); five seasons dedicated to 1959 and four to 1960 caused more than just a few continuity errors (the disappearance of old faces and introductions of new characters weren't explained properly, especially with the yellowcoats who came and went with much regularity; and the character of gladys pugh, who, in the pilot episode was made out to be a free-loving man-eater that was suddenly transformed into a naive virgin like character! also to mention quite pedantically, most of the 1959 holiday season was covered in season one, so to stretch the rest of the year out in five further series was something bordering unbelievable. still, the show wasn't meant to be meticulously looked upon, and the comedy more than outweighed it's flaws.all in all, "hi-de-hi" was probably one of the last comedies from the bbc's golden period, and even if it never managed to rival such british comedic mainstays as "only fools & horses", "porridge" or even "last of the summer wine", "hi de hi" will be best remembered as a comedy the whole family could enjoy. if you haven't already checked it out for yourself, i implore you to do so.

bounty killer george hilton, smooth mexican bandit gilbert roland (who's great), and bank representative edd byrnes each try to outwit one-another while searching for a large amount of gold from one of roland's train robberies that was hidden by a treacherous member of his gang.though not the greatest that the genre has to offer, it's still breezy enough with a lot of light-hearted, action-filled fun and a satisfying finale.any gun can play is mainly remembered for it's opening gag where george hilton easily guns down three outlaws resembling clint eastwood, lee van cleef, and django.the next year, hilton and roland were reunited alongside van heflin and klaus kinski in the highly recommended the ruthless four.

"any gun can play" (1967), directed by enzo g. castellari, is a very good pastiche of spaghetti westerns, especially leone's. the first half is great, which, apart from the opening which is a direct nod to "for a few dollars more", with monco, colonel douglas mortimer and el indio lookalikes walking into a ghost-town and then promptly killed by a bounty hunter called "the stranger", is entirely serious, with great gunfights (especially the train-robbing scene), fast and furious action and nice performances from gilbert roland, george hilton and (who manages well, considering that he is badly miscast) edd byrnes. but then, when the film reaches the half-way mark, there is a jokey fist-fight between hilton and byrnes. it isn't very funny, and is the weakest part of the film, but it throws everything you have seen previously in a new light. you realise that in fact the whole thing is a spoof of spaghetti western conventions, and in retrospect, the first half is so well done that you completely miss this spoof undercurrent. what now follows is a more obvious parody, with even some acrobatic jumping around from brynes that predates all those seventies circus westerns. the ending, a complete send-up of "the good, the bad and the ugly" climax, is very well done, as in other hands it could have been very silly. so, a pretty fun spaghetti western, that doesn't take itself too seriously. i would recommend it to anyone who likes spaghetti westerns.

a train holding union soldiers is transporting $300,000 of gold, along with a banker clayton, who's there to see it reaches its destination, but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit monetero. however bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when monetero tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. the only clue is that of a medallion, but monetero is captured and soon would be executed. a stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold. in exchange monetero gives him half of the medallion, but clayton notices it and discovers something is up. soon all three are crossing each other for the gold, but also the bank's insurance company and monetero's gang are watching on, waiting for their chance to pounce.just watching the opening sequence you'll know you're in for a spaghetti western with a tongue-in-cheek style and a reliance of sprinkling many references (some nicely realised) from other films (largely the dollar trilogy) of its sub-genre. director enzo castellari's sprightly direction is sprawling and mostly lightweight, but there's potential in many of his grand, showy set pieces and smooth rhythmic pace. largely there's a lot of tussles, fist-fights (and plenty of acrobatic stunts) taking place, compared with all-out vicious shootouts. however most of these stunts are very well done, and very enjoyable and when the guns are blazing there's energy to burn. the traditional story sticks close to conventional details, but since there's a lot of conniving and outfoxing going on, the spontaneous nature makes sure you're never quite certain how it's eventually going to play out between the three. this leads up to many effective suspenseful moments, clever twists, and plenty of wink, wink. the humour within the starch script is pretty sly. worked in favourably amongst the light and zesty style, is giovanni bergamini's dynamically taut framing and francesco de masi's impulsively rousing music score. the performances are extremely well tailored and form a striking rapport. george hilton's wry and scuffed turn is solid as the ambiguous stranger. gilbert roland brings class and intelligence to his formidable mexican bandit monetero. edd byrnes gives a poised performance as clayton, that holds up well. kareen o'hara doesn't get much to do, but is a worthy looker. gerard herter, pedro sanchez and ivano staccioli provide able support.a fun and worthy spaghetti parody/homage that throws one curve-ball after another and many fruitful down 'n' dirty antics.

this enjoyable euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that sergio leone wanted to shoot for "once upon a time in the west" but couldn't persuade clint eastwood to appear in. three tough-looking gunfighters ride into a town. one is dressed like the man with no name in a poncho. another is dressed like colonel mortimer from "for a few dollars more," and the third is garbed like django, except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. our hero meets them in main street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins. "any gun can play" is a spaghetti western with an in-joke on spaghetti westerns since the hero here wipes out the three killers. aside from a little too much comedy, especially in the acrobatic fight sequences, this is an above-average oater.the notorious mexican outlaw montero (gilbert roland of "barbarosa") and his gang of trigger-happy pistoleros rob an army train transporting $300-thousand dollars in gold coins across the frontier. director enzo g. castellari of "inglorious bastards" stages the hold up from a variety of camera angles that thrust you into the forefront of the action. the bandits seize the locomotive along with the coach carrying the gold and separate it from the rest of the train that houses the u.s. cavalry. while montero and his gunmen keep the cavalry pinned down, pajondo (pedro sanchez of "sabata") commandeers the locomotive, kills the engineer and his crew and trundles it away, leaving the other pistoleros behind to fend for themselves. essentially, pajondo double-crosses montero and steals the gold for himself. later, montero catches up with pajondo at the rio grande. before the bandit can reveal the whereabouts of the loot to montero, however, a cavalry sergeant shoots pajondo dead. before he dies, pajondo tells montero about a medallion that serves as a clue about where he stashed the treasure. the irate cavalry captain (ivano staccioli of "commandos") imprisons montero, but he cannot loosen the bandit's tongue even after he uses his whip on him. infuriated by montero's reticence, the captain threatens to have the mexican shot if he doesn't talk. meanwhile, the jailers let a priest speak to montero, but he really isn't a priest. the six-gun toting stranger (george hilton of "the ruthless four") masquerades as a man of the cloth and rescues montero from a firing squad. unfortunately, before montero is rescued, clayton (edd byrnes of tv's "77 sunset strip") takes the medallion away from him and keeps it for himself. clayton is the bank representative that was sent to safeguard the gold. he is horrified that the captain wants to shoot montero. clayton's career at the bank hinges on his ability to recover the gold. the stranger stages a fire at the fort to distract the firing squad and montero takes the captain as hostage and tries to escape, but the stranger shoots him off the horse. before the authorities can verify that montero is dead, the stranger claims the body for the handsome reward he will receive and he rides out with the captain's gracious thanks. no sooner have they left the fort than montero's men show up to rescue him from the stranger. from this point on, the stranger, montero, and clayton forge short-lived alliances among each other as they search for the gold. castellari and scenarist tito carpi, who has penned a number of spaghetti westerns such as "a few dollars for django" and another castellari oater "seven winchesters for a massacre," rely on clever humor and surprise reversals to keep the action fresh and fast-paced. one cool scene has clayton seated at a table about to eat his meal when he hears some suspicious sounds from behind him. clayton pours his drink on the table and sees the gunmen behind him with holstered six-guns."any gun can play" lives up to its title. in fact, many guns do play, and at least twenty or more corpses pile up before fade-out. this western isn't so much a parody as it is a knock-off of sergio leone's "the good, the bad, and the ugly." mind you, bad guys and good guys fall as frequently as ten-pins in a bowling alley, but their deaths aren't depicted in the brutal fashion of a leone western. "any gun can play" doesn't take itself as seriously as the aforementioned leone masterpiece. the three leads jockey back and forth for supremacy. each has a piece of the puzzle that will lead them to the treasure, but they refuse to share their information until the shoot'em up finale. lenser giovanni bergamini's colorful widescreen photography is spectacular, especially the opening shots of the train chuffing along railway tracks with distant mountain peaks rearing up dramatically in the background. another great shot occurs when montero tests the stranger's imperturbable calm. this scene happens after the stranger has rescued montero and the mexican's minions arrive to save their chieftain's bacon. confiscating the stranger's six-gun, montero takes aim at the poncho-clad tough guy and empties the revolver, placing his well-aimed bullets harmlessly in and around the unflinching gunslinger. bergamini, who photographed castellari's world war ii thriller "inglorious bastards," frames the scene with the stranger in the background and his pistol in montero's hand in the foreground for a pleasing, three-dimensional style shot. meanwhile, francesco de masi's lively orchestral soundtrack is as memorable for its own idiosyncratic melodies as ennio morricone's soundtracks were for the leone westerns. the opening song is reminiscent of a 1950's hollywood western with its catchy lyrics and guitar riffs. although it isn't a major spaghetti western, "any gun can play" is always entertaining nonsense with interesting plot twists and good performances, especially the indefatigable gilbert roland who was 62 years old at the time!

a gang of bandits lead by the shrewd, rugged, ruthless monetero (a perfectly imposing performance by gilbert roland) steals $300,000 worth of gold coins during a daring train robbery. but untrustworthy member bahunda (an amusing turn by jose torres) makes off with the coins and hides them. unfortunately, bahunda gets killed before he can tell monetero where he stashed the booty. so monetero has to join forces with cunning, cocky, enigmatic bounty hunter the stranger (smoothly played by the handsome george hilton) and cagey, corrupt banker clayton (a delightfully weaselly portrayal by 50's teen idol eddie "kookie" burns) to find the coins. skillfully directed by enzo g. castellari, with a clever, complex and twist-laden script by castellari, tito carpi, and giovanni simonelli, a playfully amoral and nihilistic tone (everyone keeps double and triple crossing each other with happily greedy abandon), a twangy, flavorsome, spirited score by alessandro alessandroni and francesco de masi, plenty of stirring shoot-outs and rousing rough'n'tumble fisticuffs, a wickedly sly sense of self-mocking humor, a steady pace, and a real doozy of a surprise ending, this giddy and often hilarious feature makes for an inspired send-up of sergio leone's "the good, the bad and the ugly." popping up in nifty secondary parts are the luscious stefanie careddu as monetero's fiery gal pal marisol, ivano staccioli as a hard-nosed army captain, and gerard herter as flinty lawman lawrence blackman. an immensely amusing and enjoyable romp.

"when i die, someone will bury me. and if they don't, what's the difference. who gives a damn, huh?" thus the philosophy of life (or lack there of) is summed up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun spin off of sergio leone's "dollars trilogy." in the opening scene, three obviously evil gunmen ride into a western town and, with menacing glares, they intimidate all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes. the observant watcher will notice that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to characters from leone's for a few dollars more. there is one guy in eastwood's poncho, one in lee van cleef's black suit, and one seeming to act like gian marie volonte's indio. but this movie is not about these guys. no sooner do they ride into town when they are gunned down by someone even cooler than they, a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the stranger.no. this is an altogether different story.in an obvious copying of leone's the good, the bad, and the ugly, three gunmen are again vying for a hidden treasure. once again there is the bounty hunter and the mexican bandit. the stranger (george hilton) is a supercool bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people while dressed up like a priest. he is after the reward for the bandit monetero (gilbert roland). but when monetero's gang steals three hundred thousand in gold coins, the stranger gets sidetracked from his normal line of work.to round off the trio there is edd byrne's corrupt bank executive, clayton. he too wants the money for himself. but after the money is hidden away, the only man who knows where it is gets shot. now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest. the game is too find the treasure before anyone else does. and any gun can play.with plenty of gunfights, fist fights, and double crosses, the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff, a three way draw for the hidden treasure ala the good, the bad, and the ugly -- but with a twist.this movie is not as good as leone's films, of course, but in the end who gives a damn, huh? this movie is fun -- 60s nihilism, spaghetti western style. there are no rules, no enduring loyalties, and no right or wrong -- just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it. and, though the movie is not classic, the ending surely is. hey, maybe we all can get along after all, for a hundred thousand a piece.if you like spaghetti westerns, check this one out. it is fast, furious, and worth the look. my name is evren buyruk from crestline california

george hilton never really grabs me like franco nero or clint eastwood, but this is a great outing for him. basically rippin off the django/man with no name and doing a damn good job. the opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch. fans of the genre will be in heaven.

leonard maltin gave this film a dreaded bomb rating in his 1995 movie and video guide. what film was he looking at? kid vengeance or god's gun are bombs. this film is a delight. it is fantastic. it is literate. it is well mounted. it is beautiful photographed, making a brilliant use of colors. right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is a well-done satire of the whole spaghetti western genre. the film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with homages to douglas fairbanks, 77 sunset strip, and the famous showdown in the good, the bad, and the ugly. edd byrnes, george hilton, and gilbert roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work. it is too bad mr. maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved. one can only guess as to his reason. i suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and was expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be. kudos belong to everyone involved in this project. this film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire.

- a group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying. in their escape, the bandits split up. the one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. three men have a different part of the "clue" that will lead to the gold. can the banker, the bandit, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot? or, will they kill each other first? - the plot is an obvious take-off of leone's the good, the bad, and the ugly. various scenes in the movie are also lifted from other films by leone, corbucci, and more. but, to me, it's done in a way that doesn't show disrespect to the original work. instead, any gun can play lovingly parodies some of the biggest films in spaghetti western history. the opening scene of three men riding into town and the final face-off between the three main stars are a wonderful homage to the sws that came before.- castellari adds a lot of nice touches of his own - the reflection in the spilled wine, the stranger's entrance with the vivid red background, and the playful way the gold is discovered in the end. although highly unbelievable, many of the fight scenes are well staged and directed. two fight scenes in particular (the market fight and the bath house fight) are very nicely done. he is also unafraid to try different things with his camera. tight close-ups, overhead shots, and shots around corners are all common in any gun can play.- another plus is the cast that castellari had to work with. george hilton is always good in these movies. gilbert roland is literally playing gilbert roland. and sw newcomer edd byrnes holds his own with the two sw veterans. the supporting cast features, among others, sw regular gerard herter.- any gun can play should not be taken too seriously. nice touches of humor can be found throughout the movie. if this is possible with an sw, it's more of a "feel good" movie - very reminiscent of some of the terence hill / bud spencer films.

i like "hack." think the "lone ranger" reincarnated as a 2000s cab driver, a decent but flawed guy, in philadelphia doing his best, while seeking to work out issues from a troubled past, and you've got the synopsis. david morse is nearly perfect as olshansky. he helps people but instead of riding "silver" in the old west he drives a cab through the mean streets of contemporary philly, without handing out silver bullets. the supporting cast is first class and well above average. at times, the witty dialog almost reaches the level of that 70s classic series, "the rockford files." this show deserves a return, hopefully in a better time slot than 9pm friday(eastern).

i love this show. it's clever and very well acted. david morse and andre braugher have great chemistry. the writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief. after every new episode, i'm always amazed how thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this show is. my only complaint would be donna murphy's absence, at this point, in the second season. as david morse ex-wife, heather, she added such character to the show.i think this show is a credit to the crime/drama genre. with that said - i can not for the life of me understand why this show has such a low rating. would someone please who gave this show a 1 rating back it up with a critique?

i am sick of series with young and clueless people, talking about their "problems" all the time, self centered, boring and absolutely annoying (popular; dawson's creek; beverly hills; etc). "hack" is a breath of fresh air, with a great actor (david morse), a completely different plot, credible people with real problems (thank god !!) and very, very good histories. i just love it!! i hope "hack" will go on for a long time, because it is a great television series for grown up people, for a change.

david morse and andre braugher are very talented actors, which is why i'm trying so hard to support this program. unfortunately, an irrational plot, and very poor writing is making it difficult for me. i'm hoping that the show gets a serious overhaul, or that the actors find new projects that are worthy of them.

certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time. excellent original music, clever, heady...it's hard to be articulate about something this good. there isn't one character that you don't instantly love to watch- myronex "putney, there's trouble in the black room!" "my name is rufus." the lines, thrown away left and right, are classics themselves, recalling slapshot, caddyshack, anchorman, repoman, dolemite, any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set-up punchline variety. "putney, myronex called you tasteless!" "my organization is pro-integration..." "where's lopez? 'he's in my head'" they don't sound brilliant until you hear them in the context of the scene. ...this movie will eat your brain, it's too good. i've read reviews calling this film racist, which couldn't be farther from the truth. every scene is gold, from the etherial cereal commercial to the brothers in the black room meeting to that haunting trumpet in the closing scene. one word - genius.

jarl and moodysson are part of an dying breed of political film makers. the swedish population should appreciate that they try to uncover the truth when the government and media actively distorts and cover up the events surrounding the eu meeting in gothenburg. it is absolutely heartbreaking to see how these innocent kids have been abused and drugged by the swedish police and convicted to prison in political trials for sending text messages and as revenge for others actions. the only unfortunate thing about this movie is that it will not reach the broad masses in sweden as it will only be shown it theaters and not be released on video or aired on television.the political film is important as it can bring new perspectives and insight into complex issues and has a role to play as an educator of the masses.

this documentary focuses on the happenings in gothenburg 2001. in swedish media the demonstrators where pictured as criminals that stood for anarchy and violence. this movie shows that there not, actually they are intelligent, articulate people that has something to say - and says it by the force of bricks. they believe in a better world, a world where people can think and say what they want - without being aimed at. but are their beliefs of having the possibility of changing the society realistic? i think not.this documentary gives us enlightenment in the issues of greed, capitalism and the future it might bring. it is a great documentary that is not propaganda, because it is not shown as what they say is right. everything it shows is what some individuals think and it is up to the viewer to decide if what they do and stand for is right or wrong.i have heard many people that labels this a propaganda and therefor chooses not to view it, i think they are making a bad decision because even if you sympathize with the police or the demonstrators belief, all you get is more facts to rely on, for example the kid that got shoot says that he thinks that it is good to throw a brick through a mcdonalds window because it is the step between thinking and acting as you think.overall this movie freaked me out because you cannot really dismiss the facts that the few policemen, that fought violence with violence, did not get convicted or even detained in custody even however the proof of them throwing bricks at the demonstration march (and in some cases beating people with truncheon, even though they are lying on the street without making resistance) where as good as it gets.rating: 8/10 - very good, but not best!

at times, the mainstream news media seems to be driven by a bunch of no-brain reporters. in that they just listen to each other and report what others report. this documentary shows what can be found if some more effort is put into the task of reporting about something. true journalism should be about providing the people with different perspectives on things that happen so that they have a fair chance of creating an own opinion. this documentary together with mainstream media reports, will help you with this. at least for me, it provided a lot of relevant information regarding the purpose/motivation behind the nowadays frequent world-wide protests at different political summits.

this is a film that everyone who lives in sweden should watch. the film shows the political riots who took place in gothenburg in 2001 from a new perspective. it features interviews with those who were convicted where those people gets the first chance after the riots, to tell their side of the story and why they think the world can be a so much better place to live in and be a part of. i react emotionally when i see this, since i just feel so mad about how those people were treated both during the riots but also after the riots.i hope as many as possible gets to see this movie, as it really gets your mind thinking: is this possible? in sweden, a democracy, in 2001?

i watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was. i was looking forward to it after reading the plot (even though i find nirvana overrated). it sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that. jansen puts in little touches like the books (kubrick book among others), movie posters, etc. i like when i see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film. and you can really feel that in this. there are tons of scenes and moments that i love, i am trying to think now of some other films that are like this and i would say the only thing i can think of are cameron crowe films. takes little moments and makes them stand out and special. the soundtrack is amazing and each song works perfectly with the scenes and feel of the film. this film is amazingly shot, and the editing is outstanding. i could really go on and on about the film. i cannot recommend this enough really. if you want a fun story with great tunes from a director who clearly put his heart into his work then check this out.

set in and near a poor working class town in the mountains of rural italy, it's a story of madness. the landscape may be quite picturesque, but there's madness herein, concealed behind the mask of a person who seems outwardly normal. this person kills little children.in style and tone this film resembles dario argento's famous italian giallos, those fascinating whodunit horror films, except that argento's films are much better looking. still, the visuals in fulci's "don't torture a duckling" are competent, with some interesting compositions and lighting. lightning and thunder on a rainy night enhances suspense in one sequence wherein one of the "ducklings" is vulnerably alone.in one sequence the gore is a bit overdone. but this is no slasher film. a legitimate theme undergirds the story. and that theme is that madness can take many unexpected forms, not just the obvious delusions of people who practice voodoo or black magic.plenty of red herrings render the puzzle solution difficult if the viewer doesn't assume an agenda on the part of the director. don't dismiss someone who might not seem to be a suspect. the twist near the end provides good misdirection. however, in one scene midway through, a line of dialogue could have been added to clarify the relationship between two characters, one of whom is the murderer. the film's finale takes place on a beautiful mountaintop with the wind whistling in the background. we see flashbacks to clues and get insights into the killer's mindset.i don't care for the film's widescreen projection. but background music is effective, and ranges from jarringly creepy at the beginning to low-key jazz, to indigenous italian songs. acting is generally average, though in a couple of cases, it's a bit overdone.though not as visually brilliant as argento's giallos, "don't torture a duckling" nevertheless is a fine film, one that contains a thematic storyline and enough of a whodunit puzzle to interest most viewers who like thrillers and murder mysteries.

if you are one of those people that think lucio fulci is all about gore, guts and zombies, you have to watch this (and "the psychic" too, for that matter). even though the film does include some quite brutal scenes of violence, and a unsettling subject matter, it's not the main thing here. this is a truly impressive, story and character-driven murder mystery that might well be the director's masterpiece. here, he proves that he's a real craftsman, creating a memorable, disturbing yet strikingly beautiful masterpiece, filled with creepy catholic imagery and interesting social commentary. it also has a great cast, including the gorgeous barbara bouchet, as well as tomas millan (from beatrice cenci) and irene pappas in a small but important role. still, it is brazilian actress florinda bolkan (who also stared in fulci's bizarre "lizard in a woman's skin") who steals the scene in the role of majara, giving an excellent performance of a woman driven insane by her superstitions, and her vicious murder scene is particularly heartbreaking. the second star of the movie is sergio d'ofizi's cinematography who, along with the melancholic morricone-esquire score by riz ortolani, help bringing the "secluded italian village with a dark secret" setting to life. i have to admit thought that the dummy head hitting the rocks kind of pulled me off, but nonetheless, this is a definite italian horror classic - a moving, sad and ultimately thought provoking work of genius. 10/10 for me. if you liked this one, i recommend watching alfred sole's "alice, sweet alice", as they are somewhat similar, and are both underrated gems.

the name "lucio fulci" congers up images of graphic death and mutilation in the minds of may fans. thanks to movies like "zombi 2", "city of the living dead", "the beyond" and "the new york ripper", fulci has a reputation for being one of the goriest directors in history. and although many of his later movies certainly justify his reputation until the release of "zombi 2" in 1979 fulci's films did not contain anywhere near the amount of blood and guts he's know for, in fact they were for the most part gore free, instead relying on more traditional shocks and disturbing imagery to work. "don't torture a duckling" hardly contains any gore, yet ranks as his best."don't torture a duckling" is set in a small sicilian town where superstition rules instead of logic. the townsfolk are very distrustful of outsiders as well as anyone different, often shunning them. after a series of child murders though many people descend upon the town, including andrea martelli (thomas milan) who tries to uncover the truth about the murders while they continue to happen.this is a remarkable film. it's very well made with an excellent cast filled with many favorites of italian exploitation cinema. it also contains a solid score as well as many creative camera movement courtesy or lucio fulci. but the real draw of "don't torture a duckling" is the disturbing nature of the movie. little kids, around twelve years old are shown mocking retarded people, visiting prostitutes and being propositioned sex by an older woman. it also contains some very biting commentary on the middle class and the catholic church. it is for reasons like this that "don't torture a duckling" was blacklisted throughout europe when it was first released and never was shown in the united states. still, "don't torture a duckling" stands as a monumental achievement in giallo cinema as well as lucio fulci's best work. i really can't recommend this one enough, check it out.

if you like who-dun-its, you will like this film, considered the best italian detective story (giallo), fulci has done.it's not mickey spillane for sure. there are scenes designed to disturb anyone.many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. she was joking, but she was naked nonetheless, and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones. she also tries to tempt the local priest.young boys are turning up missing, and there are several interesting suspects. you have to watch carefully to discover the killer. can you? don't jump on the first guy, it's way too early, and he is too obvious.anyone familiar with fulci will be able to guess the killer, who died a violent death at the end. what crazy reasoning he had.

being a seasoned fan of italian thrillers and directors dario argento, mario bava, sergio martino and aldo lado, i thought of lucio fulci as an overrated hack. i had seen the beyond which i think is totally overrated, i found the new york ripper to be simply appalling and i didn't particularly like the house by the cemetery. these three movies left me to conclude that fulci is the least interesting of these italian filmmakers. but my stubbornness prevailed and i had to check out more of his films. city of the living dead was a film i found very interesting but don't torture a duckling is very nearly a masterpiece.set in a small town in the italian countryside in a repressive religious community where young boys are being murdered. the authorities are clueless as to who's behind these crimes, especially after their prime suspect has been cleared. an eager young reporter along with a rather slutty girl (who seduces young boys) investigate and eventually get to the bottom of it.brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a good cast (not always the case with 70's italian thrillers) make don't torture a duckling a crackling good thriller. the plot is well constructed, not easily figured out and the end conclusion is very satisfying. fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of repression and guilt in a very unforgiving and ignorant community and creates some very strong visuals, particularly in a scene where a woman gets beaten to death by some local townsfolk. fulci's social commentary concerning religion and innocence are quite edgy and every aspect is well handled. when thinking of his zombie flicks and his ultra violent giallo new york ripper it's amazing how well he balances his critique with explicit violence and makes an even stronger point. so far i haven't seen any fulci film made as professionally as this one.while not a traditional giallo film, duckling has many of the genre's trademarks. fulci displays complete control over the format, only once going overboard with an unconvincing gore-moment, but overall he seems to be even better at making mysteries than full blown gore epics. the extreme scenes here are much more powerful and really pack a punch.so far don't torture a duckling is fulci's best film by far in my opinion. edgy social commentary combined with explicit scenes of violence and a crackling good mystery to boot.

don't torture a duckling (lucio fulci - italy 1972).definitely a prime candidate for the most insane movie title ever conceived and that's quite an achievement in giallo-land. originally, the film was titled even more absurdly, "don't torture donald duck", literally translated from its italian title. a small donald duck figure features briefly as a toy, but hardly enough to render a title like this, but, apparently, it was changed in fear of legal ramifications by disney. i railed quite a bit against fulci's earlier lizard in a woman's skin (1971), but here all the right ingredients are present. a surprisingly effective mystery, a good cast and imaginatively shot against an unusual rural setting. everything just clicks. i think it's justly hailed as one of the director's most accomplished achievements.the story is set against the backdrop of a small mountain-side town in sicily, where someone is killing young teenage boys. among the suspects, the most obvious one is a young woman, maciara (florinda balkan), a self-proclaimed witch who is seen suspiciously unearthing the skeleton of a baby and sticking pins into way effigies. guiseppe, the village idiot is under suspicion as well, since he made a feeble attempt to profit from the disappearance of one of the boys and walked right into their trap. by the time a quick-witted newshound (tomas milian) arrives from milan to cover the murders, he immediately begins to question the authorities' assumptions, when he meets two other potential suspects: don alberto, the local priest (marc porel) with a high-minded attitude, and patrizia (barbara bouchet), a bored young woman from the city with a troubled past of drug offense, who also fancies having sexual relations with the young boys in town. talk about your prime red herring.fulci nicely contrasts modernity and tradition with the newly constructed elevated highway meandering through the sicilian hills, past old towns where life is still firmly rooted in tradition and superstition. one could debate about the film's political stance as the north versus the south, or as commentary on small-town virtues - society's conventions in general - that are all too often dangerously close to tipping over into moral disintegration, chaos and - ultimately - self-justice by the populace. the film has often been lambasted because of its anti-catholic tone, but it's hardly an important element here, except for obvious plot-related reasons, which would be giving away too much. it's actually rather tame compared to a film like joël seria's don't deliver us from evil (1971). probably, the film's rather unflattering portrayal of small-town sicilian values (when another boy is killed, the local populace are depicted as a retarded lynch-mob) might be cause for some offense in sicily, but - considering sicily's problematic relation with the rest of italy - hardly problematic for other italians, i would think. the film vanquished into obscurity far too quickly to have much impact anyway.when talking fulci, the amount of gore is usually a prime subject for discussion. although eyes-gouging scenes are lacking, the film does contain two very graphic scenes. in the gross-out finale, the killer falls of a cliff, smashing his face along the rocks on the way down with gruesome results (albeit, not very realistic). and the chain-whipping sequence with florinda balkan in the graveyard shows fulci's penchant for sadistic violence and typically, he's not holding back at graphically showing what most film-makers would merely hint at. surely, one of the most horrifying scenes in fulci's repertoire. above all, this is a taut, well-written, effective little mystery, nicely lensed by fulci, with an impressive cast of genre-regulars like barbara bouchet, marc porel (not very convincing as a priest), tomas milian and florinda balkan (mouth-foamingly crazy as the town's witch).camera obscura --- 8/10

lucio fulci's "don't torture a duckling" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys.this surprisingly well-directed film(especially in comparison to later fulci's gorefests)is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity,nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence.the soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms;bruno's near-seduction by the naked patrizia(barbara bouchet)really has to be seen to be believed.highly recommended-especially in pair with my another cult favourite "house with the windows that laugh"(1976).

in a small, picturesque sicilian village, someone is brutally killing young, sexually curious boys. the local police force keep busy trying to track the killer and whittle the list down to five or so main suspects, including voyeuristic village retard giuseppe (vito passeri) and an elusive, grungy, voodoo doll-poking backwoods witch named maciara (florinda bolkan). there's also don alberto (marc popel), a handsome young priest who runs the local boy's school, andrea (tomas milian), a journalist helping to aid the police, and the beautiful patrizia (barbara bouchet), a gorgeous, but seriously screwed-up drug addict who seems to have a thing for very (i mean, very) young boys. as typical with the giallo subgenre, the plot won't be fully revealed until the last few frames, but if you can hang in there long enough, this film pays off. the script (written by fulci, gianfranco clerici and roberto gianviti) keeps red herrings to a minimum and will keep you interested and the story is ably supported by excellent location work, cinematography (by sergio d'offizi) and musical score (by riz ortolani). the acting, particularly bolkan, is also very good. fulci fans who were weaned on his 80s grotesqueries like the beyond and zombie will find more artistry and less gore on display here than they might anticipate, but they'll still enjoy a particularly nasty chain whipping scene in a cemetery (bizarrely, yet effectively, set to singer ornella vanoni's ballad "quei giorni insieme a te") and a long tumble down a rocky embankment that fulci liked so much that he reused it in his film the psychic (1977). scenes of the children being killed is mainly kept off screen (except for a brief strangulation), but the camera doesn't hesitate to linger on their corpses. the film was not released theatrically in america and, presumably because of some anti-catholic elements in the storyline, received only a limited theatrical release in europe.

i didn't know what to expect when i rented this widescreen dvd. i knew it had a cult following but i had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. don't torture a duckling actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end. and after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. one major caveat: i would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read english subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.

don't torture a duckling is one of fulci's earlier (and honestly, in terms of story-line, better...) films - and although not the typical "bloodbath" that fulci is known for - this is still a very unique and enjoyable film.the story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring. some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations - either as suspects, or those "helping" the investigation (or in some cases both) - include the towns police force, a small-time reporter, a beautiful and rich ex-drug addict, a young priest and his mother, an old man who practices witchcraft and his female protégé, a mentally handicapped townsman, and a deaf/mute little girl. all of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns, until the actual killer is revealed...don't torture a duckling is neither a "classical" giallo or a typical fulci gore film. although it does contain elements of both - it is more of an old-fashioned murder mystery, with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence (although nothing nearly as strong as some of fulci's later works). this is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end. recommended for giallo/murder-mystery fans, or anyone looking to check out some of fulci's non-splatter films - but don't despair, don't torture still has more than it's fair share of violence and sleaze. some may be put off by the subject of the child killings, and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys, which is also kind of disconcerting - but if that type of material doesn't bother you, then definitely give this one a look. 8.5/10

sporting a title seemingly more suitable for a looney tunes featurette than a grisly giallo, "don't torture a duckling" (1972) is nonetheless a grade a thriller from horror maestro lucio fulci. in this one, someone has been strangling the preteen boys in a rural, southern italian village and, typical for these gialli, there are many suspects. there's barbara bouchet (patrizia), looking more scrumptiolicious than you've ever seen her, a rich girl hiding out after a drug scandal; florinda bolkan (martiara), the local epileptic voodoo woman; her witchcraft-practicing beau; giuseppe, the local idiot; the sweet-faced priest; his dour mother; and on and on. the film features some unusually violent set pieces, including a chain whipping of one of the main characters in a graveyard (one of the most realistically bloody sequences that i've ever seen) and a nifty dukeout when the killer is ultimately revealed. the film's bursts of violence compensate for the fact that there are no real scares or suspense to speak of. still, this giallo fascinates, with its unusual rural backdrop, unsettling child murders, oddball characters, and freaky score by riz ortolani. the film has been beautifully photographed in what i presume to be monte sant'angelo, near the adriatic in southern italy (at least, that town's police force is thanked in the closing credits). and while subtitling would've made this fine-looking dvd work even better (the american slang doesn't convince in this rural italian setting), anchor bay is to be thanked for another job well done. oh...that title does eventually make perfect sense, too!

i tend to get furious when hearing about lucio fulci's reputation as a director. too often he's categorized as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. true, his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream american production, but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid. don't torture a duckling is yet another story! this film is a pure gem of the italian shock cinema! i easily dare to call this film a masterpieceit's an old-fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror. the film shows the search for a inhuman serial murderer in a small italian mountain-town. the bodies of 3 young boys are found, horribly mutilated. there are quite a lot of pseudo-madmen in the town but every trail leads to nowhere. among the suspects are a greedy bum and a scary woman, obsessed by witchery and voodoo. like a true mastermind, fulci knows to find the right creepy tone for his film. he portrays the small town as a claustrophobic and inescapable setting of macabre happenings, supported by a giddy soundtrack. fulci also develops himself as a genius storyteller here. the script always is one step ahead of you and the complex plot will mislead you more than once. in other words, this is a unique giallo (horror slash murder mystery). the gore isn't presented as grotesque and explicit as in lucio's later milestones (among them are the legendary zombie 2, the beyond and the new york ripper), although there still are a few nauseating and hard-to-watch shock-sequences shown. don't torture a duckling is the most compelling and effective achievement lucio fulci ever brought forward and it easily ranks among the greatest italian horror movies ever made. right next to the masterpieces made by mario bava and dario argento. the film is fascinating from start to finish, some plot aspects are alarmingly realistic and the tension is adrenalin-rushing at all times! a must see for horror fans and an absolute priority for italian shock-lovers!

this is lucio fulci at his best. if only all the films he made after were like this.this extraordinary film is as intriguing as dario argento´s "the bird with crystal plumage"... if you´re an argento fan but you don´t like lucio fulci films, like"the beyond", "manhattan baby", "the house by the cemetery", etc. this one has nothing to do with the others... this is what the italians call "giallo"... that would be something like a "who-done-it" movie in a nutshell.you won´t know who the killer is until the last moments of the film.but apart from that, there´s the plot: some maniac living in a small village starts killing little boys... a journalist (tomas milian), a sexy young woman (barbara bouchet), a priest (marc porel), his mother (irene papas) and a witch (florinda bolkan) are the main characters in this tangled, bloody story.talking about the actors, i want to say that tomas milian is superb (like always), and florinda bolkan is terrific as the village witch...do you want to know who is the killer?... i cannot tell you... but i can tell you that you must see this film!.(10 out of 10)... of course!

as far as i know i've seen most of lucio fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on dvd now, and i would have to say this was his best "pre-zombie" offering. in fact it beats out his later movies hands-down. this is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small italian town out in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. it's no mystery how they died, i guess, it's more who's doing it. is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch? is it a young woman that lives in a fancy modern house on the outskirts of town, who used to do a lot of drugs? is it the village idiot, who gets nabbed early on because of being in the wrong place at the wrong time? you'll only know if you watch, and watch you should, for this is a top-notch mystery thriller, or should i say, a "giallo". i've seen this before but it's been a long time and upon a second viewing it was still as powerful as the first time. for those of you that only know lucio fulci for his zombie flicks, well, open your minds to this because it's well worth seeing and while the "monsters" in this are human, they're as nasty as anything dredged up in his later films. 9 out of 10 stars, see it! please....

lucio fulci, later known for his graphic horror films like the beyond and zombie, was years earlier a master of the italian giallo (in the company of argento and bava) with films like a lizard in a woman's skin and his masterpiece, don't torture a duckling. this film has all the elements of the italian mystery/thriller genre known as the giallo, but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his/her own closet. this keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. who is killing the young boys in town? the young rich woman who is so bored that she sexually taunts the eventual victims, the reporter who likes to tamper with a crime scene to get a better photo shot, the townswoman with a mentally retarded daughter, the local witch, the town idiot....the list goes on, and you have to keep mental notes like a true game to play and solve. the themes in this film are very daring and done with that perfect italian style in the early 1970s. it is certain that no american studio would have even considered making a film of such strong content, and that is precisely why this is such a satisfying film (despite some unusual accent choices for the dubbing) and will definitely have people discussing its meanings long after viewing it. as the saying goes, they don't make them like this anymore, so get a copy and cherish an important film like this one!

this is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. that would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. the theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. as with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. alas, we probably will never know.

a mesmerizing film that certainly keeps your attention... ben daniels is fascinating (and courageous) to watch.

i love this movie, though i don't like how they picture egyptians, being an egyptian citizen myself! that's why it earns an eight out of 10.the relationship between augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long, he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard.a very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch augustin's reaction.. all in all i find it enjoyable, and i'm looking forward to reading the short story by balzac.

a film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of "the english patient," even down to a scene similar to when ralph fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert-rock cliff. in "a passion in the desert," the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert-rock cliff but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). historically expanded from a very short balzac story, the film is not perfect but a treat no less. final shot will haunt me for weeks. (8 of 10)

the story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place. he started out as an officer in napoleon's army fighting in egypt but became separated from his unit. after nearly starving and/or dying of thirst he came upon a leopard which somehow became his bosom buddy. it brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal. all things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter. a very strange film, well written and portrayed. beautiful scenery from jordan and utah which didn't always blend perfectly, but who cares.

what an incredible story and what a beautiful film! hat's off to ben daniels, lavinia currier and the great honore de balzac. this captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. i watched it mesmerized, almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end. this film's execution was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us in understanding the strange platonic, absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world. both are capable of affection, yet ironically, it's the more "evolved" one who becomes dependent and possessive, unable to accept the other's freedom. it's one of the most fascinating and intriguing look at the many forms of love, and an incredible study on how oppressive and destructive human love can be sometimes. only a rudimentary mind would associate this story with any kind of bestiality.

an excellent story well told by the film maker. the interactions between the man and the leopard brought many questions to the viewers mind about just who was being humane. the humans killed for no reason the animals only to survive. at the end of the movie you were left wondering just who the real "hero" of the movie was. a well told story. the human actor did an excellent job but the leopard stole every scene it was in.

this movie is beautiful in all ways. it is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. the acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. ben daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. there is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. it is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience. it isn't a movie for anyone who wants normality.

my opinions do not flow with the majority in most cases. i tend to lean toward the artsy, imaginative, and different. this movie was reminiscent of frances ford's "the black stallion" wherein a fantasy situation is created to showcase the beauty of a magnificent creature who's not readily available to view performing at its peak except on these multitudes of documentaries ala natural. unlike those nature films, this offering utilizes the finest movie making techniques the industry has to offer fit for a diva creating one of the most sensual super stars (the cat) on the screen.this fantasy depicting the love relationship that develops between a french soldier (he is very nice too) lost on the egyptian desert and a female leopard he encounters when he chances upon an abandoned egyptian temple is mesmerizing. i bought into it wholeheartedly. if you are the least bit open to fantasy and appreciate the grace, beauty, power and sensuality of the feline, you should enjoy it.the only flaw in my book was the ending. it was a perfect set up for a romeo and juliet finale - that would have taken me over the top.

i remember reading the original balzac story in college french.i remember ken nordine of wgn-tv in chicago reading it as one of his late night shows.always loved the story but never believe they could or would make a movie of it. to my surprise they did and did it very well.few of any balzac stories lend themselves to dramatization, which is unfortunate, and -cat lover that i am, i was always hoping it would be filmed without a lot of hollywood sexing up. this is as close to perfect conversion as could be done.the theater of the mind is always better than what the eye can see, but this is as close as i think it can come to letting the imagination of reading meet the reality of seeing.

honore de balzac's genuinely bizarre short story on which this was loosely based gets an unsettling, albeit breathtakingly filmed, treatment here as a sort of forbidden-love blossoms over a period of time between man and beast in the early part of the nineteenth century. thin and very blonde english actor ben daniels plays the role of a young soldier during the napoleonic wars who gets lost whilst escorting an exiled(?) french painter across the rugged, dangerous landscapes of the gobi desert. after literally going around in circles the two men give up ever trying to reach civilization again, thus each decides (against better judgment mind you) to go their separate ways with the promise of both returning to the same exact spot when and if a water source is actually found. this is of course how daniels' character comes to encounter the creature (a wild and untamed female leopard) and eventually form a seemingly unbreakable bond, or rather love, with it that both saves his life and nearly destroys it by film's end. the exquisite cinematography, minimalist dialog, somewhat demented story which arguably hints at possible bestiality in about three scenes are what ultimately lead professional critics to pan the film as pretentious and overlong rubbish. while it is a film that isn't exactly for all tastes mind you, i find it to be a subtle, though decidedly left-of-center mixture of fantasy with a surreal and sumptuous atmosphere, highlighted by the fact that for more than half of the flick actor ben daniels is forced to perform opposite a wild animal (four leopards were actually used as opposed to just the one), which plain common sense and a slight knowledge of theatrics dictates that it must have been a maddening and very difficult job that he managed to pull off quite brilliantly if you ask me! overall, i think that "passion in the desert" takes a while to warm up to, but if you're a patient person who is willing to give it some time it does in fact cast it's uniquely original spell over you in spite of everything; and unlike most platonic human and animal relationship stories it need not require a talking pig, monkey or shaggy dog to keep your interest throughout. (***** out of *****)

i recently stumbled across a tv showing of "passion...." (having missed the opening scenes). ms currier in to be praised for having the vision and courage to bring such a strange de balzac tale to the screen. i am grateful to the entire cast and crew for their parts in producing such a thoroughly fine motion picture. it must have been arduous shooting so many scenes in the desert. and i cannot comprehend how her trainer coaxed such a fine "performance" from the leopard, simoon. (this adverture calls to mind another suspenseful adventure, "naked prey"). why isn't this film more well-known?. hope i can find it on video.

passion in the desert exemplifies spatial grander. it is a visual narrative, illuminated by the magnificent cinematography. passion was filmed on location in the deserts of jordan, egypt, morocco, namibia, and tunisia. we are in egypt, 1798. augustin, a napoleanic soldier, is escorting writer and artist jean-michel venture de paradis on an official mission to document, measure, draw, and paint the cultural landmarks of the egypt: its dunes, stupendous ruins, and mysterious people. but, can you truly "document" majestic sandscapes, fractured edifices, and wild bedouins? can you truly capture the essence of egypt, nature, man, and time?jean and augustin become lost in the mesmerizing glittering, gold desert, whose vastness overwhelms their senses. "you can't get lost in egypt! there's the nile, and there's the sea!", says the dehydrated augustin, and soon he discovers an ancient, winding cave that leads to a palatial ruin. delirious and near-delusional, he attempts to rest; a perplexing sound rouses him; his eyes, body, and emotions become hypnotically locked in time as he stumbles into a sensual, sensory experience.... a wild, sleek female leopard stares back at him, and their love affair begins....a daring love affair, a daring film.

this movie was thought to be low budget but it turned out to be awesome. i just rented it from blockbuster and i loved it. the acting was very good, hot women and some scary parts. it is plain and simply worth the money to pay for.

it's one of the best movies that i have seen this year ! i don't agree with the person who said it's boring. of course some people may find this movie not frightening at all, but personally i spent a very good moment. this movie alterns very well sex scenes with frightening scenes. there is also a nice touch of humor. for example when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her father, and then her husband says "how can someone abuse someone like you", and then he attempts to attach her on the bed for sexual games :d very funny ! i recommend this movie to everyone, and by the way, sorry for my poor english (i'm from france).

others' main criticism of this film--namely that macy suddenly looks jewish upon donning his glasses--is misplaced. the glasses are just the little bit of change needed to convince others he's a jew. the scene in which he says to his boss, (paraphrasing) "but you know what my background is," along with another discussion with his mother, suggests that he's had to fight this same assumption in the past. the glasses now make him look just jewish enough to "confirm" his neighbors' and co-workers' existing suspicions. then there is his new wife's large nose and taste for loud clothes, which of course means she's jewish. the whole point of the film is how those little stereotypical nothings become the entire basis for judging others. if he has a lisp, he must be gay. if he has long hair, he smokes dope. if he's hispanic, he's got a knife...and if he has round black glasses and he's slight of build, he must be jewish. those statements all sound equally (im)plausible to me. if the conclusion people were jumping to in focus was reasonable, the whole point of the story would be lost.

i don't know if it was the directors intent to make sure the sky was almost always sunny and beautiful in this film. perhaps that is the romantic image many americans have of the time this film is set, as it is in the middle of the war, macy has returned from the war (his neighbor asks "hey, is it true you got a fritz over there?") and is trying to get on with his life but one day he gets a new pair of glasses (hence the name) and sees things clearly as the surrounding situation reveals itself to be one of rabid anti-semitism, and macy and dern could wrapped up in it. funny how neither is jewish in this film but the accusation is made. also it is historically accurate, as the labor union democrats of this time wrapped themselves in the flags of america and god. macy is continually pestered to come to the "meeting". his presence brings unexpected results.applying this time frame to today is a study in contrast. in 2005, has undergone a complete reversal, with average citizens who have taken patriotism and religion as their unifier supporting the republican party and viewing organized labor as part of left-wing 'unpatriotic' america.a great picture to watch, if you care to see the friendly, timid and meek macy (played beautifully by him) get caught in the carnage of race and hate in the mid 40's in nyc.a tough, emotionally charged film.

the essential message - one which miller would have surely intended after seeing vichy war crimes trials - is that hatred of somebody without rational basis is a waste of life. meat loaf's character, fred, has known lawrence for many years, and yet when the time comes, at the bidding of his fanatical supporters, he allows them to attack a man who is not part of their "target" group. for me, this is the crucial message - it doesn't matter what lawrence and his wife do from this point onwards - they are marked, and have chance to save themselves by using reason. animal aggression and anger have blinded fred's union thugs to reality.a friend of mine suggested i should see "the wave" to study how irrational hatred and evil ideology can take over people without them realising it. i once conducted an experiment in a role-playing game, and was shocked to see how normal and level-headed people welcomed the creation of an oppressive police state - which would ultimate threaten them all - because it crept in in stages.fred is the start, his la friends and preacher idol are the catalyst which pushes his neighbours over the edge into violence without stopping to think that what they are doing in wrong.the relationship between lawrence and finkelstein, the jewish shopkeeper is a fascinating one, because lawrence misses the point almost until the end: if the bigots force finkelstein out, where is he to go? if his family have fled the nazis, what an irony to be tormented again in the land of "freedom".that big poster (it's a fairly famous propaganda piece) about american families enjoying the highest standard of living in the world is a very important detail. when you see this film, watch for the grafitti on the subway train, and all the little posters. the message lurks there too.this movie should be on the curriculum of every school, especially in our time when baseless hatred is being promoted so widely by "reasonable" people who are just extremists in thin disguises.

this movie packs a punch. there are a few every now and then that make me think deeply, and disturb me a lot. i could see myself in this same predicament - passively allowing things to happen around me, not standing up for the right and decent thing, just trying to avoid trouble. how often do we avoid making waves or sticking our necks out? how often does our inaction condone the evil actions of others. we would never join them, we tell ourselves, we recognize that what they are doing is bad, but do we do anything about it? lawrence newman (william h. macey) is a low-key, nerdy office worker who has paid off his home in brooklyn, ny in the waning days of world war ii. he rarely gets engaged in what is going on around him, has never married, rarely socializes, just goes to work and cares for his invalid mother. then a series of events in his very "white" little neighborhood pull him out of his complacent shell into a maelstrom of events. it starts as he witness from his bedroom window the rape of a puerto rican girl by the son of his neighbor. soon after he gets glasses because of poor vision. as he is now better able to see, he becomes less able to deal with the circumstances of his life. the one bright spot is a new love in his life, and he marries, hoping to continue on in his normalcy. then the virulent anti-semitism on that street catches him, despite his credentials as a presbyterian wasp. as things spiral further out of control, he discovers he must make an important decision - does he take a stand or does he simply go away.i cannot how anybody can view this movie without being affected and having to think very much about themselves and what they really stand for. post war anti-semitism is the setting here, but there is injustice at all times and in all places. it is for the individual to decide where he or she stands.

most people attending this film will have no idea of the great novel by arthur miller that is the basis of it. it's a novel that should be read by more people to see how prejudice affects and alters peoples lives.at the beginning, lawrence newman is an ordinary man. the eyeglasses his boss makes him get change everything he has worked for and his whole world collapses around him, little by little. there couldn't have been an actor better suited to bring this intelligent performance to the screen than william h. macy. not only is he a talented stage and screen actor, but he projects honesty behind every character he plays. he is an everyday man caught in his own insecurities. his anxiety intensifies when he takes a stand and walks out of his job. suddenly, he has to confront the issues he has tried to avoid all his middle class existence in the brooklyn of the 40s. is he jewish, is he not? the cinematography in this brilliant and atmospheric film, directed with sure hand by neil slavin, kept reminding me of some edward hopper's paintings, especially a sequence at the beginning of the film when newman steps outside a building and the night shot when he and his wife are being followed with long black shadows behind the couple, menacing and anticipating the confrontation with the bullies. laura dern, david paymer, and especially meat loaf, who infuses incredible depth to the bully-next-door, are excellent, but they all pale in comparison with the stellar turn of william h. macy (h must stand for honest..) if you haven't read the book, i would sincerely recommend it because no one has written more truly and convincingly than arthur miller has.

first they came for the communists, and i didn't speak up, because i wasn't a communist. then they came for the jews, and i didn't speak up, because i wasn't a jew. then they came for the catholics, and i didn't speak up, because i was a protestant. then they came for me, and by that time there was no one left to speak up for me.attributed to rev. martin niemoller, 1945when faced with intolerance or injustice, the easiest thing to do is nothing - speak up and you risk becoming an object of scorn. but when does enough become too much? global anti-semitic sentiments allowed hitler's genocidal policies to thrive, and equal doses of fear-mongering and ignorance made it possible for the anti-communist purges of mccarthyism to destroy thousands of peoples' lives. inaction makes one no less culpable.lawrence newman is a chameleon of a man: quiet and nondescript he blends seamlessly with his surroundings. lawrence doesn't like to get involved - when he witnesses an attack on a young woman, he tells no one and goes about his business. his world spirals into chaos when he buys a pair of glasses, and is mistaken for one of "them." lawrence's view of the world and its view of him is forever altered. while the subject matter of this film is not new, its presentation is definitely unique. it is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudice, when placed within a certain context - lawrence is more concerned with the assumptions that he is jewish, than he is with the views of his attackers. he believes that if he corrects this "oversight" that everything will be all right, not realizing that logic and prejudice never go hand in hand. whether playing a schemer (the only thing i liked about "fargo") or a down home nice guy sheriff, william h. macy's roles are linked by a common thread -his characters share a subtle, deliberate countenance that gives them substance. macy nails lawrence down to the smallest detail, and says more with a furtive glance or tremble in his voice than a page of dialogue. by showing, rather than telling, lawrence is able to share his fear and bewilderment with the viewer. the supporting cast brings the story together.laura dern is compelling as gerty, lawrence's bombshell wife with a past. trailer park rough, yet other worldly wise, she has also felt the wrath of prejudice as the result of "a mistake" and unwittingly exacerbates lawrence's situation. michael lee aday (aka "meatloaf") is frightening as fred, the prototypical redneck next door, equal parts ignorance and venom, rallying neighbours to his virulent cause. in the midst of the chaos is finklestein (david paymer), the focus of the aggression, and the voice of reason that raises the important questions. paymer's even handed portrayal keeps finklestein from becoming a stereotype or someone whose sole purpose is to engender sympathy, making his one of the strongest performances in the film.the tight editing and close-cropped cinematography make for a clean picture with few distractions, and mixes an air of claustrophobia in with the small town usa feel - it is simultaneously comforting and disturbing. the deliberate use of harsh two-tone lighting to accentuate the malevolent aspects of the piece and the carefully scored soundtrack, are powerful without being overwhelming. finally, the set and costume designs recreate the feel of the era, an essential component in the film's message."focus'" unconventional approach in dealing with prejudice is reason enough to recommend this film. just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.

cleopatra 2525 is a very funny, entertaining show. you shouldn't take all the show seriously, but if you wanna have fun, that's your tv show. being made by the producers of xena is a quality guarantee, and cleopatra 2525 isn't that different from xena. the female warriors formula is brought to the future, where they don't have to fight warriors or gods, but dangerous robots which dwell in the surface, and the humans are forced to live underground. along the two seasons of cleopatra, they develop an interesting and funny underground world, and we get to know the three main characters: cleopatra (jennifer sky), hel (gina torres) and sarge (victoria pratt). they all are different, but as a team, they work really well. the three main actresses appeared previously in xena, like most of the regular/guest cast (there are some known faces from hercules too, or from both shows). i specially liked the character played by danielle cormack (ephiny in xena), which is very different from any of her roles i previously knew. so if you liked xena and hercules, you'll love cleopatra 2525. if you don't know them, try it: i'm sure you'll enjoy it.

there are moments when you don't want those deep drama-series. when you don't want series with heavy stories or a must to watch every single episode to be able to hang on. there are moments when you just want to watch a simple series, with lots of action and cool characters. for those moments, you have cleopatra 2525.i was one of those who actually enjoyed charlie's angels. critics said it was to superficial and silly. but the thing is, that's the point! people who can't relax and expected a serious movie hated it. it's exactly the same with cleopatra 2525. it is superficial. it has silly and unrealistic characters. and that's why i like it. it isn't like any other series.the first season wasn't very good. the character cleo was irritating and a little too much. the story was a little lame, and you didn't get to know the characters very much. but hey, they only had 20 minutes in every episode.in the last 5-6 episodes of cleopatra 2525, they finally gave the series full 40-minutes length. and it was here i started to love it. the series finally started to grow into a very qualitative series. too bad they had to cancel the series. because the last episodes of cleopatra 2525 actually was very good. i will never forget hel, sarge and cleo. unique characters that only the creators of xena could have created!

i picked up a dvd at the 1 discount, having no idea what it's about (but at that price i can't resist..) in brief: i was positively surprised.so much that i did quite some research. on the german dvd (part 2 of a series of 3), episodes were recombined into two 85 minute parts, and out of order. here are my results, based on wikipedia's episode list:"doomsday" is in my boots + the voice (final episode). "war of the machines" is hel & high water (1, 2) + pod listener + juggernaut down.well, what can i say. underdressed girlies are of course interesting for older men. i never watched charlie's angels so much, so i can't compare, but the more i watched, the less i looked out for bikini tops and their fillings. instead, the characters (both m and f) became more interesting. i can imagine feminists have their fun with this, too. all in all, maybe a guilty pleasure, but a pleasure it was :^)

ya know the concept of "guilty pleasures"? yeah, you have 'em, like admitting you watched - and enjoyed - goonies, battlestar galactica after they reached earth, v the series, charlie's angels, starsky & hutch, the 1950s version of superman, or godzilla movies.here's the ultimate in guilty pleasures. coupled with jack of all trades in a sam raimi action packed hour, this half hour slot is fast paced, easy to follow, and loaded with fun-to-watch scanlity-clad babes.the man that brought us evil dead, xena, hercules, and the adventures of brisco county jr does it again with this 2000 update of charlies angels. we got charlie (voice) an unknown being that has the knowlege and the time to find people who need help, bosley (mouser) the gadget man, and three gorgeous babes that kick a** for a living.and oh what a living!

as i have said before in previous comments, some programmes are there to be 'light entertainment'. so i get somewhat frustrated when commentators seem to be expecting a program that will reveal the meaning of life, you will not get that from cleopatra 2525 and it does not presume to offer it. what you get is a girl who was frozen and is brought back to life some 500 years later and her adaptation to this new life is realistic. she does not settle in within 10 minutes as what happens with other time travelling adventures and neither is she the female equivalent of james bond ready to take on all comers.cleopatra is overawed by her new surroundings and frightened by some of the weaponry on display as most of us would be. however it is light entertainment, the stories have a beginning a middle and an end in quick time and their are some surprisingly good moments of acting. the episode when there is a double of cleopatra is particularly moving and jennifer sky i think gives one of the best performances of someone dying for a long long time, and being a film and television buff i know what i am talking about. finally to prove my sincerity i have purchased all but four of the episodes and i am entirely satisfied with my purchase. the only reason i do not have the complete set is because i purchased the other episodes before realising that there was one complete box set. victoria pratt and gina torres complete the trio creditably and for light entertainment cleopatra 2525 certainly entertained me.

this second pairing of wile e. coyote and the road runner is a great as the first. predictable maybe, but i don't care and still laugh so much whenever i see it. the wile e./road runner shorts always had the most special place in my heart. so knowing that the second disc of the golden collection would not only feature 11 of this, but they would be in chronological order (2 through 12, the first episode was on volume 1), made me get misty eyed. i love this stuff. this animated short can be seen on disc 2 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 2. it also features an optional commentary by micheal barrier.my grade: a+

"goodbye, mr. chips" is a superbly written and photographed musical version of the classic 1939 film. aside from peter o'toole's wonderfully controlled, understated performance as the pedantic schoolmaster who finds love and is changed by it, the film contains hundreds of stunning visuals, from grecian ruins to london side streets to an extended countryside montage. the music and lyrics by leslie bricusse have been criticized as being dull or not-up-to par for film musicals, but they are used to enhance the story rather than tell it. many songs are used to underscore montages or scenes; the few that don't are relegated to "show biz" numbers. in this manner, the songs do not intrude upon this delicate story but heighten what the characters are thinking or feeling. "where did my childhood go?", "walk through the world with me", and "you and i" are especially effective. an absorbing, brilliantly acted, directed and written film.

i love this movie because every single element of it is nothing less than excellent. i will quickly praise a few of them. peter o'toole gives us one of his great performances as he becomes the definitive mr. chips. petula clark, has a beautiful voice and is perfect as katharine. the director was able to bring the story to the screen in a fresh new way. combine that with the fantastic and creative cinematography, editing, writing, etc., and you have a film that shows the fine quality of its production. i can't praise the well-planned camera work enough, it moves us up and around, zooming in and out, giving us the best views of, and letting the locations become part of the scene. petula clark's last song 'you and i' is just 3 beautifully composed long takes, and in this era of 2 second takes, i can appreciate the extra care that everyone involved had to give to get those long scenes perfect. the music is great, and the songs move the story along just as they should. leslie bricusse is one of my favorite composers. listen to these songs, how could anyone not like them? this is a very romantic story between two people nearing middle age that find each other, bring out the best in each other, and it lasts till the end of their lives. excellent production values, acting, camera work, and music, make this movie well worth watching.

peter o'toole is arthur chipping a latin teacher with strict adherence to detail and thoroughness in helping young minds grasp the meaning and definition of latin words and phrases. he is seen as being cold and unfair and not in touch with the times. but upon meeting stage actress singer katherine briskit (petula clark) not only at a late supper after a performance of london is london but at an amphitheater in greece his closed minded world starts to open up.goodbye mr. chips is an mgm musical remake of the 1939 movie also from mgm. during this time musicals were out and the hollywood studio system was in total shambles. when it premiered in new york los angeles and london the musical numbers were left intact but when it came to the local main street theaters world wide it was sans songs therefore making the movie shorter and gaped to the max.thanks to mgm/ua home video under ted turner in the late 1980's early 1990's when vhs and laser disc were the main home video formats of choice the musical numbers were re-instituted and the gaps closed. laserdisc though was the only format chosen to view goodbye mr. chips in the widescreen letterbox format.for awhile now the original motion picture soundtrack was only available on the original out of print vinyl and cassette tape and can still be found today on ebay.thanks to the wonderful people at film score monthly.com in 2006 the soundtrack has been digitally remastered and remixed into a 3 cd set featuring the completely reconstructed score, the original 1969 general release album score, and narrated sequences source music and interviews a plenty. you also get 1 unused song which is a real lost gem, "tomorrow with me" by petula clark which would have been chosen in place of "you and i" before hand.this movie is both a classic musical and a real tribute to educators everywhere. i most certainly would buy this movie if warner bros. mgm and sony would put their money where there mouth is and get this film restored from all master film sources and put it on both dvd and blu ray with all the bells and whistles put back into place with all the extras you can find and stuff into a release.

most of the comments so far have nailed this one right on the head. viewers under "a certain age" and with iq's of three digits should avoid "chance of a lifetime" like a george w.bush appointee facing a congressional grilling.the cast is composed largely of veterans who know their way around a well-written script. is the premise wildly original? no, but the movie stands out like a lighthouse at midnight in the current and non-ending glut of movies/tv geared to the most-desirable audience demographic of teenagers and "young adults"in addition to betty white and leslie neilsen in the leads, the cast also has ever-reliable veterans like elaine stritch and william windom. the sharp dialog is effortlessly and effectively delivered by these pros."chance of a lifetime" is definitely not a movie for the will ferrell/adam sandler/"saw" slasher gore-fests, "american eye dull," and ninety percent of the rest of the sludge ground out by hollywood and tv.

this is one of my favorites. betty white and leslie neilson sparkle in this romantic comedy. one is a business executive who re-evaluates life based on the expectation of her death within a year. the other is a playboy who has tired of gold-digging young women and seeks a relationship with a vital, mature woman. if you've got silver in your hair and/or romance in your heart, microwave the popcorn, curl up with your honey, and prepare yourself for a treat.

arising from characters previously developed in a series of much-lauded shorts, the curse of the were-rabbit is about as far from run-of-the-mill "family fare" as you can get: beautifully crafted and with witty dialogue and clever concepts, this really is a movie that will appeal to almost every member of the family.the story concerns wallace and his dog gromit, who live in a village obsessed with growing large vegetables for the annual fair and who operate "anti-pesto," a humane solution to all those pesky rabbits that torment passionate gardeners everywhere. the business is a great success--but wallace proves a bit too clever for his own good. when he tries to "rehabilitate" rabbits from their vegetable-crunching ways, he unexpectedly unleashes an ancient horror of legendary proportions: the were-rabbit! and suddenly no vegetable in town is safe! the movie is full of crazy inventions, unexpectedly smart dialogue, and references to everything from king kong to the wolf man--more than enough to entice even a jaded teenager--but the real charm of the thing is in its characters. the amount of personality the artists and animators can wring from bits of clay is amazing: they seem as fully alive as any flesh-and-blood actor. the dvd release (and i recommend the widescreen) includes a number of informative and entertaining extras as well. greatly recommended! gft, amazon reviewer

although it isn't half as hilarious as "chicken run," the new wallace and gromit comedy "the curse of the were-rabbit" (*** out of ****) yields more laughs than most live action comedies. british director nick park, who created the wallace and gromit characters, and co-director steve box rely on the old-fashioned, stop-motion method of animation--known best as claymation--to create several visually adorable characters in more than enough side-splitting scenes about a monstrously mutant hare out to devour every vegetable in sight. amusing as its whimsical storyline is, the heart of the hilarity lies in the imaginative way with which park and company have painstakingly constructed characters and gags out of a brand of modeling clay called plasticine. basically, every shot that you see in "the curse of the were-rabbit" required patient souls that made minor alterations in the clay characters for a series of individual shots that merge into a veritable montage of merriment. hollywood pioneered claymation as a form of animation as far back as the silent movies of the 1920s, before the industry turned its back on the complicated process. aardman studio animators managed to crank out a mere three seconds of usable footage per day. for the record, "the curse of the were-rabbit" took five years to make. the lumpy looking characters, with thumb-prints clearly visible in their respective clay complexions, look incredibly funny with their ping-pong ball eyes and over-biting mouths. interestingly, gromit emerges as the funniest character, a lovable mutt with no mouth but an expressively inexpressive face who says more than most of the talking characters.wallace and gromit are respectively master and pooch. as the human half of the duo, wallace is a homily looking moron without a clue who somehow manages to construct machines that do some rather incredible things. one of the funnier scenes shows master and pooch awakened by a system of chutes, hatches, and spring-operated contraptions that dress and feed them. meanwhile, gromit is the animal half. the running joke is that gromit shows more common sense than his genius of a master. as good as his ideas and inventions are, wallace could not succeed without the loyal gromit giving him a hand. our heroes run a pest protection business called 'anti-pesto.' essentially, they must protect every vegetable patch for miles around using an ungainly looking device called a bun-van 6000 that literally sucks rabbits out of their ground and into a huge glass container. no, wallace and gromit don't kill the critters. instead, they keep them as pets, and wallace experiments with an inventionmind-o-matic--designed to convert hares into carrot-haters. this "frankenstein" meets "the fly" approach plunges poor wallace into deep trouble when he swaps bits of his brain with that of a rabbit. not long thereafter, a mysterious towering terror stalks the vegetable patches on full moon nights and creates chaos for everyone as the village's 517th annual vegetable contest approaches.initially, wallace and gromit appeared in park's oscar-nominated, film school project "a grand day out" (1989). since then aardman has released ten other animated shorts, among them "wallace and gromit: a close shave" (1993) and the oscar-winning wallace and gromit: the wrong trousers" (1995). "curse of the were-rabbit" differs not only because it represents the duo's big-screen debut, but also it runs a whopping 85 minutes. the first two-thirds of "were-rabbit" contain better gags than the last third, but park and company never miss a chance to slip in an adult joke that kids won't get but attentive grown-ups will appreciate. "wallace and gromit: the curse of the were-rabbit" is hare-raising fun.

a great animation movie that really gets up to the level of oldies like "the lion king" . i went to see this with one of my best belgian friends who also watched the series on tv . i was lucky because i didn't know people in belgium were aware of "wallace and gromit" . when it started and that good old theme started it started to bring back memories of me watching it when i was 5 .the humor itself was very funny . some nice sitcom style scenes , some wordplay or just plain jokes . the animation isn't as impressive if you have know the series but it is still fun to watch is you realize how it gets done. my conclusion : not only can it keep my happy and entertained , some of the humor can easily appeal to older people so i say : go and watch "curse of the were-rabbit" as soon as you can .

this is a great compendium of interviews and excerpts form the films of the late sixties and early 70s that were a counter movement to the big studio films of the late sixties. directed by ted demme, it is obviously a labor of love of the films of the period, but it gives short shrift to the masterpieces of the times.many of the filmmakers of this period were influenced by truffaut, antonioni, fellini, bergman, and of course john cassavetes. unfortunately the documentary logging in at 138 minutes is too short! the film is rich with interviews and opinions of filmmakers. some of the people interviewed are: martin scorsese, francis coppola, robert altman, peter bogdonovich, ellen burstyn, and roger corman, bruce dern, sydney pollack, dennis hopper, and jon voight.bruce dern has a moment of truth when he says that he and jack nicholson may not have been as good looking as the other stars that came before them but they were "interesting". this summarizes the other areas of this period of film-making in american history.the filmmakers were dealing with a lack of funding from the studios because they were expressing unconventional attitudes about politics, sex, drugs, gender and race issues, and americas involvement in overseas conflicts like the vietnam war.there is a great interview with francis coppola saying that he got the chance to make "the conversation" because the producers knew he had been trained by roger corman to make a movie with nothing so they bankrolled his film.another interview is with jon voight who was directed by hal ashby in "coming home" a clear anti-war film about a crippled soldier immersing himself back into society after his facing battle. voight talks about how his working methods helped him achieve an emotional telling point when ashby said that they were doing a "rehearsal" take and it ended up being the take used in the film- it was better because it was so un-rehearsed and not drained of its freshness by being over-rehearsed.there are also many fine excerpts from al pacino's break-through film "the panic in needle park", and interviews from dennis hopper on the making of "easy rider", and interviews from sydney pollack about making films.all in all the documentary is a fine jumping off point for any film lover who wants to see great examples of what the new voices in film were like in the seventies. many of the sundance folks, where this film made a big splash, are unaware of just how much the independent film maker today owes to the films of john cassavetes, milos foreman, william friedkin, and roger corman.rent it from your favorite shop. it will at least perk you up to some films you may not have seen before and can enjoy today. amazon.com has it for as little as $11.50, if you want to buy right out.

when i tuned in to my local pbs station last night to watch "the war that made america". i was expecting a dull documentary, instead i got a very good and believable reenactment of the major events of the time. now i see the reasons for the american revolution, and the part the indian wars played. larry nehring is george washington, and he is perfect for that part. the narrative to the camera, also work fantastic. i'm looking forward to next week, to see the rest. it's good to see pbs really using the hd format to bring the 1700 right in to our living room.i hope larry nehring is seen more in the future, since he is such a talented actor.

as a long time resident of western pa i have an intimate knowledge of this topic and found it regfreshing to be so authentically captured on film! kudos to the producers of this epic!!! and what a great legacy to the school children for years to come.the attention to detail and realistic depiction of this complicated web of events make it a one of a kind production.viewers will find themselves mesmerized by the storyline and captivated by the storytelling.grahame greene is magnificent as the presenter.bravo!!!

the student nurses is not a typical sexploitation movie. sure, the nudity and sexual openness is there, but it's not all for laughs. stephanie rothman scripted a socially compelling, well-written tits & ass movie which confronts the topics of racism, socio-economic inequalities, rape, abortion, medical ethics, public health issues, human rights, the vietnam war, free love, lsd and drug experimentation. four sexy college roommates are taking their nursing internships at the same time. sharon (elaine giftos) is assigned to the terminal care ward, lynn (brioni farrell) to public health administration, priscilla (barbara leigh) to gynecology and phred (karen carlson) to psychiatry. these four beauties have ample opportunities to disrobe and fornicate, of which they take advantage, much to the delight of male viewers. these are liberated women at the height of the sexual revolution, after all, and are as intelligent as they are horny and beautiful. visceral yet low-budget action sequences are interspersed throughout. there's a very bloody gunfight at the resistance movement headquarters in which two policemen are shot and killed, along with several members of the group. an anti-(vietnam) war protest consisting of spookily-dressed young people of all races painted like skeletons becomes violent, with cops beating protesters. the effective trip sequence on the beach consists of beautiful, weird and confusing sensory and memory montages with hyper-sensual overtones. in short, the student nurses is a thoughtful and compelling reflection of the times, expressed through real women's perspectives (since it was written and directed by a woman). but, it's still fun and titillating, despite its sobering treatment of subject matter.

four lovely young nurses in their last year of nursing school experience all kinds of turmoil and excitement in their lives: sweet susan (winsome brunette elaine giftos) tries to comfort the bitter, terminally ill greg (a moving performance by darrell larson), eager, but neurotic phred (lovely blonde karen carlson) romances handsome gynecologist jim caspar (affable lawrence casey), free-spirited hippie priscilla (the stunningly gorgeous barbara leigh) gets impregnated by laid-back drug dealer les (the solid richard rust), and compassionate lynn (nicely played by brioni farrell) helps out angry mexican revolutionary victor charlie (the excellent reni santoni). despite the fact that this film was made for roger corman's legendary exploitation outfit new world pictures, it's anything but your standard mindless piece of leering soft-core schlock. instead, it's a very pleasant, charming and even often thoughtful time capsule of the social and political upheavals of the groovy early 70's (the subplot involving lynn and the revolutionaries is especially potent and provocative). special kudos are in order for director stephanie rothman, who brings a welcome and refreshing intelligence and sensitivity to the material. moreover, the four attractive and appealing female leads all turn in sound and praiseworthy work. scottie macgregor likewise impresses as wise supervisor ms. boswell and ubiquitous 70's trailer voice guy ronald gans supplies the off-screen voice of a psychiatrist. stevan larner's polished cinematography, the fantastic rock soundtrack, and the flavorsome folksy'n'funky score by clancy b. grass iii are all up to speed. a real sleeper.

"the student nurses" is an excellent film that deals with four women bonded by friendship and career. for the first time, one is able to see a realistic portrayal of relationships inside the work place, outside the work place, the risks of those relationships, and the consequences. this film also offers a rare chance to see veteran stage and television actress katherine "scottie" macgregor as the nurses' instructor, "miss boswell." ms. macgregor is best known for her performance as "mrs. oleson" on the television series "little house on the prairie." the direction, music, and print color are very good as well as the opening theme song performed by clancy b. grass, iii. this film offers a rare opportunity for those who enjoy themes centered around the late 1960s and early 1970s, which offers a "softer side to life" while appreciating the beauty of the female sex.

this is by far the best stand-up routine i have ever seen. john leguizamo's one man show tells the supposed story of his life in a barrage of lines and situations. by far better than any other comedy out there.

john leguizamo's "freak" is one of the funniest one-man shows i've ever seen! i recommend it to anyone! well, anyone with a good sense of humor....

john leguizamo's one man show is both funnier and more involving than most movies you'll see. a number of devices, such as slide projectors, are used to enhance the story, but this is essentially good old-fashioned performance art. in particular, check out his hilarious rendition of "i will survive". *highly* recommended.

oz was a fantastic show, as long as frequent male nudity doesn't turn you off. there was way too much frontal male nudity in this show, more than any other show you'd see on a porn channel. minus that, it was the best show on tv, and a previous commenter said "better than prime suspect". prime suspect is tom and jerry vs the simpsons. no contest. if you have directv they are now re-running it from the start on channel 101, they're at episode #3 now. highly recommended. the creator tom fontana also did homicide, which was an awesome show. but why all the male nudity? we all know that stuff happens in prison, but did they really need to show it as often? that was the only thing that turned me off the show. if i want to see naked men, guys getting raped, i'll kill someone myself and witness first hand. otherwise i like my tv shows free of black penises every five minutes.

oz is a great series, one of televisions underrated shows. it has a certain relationship to soap opera in that something evil is always happening, and it is the unfolding of each instance of evil that fascinates. from my discussions with people who are actually in prison, it rings true. every interaction has some machination working in the background. behind every action, there lies a scheme, a plot to do someone else in. i like this series so much that it is one of the few tv shows i have bought completely, on dvd.and, yes, i agree with the writer before me who commented that there are elements of satire in it. the character in the wheelchair who offers his jaundiced view of life does so with a certain bit of ironic humor.

oz is set in oswald state correctional facility. it tells the story of confrontation, cruelty, violence, hate and survival at any cost. in a place like oz, you have to have eyes in the back of your head.this completely original, intelligent and compelling drama tells of how warped life becomes as soon as you step through the gates of emerald city.what is supposed to be a state of art correctional facility is in fact far from being such. the show brings to light some of the many flaws in the prison system, the underestimating of the humanity that cold hard killers are capable of still retaining, and the one true fact: the prisoners are the one's who control the prison.this magnificent and somewhat surreal show teaches about the importance of every life and helps give an understanding to the reasons that most of the prisoners are there. this show may seem shocking at first but to truly tell it like it is, such a thing is necessary.oz is a great depiction of hell on earth and how such a place teaches you some of the most important lessons you will ever learn.

jim henson as kermit, dr.teeth, rowlf and waldorf.frank oz as fozzie, piggy and animal.jerry nelson as floyd pepper, robin the frog, lew zealand and crazy harry.richard hunt as janice, statler,beaker and scooter.dave goelz as gonzo, dr.hunnydew and zoot.charles durning and mel brooks.cameos by steve martin, carol kane, orson welles, bob hope, richard pryor and others.this is the first muppet movie of the billion others that came out, and is also the best, by far! this deals with kermit the frog going on a trip to hollywood and meeting the other characters along the way. this movie, along with being already good, has excellent songs performed by the muppets, including rainbow connection, can you picture that?, moving right along and others. this movie, unlike the other muppet flicks, carries a strong sentimental value to me. it's such a nice movie. also noted is it's many cameos featuring steve martin, mel brooks and a dozen others.my rating-a plus. 109 mins. rated g.

y'know, it's very interesting watching this... half the people involved with it are now dead...anyways, it's been a long time since i've watched anything muppet related, but this stuff is pure gold. i'm a great fan of puns, and this movie has them quite well placed, but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing: it's not really high-speed children's pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the character's depth, it's just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to go.kermit the frog is just an awesome character. his voice and the expressions on his puppet-face are fantastic. but above all, he points out why he's popular--"he can sing and make jokes too!"--but more appropriately why he's so endearing--he, without any effort, inspires everyone to search for their dreams. in the meantime, he also has to deal with himself, which is an uncommon theme in family movies.it also contains quite an ensemble of comedians making appearances here and there, some to great effect, others to a little less (i think mel brook's part was just a bit overplayed, do you?). some parts of the film are just kind of odd. but it's highly imaginative and takes itself to the same destination from a very different direction.moving right along...--polarisdib

jim henson's the muppet movie is a charming, funny and brilliant film that can be watched and enjoyed by adults and kids. i feel this is my favorite childhood film because it combines great characters, great story, and great wit that it is irresistable. the plot involves kermit the frog (puppeteered and voiced by henson) in his odyssey across america to follow his dream in hollywood. along the way, he meets fozzie bear, the great gonzo (my favorite), miss piggy, rolf, and dr. teeth and the electric mayhem.this film has so many good things i can't even say them. but it is memorable and every time i think of a puppet or muppet, i will think of this film. look for cameos from mel brooks, dom delouise, paul williams, madeline kahn, bob hope, richard pryor, steve martin, edgar bergen (and charlie mccarthey), elliot gould, carol kane and the great orson welles. excellent and spectacular, one of the best films of the 70's. a++

in many ways, the perfect movie. the "incredible journey" and horatio alger tale come together for a positive spin on the usually depressing subject of existentialism. in essence, the travails of the muppets boil down to the finale song of the movie: "life's like a movie, write your own ending, keep believing, keep pretending." they create their own reality, which has all the trappings of every epic tale: a lofty goal at the end of what is necessarily a obstacle-laden journey; an ever-increasing group of like-minded individuals for camaraderie; a nasty set of villians who are not beyond all redemption; and a big-budget hollywood ending because, darn it all, they can.only jim henson could pull this off. he walks the line between sentimentality and philosophy without swerving too long or too hard into either. of course it seems odd that invest such weight into a film starring puppets, but in the end perhaps they are the perfect, uh, puppet to make these points. the movie's atmosphere allows for the pure enjoyment of the hollywood dream, the "happy" ending, unnecessary cameos, and bursting into song at the drop of a hat. usually these aspects are anathema to quality in film, but the self-deprecating manner under which the story is delivered makes for guilt-free viewing. one of the few films that can truly be called "suitable for all ages."the other muppet-related films (including "the empire strikes back"), while palatable, do not touch the simple grace of this film. take, for instance, the musical number "hope that something better comes along," the duet of kermit and rowlf. amusing in its vaudevillian goofiness, yet makes a bitingly crucial point about the motivations behind life choices. brilliant.

minor spoilersmisunderstood classic remains one of henson's finest and most personal films. it may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one 'misunderstood,' but people do seem to remember this one mostly for jerry juhl's snappy screenplay and paul williams's knockout songs. now while these things are admittedly great, as is the movie's formal playfulness (screenplay-within-the-screenplay, film break, etc.), what distinguishes 'the muppet movie' from the other muppet films is the serious, wistful thread that runs through the picture. it's a road movie, all right, but like most road movies, the pleasure is in the getting there, and the achievement of the characters' goals is tempered by uncertainty, and by the knowledge that they can never really go back again. throughout the film, we are shown the down side of show business, even before the muppets have 'made it': piggy abandons kermit without a second thought at a phone call from her agent, gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of a performer's life on the road in his haunting 'i'm going to go back there someday,' and, worst of all, kermit is continually tortured and tested by doc hopper, who wants him to commercialize his art for the unholiest of purposes. (one can only wonder what henson would have made of his family's management of the company after his death.) kermit himself agonizes over his choices in the desert conversation scene, and the final 'magic store' number questions whether it's all been worth it, before concluding that it probably doesn't matter either way. all this is punctuated with the expected muppet chaos and satire and deliciously awful jokes, and of course the serious stuff wouldn't work if it weren't. but 'the muppet movie' isn't just another jokefest, as the rest of the diminishing-return muppet films would become. no, it's a lovely, gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business, and it's every bit as effective today as it was 25 years ago. 9.5 out of 10.

centres on czech ww2 pilots  the older frantisek, the boyish impulsive karel and in the background the quiet piano-playing honza. as the film opens, it is 1950, the war is over and frantisek and honza are imprisoned in a former monastery. in their now soviet-controlled native country they are 'enemy of the people'. honza is severely maltreated by his communist countrymen and dies.in 1939 many pilots manage to escape german-occupied europe and make their way to england where they join the raf. notwithstanding their high motivation and experience they face raf reluctance and british stiff upper lip. finally they fight gallantly in the battle of britain. however, frantisek and karel find their friendship severely tested when they both fall for the same woman.in terms of romantic sub-plot, this is very similar to the hollywood production pearl harbour. however, given the context of the film and frantisek's eventual fate, it is also possible to read the english woman's treatment of the two men as symbolic of british treatment of the czech and polish raf pilots: conveniently forgetting them once the war is over.in addition, the film is a lot less cliché than pearl harbour and the characters are more fully realised. dark blue world also scores in terms of its stunning aerial dogfights, which were seamlessly created using a mixture of models, actual live-action aerial filming and out-takes from the 1969 epic the battle of britain.in short, dark blue world is a well-made, moving, thought-provoking and exciting drama that puts the likes of pearl harbour to shame. highly recommended.

i absolutely loved this movie. great, realistic looking combat footage for one thing and a touching, genuine story also. the calm, understated manner of the lead character, franta, makes him very likable. the human relationships in the story seemed so very typical and possible of what you could expect in war time. the bond between franta and carel shows the loyalty wartime comrades can have for each other and that is often described in books and interviews with veterans. the subtitles do not detract from the story at all and actually serve to underline the problems the czech pilots had in the raf. the postwar storyline is a great reminder that for many the suffering of ww2 did not end in 1945, especially in russian occupied countries. the cinematography was also very good. wish i could have seen it on the big screen.

planktonrules comments must've been written on topsy-turvy day, because everything stated by that simple life form is the opposite of real truth!'bluebeard's eighth wife' is hilarious in every scene, in every way -- the chemistry between colbert and cooper could not have been finer...supporting cast is superb.writing and direction are magnificent!!!like so many other comments on this board again i lament, "why can't films be like this anymore?" this is classic paramount 1930's screwball comedy at its best, folks!

it's all about getting what you want when you want it. and the message of bluebeard's eighth wife is to be careful what you wish for, until what you wish for wishes for you.most men have heard the stories about what happens when your sexual frustration isn't relieved and a certain part of your anatomy turning blue. misogynistic pirates aside, cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very accustomed to getting what he wants whenever he wants it, learning only too late that it wasn't what he expected and never learning his lesson until he runs into the feisty claudette colbert. through a twisted (in soul and in practice) business deal, he ends up marring/buying her with the intent of bedding her, but she will have none of it (literally) and frustrates him at every turn, and corner, and room, and tourist attraction.the film has definite french sensibilities which means it has strong double-entendres and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge you're not accustomed to (and may not enjoy seeing) in either cooper or colbert. the whole reason i watched the film was because they are "likable" actors, and the whole point of this movie is that they're unlikable people, or at least likable people who have developed unlikable traits to protect themselves, they think, from the world. if you can accept it on its own terms you'll find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated film...and satisfaction, as we said, is what it's all about. such a movie with such a cast only comes around, after all, once in a...ummm...blue moon.

gary cooper, (michael brandon) played the role as an american millionaire who had seven bad marriages, but always divorced his wife's with plenty of money to live on. michael is in paris on business and goes into a french department store to buy a pair of pajama tops and the sales people refuse to sell him just the tops, he has to buy the bottoms or there is no sale. nicole deloiselle, (claudette colbert) listens to this conversation and offers to buy the bottom of these pajama's. michael becomes very interested in nicole and they have occasion to meet and go on dates. it is not too long before michael proposes marriage to nicole and she is very taken back with his request for marriage since she really does not know him very well. however, once she finds out she is going to become the eighth wife of michael she begins to change her mind and this story becomes quite entertaining and funny. don't miss this film, it is great entertainment by great veteran actors. enjoy.

the lubitsch's touch is more than ever in this film. humour at anytime and very subtle. the plot is simple but turned in a delicious way by the director. the film cut is very clever and add to the comic effect. a real piece of comedy that isn't getting so old for a xxist century spectator. the character are finely acted by gary cooper and especially claudette colbert so smart and mean with this poor micheal in the movie. she avoid every traps from her husband and turn the situation to her advantage, very funny. and no problem, with lubitsch, there is always an happy end. a film for men too confident with women. don't let your girlfriend watch this movie...

this film reappeared on channel 13 in the 1990s when they did a series of comedies from hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s. in fact, to the tune of "the jolly fat policeman", they had a montage of scenes from the films to introduce the series of people laughing, including one of gary cooper chortling when watching a film in a movie house - a sequence from this film.it all begins innocently enough when cooper, a millionaire, goes into a fancy department store in france to buy pajamas. but he only likes to sleep in the tops. the clerk (tyler brooke) insists that he cannot sell half a pair of pajamas as cooper wants. claudette colbert hears the argument and offers to help - she only likes to sleep in pajama bottoms. what if brooke sells them each half? brooke has never had such an offer before, so he goes to the floor walker (rolfe sedan) and asks him if this can be done. he is disturbed too - the request is quite unconventional. eventually they contact the store's owner (charles halton). halton is in bed, and gets out - his skinny frame supporting only a pajama top (if a suitably long one for the sake of censorship). can they sell the two customers one set of pajamas (half for each)? properly horrified, halton answers, "no, of course not! that is communism!!". so the sale is not allowed. apparently nobody thinks that cooper can buy the total pair and sell half to colbert.lubitsch's bluebeard's eighth wife has had a reputation of falling flat, most viewers not liking it because of a misreading of colbert's character. she is seen as quite mercenary towards cooper - selling herself to him on her terms.actually cooper's character is the nastier, as he is rich and figures that everything has a price. he is correct most of the time. look at the way colbert's aristocratic pauper of a father, edward everett horton, sees his new son-in-law as a golden goose he can use. cooper's willingness to marry colbert somehow includes an agreement that if he is hesitant or chooses to not marry her he has to pay damages. horton, when he realizes this, takes out a watch, and (in a most reassuring voice) says to cooper - "take your time my boy!", to come to a decision. later we see horton's wardrobe has gotten more modern and fancier.the film, script by billy wilder and charles brackett, compares well with their script for mitchell leisin's midnight (also with colbert, but with don ameche and john barrymore). there colbert is willing to sell herself for a money marriage to (to francis lederer), but it is complicated by a fictitious marriage to ameche. she really loves ameche (a taxi driver) but she explains to him in an unexpectedly realistic moment that her parents married "for love" but poverty made them grow to hate each other. this is not found in bluebeard's eighth wife, where colbert does not have a background like that (she is, after all, the daughter of a marquis). her mercenary plotting is to teach cooper a lesson about his standards.the film has some nice work by the supporting staff, including herman bing as a private eye who turns out to be hiding things that colbert learns about, and a young david niven, who has a set of choice moments as a stand in punching bag and as a willing ear to cooper. coop tells niven about his problems with colbert, and how she is so infuriating. niven listens respectfully. at the end, cooper is touched by his willingness to hear what he had to say. "albert, how much do i pay you?", cooper asks him. niven thinks and says, "thirty five francs a week sir.". cooper looks deeply into his soul, and says (shaking his head), "that's fair!"

ernst lubitsch gave us wonderful films like design for living, ninotchka, the shop around the corner, to be or not to be, and other wonderful films. but people usually put bluebeard's eighth wife as one of lubitsch's weakest films.but i consider this film as an important film. this film began the collaboration of charles brackett and billy wilder. charles brackett, billy wilder, and walter reisch wrote the screenplay for ernst lubitsch's ninotchka. of course, lubitsch worked with writers in the scripting process. after that, charles brackett and billy wilder worked together. they together wrote the screenplay for famous films like the lost weekend and sunset blvd.there are lots of funny moments in the film. i thought "the taming of the shrew" was very funny. there is a famous expression called "films are slices of life." and here is a great example from bluebeard's eighth wife (1938).at the first session of the scripting process, lubitsch posed this question: how do the boy and girl get together? billy wilder promptly suggested that the opening scene should be the men's shop of a department store. "the boy is trying to buy a pajama," he extemporized glibly. "but he sleeps only in the tops. he is thrifty so he insists on buying only the tops. the clerk says he must buy the pants too. it looks like a catastrophe. then the girl comes into the shop and buys the pants because she sleeps only in the pants." ernst lubitsch and charles brackett were enchanted. it wasn't till months later they discovered that billy wilder himself is a tops-only sleeper and that he had been nursing the idea for months waiting for a chance to use it.i got this information from a book. i think this film can be considered as the return of ernst lubitsch. right after this film, he made wonderful films like ninotchka, the shop around the corner, and to be or not to be.i thought gary cooper's performance was good. i think lubitsch casted gary cooper probably because gary cooper played long fellow deeds who inherited the fortune in frank capra's mr. deeds goes to town. but this is just my opinion.as for me, i highly enjoyed the film. i rate this film 9 out of 10. lubitsch films are different, because his films are slices of life.

years before pre-nuptial agreements became a regular thing, ernest lubitsch made a screen comedy on which they are the basis. bluebeard's eighth wife involves gary cooper as a multi-millionaire living on the french riviera who's been married seven times and now marries claudette colbert for number eight. but cooper's a good sport about it, he always settles with his ex-wives for a $50,000.00 a year as per an agreement they sign before marrying him. sounds like what we now call a pre-nuptial agreement.of course claudette wants a lot more than that and she feels cooper takes an entirely too business like approach to marriage. she'd like the real deal and is willing to go some considerable lengths to get it.bluebeard's eighth wife has some really funny moments, the original meeting of cooper and colbert in a men's store where cooper is insisting he wants only pajama tops and colbert looking for only bottoms. and of course my favorite is colbert trailing and blackmailing the detective cooper sends to spy on her. herman bing has the best supporting role in the film as that selfsame, flustered detective.i've often wondered how back in the day hollywood could get away with casting so many people who are non-french in a film like this. of course cooper is an american and colbert of the cast is the only one actually of french background. though david niven is charming as always, having him be a frenchman is ludicrous, he is sooooooo british.nevertheless bluebeard's eighth wife is an enjoyable film and a great example of what was called 'the lubitsch touch' back in the day.

for some perverse reason best known to themselves these imdb boards seem reluctant to credit the great billy wilder as co-scriptwriter on at least two (this one and ninotchka) of his early classics when any buff can detect the wilder hand at work. as it happens this represented the first time he was teamed with charles brackett (who does get a credit) and it was a great start. one commenter has noted how satisfying it is to see these type of films in old-fashioned cinemas and i couldn't agree more. in paris one of the smaller revival houses shows in one of its salles a more or less continuous lubitsch retrospective and i'm pleased to report that this played to a very appreciative audience right across the age spectrum though i doubt whether any were actually alive when it was first released in 1938. the famous wilder schtick the meet-cute is particularly tasty here when millionaire but-careful-with-it cooper attempts to buy half a set of pajamas in a department store on the riviera and meets with sales resistance until claudette colbert turns up and agrees to buy the other half. the gag is milked even more when, having exhausted the chain of command at the store itself the manager places a call to the owner, who is in bed and leaves it to reveal that he, too, is only wearing the top half of pajamas. the film is full of sight-gags like this balanced with verbal wit which makes it just about perfect. claudette colbert is only terrific and gets great backing from edward everett horton as her impoverished titled father. david niven in fourth billing has some funny 'business' as does franklin pangborn and if gary cooper is not up to his role lacking as he does the verbal dexterity and sophisticated persona that wilder scripts called for at this stage of his career well, you can't have everything and what you do have is darned near perfect.

there is something about seeing a movie in a good, old-fashioned movie house that adds enormous appeal to every picture. i, fortunately enough, was able to see at film forum in new york city a pair of ernst lubitsch comedies during their three week tribute to the legendary director. the double feature i attended was a screening of lubitsch's 1938 comedy bluebeard's eighth wife and the pre-code classic design for living, neither of which i had seen before. everything i read of design for living praised the film, but i could not find a good review anywhere for bluebeard's eighth wife. leonard maltin disliked it.videohound, too, gave the comedy a low rating.its imdb score was not complimentary.and pauline kael (not a great surprise) blasted the film in her scathing review. so, when i went into the city that day i was expecting to enjoy bluebeard's eighth wife only slightly and love design for living completely. bluebeard's eighth wife (which was showing first) began, as the eccentrics who populate the cinema took their seats and the thirties music subsided. `adolph zukor presents claudette colbert and gary cooper in ernst lubitsch's bluebeard's eighth wife,' the title card read. then the picture opened with a hilarious scene: cooper wants to buy a pair of pajama tops, but he doesn't want any part of the bottoms! he gets into a squabble with the clerk, who seeks the help of his higher bosses, and their seems to be no end to the argument. enter claudette colbert, one of thirties cinema's most beautiful, charming, and talented personalities. `i'll take the bottom,' she kindly intercedes. and there you have perhaps screwball comedies finest `meet cute' ever. the film kept my interest wonderfully.i found myself laughing almost constantly. when colbert discovers, just before a family portrait is taken, that her groom-to-be has been married seven times, the entire theatre broke into histerics. when she bargains for money immediately after she gets over her shock, the laughs (which still haven't ceased) intensify. and edward everett horton milked some hilarious reactions out of the script as well. when cooper takes inspiration from shakespeare's the taming of the shrew in disciplining his wife by slapping her in the face, i could not control my laughter when she slapped him back. and the drunk scene with the scallions is one of claudette colbert's funniest comic scenes. the greatest comic moment of the film came when colbert highers a boxer to `teach her husband a lesson.' in pure screwball fashion, he knocks out the wrong man, instead putting her friend david niven into a cold sleep. he awakes as cooper is arriving. in order to cover up the situation, colbert herself, in a moment of strong sexiness, puts her fist up to niven, asks: `where did that man hit you? here? right here? right here?' and then bam! knocks him out again! the film was wonderful, from beginning to end it was a perfect delight. i loved design for living, too, though i dare say i think for sheer laughs and entertainment bluebeard's eighth wife was the better and more enjoyable film. there is some charm of seeing a vintage film on the large screen. and in the presence of others laughing, one feels more comfortable doing so himself. that is, perhaps, why i felt the way i did about bluebeard's eighth wife.

when i first saw colleen moore it was in the excellent series about silent films called "hollywood". there she was in 1980, her hair defiantly bobbed as it was in the twenties, a sparkling, witty and charismatic elderly lady - the very definition of "presence". then i saw her fabulous silent comedy work in films like "ella cinders" and "orchids and ermine". then the disappointingly sombre talkie "the scarlet letter". and now here she is in "the power and the glory" giving a performance of staggering power, working expertly alongside one of the talking cinema's finest actors - spencer tracy.i found the movie a little lack lustre story-wise, but moore and tracy give such brilliant performances that the story hardly seems to matter. both actors age from youth to old age in the course of the film - and this is done mostly through acting alone with minimal make-up and hair changes. moore is almost unrecognisable as the elderly wife, and the scene where she finds out her husband is seeing a younger woman is one of the most magnificently performed scenes i have ever seen. she does most of the scene without dialogue, which is where her silent acting experience gives her the edge, even over tracy. contrast this with her delightful comic playing in another silent sequence when she is a young woman and tracy is struggling to propose to her. astonishing! what this film reveals more than anything else is how shameful it is that hollywood let this remarkable actress slip through its fingers and spend most of her life in retirement.

supercarrier was my favorite movie in the later part of the 80's when it came out. my dad taped it for me & i watched it all the time until my step-mom taped oprah over it & my heart was torn. i would love to know if or where i can get it from. i have been looking for it. i believe they even came out w/ a supercarrier 2. it wasn't as great as the 1st, but i would like to have all of them if i could find them. i do not think @ all that it was a bad movie. it was a very interesting movie with a lot of action yet it had somewhat of a love story plot to it. the actors/actresses in the movie were great. it also helped me to understand that this is not just a man's world, but it is also a woman's world & many women can do the same things if not more than what a man can do & women deserve much respect for their duties as well.

let's get this out of the way, so the ones checking out this page looking for info on anything related to the word "breasts" (and you know who you are, googlers) can move along: this is not in any way pornographic. on the contrary, if this has any value as masturbation material then, frankly, the filmmaker didn't do a good job since the aim is to keep it on subject and on the experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and society and health and so on. indeed, i would be a little circumspect of one who came across this on dvd or, if it ever plays again, late night on hbo or cinemax and used it as a means for pleasure. you might as well go to the supermarket and pick up a pair of ripe melons and take them home and squeeze them and uh, well, you get the idea.no, this is semi-serious film-making meant for premium late-night viewing, but it shouldn't have to be just for the late-night types. this is intimate in setting but not in tone. all of the women, in all their variety of shapes and sizes, and races, and even with one man thrown in with fake breasts, have something of value to say, from life experience in the most straightforward way. if i say semi-serious it's due to the several little segments that the director feels she needs to throw in, with the archival footage of old "how-to" videos about puberty and sex and breasts and super-rare cartoons with the knockers flying about. this isn't a problem but an asset: we need a few little visual seg-ways to go between these interviews.nothing is held back, and we see it as feminism in a liberating form: they don't need to cover up, and even if they choose not to take their tops and shirts and bras off they're still open as can be about a natural part of their body that is an object of sex, surprise, comfort, discomfort, curiosity, motherhood, and, sadly, cancer. in that last part, there's another brave step taken as we see a woman who survived her cancer with only one breast. you know you've become mature and an adult when you can see this woman who has somehow gone on to live a semi-normal life with one breast (the most bittersweet moment is when she says if a fairy godmother said she could have one wish to have two full breasts she would have to think about it), and you don't snicker or go "eww, gross." that's the test, folks.it's not shot under the best of circumstances, but then again for tv it's edited with a tight pace. it's never dull for a moment, and we never feel like anyone is holding back, especially when a man might hear the hard truth like that breasts may not really be erogenous, or that a flat chest is very attractive to some men. breasts: a documentary is about deconstructing myths with real faces and breasts and minds and hearts laid bare. if that's worthy of a "i was alone" session, then, well, more power to you, i guess, though it's not the intention.

this is a wonderful look, you should pardon the pun, at 22 women talking about breasts-- theirs, their mothers', other women's, and how they affect so many aspects of their lives. young girls, old women, and everyone in between (with all shapes, sizes, configurations, etc) talk about developing, reacting, celebrating, hiding, enhancing, or reducing their breasts.it's charming, delightful, sad, funny, and everything in between. intercut with documentary footage and clips from those famous old "young women's films" that the girls got taken to the cafeteria to see, the interviews are a fascinating window for men who love women & their breasts into what the other half has to say when they don't know you're listening.

in the spirit of the great space coaster, but a few years earlier.hot fudge was one of the psychedelic kid's shows that i grew up on. seymour was a big, fuzzy, green puppet, with a crescent smile of enormous teeth which nearly split his head, i recall him wearing a variety of elton john-type shades.he "played" piano, and had a jesus looking dude in a white tux, sitting next to him. they would have a moral discussion and then do a song about it.don't remember much else except the opening theme, seymour and the hippie.no one else i know remembers it at all. i grew up in jersey, so if it was produced in detroit as a previous post said, it wasn't just local. seymour reminded me a lot of sherlock the squirrel from the magic garden (another psychedelic kids show if there ever was one.) people always talk about lsd's effects of music and movies of the 70s, but it seems kid's show writers got a dose as well.

this educational show focused on emotions, interactions, and relationships. it was produced at detroit's abc affiliate and syndicated in 90 markets nationwide. this past week, detroit public tv had a 1-1/2 hour clip show as part of their pledge drive. wow, the memories that resurfaced! while i remembered the show, there were segments that i'd forgotten about but remembered instantly a soon as they'd begin ("hot fudge holy moley!", detective tomato and the pies in his face).for more on the public television special, do a search for "hot fudge comin' atcha concert"

every episode i saw when i was an innocent child was stupid. there were some funny looking puppets called "the mitts" who would always discuss childhood things. they would play this song before "the mitts" part of the show that goes like this "let's join the mitts..." there was a groucho marx puppet that told jokes. before the session, this man would sing "hot fudge! right on!" there was a green puppet with teeth that was called seymore. we would always see more seymore. he would crack jokes and sing every episode. there was always a moral in every episode. one episode, a man sang "liars are losers!" another episode he was singing about sharing and caring. seymore said tell me about those two little girls "sharon and karen." the hot fudge holey moley part has this man doing weird stuff and they played weird music.

my favourite story from 'tales from the crypt'. brion jones was born to play the part of the maniac lumberjack,axe swinging madman steve dixon.having seen him before in tango&cash i can state this actor never got the proper credit he deserved. a jealous husband takes offence in his wife showing an interest in a hunky young worker he's just employed.and you know when dixon finds out there's gonna be hell to pay!the young worker ted(billy wirth)receives an almighty beating from dixon leaving him blind.now how is a blind lumberjack supposed to work? a tribute to black humour if there ever was one! the co stars do a pretty good job too supporting ted when dixon when he has his initial suspicions about his wife desiring another man.dixon's behaviour making the bond stronger closer between the colleagues.one even stated he became a changed man when he got married.though ted should have done the wise thing and left when he could!

this enchanting movie is based on a novel by arto paasilinna. the bestseller is one of the best books i've read. here's the story:one day journalist and photographer kaarlo vatanen decides to leave his past behind, and starts a new life wandering across the finnish forests and countryside. with him he has a companion, a young hare hit by a car. vatanen has to take care of the hare, because it's leg is wounded, so they start a journey together taking care of each other.in the course of their adventures they get almost shot by hunters, get caught by the police, meet many people and finally get to lapland, where they live peacefully, until a group of foreign tourist disturbs their privacy. the hare falls ill and they must return to helsinki to see the vet.vatanen has found an ideal way of living, but the modern society tries to tie him back to his duties and taxes. in helsinki vatanen took to drink, gets even engaged and imprisoned, but finally he and the hare flee.

jäniksen vuosi is one of jarva's most political movies. it takes stance strongly against modern day society's authority status in the life of the common man, and how it has estranged men from the nature completely. it challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society.vatanen (antti litja) - smothered buy the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations - tries to rattle the chains of the society by escaping it all in to the wilderness of northern finland - only to realize that the concept of a 'free country' isn't all that unambiguous, in other words, the society has the common man by the balls.still the thing that makes jäniksen vuosi so exceptional - besides the visual and humouristic brilliance - is how it seems to illustrate the whole political atmosphere in finland in the 70's, as well as the whole identity of finland as a nation. vatanen is like an archetype of a classical finn in his solitudeness and social distantness. since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of us finns, the whole idea of that being slowly taken away by the modern society makes jäniksen vuosi emotionally exceptionally moving.

all risto jarva's films are worth of seeing. some like "jäniksen vuosi" and "loma" are best films in their genre and have reached a status of a classics in finnish cinema-history.most people have formed a impression of actor antti litja through jarva's films. litja acted leading role in three of jarva's films which all became successes at box office and movie reviews.it's nice to see that idea of "jäniksen vuosi" still lives in commercials (i think it was tele-operator sonera's tv add where litja was walking in mountain fell at lapland with hare in his arms. everibody who has seen the film knows what i am talking about..) "jäniksen vuosi" is a beautiful film with great actors and good filming locations - like famous small town in lappland, sodankylä, where the best film festival in the world is held - the midnight sun film festival. i recommend it for all to go there on june - but remember warm clothes and raincoat :)

a wonderful film in the best scandinavian eldritch magic tradition, with very far sighted analysis of much of the big issues we are just starting to face.should be compulsory viewing for all politicians.take your pick from privacy, nuclear sustainability, global climate change, quality of life.reminiscent of thoreaus' walden, but with modern twist, and considerable humour. i'm not finnish, although i've travelled there and have good finnish friends, but i found it totally accessible, and also culturally informative.

an excellent example of what happens when one central body controls everyone. i liked this movie because glenn corbett also appeared in star trek as zeffrem cochrane in 1967. i also liked it because i am a fan of the apollo space program.

i suppose it depends on when one actually sees the movie for the first time that their impression is formed the way it is.i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973, when it was "the stranger" and i loved it. such was the time when the space program to the moon was a reality, when shows like "search", "ufo", and "6m$ man" were showing a child of 12 of what the world could hold in their future. adventure and technology.you got to see shows only once and that was when the network aired them. the only way people could slash your shows was by making their own parody of it; they didn't get to take your show and add in their own comments over it.i did not know what this concept of a "pilot" was. i saw the movie and was hoping thru out that stryker would get home; did not know that there was a possibility of it continuing beyond two hours.back then, would i understood what so many people hate about the movie now? i doubt it because i don't remember it as such. do i understand now? not really for to understand the story, one must not see it from their perspective but rather from that of the characters in the movie.if one is watching as an american, it might be humorous about the lack of security in a police state.....but if one is a subject in that state, then compliance could be expected and security can be less. when things are suppose to be perfect, perfect to an extreme degree, perfect that one is not suppose to doubt, then one is not likely to question as quickly when things are out of order.the subplots of the movie are interesting such as the old man who remembers the time before but watches his words since he suspects that there are spies everywhere. or that the police state values knowledge to some extent for they are careful about how they control or harm their brain power.these days, one is likely to know exactly what the movie is about before they see it, so much of the suspense, surprise is lost. but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr. one gets quite a distance into the movie before it becomes apparent that such a possibility is the least of his concerns.this is the primary difference between "the stranger" and "doppelganger". the latter can be considered timeless since any comments it has about the ussr are comparatively minor and lost early on in the movie. in the former, those links are through out the movie, supposedly directly in the beginning and then as a theme variation after wards.all that said, despite my fond memory for the movie, it is rather easy to see that it would not have made it as a series. each week, stryker would make friends, benedict would chase, stryker would get away. eventually, benedict's society would get rid of him. someone else would pick up the chase. a rut would develop. there might be a jab at something new such as perhaps another crew member from stryker's mission showing up, but it probably would not be enough to keep the show going.if one goes in with the knives that others have used to slash the movie, odds are they will slash it as well. but if one remembers that this was made during the cold war and what fears and estimations of the other side were during that time, of what the popular environment contained for the viewer, then they may find some entertaining and intellectual themes in it.

i actually had seen the last parts of this movie when i was a child. thanks to the search feature of plots i was able to find out the name of it. for years i did not know the name, but the movie stuck in my mind. the ending left hope that the main character would get back to earth eventually. it was a shame it did not make it to a series. this movie reminds me of journey to the far side of the sun. also known as doppleganger. if you liked this feature the other one is worth a watch. it was done before the stranger, but shares a similar plot. yet different. i just picked up the stranger off of ebay on vhs. hope they make a dvd, but it is doubtful unless it comes out on dollar dvd. a few pilots are making it on the budget dvd's and maybe this one will.

tourist trap (1979) is an entertaining horror movie from the late 70's, the movie is about a bunch of young friends who get stranded on an old deserted lane by a creepy old waxwork museum.the owner of the museum seems like a strange but harmless old man, but things take a very nasty turn when members of the young group start getting killed off, who is responsible for the murders, is it old man slausen or is it his collection of creepy mannequins who seem to be alive and hungry for blood!!!! this film was good stuff, it was fast faced, the performances were very good from the actors/actresses (tanya roberts was very sexy) and the film was never boring, and like i say, it had some very creepy scenes, so be prepared to hide under the covers! definitely recommended to horror movie/ghost story fans! i give this film a highly respectable 7.2 out of 10.

i have to admit thanks to this movie i'm now afraid of mannequins. hahaha.but yes, first off the acting in this movie at least by my standard is pretty swell. most of the actors are pretty decent in their roles. the script also seems to be pretty good too, sure some cheesy stuff in there but also some decently written character and some damn scary scenes. i still get shivers thinking about that one scene with the dude and the mannequins. brrr.yeah, i'll say you should check this movie out it's pretty good, and very entertaining. a good watch. 8/10

a group of friends break down in the middle of nowhere (one had a flat tire, the other's jeep mysteriously won't start). one of them takes the tire to a run down service station and that is the last anyone sees of him. when the remaining foursome go in search of their friend, they come across nice mr. slaussen who offers to help fix the jeep and offers cool drinks and refuge from the heat in his equally run down, hermit-like house, which happens to be occupied by very realistic looking mannequins. he goes with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house. before he goes he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack; he warns them about "davy", his brother who is lurking about and isn't all there. of course, one of them decides to venture out in search of a working phone and is never seen again. is it slaussen? is it davy? the mannequins?? tourist trap has the usual horror requirements (jiggly big boobed girl, goody two shoes girl, curiosity getting the better of people and never working out!), but it stands apart from the rest of the 70's genre in it's twist of an ending. i started to feel sorry for slaussen (chuck conners is a terrific, creepy, over-the-top performance)at a point in the film, and you almost see the character of molly doing the same. this is a gem if you can find it; i had taped it off of cable when i was younger, and walking through a used video store i spotted a vhs copy that was totally overpriced, but well worth it. fans of tanya roberts won't be disappointed either. best part of the film for me was the scene with the soup (and crackers!!)i gave it a 7 because some of the movie was and still is hard to explain.

a group of young adults get stranded in the back of the beyond, where the only place in the vicinity is a museum full of wax dummies, and the only form of help is affable local mr. slausen (chuck connors). as night falls, the kids get picked off in record time.an odd, freaky b movie that combines the creepiness of backwoods settings with the plot device of all-too-lifelike mannequins (making this a good update of the "bodies in the wax museum" genre), this is an intense shock fest along the lines of "the texas chain saw massacre". (it should then come as no surprise that tcsm art director robert a. burns repeats that duty here, and his eye for great set decoration always comes in handy.) pino donaggios' score is downright chilling; accompanied by the murky photography of nicholas von sternberg, it drenches the film in oppressive atmosphere.plot twists vary in level of success; there was one that i saw coming a mile away, and one that actually took me by surprise, and i was all the more happier for it. one of the best moments is shared with us almost right up front, as the first chump victim is trapped in a room with objects flying at him of their own volition. the capper is a great impalement by pipe with blood dripping out of the end.star connors offers an engaging performance as our down-home good ol' boy antagonist, while the younger co-stars, predictably, can't perform at the same level, although jocelyn jones is a likable enough and certainly winsome lady who has enough appeal to rate as a sympathetic damsel-in-distress. co-star tanya roberts (a brunette in this film) is okay in support. (if i had one problem with this film, it's just that the victims are a little too stupid. then again, that doesn't make this much different from many horror films of the 80's.) future notable names among the credits are future directors ted nicolaou, who was the editor here, ron underwood (who made a great debut almost a dozen years later with "tremors") as the assistant director, and veteran makeup artist ve neill, who's done many films and won three oscars since.although some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements, this is otherwise a nice little surprise that debuting director david schmoeller delivers with conviction and gusto. recommended.8/10

"tourist trap" is among my favorite late 70's/early 80's horror flicks. a group of young people are heading somewhere, one pair in the car ahead, & that car has a flat, and our film opens with the young man, woody, pushing the tire along looking for a service station. he finds a seemingly abandoned place, and yet hears voices and investigates, and ends up with a piece of pipe through his stomach for his efforts. along comes the rest of the young folks (in a vw thing) and they pick up woody's girlfriend, and find this very same place, slausen's oasis, or some such thing..and then mr. slausen happens along while the girls are enjoying a dip in the stream. of course, the vw thing has mysteriously died at that point, so odd mr. slausen (chuck connors) offers his help. mr. slausen has a museum, with lots of wax figures, and he lives in the museum but behind is a big house, where he says davey lives. and who is davey? why, davey crockett, he says...but if it were davey crockett, they'd all probably be safer. the girls are left alone while slausen goes to help with fixing the car, but of course curiosity gets the better of one & she goes to investigate, and finds the house full of creepy mannequins and one rather animated one named...davey. what follows is a rather creepy night of terror as one by one, they're taken prisoner by davey, who says he's slausen's brother. one girl (kidnapped earlier) is treated to a plaster facial, which results in her death when it covers up her air supply. at any rate there's somewhat of a twist to this and kind (but weird) mr. slausen is not exactly what he appears to be. a good, creepy late 70's horror flick, and lots of mannequins make for a very creepy atmosphere. 7 out of 10.

i really really liked this one. i know, it's rampant with what are now cliché plot lines, and plenty of overacting, but it was hell of a lot of fun.in our quest for 70's and 80's horror cheese, we come across many flicks that are so bad they're good. we also have some that are so 'good' they suck, and then, we have some that are so bad they are just bad. this is definitely so bad it's good.some teens traveling come across an 'oasis' in the middle of nowhere, a forgotten slice of roadside america, and they decide to 'check it out.' they cross every line of inappropriate until it is absurd and they pay for it. they pay dearly.i would not normally give a movie like this a 9, but the girls in this one are the type that we miss from the 1970's: ditzy, scantily-clad and fit. these aren't the anorexic broads from today's horrible horror; they look awesome in booty shorts.i give it a 9 out of 10, kids.

perhaps one of the first slasher film that came out after halloween (although made from irwin yabalans from halloween), i must say i honestly found "tourist trap" to be scarier and funner. "tourist trap" is one of those remarkable treats you find every now and then, and are left with the most enjoyable feeling of surprise. it was destiny i tell you, but one night i was at my local blockbuster (one or two months before it went out of business), and had nothing to get. then i stumble upon this movie, i think huh seems like a laughable b-movie, i rent it and took it home, boy was i in for a good scare. "tourist trap" comes off as a bad movie, it definitely has it's cheesy moments,but in the end you're having to much fun with it to really care.the things that impressed me the absolute most, and the things that made this movie one of the scariest ones i've seen, is number one the setting. a horror movie without a good setting isn't very fun, not here. i just love love love the location, it feels like we can relate to it, it almost feels like we've been there before. which makes it creepier. next is the characters, non of them are really stereotypical, and they all have a real personality. for example they're not stoners, alcoholics, or even sex obsessed people, they feel like normal young adults. plus they look realistic enough, and then their is chuck connors. who gives a great performance as mr. slausen who we all take an instant liking too because again he's so real, he feels like that nice guy grandfatherly figure we adore. the last, and probably most important thing that makes this movie scary is how they make us (the audience) jump half way out of our seats, and turn on the rights, for the right reasons. for example most of the time in horror films we mainly just jump because of a sudden change in the music pitch, but in "tourist trap" prepare yourself, that's not the case. with it's perfect use of lighting, mannequins, and weirdness you feel utterly creeped out. plus i love because although they may go a bit over-the-top with some things you still feel like this could happen. which is exactly what a horror movie who takes such a ridicules premise should do, and that is make us (the audience) feel unsafe and terrified.overall as far as any major problems go, i have none, only that it's weirdness may get a little too weird at times. however in the end "tourist trap" holds a place near and dear to my heart, for being one of the few horror films to make me turn on the lights and feel unsafe about traveling.

after a group of young friends experience car trouble whilst travelling off the beaten track, they accept an offer of help from lonely local mr. slausen (chuck connors), owner of a nearby museum full of historical wax mannequins. once at the creepy roadside attraction, the friends are stalked by a mask-wearing lunatic who can bring the museum's dummies to life through the power of the mind.tourist trap's bad guy is a demented cross between the texas chain saw massacre's leatherface and anthony, the scary kid from the classic twilight zone episode 'it's a good life', whilst the plot is a blend of elements from the aforementioned tcm, hitchcock's psycho, and house of wax. the atmosphere and execution of tourist trap, however, is so totally off-kilter that, in this respect, it's virtually impossible to draw comparison with other earlier movies.director david schmoeller's continually inventive and unpredictable treatment of his own script gives the film a distinctly nightmarish quality, and with a brilliant left-field performance from connors, an impossibly creepy score from pino donaggio, a collection of truly unsettling mannequins with detachable jaws, and the presence of super sexy tanya roberts, who spends the film in (and briefly out of) tiny denim hot-pants and a figure hugging boob-tube, tourist trap is a totally unforgettable and ultimately one-of-a-kind horror experience well deserving of its cult following.

slasher movies started may be 30 to 35 years before this movie but believe me this one among those pearl that will stay longer after you turned of tv set. especially if you are a person easily scared this is the movie for you for which you wouldn't have stomach to take it full. even after so many years the movie hasn't lost its charm and thrill.no blood no gore but the thrill will for sure chill your spine out. the movie starts with the bang and it stay with the same pace till its end. bgm is nerve cracking and i remember this was the one copied in many indian movies those days. kings favorite? no wonder why... thats the only reason i wanted to see this and it didn't let me down. "don't turn off the lights"... coz you wont find enrique but may be a smiling doll sitting right behind you! beware. not for the lite hearted...two thumps up and i am going with 8 out of 10 which is pretty low but still i preserve my ratings for dramas...

let me just start out by saying that tourist trap is a better movie then 99.9% of the horror films that have come out of hollywood lately. if you don't believe me see darkness falls or they. and it is certainly better than any of those crappy direct to video releases like stab, bleed, the pool, and so on. one of the big problems with the film tourist trap is that is never really found an audience. when the film opened in 1979 it was given a pg rating by the mpaa. anyone that knows horror films knows that a pg on a horror film is usually the kiss of death for the film. (director david schmoeller talks about this problem on the dvd's commentary track.) there are exceptions though like poltergeist, which had also received a pg rating. however, there are big differences between tourist trap and poltergeist. tourist trap was not a big budget hollywood film like poltergeist nor was it produced by steven spielberg. that alone was enough to guarantee poltergeist success. (still for those of you that have seen tourist trap, you will even scratch your head as to why the mpaa rated this film pg. the 'heart burst' scene alone should be enough for the film to be slapped with and r rating. or how about the pipe in the back with the blood running out of it.) i have to admit though that when i was young i looked at a copy of poltergeist in the video store shelf, picked it up, saw that it was rated pg and put it back on the shelf in favor of an r rated film instead. years later, i finally saw poltergeist and realized what a great film i missed out on for not renting a pg horror film. from then on i would never judge a film based on it's rating again. this is most likely what happened to tourist trap. people, like me with poltergeist, will probably overlook it in favor of the r rated film. most likely it would be a teenager too, which most of these types of films are targeted at. friday the 13th was no masterpiece either but did extremely well at the box office due to the fact it was rated r and was heavily advertised by paramount at the time. it found its audience and made enough money to spawn several sequels. when you look at it folks, tourist trap is just as good as friday the 13th. the same thing could've happened to tourist trap. we could have seen tourist trap 2, 3, 4, and so on. as far as the film goes, tourist trap is an entertaining horror film made on an extremely small budget, but it is well acted, well directed and well made on many levels. chuck connors is a riot as mr. slausen and gives the best performance in the film. special credit must be give to composer pino donaggio, whose score for this film really is what sets it apart from others and gives it its creepiness. the music in the scenes involving the mannequins is especially creepy. donaggio worked on the horror film carrie and many other film scores since tourist trap. he has done exceptionally good work in film and continues to score films to this day. the weakness with tourist trap is that there really is never any explanation of davey's powers. maybe that is how it's supposed to be. he just has them, and we should accept that in order for the movie to work. we do accept it to a point, but then the screenplay has incidents like how davey makes the phone ring in the store while he's in the basement of the house. in that case, is davey limited in using his powers? can he make a phone ring in houston, detroit, los angeles? what is his range? those are things that people that didn't care for this movie would most likely to point out as flaws. others would accept it as a mistake. i accept it. there is not enough of those type of questions generated by this film to make me hate it. this is a horror film. we should not be required to read too much into it. many people have called this the 'killer mannequin' movie. i assure you that no mannequin kills anyone in this film. the mannequins are controlled by the power of davey who uses them as a weapon. this is a common misconception about this film. some people have a problem with the mannequins and some have even said they are just downright silly. i think they add to the overall creepiness of the film. overall tourist trap is a good fun rental.***(out of 5)

this is a bizarre oddity, directed by the guy who edited "the texas chainsaw massacre." chuck conners gives a hilariously over-the-top performance as the owner of a roadside "wax" museum which our doomed teenagers happen to break down near. the wax figures look "so real," one of the teen's points out. heh, heh, heh...not so much a slasher film as a weird mix of psychological horror and old fashioned "house of wax"-style terror. i can think of many, many horror films that are worse than this one.

i saw this movie many years ago, have tried to locate it but perhaps understandably it is nowhere to be found. it was so esoteric, & yet one of a handful of movies that remains with you for a long time. i am still not sure what the reality of the movie is, and perhaps, like the uncertainty principle, the obscurity is the definite thing. acting is superb, the atmosphere is always filled with a sense of foreboding, an overall melancholiness permeates, & yet, it is hard not to be absorbed in the story. i rented it thinking it was science fiction (it was in the sci-fi section with some totally misleading blurb), but quite clearly it is not. or horror, or even suspense. in fact, one feels thankful the director took the courage to make a movie like this, for which obviously there is no solid audience. i know some people have complained about klaus kinski's short role, but i think it is very appropriate - his limited exposure is critical to the formation of the mystery of this movie.

"footprints (on the moon") is almost certainly the strangest, most convoluted and most atypical giallo ever made. it may come as a restraint to some of the sub genre's fans, but this film doesn't feature many of the regular giallo trademarks like bloody knife murders (preferably committed by a masked killer wearing black gloves), ravishing scantily dressed beauties and unpredictable red herrings. however, to compensate for all this  and much more  "footprints" benefices from the most indescribably mysterious and non-stop compelling atmosphere i ever experienced in this type of film. the level of mystery in this movie is so high and unbearable it literally makes you feel uncomfortable and scared. like the female protagonist alice cespi herself, you absolutely have no idea of what's happening or why, and this feeling of utter powerlessness is unquestionably the film's main strongpoint. as a viewer, you crave to help this poor woman understand the things that overcome her, but you simply can't. alice has a successful career as an interpreter, but her quiet and peaceful life gets brutally interrupted when she wakes up one morning and slowly begins to realize she has absolutely no recollection of the previous three days. she finds a torn apart photograph of a hotel located on the holiday island gama and decides to go there in order to investigate what happened. on the island several people including a lonely little girl seem to recognize alice, only she used the fake name nicole, wore a red-haired wig and acted like she came to the island to hide from an unknown danger. meanwhile, even the poor girl's nights are restless as she has reoccurring dreams of astronauts hopping on the moon surface and an uncanny scientist called dr. blackman. the plot of "footprints" is truly bizarre and slowly brooding, and particularly the cosmic sub plot is really difficult to link with the rest. alice assumes they are just images from a sci-fi movie she saw long time ago, which sounds like a reasonable enough explanation, but you sense there's a deeper meaning and actual connection to all the other events. fans of tension-driven and stylish italian cinema can't afford themselves to miss this film, really. this is director's luigi bazzoni's psychological tour-de-force, with staggeringly beautiful photography and mind-altering music. in spite of the lack of violence (or maybe just because of it), the film is genuinely disturbing and the mental agony alice goes through honestly affects the viewer emotionally as well. as it is sadly too often the case in gialli-cinema, the climax suddenly comes rather abrupt and nearly doesn't give a waterproof explanation of all the awkward events you just witnessed for the last hour and a half. still, the content of "footprints" will keep you contemplating long after the film has finished and its powerful impact will only increase. florinda bolkan is sublime as the tormented leading lady and receives excellent feedback from the limited supportive cast, including the young nicoletta elmi. the eminent euro-cult star klaus kinski receives top-billing as well, but his role is merely an extended cameo. this film is actually a lot better than director bazzoni's more acclaimed (and much easier available) giallo "the fifth cord", so here's to hoping "footprints" will soon receive a fancy dvd-release as well.

a very insightful psychological thriller! footprints is a stylish example of the 70's powerful italian film making.and luigi bazzoni, a wrongly underrated director and visually amazing 'auteur'. the movie develops its unusual plot with an incredibly suspenseful atmosphere and never disappoints,especially in its sad and dramatic finale! florinda bolkan delivers an excellent performance,rich of nuances and touching sensitivity,being able to portray a dark lady who is not only fascinating,but also painfully real and tragically lonesome.but the all cast is a treat,as well! lila kedrova,nicoletta elmi(the mysterious kid by the beach),italian screen legend caterina boratto and stunningly beautiful b movie queen evelyn stewart in the brief but haunting role of the protagonist's friend! and klaus kinski in a surprisingly disturbing cameo! it's peculiar to notice how incredibly well done movies like footprints were! vittorio storaro's moody and creepy cinematography,stylized locations and sets,nicola piovani's haunting score and first of all the story,so intense and disturbing,so intelligently layered and structured! a thriller with fantastic elements,but especially with a soul and a personal vision. i wish movies like footprints would not be forgotten! i wish the movies were more insightful and personal today as they were back in the 60's/70's! and yes..i wish somebody will soon make a digitally remastered widescreen dvd out of this little masterpiece!

alice (florinda bolkan), a translator living in italy, discovers that she has a memory loss and can't recall the last couple of days. she starts to follow a trace of memory fragments, which leads her to the small town of garma. people in the town seem to recognize her and she's beginning to suspect that the re-occurring nightmares of astronauts conducting horrible experiments has something to do with her own amnesia.the movie is interesting and the plot is good, but it's a bit to slow moving and arty for my taste. the plot takes some nice twists and it's really hard to figure out where it's heading. florinda bolkan is good in her role (but even better in "flavia the heretic") and it's always nice to see "star" child actor nocoletta elmi. klaus kinski's role is too small though. this is not a movie for the die-hard gore hound or exploitation addict, but still a very nice hour-and-a-half mystery.

footprints is a very interesting movie that is somewhat difficult to categorize. "psychological thriller" is the most appropriate description i can think of. the female protagonist, alice cespi, discovers that she doesn't remember anything of the last three days. the only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel. she is also haunted by a recurring, very vivid, dream about a science fiction movie that she believes she saw many years ago. in her pursuit of the truth behind her amnesia she doesn't trust anyone, but little by little it becomes obvious that she has visited the town where the hotel is located before. this is an exciting flick whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how the events will unfold, and particularly, how it will end. the unusual loneliness of the main character and the unreliability of everyone else ensure that the good old paranoid feeling is present throughout the film, whereas beautiful colors and some spectacularly filmed sequences make this a visually attractive movie as well. the important part of the one and only nicoletta elmi, everyone's all time favorite redheaded obnoxious child star of italian horror, is an extra bonus.

imagine the most depressing winter you will never experience: grey instead of white, no snow fights and certainly no wonderlands. this is the finland as portrayed by 'frozen land'. this film follows a bunch of people whose lives are oddly linked to each others' with results beyond anyone's nightmares. yes, most characters are flawed in the way that only celluloid characters can - completely annoying and frustrating to watch, yet for some reason you wish for their luck to turn. with some randomly placed humour and a cast that groups together finland's somewhat mainstream faces, frozen land offers a glimpse of the finnish mentality that despite its depressing downward spirals manages to restore some faith in humanity. more so than kaurismäki, to say the least.

i didn't understand what that line meant... i do now. i didn't really want to see dirty dancing either. i'd rented it out but never watched it - and today i did. and i thought it was a really fun, great movie that makes you want to get up and dance. alright, it was cheesy at times... but it's still a great movie. i can't believe jennifer grey was 27 in this movie - my friend and i thought she looked about 18 or 19 - 20 at the most. i guess this is attributed to her acting talent. and she did really look awkward at times. patrick swayze is also very good, but you can tell he is in his thirties and seems a bit old. nevertheless, still very good. i love 80s songs so it really struck a chord with me, and the love story (yes, i'm a romantic) was so wonderfully done. i thoroughly enjoyed this movie. exceeded my expectations!

i have to admit, before i watched this film i thought, this is one of those soppy love stories where everything works out fine and dandy all the way through. but i was proved wrong when i actually sat down to watch this. i found that it was in fact a really good story about a family who go to a dance park for a 3 week holiday and there the youngest daughter, baby, finds love but has difficulty getting there with her new found love due to disagreements with her father. but along the way helps another dance instructor, and risks the whole relationship...a truly heartwarming film, like no other.10/10

dirty dancing follows the story of frances 'baby' houseman (jennifer grey)and her family as they spend the summer at kellerman's family summer camp. we get to see her discover herself as she falls in love with the dance instructor, johnny castle (patrick swayze).the movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!) some great music, and terrific scenery. it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending! you know how it's going to end from the beginning, but that's really not the point here. the point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tv...never mind the fact that i already have it memorized!

i first saw this movie with my fiancée many years after it came out. i thought i would hate it, but to my surprise it is so cheesy that it's great. we've spent many hours reenacting parts of the movie ("sylvia?!yes mickey?" or "i'm sorry you had to see that baby. sometimes in this world we see things that we don't want to."). my financee cracks up every time i imitate neil. also the music is classic and fun to sing along with, especially on road trips. of course i don't admit any of this to my male friends. it's like a guilty pleasure. i seriously watch dirty dancing once a month or more and it is just as good every time. jennifer grey is also so cute in this movie. its too bad her career never really took off.

when this film was released i dismissed as being lightweight pop nonsense. that was a mistake. after repeated viewings and seeing a documentary of the making of dirty dancing, discovering the depth of this film certainly increases its appeal.dirty dancing is a film about change. the evolving nature of relationships within the family, the changes in one's view of the world during their coming of age, etc. the story takes place during august of 1963, the final weeks of the last summer of innocence for the american people. the many personal changes experienced by the characters reflect the many changes in american society that would be marked by the kennedy assassinations and vietnam.female movie go'ers adored this film and repeated trips to the movie houses made it the world's most successful dance movie. as a male i find the romantic pairing of ultimate stud patrick swayze with very plain jennifer grey very hard to accept. this would be fatal for most romantic dramas, and it also may have create the intense dislike expressed by most male reviewers.the film's soundtrack found #1 status before the release of the movie. to this day it is nearly impossible to attend a wedding reception without hearing a dirty dancing song.near the midpoint of the film baby's mother wakes up and asks baby's father, "is anything wrong?"baby's father, the anti-change family member, attempts to keep all that is happening a secret. he tells his wife to go back to sleep. however, resist as one can, change is unstopable. dirty dancing is the story of one person waking up just at the final moments of our country's last sleep in innocence.

this is the best movie ever, but that is my opinion. some say it's cheesy but i think it is truly a beautiful film. the chemistry between jennifer grey and patrick swayze it's like no other i have ever seen, and that is what makes the film so perfect. i always wonder what would have been of this film if these two actors never existed, because not just one them did it for me, they both did. if you have never seen this film, when you do you will understand what i mean. dirty dancing looks like it was done from the heart and it feels so real for some reason, like magic- and the soundtrack love it. besides the 2 lead actors the soundtrack makes the film the beauty that it is. as you can tell i am in love with this film, and i know you will be too.

this is an excellent movie i have been watching it since i was 6yrs old with my big sister. it is the type of movie that u can watch over and over again and still laugh, smile, and cry every time with out ever getting bored of it like other movie's. it is a movie that will live on forever through generations of family. i love it :) when ranking from 1-10 in my case i would rate it easily 9.9 every time. itis a film about the change of a girl (baby) and her first boy-friend (johnny)their relationships within the family, the changes in baby's and johnny's view of the world during their relationship.dirty dancing will forever live on as a timless classic. thank-you sorry though for only the short comment.

i viewed this movie for the first time last night and i enjoyed every aspect of it the dancing, the acting, the dialogue, the plot, the script and the whole atmosphere that this movie created. i would highly recommend it.jennifer grey gives an absolutely wonderful and first class performance in her role as frances (baby) houseman. she has a natural ability and flair for dancing and she is beautiful and enchanting on the dance floor. but what is wonderful about baby is that she has such a wonderful depth and dimension to her character. this is not simply a movie about dancing but the scriptwriters have also given us a chance to see baby deal with the various emotions and feelings that she is experiencing throughout the movie and to allow us an insight into how her interaction with others at the camp changes her life. grey portrays her character with such realism and poignancy that you end up feeling deeply for baby as she experiences all she does in this movie.patrick swayze is magnificent in his role as johnny and truly succeeds in making his character come alive. he gives his character a comprehensive personality, strong appeal and great depth. the chemistry between swayze and grey is enchanting and powerful and contributes significantly to the great success of this movie cynthia rhodes is great in her role of penny and her portrayal of the ordeal that she experiences is truly powerful and contributes a frightening dimension to the film. the other members of the supporting cast jerry orbach and the late mark cantor deserve a special mention here-also give wonderful and imaginative performances that gives this movie an additional dimension of high quality acting and believability that is wonderful to experience. the dancing is magnificent and first class on the part of all involved. the script and interaction between all the major characters is intriguing and engages the viewer in a powerful fashion. the plot, although exceedingly predictable, is given more than enough life and vitality to make this movie successful. furthermore the wonderful selection of music contained in this movie creates a truly magical atmosphere and very nostalgic environment that enhances the quality and success of all the various scenes.`dirty dancing' is a truly powerful, magnificent and very appealing movie that leaves you deeply touched and with a wonderful feeling in your heart and soul and an inspiration to dance. i highly recommend it

there was talk on the e! hollywood special about the making of dirty dancing which still is considered by many women including a dear friend of mine in her fifties to be one of her favorite all time movies. maybe the music, the dancing, or the melodrama around the plot of baby frances becoming a dancing sensation with johnny castle. of course, this film established jennifer grey whose biggest role to date was the resentful sister in ferris beuller's day off. patrick swayze is perfectly cast as the heart throb leading man who sweeps baby away literally. dirty dancing has it all to become a broadway or west end smash hit. it has the love story, the music, and most of all lots of dancing. jennifer and patrick could revive their roles easily. it is nice to see jerry orbach play a doctor instead of a police officer and kelly bishop as the mother. it all took place in the catskills in the sixties where many jewish families vacationed in the area during their summer vacations. at the end of the film, it is sad to see the hotel owner, kellerman, be baffled by the next generation. it happened anyway! most people prefer cruises and traveling through europe than spending the summer in the catskills. those old grand hotels are becoming indian gaming casinos. let broadway bring dirty dancing alive and well. after all, they could do it for footloose and saturday night fever, this should be a no brainer! i know that this film is one of the favorites that you don't get tired of after watching 800 times. there are people that have probably seen this film-a 1,000 times by now. somehow watching the making and the story behind dirty dancing made me long for my childhood days as a thirteen year old. dirty dancing may not be the greatest film ever made in the history but its universal appeal still draws crowds and repeated watchers like the 800 club whose members have watched it so many times. i watch it fondly now with all the awkwardness of baby's first days and her first true love with patrick swayze as heart throb, johnny castle. nobody could have imagined this little film as a big hit then with the sixties music, two soundtracks, and even a tour in the late eighties. i hope they bring it to broadway in a musical. it would work for the audience to be part of a film. no wonder it still attracts kids and even adults particularly women of all ages to watch it over and over again. well, australia and london both have had productions of dirty dancing. it looks like it will come to broadway in 2007 just in time for it's 20th anniversary.

i have been waiting to see this film for ages and i finally have! as soon as i heard the title i knew that this film would be my favourite film ever and when i saw it believe me i wasn't disappointed!this film had everything dance, love and patrick swayze! there was so much in it and it dealt with important issues, (that were at the time, 1960's) , such as abortion.the dancing in this film was fantastic, just like the acting was! swayze was brilliant just like grey was too!although this film was absolutely fantastic you cannot say that you have seen it if you haven't seen the last scene. it really does take your breath away as the whole choreography of the last dance was done brilliantly, it had you dancing at the end of the film and it really wouldn't surprise me if it influenced people to take up dancing!overall dirty dancing is a film not to be missed and even if half the actors are in the: "where are they now?" period the actors will always have this superb film in their career!

i caught this on television one day when i was young and loved it. in the 1970's, there were a bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be be funny so it this was a nice surprise. it's one of the best comedies of the 1970's and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to murrary's excellent comedic performance, which still stands as one of his greatest. this is the film that really got ivan reitman noticed as a director. reitman proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time. while this film is hilarious and meatballs 2 is so bad that it's fun, meatballs 3 and meatballs 4 are absolutely dreadful. recommended for those who enjoyed stripes and ghostbusters.

no, it's not citizen kane. but would you expect it to be with a name like "meatballs"? it's the best damn summer camp movie of all the summer camp movies. does anyone quote "little darlings" line by line? or "whitewater summer"?this is just one of those movies that got into my brain when i was in junior high, and stayed with me all these years. every time i feel geeky, i mumble "spaz. spaz. spaz. spaz." or when we're hiking in the brush in the forest, i tell my husband, "i'm wudy da wabbit." (he doesn't get it). "it just doesn't matter. it just doesn't matter." i mean, this stuff is classic!disappointed with the dvd, though. wish there were special features, maybe a commentary or a making-of. but the movie itself is a perfect snapshot of life as an adolescent in the late '70s. maybe not my life... you can't help but want to run around out in the woods in shorty shorts and knee-high socks and feathered hair every time you see this movie.

meatballs has been a main staple in my family for over 26 years! we saw this movie when it first came out and have seen it dozens of times since. bill murray is at his best and is most touching in the scenes where he reaches out to a lonely pre-teen boy and befriends him, while leading his cit's into once mischievous scheme after another! the cast of characters are fun and zany and you really come to care about them and the relationships they have with each other. this is not another sleazy, dumb, teen sex-fest. it is funny and sweet and just all-around fun. anyone who sees this will enjoy themselves. it is a must-see. watch out for spaz - he is by far the best character! (especially during the camp social - while bill murray hams it up for the camera - just watch spaz behind him dancing with the poor girl he picks to dance with!) by far, one of my very favorite comedies of all time!

i can hardly call this a great film but it is entertaining. in my case i, at the time this film was released, was the same age as some of the junior campers in the film. for me watching this film brings back the memories of my camp years. while some of the pranks that takes place in this movie, like carrying the camp director out in his bed and leaving him on the side of a road, strung up in the trees or out on a lake, are a bit over the top some of the other pranks are not. when i went to camp the campers and counselors pulled similar stunts such as running underwear up the flag pole, canoe battles and boys raiding the girls cabin. as i grew older i realized these night raids to the girls cabin that i participated in were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so that we wouldn't find the girls in embarrassing situations but at the time i thought it was real and it was fun. that's what meatballs (mb) is. mb captures not only the scenic beauty of camp surroundings but the beauty of being young and carefree. mb give a great example of pre-teens, teens and young adults living their summer with no concerns other than guys hooking up with girls and girls hooking up with guys and booth having as much fun as they can before they head back to junior high & high school and college. the opening title song that goes "are you ready for the summer?...no more homework no more books, no more teachers dirty looks..." describes exactly how summer is viewed by school kids. i personally enjoyed the two campers spaz and fink. what boy, nerd or jock, didn't spend all camp trying to cozy up to some pretty girl camper? what guy didn't want to be accepted by the other campers and counselors? while these two characters are somewhat over the top i bet everybody who watches the film can't help but to like these two guys. these two characters are a mix of charlie brown from peanuts and jack tripper & larry dallas from three's company. i would bet that most viewers even cheer for spaz in the egg carrying competition and for fink as he attempts to "beat the stomach" in the hot dog eating contest. lastly, this movie had normal looking kids and counselors. no super models for counselors or campers that wore trendy clothing. it is fun to just kick back and watch this film and remember when life was as fun as this movie.

"meatballs" is an ode to summer camp. those of us who got to go to camp will see many of the scenes as we remember or wish they could have been.bill murray plays senior boys counselor tripper harrison, who really runs the camp. he reminds us of the funny cool staff member who everyone loves. young campers gravitate toward him and if he speaks to you, you feel like you are family. this is one of murray's best roles. he drives the film with his one liners and ad-libs.chris makepeace plays rudy, the loner camper who is taken under tripper's wing and breaks out of his shell.the rest of the campers and staff in the film were excellent as well.the overall theme of the movie is the underdog overcoming obstacles to finally win. from rudy to spaz to the camp and even to tripper himself, the underdogs of the film are the stars. the movie has heart.the film is fun and funny without being cruel or oversexed as some teen movies are today. the cast look and act like real people.the comedy and heart draw you in to the point that at the end, just like at camp, you are sad to leave.in my summer camp experience we had underwear run up flag poles, mystery meat, trying to sneak a peek into the girls cabin, the lunatic-with-the hook stories around the camp fire, and moving sleeping people out of their cabins and putting them elsewhere. but we also had a dedicated camp staff guiding us to be the best we could be.my favorite scene is the cit overnight when they are canoeing across the lake singing a goofy song. the one line that cracks me up every time is when tripper is announcing light outs the evening before parent's day and he ends "tomorrow is parents day, and you must look rested or morty will be sent to the state penitentiary."

i'm not american, but meatballs still really hits me. maybe because it's a sweet, sweet movie. watching it again today made me sentimental for a time i can't really put my finger on and a place i can't quite remember.meatballs is just a great movie. it reminds me of innocent days when nothing really mattered and anything was possible.if you're reading this you probably know what i mean.all i can say on top of what i've already said is that meatballs must be even more nostalgic if you're american.i guess you know what i mean by that too.

some people have the ability to use only 3 neurons, one for eating, one for breathing and the other one for s**ting... this is not a movie for them... but for those who enjoy using the brain... the whole movie is a metaphor, everything is there for a purpose, every single detail, the coffee mug, the red couch, everything... is a underestimated masterpiece... it is hilarious, is raw and totally realistic, that's how we actually interact.... it is a royal comedy... total causality...just hang on, don't let the first scene shock you..... hang on... and enjoy the show....

the kind of movie that demands too much from the audience, yet to disappoint most of them. i think of the mexican people who (either in an attempt to support mexican movies or willing to see a film casting top mexican stars) saw it, half of the people went out of the theater when i went to watch it, it's definitely not the kind of movie one could expect. i think too of the people from other countries who dared spending 2 hours seeing it till the very end, "what a piece of crap". in order to understand cronica de un desayuno, one has to be mexican, and one has to be familiar with the low middle classes (or even better, be part of them). there's nothing accidental in this movie, the family is and has what many families, in mexico at least, share. one has to see it with a wide open mind to accept it entirely, it's not the kind of movie that you fully understand after you watch it. the older brother wouldn't let anyone sit on his red couch, the sister is staying no matter how she wants to leave, the younger brother is going to an excursion, and all he cares about is the yellow radio, the mother has to prepare the breakfast for the family, no matter how tense and unbearable the situation is. the father came back after who knows how long, allowing the mother to live a night of passion that somehow turns out to be momentary, and ends up by repeating all the attitudes of his sons... the stories around the house are surrealistic (and so is the movie), a travestite looking for his penis, a factory worker and his attempt of suicide, subtled by the kisses of his girlfriend, a fat man riding his bicycle after a interesting conversation about homosexuals with his sister? wife? mother?... the music doesn't pretend too much but it achieves a lot, not more than a snare drum, cymbal, a some strings. thanks good a movie like this was done and released.one of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.

after the return of "horror movies" (come on scream isn't scary!) i didn't have very high hopes for this low-budget three story horror movie. but i was positively surprised! man this is scary!!! the first 2 stories are simply brilliant. the first one about a new wed couple driving in a dark forest with their rv, when they bump into a fierce........(watch the movie)! the second story is about a disgusting man who is obsessed with a little girl, who is home alone for one night.... i know it doesn't sound any special but it is scary. i promise you. the last story isn't scary but atleast not bad. it's about a biker and a ghosthouse. in fact the stories are based on real urban legends(i guess kevin williamson can steal ideas too).rent this movie it is good!!! i'd say i'ts the scariest three-short-story-horror-movie ever made!

a fascinating relic of the turbulent cultural/political aura of the late 60s (taking in the class struggle as well) which, ironically, in view of its outdated and occasionally embarrassing conservative views, makes full use of the permissiveness that prevailed for a while in mainstream cinema and which came about as a direct result of the liberal attitude it purports to criticize! norman wexler's incisive oscar-nominated script is superbly enacted by peter boyle (in a powerhouse performance) who manages to make his garrulous, down-to-earth yet hypocritical and opportunistic character (with a barely-disguised fascist streak which comes to the fore in the remarkable violent conclusion) likable, even admirable; indeed, he comes across uncannily like a flabbier version of the young marlon brando! similar to other generation gap movies of its era like taking off (1971) and hardcore (1978) but also nihilistic vigilante films like death wish (1974) and taxi driver (1976) - interestingly enough, two of these also feature boyle - joe ultimately emerges as an engrossing and powerful drama which could have been a masterpiece if it had had a more experienced director at the helm...

peter boyle was always a great actor and he proved it by his performance as a gun-ho bigot, making me hate him everytime he used the "n" word, i watched him and his big mouth and wanted to punch his lights out. ( just think, peter boyle was a monk once) (now a supporting actor in "everybody loves raymond") susan sarandon making her first debut need a bath right away and enjoyed sharing it with someone else in his own dirty water. i noticed a large raggerty ann doll(creator, john gruelle) was the only thing that susan could actually trust and love and the doll appeared in quite a few scenes. if you really want to know about the way out 70's with drugs, free love and pipe dreams, then, enjoy the excellent direction of john g. avildsen ("rocky and "the karate kid") i always thought that peter boyle should have been blown away in the end!! this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.

i really liked the movie "joe." it has really become a cult classic among certain age groups.the producer of this movie is a personal friend of mine. he is my stepsons father-in-law. he lives in manhattan's west side, and has a bungalow. in southampton, long island. his son-in-law live next door to his bungalow.presently, he does not do any producing, but dabbles in a business with hbo movies.as a person, mr. gil is a real gentleman and i wish he would have continued in the production business of move making.

joe is the movie about the dark side of the force of the 1960's in america, and susan sarandon had nice boobs. this movie scared me so much when i saw it in the theatre that i never liked peter boyle until young frankenstein and was still quite leery of him even after that comedy. looking back now from today's experience, this film seems current again in being direct and to the point of half the electorate's approval of john mccain's "joe the plumber" typecast and their fear of electing a black man as president of the usa in the coming weeks. a black prez would be seen as sweet revenge of the "niggers" but bound to again bring fire to many minds if not the streets, this time by joe enthusiasts. so, the spirit of joe in the film is resurrected in the campaign of joe the plumber! still, i love to be american and be terrified at both and by the knowledge that they illustrate what ironically gregory peck said our civilized law also is: "a living, breathing reality!" god help us.

dennis patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's boyfriend and then reveals his secret at a local bar. joe (peter boyle), a bigot who is getting drunk there, at first takes it as a joke, but then the story is confirmed on the evening news. instead of calling the cops or the like, joe decides that, since the guy killed a hippie, they must be kindred spirits! he blackmails the man into becoming his pal. at first, the film seemed harsh and judgemental, but, as it revealed itself, it actually became quite a complex portrait of the current society. yes, i think it does exaggerate a bit, but in amusing ways that don't really detract from the power of its messages. susan sarandon debuted in this film, and it's a shock to see how pretty she was around 23. well worth seeing.

i am so glad when i watch in every time the movie of (ray) for the sidney pottier of the 21st century (jamie foxx) who played this role as an evidence of his brilliant ability as an actor to take his position beside great actors in hollywood by his golden supporting for the strong abilities of afro american actors all over the times and periods by his eternal work as an evidence for the eternity of ray charles as a grand prove for their legend appearance in every time by their success for winning oscar prize as (best actor for leading role) an (best mixing sound) between fact and cinematic scenes upon ray and jamie as a mixing between two copies of ray (ray of the past) and (ray of 2004 acted in the person of jamie foxx).it was nice from the director to choose those songs to be adapted with dramatical scenes in the accidents of film to enter for the atmosphere of success in legend corn with legend movies in hollywood since 1893 till now and his cleverness of choosing sharon warrne in the role of ray ,s mother that she succeeded in this role by brilliant analysis for the core of her character that ray,s mother was the turning point for him upon her grew up to be independent on himself to take his place in this world and to be icon in his talent as (nat king cole , louis armstrong , duke ellington) and at the end of this film by receiving his honorable report from gerogia and their decision to take his song (georgia on my mind) the national anthem for this state he made his promise for his mother to be alive until now by his legend songs and brilliant life.

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles. his performance is simply genius. he owns the film, just as spacek owned "coal miner's daughter" and quaid owned "great balls of fire." in fact, it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself. ray charles is legendary. he is well-established as a musician and the music is deep, complex, and innovative ~ even more innovative than i realized before watching this movie. the film should make new fans of a young audience who might come into it knowing little about his music. ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician. i confess that i knew very little about the man's life until i saw this film. i came out of it being impressed with ray charles' courage, strength, and innovation as man and musician.

like almost everyone, i am familiar with the music of ray charles. who hasn't heard "georgia on my mind" and "the mess-around" and some of the other marvelous songs featured in this movie. but about the life of ray charles i was sadly ignorant until watching this. i have to say that jamie foxx brought ray charles to life brilliantly. his performance was powerful, right down to the mannerisms and voice inflections. the movie also offered a no-holds-barred account of some of the trials and tribulations charles dealt with over the course of his life, and with some demons from the past that haunted him well into adulthood. perhaps the most powerful scene in the movie was the heroin withdrawal scene, which was painfully realistic. the movie portrays charles' growing awareness of and involvement with the civil rights movement, culminating in his refusal to play before a segregated audience in georgia, which led to a ban on him performing in the state. his drug addiction and extra marital affairs are also well documented. the movie revolves around a plea from his mother when he was a child: don't let anyone or anything turn you into a cripple." the point is that drugs did just that, and to honour his mother's memory, he had to beat them. there's not much here about his later life and career after breaking his heroin habit but up to that point, this is really powerful stuff. 9/10

jamie foxx did an incredible job playing ray charles. i loved this movie because every so often there would be a flashback scene and then to the current movie. when ray charles was little, he went blind and his mother didn't baby him. she was a strong woman who didn't treat him any different because he was blind. she made him do things on his own and that really pushed him to become a great musician later on in life. his mother also sent him to school as well. then when ray charles became a man, he could stand up for himself and take care of himself but there was a downfall into narcotics, sex and betrayal. when i am discouraged about something i can just think of this movie and it will inspire me.

ray is interesting in parts, and technically it's very well made, but ray is often sluggish, and forgets some important details about ray's life. all the movie shows us is parts where he's in his prime, and most successful, which is good, it's just i wanted to see some bits about his older life too. jamie fox mimics ray charles to a t, at times it's absolutely uncanny. i have to say, jamie is the reason i got through this movie. the 1st half is a lot better then the 2nd. it's more interesting, it has more oomph, and it's nowhere near as sluggish as the 2nd. i wasn't a big fan of ray charles to begin with to be honest, so i really didn't have any expectations for the film, what so ever. ray's biggest problem had to be the over length. this could've been cut very easily, with more relevant scenes, other then the ones they used. i found the early part of ray's life when he was just starting to get successful, the most interesting. he was humble back then, and somewhat a gentleman. and while the film may have over exaggerated his actions, he got a bit too full of himself for me to care.performance. jamie fox gives a performance for the ages as ray. he looks like ray, talks like ray, acts like ray. he even sings like ray!. this is much more then an impression, i truly believed he was, ray charles. he was the heart of the film, and without his presence, this film would've been a complete and utter bore.bottom line. ray is interesting at times, dreadfully dull at others. when all was said and done, i was disappointed by how routine it seemed at times. just because it's a bibliographical film, doesen't mean it's automatically oscar worthy. jamie fox deserved his oscar, but the movie is above average at best. worth a watch, but if i were you, i'd keep my expectations at a rather comfortable level.7/10

it was evident until the final credits that this film was made in 1989, as all the elements of its production were made to look 1960's - the acting, the characterisations, the sets and the props all had an aesthetic from an earlier time.the film opens to the moments prior to the dropping of the a-bomb on hiroshima and how this tragic incident affects one family: a young woman, yasuko, who lives with her aunt and uncle. even in black and white, and using special effects that are quite primitive by modern standards but emotive and effective nonetheless, the depictions of the immediate aftermath of the bomb are quite horrific. family members become unrecognisable to each other, others resemble zombies as they wander the streets bedraggled and in shock.the title refers to rainfall that fell soon after the bomb, which was mixed with radioactive ash, and in which yasuko is caught. rumors of yasuko's being in hiroshima at the time of the bombing affect her marriage prospects and it is later learnt that the black rain is indeed causing sicknesses. the film is concerned not just with the physical effects of the bomb on the japanese, but on the social and psychological damage that was wrought.i found the film compassionate and a fascinating journey into a unique culture. while the film is primarily concerned with the pain felt by one family, the film's gentle political message is relevant today and probably for all time - wars have horrific consequences, and should not be entered into unless absolutely necessary. it is said that history repeats itself, and the current leaders of the 'coalition of the willing' have learned nothing. while atomic warfare has not resurfaced since 1945, other deadly after-effects have. this film is compelling viewing.

i didn't really concentrate on the larger genocidal aspects of the story (although the horrific images at the beginning are very powerful). i was really taken with the human story of the girl and her family. imagine living your life not knowing if you have a time bomb ticking away inside you. i was really wrenching to see yasuko being rejected as "tainted" by the bomb. the image that stays with me most is when yasuko stands before the mirror combing her hair, silently watching it come out in clumps.

black rain is a superb film, but watch out for the dvds currently being sold for as much as $300 apiece. i have the dvd, and it's terrible. very tiny non-anamorphic image that has to be blown up to resolution-killing size. acceptable sound. this is a primitive dvd that absolutely *has* to be rereleased.btw, i also own the laserdisc and the vhs of black rain. the vhs is a huge step upward from the dvd! and the laserdisc has far and away the best picture of them allsubtitles in the black, sharp, big picture, simple but very good soundtrack. buy the vhs and avoid the preposterous prices these scam artists are demanding!

this is a pretty faithful adaptation of masuji ibuse's novel, "black rain." like the book it is very moving and thought-provoking. the story revolves around a couple's attempts to see their niece successfully married. they are having trouble finding suitors because of a rumor that she suffers from radiation sickness, after walking through hiroshima on the day of the bombing. well filmed, well acted, moving, tragic, horrifying and funny.

after the atomic bomb hits hiroshima, charred bodies lie all around, deformed victims attempt to communicate with relatives who can't even recognize them, and one person after another dies of radiation sickness. this black and white film, however sad and scary, is not without humor. the story revolves around a young woman yasuko, who was hit by black rain after the explosion. she is trying to get married, but everyone keeps dying, and people are worried the same will happen to her. after finding a suitable mate (who is losing his mind after being in the war for too long), she ends up showing signs of radiation sickness. this film is a great portrayal of the atomic attacks on japan, it will frighten you, and will perhaps make you cry. the acting is good, not overly dramatic like many other ww2 films that have been made.

shohei imamaura's black rain was released in 1989 just at the onset of the aids epidemic, a fact that gives the film about the slow deterioration of hiroshima radiation victims an added poignancy. the black rain in the title refers to the combination of ash, radioactive fallout, and water that fell one or two hours after the explosion. there have been other books and films about the dropping of the atomic bomb but none as unique and powerful as this one. based on a novel by masuji ibuse who gathered information from interviews and the diaries of real-life bomb victims, the film depicts how an entire family is affected psychologically as well as physically by the bomb years after the original explosion. it is a horrifying vision but one that resonates with deep compassion for humanity. the film begins in hiroshima on august 6, 1945 as soldiers and civilians go about their normal daily activities. suddenly a blinding light flashes and a thunderous blast is heard. almost every single building is destroyed or damaged beyond repair. the first atomic bomb ever dropped on a city is now a part of history. survivors must somehow restart their lives, unaware of the bomb's devastating after effects. filmed in high-contrast black and white, the story centers around yasuko (yoshiko tanaka), a young woman who is caught in the radioactive rain as her boat heads back to the city to search for friends and relatives. in hiroshima, imamura shows us indelible images that remain with us: a young boy with skin hanging from his body pleads with his brother to recognize him, an older man is in tears over his inability to free his son from piles of debris, a mother is in torment as she rocks the blackened body of her child.when the family returns to their rural home, yasuko's life is forever changed. she sees her friends dying around her and waits for the inevitable bouts of radiation sickness that have already affected her uncle shigematsu shimuza (kazuo kitamura) and aunt shigeko shimuza (etsuko ichihara). pretending that there is only business as usual, the family denies that the bomb has affected yasuko. "she forgot how hiroshima and nagasaki were destroyed. everyone forgot it. they forget the hell of fire and go to rallies like an annual festival. i'm sick of it," says a friend katayama (akiji kobayashi). yasuko internalizes the tragedy, feeling shame for being different than others and guilty for being contaminated.when her aunt and uncle try to find her a husband, the eligible men refuse to marry her because of suspicions about her health, even though shigematsu has copied her diary to prove that she wasn't directly exposed to the bomb. the only suitor she feels comfortable with is another damaged man, yuichi (keisuke ishida), who has a panic attack every time he hears the roar of an engine. at the end, the beauty of life shows itself ever so fleetingly when yasuko goes to the pond and sees a sight she has been longing for all her life, the king carp jumping in the water, playfully as if to say that beyond despair there is still joy. sadly we hear on the radio statements by politicians about using the bomb once again in the korean war. "human beings learn nothing", says shigematsu. "they strangle themselves. unjust peace is better than a war of justice. why can't they see?" immamura's black rain has hopefully allowed all of us to see more clearly.

it infuriates me no end that, now and forever, i will have to identify this movie (which i consider a masterpiece, and i don't use that word lightly) with the qualifier "not the michael douglas movie!" not only are the titles the same, but they refer to the same thing- the radioactive fallout that rained upon the survivors of the first nuclear bombings. in imamura's film, this is no cheap metaphor; the whole movie is about the fallout, physical and emotional, from hiroshima and the war itself. as the deterioration of a couple and their grown niece becomes more grimly clear, the ironic imagery becomes more potent, from the old clock that is reset each night to the stone gods that gradually pile up outside the heroine's door. (these, in turn, are carved by a shellshocked veteran who is compelled, in a series of tragicomic episodes, to attack anything with a motor that approaches the town.) the bombing day itself is shown in piecemeal flashbacks that are coolly horrifying. yet "black rain" ("ntmdm!") can be watched, even repeatedly, because of imamura's compassion for his characters. i repeat: a masterpiece.

i read most of the comments here were everybody saw only the flaws of the movie. i agree, the director it's not kuprik, the actors are not oscar winners, but it has something everyone could relate to. i don't want to spoil but telling more then the plot - the finishing of school and the trip to a big party, or if you like to see beyond the metaphor, is choosing the way trough life. remember that days of youth? the days when you or our friend acted like the characters? or do you think you should acted like one of them and now you regret you didn't? if you can go back in to that time and if you can ask yourself any of this questions maybe the movie wasn't so bad.

i watched fantabulosa! because over the last few years michael sheen has become one of my favourite actors, and if you haven't seen him in anything before firstly shame on you, and secondly get your hands on a copy of either heartlands or dirty filthy love. this production did not disappoint - michael sheen transformed himself almost magically into kenneth williams, and gave a performance that was as tragically moving as it was skillful. not to take anything away from the other performances but like kenneth, michael truly stole the show. i don't know how he does it, but every performance i have seen michael give he seems to metamorphose until the character he plays is truly, utterly believable, and no matter how hard i try i cannot fault him. must go get my tea, enjoy!

a lot of my childhood was spent lying in front of the wireless listening to round the horne or hancock's half hour or watching carry on films. probably the most famous line in comedy "infamy! infamy! they've all got it infamy!" still makes me laugh.this is a rare insight into the man behind the comic figure and the whole production is a brilliant mix of tragedy and comedy right down to the final quotation from the coroner's court read in four different voices by michael sheen. he was brilliant in the role. most of the other members of the carry on team were so-so and their kenneth horne was very good but michael sheen carried the show and there should be an award of some sort for him.it left me feeling "wow". to quote kenneth williams, to the cynic who says 'life is a joke' the only response can be 'yes, well let's make it a good one.'

i saw this very emotionally painful portrayal and it was fascinating. the conflict between the public and private faces of williams and the pressure he was under is illuminated in a way that even those who knew something about him would be surprised. the cast acted superbly, but michael sheen was outstanding. i only realised it was him when i saw the earlier comment. he looks completely physically different in this role, from any other role i have seen him in or as himself. williams autobiography differs markedly from his diaries,as represented in this film. the film is at times distressing to watch, because of the emotional anguish displayed. however, it is a worthwhile experience and a film that can be recommended highly.

watching this ppv, i had high expectations for it, since smackdown is the best show in wwe, this is a very good ppv as it is the last one before wrestlemania.first match-hardy boys & chris benoit vs. mvp & mnm w/ melina in a 6 man tag team match good way to start the match. it started a bit slow at the start, but later the pace quickened & the match got more exciting & entertaining. benoit rolls through & makes joey mercury tap out to get a victory for the hardy boys & himself. 6/10second match- gregory helms {champion} vs. shannon moore vs. funaki vs. chavo guerrero vs. daivairi vs. scotty 2 hotty vs. jamie noble vs. jimmy wang yang in an open cruiserweight invitational match for the wwe cruiserweight championship i'm a very big fan of cruiserweights, & i never get disappointed watching them, especially in this match here. chavo guerrero nails the frog splash on jimmy wang yang to get the win & become the new wwe cruiserweight champion. 5/10third match- finlay & little bastard vs. boogeyman & little boogeyman this was not really a wrestling match, it was more like a comedy match, despite not being a clear wrestling contest, it still entertained me with the funny antics. finlay nails the little boogeyman with the shillaegh to get the win. boogeyman does not deserve to be on a ppv, & does not deserve to be in wwe. 4/10fourth match- kane vs. king booker w/ sharmell this was a surprisingly good match, i thought it would be mediocre, but it turned out into a real competitive wrestling contest. hats off to both men, pulling a very entertaining match. kane wins after a chokeslam on king booker. 6/10fifth match- paul london & brian kendrick {champions} vs. deuce & domino w/ cherry for the wwe tag team championships not really that much of a good match, deuce & domino need more training to wrestle, & london & kendrick are the only ones keeping this match fast paced. london & kendrick retain their titles, after kendrick gets a roll-up on one of the guys for the win. 4/10sixth match- bobby lashley {champion} vs. mr. kennedy for the ecw championship mr. kennedy attacks lashley from behind, before the match starts. it was an okay match, but not really good. lashley & kennedy have a bit of chemistry, but not enough to pull a great match. kennedy wins by dq, after lashley nails him with a chair, then assaults him with the chair all the way to the entrance area. lashley still retains his title. 4/10seventh match- john cena & shawn michaels vs. batista & undertaker this is probably the greatest tag team match that i have ever seen. hats off to all of these men {yes even batista} for pulling off as close as a 5 star main event classic. all 4 of these men played their parts in the match very well, as this was a very great & entertaining tag team match. batista turns his back on undertaker spine-busting him, then leaving the ring, which prompts michaels to nail sweet chin music, then cena to nail an f-u for the hard fought victory. 7/10i don't know why everyone says that this ppv is not good enough, or it is boring, i just don't get it. it is a great ppv which smackdown always delivers. a great ppv indeed.overall i'll give it 8/10 & a b+

every time the supposed explorers and we , the audience, is primed to set its first sights one of the wonderous new worlds, for some ungodly reason, the filmmakers decided to distract with an "emergency" or some false alarm or some bit of artificial dramatic suspense. so instead of calmly enjoying the surface of io, or standing over the rings of saturn or concentrating on the magic of flying by a comet or an asteroid, we are distracted into worrying about the wellbeing and survival of the characters. big let down !!!!the filmmakers seem to be unsure what they want. a documentary of the natural wonders in our solar system, or a suspense thriller in which the viewer cares more about the characters than the subject matter. come on. hello. if i wanted suspense and tension i'd watch a real narrative sci-fi movie. sure it's a docu-drama. but the characters and their survival here (the risks of such a mission - should be secondary to the subject matter ). wait. yes the risks of such a mission are an important part of the subject matter - since essentially this is a film about a space mission , not just about the solar system. but it was overplayed and distracted strongly from the discovery of new worlds we were supposed to be enjoying. otherwise, the film was remarkable in giving a very realistic feel for the human elements of a space mission , the squabbles, the tensions, the weight of responsibility, the near-fatal mistakes, the sacrifices , etc. also it would fit very well in the hard-sci-fi subgenre - in fact it would be one of the best , because here the science was almost closely adhered to. but the distractions were awful. otherwise, i missed showing the effects of being in space for several years on the astronauts after landing on earth. also not

my main criticism is quite simply that it isn't long enough or detailed enough. i would have loved to see more of everything: the building of the vessel, the engineering, the training, the first lift to orbit, preparations for departure, venus orbital injection, everything. i would have liked to see more of the first leg, venus to earth, instead of zipping there like a n°10 corporation bus. in fact, i would have liked to see a series on the scale of earth story made of this, with a full hour dedicated to every planet and maybe another to the loop around the sun. as it was, i was left hungry. on the other hand, i do understand budgets and viewers' attention-spans.re the science: let's be fair about the speed-of-light time-lag: they did mention at the beginning that there was a lag in conversations, but they let this evaporate once they reached the outer planets. some kind of conversation had to be presented to the viewers, and we have to assume that the lag was edited out for the sake of palatability; so no complaints there. but zero for noisy spaceships. the only film in which spaceships make no noise was kubrick's 2001, and even then he copped out by using the noise of the crew breathing in their helmets - which *was* pretty effective. i wish the makers of space odyssey had realized just how eerie the sight of vast rocket-motors blasting in absolute silence might be but alas, pegasus lets out much the same roar as every other cardboard spaceship in every other cardboard scifi film.but the rest of the science was excellent. no complaints there, in fact praise for bringing out the radiation problems as well as they did. i just hope that having done this film won't discourage the bbc from making a really detailed version, but i suppose that's not for next week or next year either...

i strongly recommend it to anybody who likes good plots, good actors (even if not well known)(often, it's just better that way), science and/or science fiction presented in an intelligent way on the (small) screen, good special effects even if they did not have billions of dollars to produce it... much better than any war in the stars...there was only one comment which was not necessary: talking about the comet, the commentator says that life was maybe brought on earth through a comet... that's fun, there must be always a chance for a magic way, huh?! that's what's great about life, can come anywhere, no need of extern force

1 let's suspend belief for a moment and let's stop pretending we could, might or ought know "how it is" or "ought to be" there in space. human knowledge in that area is probably primitive as say middle ages maps are compared to today's satellite maps, so we really have no clue. 2 considering this is "just" a bbc tv docu-simulation, it gets much better than many big budget hollywood blockbusters, and that is just incredible. 3 all in all, a show worth watching as it portrays the cgi enhanced and fictionalized account of what we know of the solar system this far. 4 probably fictionalizing and cgi-ing the whole thing is the only way to make it palatable to a large public. ever watched clips from real space missions and real space probes? the quality is generally average to poor and the comparison would be between looking at a chest x-ray (and what it tells about the human body ) and compare it with a cgi-ed cyborg movie...which one would be most entertaining? yet the chest x-ray is real, while the cyborg flick is just fictionalized sfx. 5 actors do a good job. none i'll tell my grandchildren about, but very fair for it being a bbc docu-simulation.

i'd first heard of this show in 2005, first online and then by viewing (and of course, buying)the typically gorgeous, bbc tie-in book. then i got the dvd; it did not disappoint! i'd been hoping for years someone would make a science fiction program with the emphasis on the thrill of discovery rather than aliens, laser gun fights and other hollywood 'boogieman' gimmicks! thank you, joe ahearne (also for your dr. who work, and ultraviolet--the mini-series; not the crap movie of the same name)! what compelled me to write this now (2 yrs. later) was that i'd just seen sunshine last night. and what appeared to be in the same family as space odyssey turned into (about 2/3rds of the way in) freddy krueger meets 2010! that was when space odyssey really stood out as a positive example of how to do a real science fiction film; more science, less fiction! odyssey (like sunshine) also dealt with astronaut shortcomings (zoe's failed eva, ivan's over exertions on venus, the spats with mission control) and the sheer danger of exploring new planets with unfamiliar dangers (the fatal radiation spike on mars). i would've easily paid to see this in a theater (i-max, anyone?). and to top it all, not only were the space vistas jaw droppingly beautiful, but the characters were nicely drawn, too. i found their interplay more realistic than the wall-slamming histrionics of sunshine's icarus 2 crew (icarus; dumb name for a solar mission--did anyone read the mythology of icarus??). sometimes it takes a not-so-good film to compel one to re-watch a better film. as an armchair astronaut, i'd trade my passage on icarus for a seat on pegasus any day. in all fairness, however, the visuals of sunshine are quite stunning, though, and quite memorable. which is why i was so strongly rooting for it to succeed as an honest-to-goodness sci-fi film. so, even though this review is almost a back-door review of sunshine, i hope it's read for what it was meant to be; strong support for a bbc telefilm that succeeds where most big-budget, bloated cinematic spectacles fail. space odyssey (a.k.a. voyage to the planets here in the states) whets the appetite for solid, science-fiction and delivers a banquet. i very much enjoyed the pseudo-documentary approach as well. as for the time lag/light-speed quibbles, they are addressed, if you pay attention. where sunshine melts, odyssey keeps its cool. if you're considering going to the movies for another dose of sunshine, stay in; go for a true space odyssey instead!

laura gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to africa for a photo shoot. there she is met by a couple and other swinging couples. they all stay at this huge, very touristy hotel with a gigantic swimming pool. one night they have a pool party complete with "real live" native dancers. it's very un-politically correct and very kitschy. later, emanuelle finally has her photo shoot, which turns out to be in one of those drive-through, stay-in-your-car safaris (albeit the photography is gorgeous). throughout the film, emanuelle is going after every man she meets. the photography is very well done in this film. there are scenes with cascading waterfalls, galloping giraffes and ancient ruins. the film is worth seeing for the soundtrack by nico fidenco alone.

the first of the italian rip-offs of the french soft porn blockbuster (though it might be interesting to note that the boot-shaped country actually got their first with cesare canevari's 1968 io, emmanuelle starring erika blanc) is a very different kettle of fish than the sleazy sequels provided by the late, questionably great joe d'amato. it is much closer in spirit to the now very dated just jaeckin film from 1973, taking a pokerfaced look at male/female relationships, questioning such then hot topics as fidelity and jealousy, all in luxurious exotic surroundings. unlike d'amato, director albert thomas (aka adalberto albertini, who also made the hard to find yellow emanuelle, actually a sexed-up version of madame butterfly !) does not present us with predatory drug lords, snuff movie makers or rampaging cannibals, making for an admittedly less sensational yet far more erotic viewing experience.photo journalist mae jordan aka 'emanuelle' (lovely java-born laura gemser in her first lead role following bit parts as a thai masseuse in emmanuelle 2 and an 'unspoilt native' in just jaeckin's portion of the rarely seen collections privees) flies down to nairobi where she's to shoot the stills accompanying an article by noted british writer anne, played by the very teutonic karin schubert with a butch haircut that takes some getting used to. anne shares an 'open relationship' (remember when this was made) with her italian husband gianni (angelo infanti), meaning that both pretty much jump anything with a pulse. contrary to her subsequent reputation, emanuelle appears positively reticent compared to her heavy breathing hosts, smoldering seductively at gianni by way of foreplay until the exquisitely tantalizing pay-off. okay, so she does make up for this lack of wantonness at the end when she does an entire male hockey team on the train. i kid you not.production on this sexploitation classic is quite impressive, especially the superb cinematography. and nico fidenco's musical theme is a solid favorite of anyone with more than a passing interest in the genre, a hilarious eurotrash pop ditty (try to make out those totally nonsensical lyrics and have a full evening's worth of fun with the family !) that turns up throughout the entire film in every conceivable type of rendition from slow 'n' sexy to hip-gyrating disco.this is entirely laura gemser's show though. billed simply as 'emanuelle' (as was another actress on the same director's elusive emanuelle nera 2), she lights up the screen from start to finish. not yet submitted to endless rape scenarios (as she would be once d'amato took over), she seems much more relaxed than in later films, even smiling from time to time, a rare occasion as anyone who has seen some of the lady's work surely knows. a flawless eurasian rather than as the title suggests black beauty (she hails from dutch india now indonesia and is actually quite close in physical appearance to the supposed author of the novel emmanuelle arsan), she projects a slightly passive, even submissive sensuality which somehow detaches her from the 'depravity' her morally corrupted cohorts indulge in. unlike the french film, cheapskate moralizing is kept to a bare minimum, almost thrown in as an afterthought near film's end when emanuelle tells gianni that he hasn't lost her as he never possessed her to begin with. i swear you could hear audiences of the just jaeckin version groan whenever alain cuny's supremely irritating mario showed up on screen as it meant we were in for too many minutes of halfbacks libertine philosophizing as an alibi for getting the divine sylvia kristel (now living in the belgian capital of brussels by the way...) to disrobe, the real reasons theaters were packed for years on end. gemser's later husband, gabriele tinti (now deceased, she has remarried), appears on the sidelines as the constantly drunk 'scottish' (huh ?) writer who forces himself briefly on emanuelle amid the african ruins at some point, but no real sex scene though.

the main reason to check this one out is to watch laura gemser in all her glory.that's reason enough for me.she heads to africa as guests of another rich guy that seems to be all over these films. huge mansion near the jungle. hunters staying around for parties when they aren't out hunting zebras. and said parties becoming drunken orgies.all the high society types in the emanuelle films seem to have out of control fetishes. and emanuelle beds most of them.joe d'amato did not direct this one. he just ripped it off and used the same cast(s). and did anyone notice the 'subliminal' sexual images at the gas station? and why did most of the men stay dressed during the sex scenes? coherence? hardly any. but goddess gemser is beautiful.

in one of the better movies of the year, tom hanks stars as congressman charlie wilson in this sardonically funny and extremely relevant (given reasonably current events) historical comedy-drama surrounding the 1980s afghan/soviet fiasco. the soviets were attacking afghanistan killing hundreds of people. why should anyone care? people are dying, right? no, the reason the united states got involved through charlie wilson was because the afghans, in fear they would get blown to sh_t, started illegally coming into pakistan which in turn p_ssed pakistani president mohammad zia ul-haq off. charlie wilson in an effort to fix this situation teamed up with the sixth richest woman and religious fanatic in texas, joanne herring (julia roberts) and a amusing and robust american spy for the cia, gust avrakotos (philip seymour hoffman) to help supply afghans with high-tech weapons to destroy soviet fight air-craft that would try and attack their land.although certainly not a serious oscar contender for best picture, 'charlie wilson's war' is probably one of the best of the many political films of the year. academy award winner mike nichols provides solid directing as to be expected while emmy award winner aaron sorkin (sport's night, the west wing) provides a remarkable screenplay that near-flawlessly balances comedy and drama. the acting is great for the most part as well. tom hanks delivers his best and most enjoyable performance since his 2000 oscar-nominated turn as a fedex worker stranded on a tropical island in 'cast away'. hanks takes a slimy character like wilson and with his trademark charm turns him into a likable guy. amy adams and ned beatty are reliable as always, but the real stand-out performance of the film is from philip seymour hoffman. arguably the finest actor working in the film industry today, hoffman takes a small supporting role and upstages everyone around him. from his first scene where he's screaming at his boss before violently breaking his window, hoffman sucks you in. the only disappointing cast member is unsurprisingly overrated hollywood starlet julia roberts. hamming her way through yet another movie, roberts' overbearing and over-the-top portrayal of a rich texas oil woman hits all the wrong notes and is at most times flat-out annoying. at 97 minutes, the movie is short and sweet, and that isn't to say it doesn't drag at some points but when it does drag it's for a very brief amount of time.in conclusion, 'charlie wilson's war' is not a perfect film by any means, but it's certainly worth a look. grade: b+

i quit watching "the west wing" after aaron sorkin quit writing and producing. it just wasn't the same. imagine my thrill at seeing a film that he wrote again. it has been a long time - the american president, a few good men. his script was a beautiful blend of humor and tragedy. he made a compelling story believable, and made me weep at the same time.tom hanks was incredible as a small-time texas congressman whose constituents only wanted lower taxes and to keep their guns. not a hard job, so he had plenty of time to fool around - and that he did. his office staff looked as if he were at the playboy mansion. like he reportedly said, "you can teach them to type, but you can't teach them to grow tits." despite his sexist attitude, which fits right in with a texas congressman, they were fiercely loyal, especially his aide, amy adams (junebug & former hooters girl).now, add a rich texas socialite who wants something done in afghanistan, played perfectly by julia roberts; and a pain-in-his-boss's-ass cia agent, superbly done by philip seymour hoffman, and you have a movie well worth watching.outstanding writing, and superlative acting, and a story that needed to be told. what more do you want at the movies?

charlie's wilson's war demonstrates with deft veracity just how futile wars can be, especially to the very people who spend countless hours and finances to fund them. virtuoso performances and remarkably memorable characters teamed with a riotously sarcastic script catapult the film, helmed by the continuously unpredictable mike nichols, to the top of the year's best. politics has never been so much fun.charlie wilson (tom hanks) is a texas congressman who is credited with almost single-handedly winning the cold war. hanging around plenty of drugs, women and scotch, he also takes an unexpected interest in the events in afghanistan and the terrors of the soviet union in the 1980s. enlisting the help of gust avrakotos (philip seymour hoffman) a renegade cia covert mission expert and joanne (julia roberts), a wealthy socialite, he raises money to provide afghanistan with the rocket launchers and antitank weaponry they need to cause serious damage to russian military. eventually by the end of the 80s the cold war would come to an end, and the funds would immediately be cut, thereby removing all help for the fledgling country to rebuild and recoup.the acting is exquisite, although it's to be expected from the more than accomplished cast. a large part of that however, should be attributed to the script, which allows each character to be undeniably well-developed and memorable. and a hearty helping of that credit goes to the novel of the same name, which is hilariously honest. tom hanks delivers yet another unequaled performance as charlie wilson, the man who did so much for so many and yet still remains relatively unknown. philip seymour hoffman plays gust, a character that is vividly boffo in both his physicality and his wry cynicism; the inimitable hoffman once again shows superb range in the characters he portrays. julia roberts is perhaps the only weak link of the film, with her generic snobbish character and not-subtle-enough accent. and then there's wilson's "jailbait" squad of young secretaries that scamper about to keep him happy. led by the always delightful amy adams, each supporting role has its mirthful moments.defeating the soviet union was not an easy task, especially considering the many conflicting goals between the various political leaders. "why is congress saying one thing and doing nothing?" queries a disgruntled politician. "tradition mostly", returns wilson. everyone appears to want the cold war to end, yet a blind eye is being turned to the atrocities taking place in afghanistan. it takes a trip to the war-torn refugee camps in pakistan to motivate wilson, as well as with his main financial source doc long (ned beatty). wilson uses strategic ties with committees to raise funding of weaponry in afghanistan from $5 million to $10 million with a simple command, but the president of pakistan scoffs at the idea of winning a war for such a trivial amount. by the end of the wilson campaign, $1 billion is sent to the mujahedin to shoot down russian helicopters - the first step toward victory, as wilson predicted. beyond the scope of the film, the unresolved turmoil in afghanistan led to further, less ignorable problems, which wilson presumably foresaw.during the course of charlie wilson's war, the main characters travel from the united states to pakistan to afghanistan to jerusalem to egypt, but wherever they go, sarcasm always follows. there's a surprising amount of comedy in the film, considering the political undertones are generally serious. hoffman provides jokes with almost every exchange of dialogue, as does hanks, with his naturally witty woman-chasing ideals. a scene early on featuring gust being continually ushered in out of wilson's office as he tries to straighten out a legal issue with his posse of gorgeous gals ("you can teach 'em to type, but you can't teach 'em to grow tits") reminds me of a slapstick routine from the marx brothers.with the press focusing on the drug allegations against wilson, instead of the important issues of the cold war, and the conflicting desire of officials to budget their help, it's clear that by the end of the film, the politicians are still oblivious to what's really necessary. and since the screenplay is so quick-witted and astute, some audience members may not be able to keep up with all of the dialogue-intensive events. but, as demonstrated by the politicians who are ignorant as to the difference between pakistan and afghanistan, it's essentially another argument to support charlie wilson's point.- mike massie

i have so much hope for the sequel to gen-x. luckily, my hopes have came true. you got a whole bunch of action, comedy...silly comedy, and surprises. i think the newcomer edison, is really a hit in the movie, but i really find sam's 'alien' stupidly annoying with english. although the movie had some flaws with the robot graphics and the silly dialogue, the action always keeps it strong. the action set-up is much stronger than the 1st.this movie is getting more of an american feel since 60% of the movie is in english from the cantonese. this movie will not disappoint you. i recommended this for young 'uns that care about pure action-packed fun.

i think this movie has got it all. it has really cool music that i can never get out of my head. it has cool looking characters. is really funny(you know, the kind that you'll crack up on the ground and you'll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks).despite the bad acting, bad cgi, and bad story(about cops going after a robot), its really cool. its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch, get together, eat pizza, laugh like crazy, and watch it two more times.there are so many funny parts, like when kurt was trying to get edison's attention and gave him the finger, and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball. on that part, i kept saying "remember, remember?"to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened. there was also a really funny part when edision ran into the room and kurt was there(just before they fought) and kurt was talking about his "strange dream" and how he was "superman". i loved that part, although it has been a while since i saw it, so i don't remember that part. everything the actors said were funny, like how kurt says, "i worship you, like a god!" to the robot.although there was some bad things, in all it was a great movie. man, i can't stop laughing. i wish i had that movie. );

gen-y cops...since i heard of the film being in release, i have been wanting to see it because i loved gen-x cops. i was a little disappointed that a) nicholas tse didn't return and b) too much slapstick. nevertheless, i enjoyed the sequel because it may not be good as the first film, but it is good in its own way.stephen fung returns as the ultracool ladies man match, who has a steady girl in oli (note: where is haze?) and sam lee returns as the insane alien (this time sporting a mohawk and speaking a lot of english!!!!). the real star of the film is newcomer edison chen. he makes a great replacement for nicholas tse as...edison. i also enjoyed paul rudd's performance of agent curtis...he seems to be the tough as nails, smartmouth fbi agent you'd love to hate...but soon, you'd like his character.the fight scenes are a lot better in this one...even though there are very few, but they are great, courtesy of jackie chan stuntman nicky li.look for a cameo from ron smoorenburg as a cage fighter who has a teeny little fight with match. smoorenburg also is the stunt double for rudd.if you liked gen-x cops...you'll love gen-y cops!!!

this film is great. all the hi-tech machinery and technology is mind-boggling. it is packed with action, humour and not to mention, guys. you will want to see it again and again. very very funny. also, it has a very unique plot which is unpredictable. you wouldn't want to miss out on it.

i am having a holiday in hong kong now, and i just saw gen y cops at the cinema.... what can i say... it was sooo cool!!everything you could wish for was in it! basically... just see it if ya can... i'm gonna get my friend to send me the vcd when it comes out....only bad thing was the dodgy american style of talking employed by some of the hl actors... like edison... "what's up my man?!" but it did add even more humour to iy... hhehesee it... especially if ya like any of the following geners: hkfilm, action, comedy, sci fi! seeitman!! edison did a good song for it too... so download it... edison tse - heroes

this is a well done action movie. there are plenty of fight scenes, the acting is convincing (for this genre) and rs1 is awesome. i don't know why people feel compelled to trash rs1, i thought his effects were executed very nicely and his design looked great. the plot was acceptable for a martial arts movie.having said that, i must tell you richard sun is one of the worst actors from hong kong i have ever watched. at least rs1 had the right idea by killing him. now, for all of you who thought sam lee (alien) was a bad actor...he wasn't meant to be taken seriously! i have just had the pleasure of watching gen-x cops (prequel) and sam lee played the same character the same way!now, please, all of you guys who watch highly reviewed oscar winners: do not judge this is a thinking man's movie! it isn't supposed to require thought! just meant to be enjoyed, that's all. i hope they make another soon.

genius or utter madness? that depends on your interpretation of this film. i responded to it on the level of a self-aware "cop-movie parody", and i sincerely hope that was the intention as i don't see anyone taking it seriously! :-d paul rudd for one seems to be chewing up the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things! is this film supposed to mark a departure for rudd from his core background in the comedy genre? some kind of insane attempt to reinvent him as a hard-boiled action star? i think not! with the cheesy, almost awkward acting, low budget fx, and zany over-the-top action set pieces, it all kinda evoked that old tv show "sledge hammer" for me! hilarious!!! :-)of course, i may have totally interpreted the film wrong. if it was in fact an attempt at a 'straight' action movie, then it was certainly an amusing failure!!watch with lots of alcohol and some mates!!! ;-)

this movie is certainly worth a watch. it's full of action. it's also humorous. you'll laugh until your stomach hurts if you watch this movie. this movie also includes lots of hi-tech things hence the name gen-y. i recommend you to watch the prequel of this movie which is gen-x.

this is a laurel & hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments but overall the movie relies a bit too much on just one comical premise.the comical premise this movie mostly relies on is very simple; stan laurel not wearing any pants. laurel plays a scottish naive young person who arrives in america in full kilt. for some reason he gets the center of attention because of this and his uncle played by oliver hardy thinks because of this that its time to put some pants on philip.its humor is well executed but the main premise also gets a bit tiresome after a while. although the movie definitely still has its comical great moments, it at the same time is also far from the best of the many laurel & hardy comedy shorts that are still around. the movie is simply too simple to be considered one of the greatest, although it definitely is most fine executed all, for most part.great good clean fun, just nothing too remarkable or memorable all.7/10

this is one of l&h's shorts most frequently cited as the first "real" l&h teaming and perhaps one of their best silent features. j. piedmont mumblethunder (ollie) is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet his nephew philip, whom he's never seen. at first ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man unboards and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way he's behaving during his medical exam, but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow he's supposed to be greeting. he has been told that philip is a good boy, but he has one weakness--women. mumblethunder and philip set off to go home, but their journey there is continually interrupted by philip breaking into a little dance every time he sees a woman, then chasing after the woman. huge crowds gather each time this happens, not so much because he's chasing skirts, but because philip himself is also wearing a skirt (a kilt). finally mumblethunder manages to drag philip into a tailor's shop to be measured for a proper pair of pants, but philip escapes from there as well to chase more skirts. there are lots of laughs all around. it's also nice to see a short like this because the boys aren't exactly the characters we know and love. ollie is pretty much his usual character, but it's such a joy to see stan acting so differently from his usual man-child character. it shows he wasn't a one-trick pony and excelled in other types of roles when he got the chance. with a run time of 19 minutes its short and sweet, providing classic one liners which still have me in stitches.

stan laurel regarded putting pants on philip as the first true' l&h film. the second hundred years was the first 'official' l&h film, but this was the one where stan completely resigned himself not only to performing (he had signed on with the hal roach studios as a director and 'gag-man', before certain situations - among them oliver hardy's accident with a leg of lamb leading to stan having to replace him; and the extra money that performing would provide for himself and his new wife, lois - brought about his historic return to performing, as well as writing, directing, editing and involvement in other areas of production), but also realised the fact that he was part of a team that worked well together. this, therefore, is an historic and very important film in the history of comedy.it is also a surprisingly funny little silent film; rather different from what laurel & hardy would become known for and from what they are more immediately associated with today. the characters of 'stan & ollie do not appear - scottish stan laurel plays the nephew of oliver hardy, a respectable man about town who is reluctant to be seen with this strange-looking fellow with a kilt and the habit of chasing pretty girls. there are some very funny moments in this well-made, charming little movie, and the performances of these two kings of comedy are spot-on - watch stan's little 'scissor-kick' and smile that says, "well waddaya know?" when he sees girls, or the hair-ruffling scene at the airport, for instance. hilarious.watch this film if you can, with backing music from the beau hunks orchestra (available on the vvl video releases) which enhances the 1920s feel and is very, very pleasant to listen to. it's a brilliant and underrated little film, which is why i said it was 'surprisingly' funny.

cocky medical students play chicken with process that simulates death, in attempt to get a (hopefully temporary) view of the afterlife. certain plot twists and themes are a little off the mark, and the acting occasionally goes over the top. but the underlying message - about god's and others' forgiveness for our real or perceived sins - is positive and unique in cinema, and the cast is very very good. the last sequence between julia roberts and her father is so effectively done that, years after having seen it, i still get chills thinking about it. highly recommended.

countless tv displays and the memorable appearances from 4 of today's mega-stars(plus hope davis's screen debut) keep flatliners still in prudence. the plot is about a non-academic research of five medicine undergrads pursuing one's crazy idea on discovering the secret of death, and learn what's after death, then come back to life again. yet the storyline hasn't been designed as fascinating as the idea of the plot.there are popular stereotypes to develop a regular teen-slasher script in flatliners. there is nelson who creates the idea of decoding death, pretty but introverted rachel, david who cuts the gordian knot on luckily not to be dismissed from the school, ladies' man joe and finally the smart guy randy("i did not come to medical school to murder my class mates no matter how deranged they might be"). they join hands altogether in an experiment where nelson's heart will be stopped and rerythmed. then they decide to continue this experiment in strict confidence at night times in the campus. not long after nelson's experience everyone starts a race over having the wildest and the longest death experience, risking their lives one by one. yet, soon they realize their daily life becomes affected from those experiences they had. the visits to the afterlife brings back their delinquent feelings from their childhood memories. depolarizing their deep subconscious watchfulness, they begin having somatic delusions and visual hallucinations.when the point comes where the explanation of subconscious, director joel schumacher skips that every humankind has a subconscious personality which they are not aware of. this inner personality keeps one from altering into identity loss. if you lose or if you depolarize this subconscious personality you certainly lose your identity instead of refreshing childhood memories. i wanted to add this as a movie mistake, which already has been mentioned via movie critics in the earlier 90s'. obviously here in this movie schumacher made the actors have it least affected. then why do they hesitate continuing on the experiment after learning their lesson, as if death is designed indiscoverable by god? david had been introduced as an atheist, now he turned out to believe in god when he recalled a flashback from his childhood. after witnessing this 180 degreed change in david, it's clear to see that schumacher's film was so conservative and lily-livered; that's ultimately why it's never classified as a work of science fiction. alas! it had a good potential. it even tried to tell the unconscious maturation from having a death experience, beginning to believe that death is so simply natural and it's only a part of a human's life.more than what's in the movie, it was also memorable to recall what's with the movie. jan de bont as the cinematographer, who had worked almost every time with schumacher, creates an dreamy atmosphere like it's being an gothic horror movie. the blue color schemes all over the walls reflecting into the actors' faces deliver first class of lighting, that suits perfectly with the film. the close-up shots of the gargoyle statues in the campus buildings, catholic frescoes in the walls, stop-motion cameras, and the dynamic camera speeds were all belong to bont's skills.flatliners became a cult movie in time with its sociological pen-portrait of the x-generation juvenile especially via its futuristic editing style with storyboard connection sequences like being part of a video music clip so much aesthetically. those were the times where fast-paced and multi-sequenced video music clips were on rise. this style was very rare to come across in those years after its pioneer tony scott's "the hunger(1983)".

this film has a decidedly weird setting, taking place in a school that's really old to begin with but it certainly doesn't look like any sterile medical school environment. very gothic and atmospheric. as for the film itself, well, ok, the premise is a bit far-fetched but hey, that's why we watch movies, isn't it? and it's less far-fetched than some of the garbage that's out these days, that's for sure. medical students are experimenting with 'short term' death, as in allowing themselves to be briefly dead so they can experience what the afterlife is like. it's kind of nice, in some cases, till parts of it come back with the voyager and start meddling in their earthbound lives. i hadn't seen this film in years till i got it on dvd and i have to say that i'd forgotten just how good it was. and it struck me that julia roberts looks truly beautiful in this film, not like actresses of today that are supposedly gorgeous but are dressed and made-up like cheap hookers. ahh, the good old days. anyway, this is a great flick, perhaps not for fundamentalist christians but many others may enjoy it. 8 out of 10 stars.

transcendental, sophisticated, incisive, emotive, powerful... i could think of a hundred adjectives to describe this fantastic work of art and intelligence, and still i would feel they were insufficient. all i can really say is that i am infatuated with this film. applause to krzysztof kieslowski, zbigniew preisner, irène jacob, and jean-louis trintignant. may "rouge" live forever.

flatliners has all the ingredients of a good joel schumacher film - intelligent, youthful characters, stunning cinematography, a gripping story, and excellent performances. it's escapist fun but it's done very well and resonates with a positive spiritual message despite the unnerving precedings.schumacher has a knack for spotting talented young actors, and all of the main five here have gone on to greater things (see the cast list). their believable performances help to raise this movie well above average. kiefer sutherland shines in his egotistical med-student role.the cinematography really stimulates the right side of the brain, which is what i love about schumacher; his use of light and location create images that stick. a disturbing nightmarish atmosphere is created which unsettles you while you watch the film and haunts you when you go to bed - reminded me of the lost boys.this is a film that takes an awesome premise - curious students want to find out what's after death, and successfully follows it through into a scary, gripping tale of redemption. one of schumacher's best; highly recommended.

what some hollywood-movies try and practically never succeed, creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons (without becoming unrealistic), manages this beautiful movie perfectly well (resembling in that way a little to the wonderful 'la double vie de veronique' of the same director and with the same beautiful actress). this is a real movie, that changes perspective of life a little bit - intelligent and beautiful story, masterfully directed, excellent main actors, masterful cinematography. i've just seen the movie the 3rd or 4th time, and i still think it's one of the best i've ever seen. and if you should be unhappy with the ending of 'white' - 'red' puts an happy end to the whole trilogy.

a wonder. my favorite film. the most important film about relationships ever made. brilliant writing. magnificent directing. image systems and symbolism that leave you thinking about it all days, weeks, years later. wow. a truly great work of art.

this movie is not only about feelings and human emotions, it is also about everything that could be but it's not. poetry in movies can be awfully boring and annoying, but this movie is delightful to be watched. not to mention the amazing irène jacob, a great actress in france - one of the best, actually. when the movie ends, you can only feel sorry. after all, when something is truly great, we want more (well, for another great movie by k kieslowsky with irène jacob we can always watch la double vie de veronique)

i love a film that mixes edge-of-the-seat suspense, laughs, style, good acting, and a bit of self-parody. hitchcock consistently carried this off, and in "le cercle rouge" jean-pierre melville does the same. i was sorry when this long film ended. i agree with the english commenter who found remarks by one of my compatriots chauvinistic. i love french films, italian films, english films, indian films--and the increasingly rare good american films. i also feel the writer who panned the film for being not even a good copy of an american gangster film, missed the point completely. but i guess it's like jazz: either you get it, or you don't, so why waste time trying to explain.just see "le cercle noir" and be prepared to be deliciously entertained.

there were heist movies before this one, and indeed the likes of rififi were an obvious influence on it - but the red circle is more than just another entry in an overpopulated genre and with this film, director jean-pierre melville has managed to create something that both thrills on the surface and gives its audience something to think about. being cool is just as important a feature of the modern crime movie as guns and gangsters, and melville delivers that with this film in droves; the tone of the film is very relaxed too and melville allows the bulk of the film to bubble under the cool exterior. the story has a number of angles but the central character is corey - a thief who is released from prison. his release coincides with the escape of infamous murderer vogel, who slips from under the nose of police commissioner mattei during a train ride. the first thing corey does upon release is steal some money from his former boss rico, and the second thing he does is recruit vogel and a sharpshooter to help him pull of a jewel heist. but rico and the police are hot on the thieves' tails...the film is bolted together by four excellent central performances. alain delon is calm and calculating as the film's anti-hero, while gian maria volontè looks formidable in his role as the escaped murderer. françois périer is good also as a dubious club owner, while the real standout performance comes from andré bourvil in his role as the police commissioner. the film runs at almost two and a half hours and is not exactly a thrill ride. however, the director keeps things interesting by keeping the action focused on the important elements. the film does feature crime film stapes such as shootings, but they are kept to a minimum. the first two thirds of the movie are really just building up to the suspenseful heist scene towards the end. rififi was most famous for its heist sequence - an intricately designed scene in which nobody speaks a word. the heist in this film is similar in that it is also wordless, and i have to say that i preferred the scene in rififi; but melville's skill in direction and the calm and composed way that it plays out make good of it. the film boils down to an exciting climax that rounds it all off nicely. overall, this might not appeal to all crime film fans as the action is more than a little bit slow; but the red circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.

after 30+ years of hiatus, once again i immerse myself in the mist of uplifting melancholy. the cold, slow-paced and existential treatment of this crime story comes from a different world, melville's world, where darkness is pure enlightenment.

meville's caper film is not as good as his most famous movie, the deliciously stylish "le samourai (1968)." i don't even think this is the best example of the much-loved heist subgenre. the main thing against the film is its long running time. meville has this tendency of concentrating on too many trivial details. he could have told the same story in a relative short time, but for reasons that i don't understand, the film seems to go on and on. still, the movie is never boring. melville's direction impressed me and the cast is very good, especially alain delon as a very "cool" master thief. the movie's must-see color photography is a great asset and melville uses sound (or lack of sound) in a very effective manner. from a technical standpoint, the movie is practically flawless. at times, one gets the feeling that meville is merely showing off, but when someone is as talented as he is, one has little reason to complain. i still like other heist movies a little bit more (jules dassin's "topkapi (1964)," just to name one), but there is no denying that this film is a good piece of pulp entertainment and a good example of what people refer to as "cool" cinema.

"all men are guilty," says the chief of the police. "they're born innocent but it doesn't last." add this bit of nihilism to jean-pierre melville's fascination with the idea of the crook's code of honor and you have le cercle rouge. this code of honor among crooks, however, is not simply a cliché; it's a figment of the imagination even when film moralists -- realistic moralists by their viewpoint, romantic moralists by most others' -- began to make movies on the subject. their theme is that it isn't what one does, but how one does it. we most often wind up with stories all about experienced men with their own sense of honor, stories where fate, fatalism and the code run things. for most of humanity, except screen writers and movie directors, this would seriously get in the way of living one's life, raising one's children and being a good friend. this mannered fatalism is something of a self-indulgent notion. le cercle rouge is, in my view, a classic film for people who may secretly enjoy the adventure of just missing the last bus home. but where melville's le samourai - criterion collection, in my opinion, is style dominating story, le cercle rouge manages the great trick of combining style with a strong story and with compelling actors. the point of the movie, in my view, is nonsense...but the movie itself is a first-class experience. melville's hopeless tale of three crooks -- cory (alain delon), vogel (gian-maria volonte) and jansen (yves montand) - is based on a bit of wisdom which is, maybe, attributed to the buddha: that all men who are destined to meet, will...along with their destiny they cannot change. maybe, because some believe melville himself came up with the wording if not the thought. either way, we know right at the start that this movie will not end happily, will depend upon fate and coincidence to set things up for us, and will leave us recalling the nihilistic philosophies we discovered and loved when we were in high school. once corey and vogel meet and then gather in the unique talents of jansen, we are off on a one-way ride to rob an exclusive, heavily protected jewelry story on the place vendome. the tension arises because we not only know the french police are after vogel, we also realize that some determined crooks are after corey. the great pleasure of the movie, for me, came from admiring the work that delon, volonte and montand brought to their characters, and the intelligent ruthlessness that andre bouvril brought to his character, the police captain mattei. melville hooked me as he developed these characters and their own situations; he built me up emotionally and then released me when he brought me to appreciate their probable fate and let me see see it happen. melville establishes his set pieces -- the escape from the train, the escape from the woods, the later shootout in the woods, the meetings with mattei and a man who refuses to inform -- with intriguing possibilities. he builds tension in all these cases by taking his time; a rare trait in movie making and an even rarer trait now. and melville takes the time to build up mattei as an individual. mattei is a rueful, experienced man. he's a loner. he has a set routine when he returns to his apartment -- he greets his three cats affectionately, he draws his bath and while the tub is filling he sets out food for them. i don't know who mattei is destined to meet, but i hope it's someone who likes cats. nihilism is always fashionable among some creative people and some critics. in most cases, i think it's a much harder task to set nihilism aside and to simply live one's life without damaging too many people. (and that's even more challenging to show compellingly in a film.) le cercle rouge is a movie which, for me, tells me little, but it is in its own way, i think, a beautifully put together film.

jean-pierre melville's le cercle rouge follows the lives of two criminals: vogel (gian maria volontè), a murderer who gives the cops the slip while he's being transferred from one city to another by train; and corey (allain delon), a thief just released from jail. fate decides to join these two men to pull off a spectacular heist. in the background there is matei (andré bourvil), the detective vogel escapes from, implacable in his pursuit and sometimes ruthless in his methods. along the movie the viewer meets other minor but fascinating characters, the best of which is jansen (yves montand), a disgraced ex-cop and an excellent marksman.melville has such a unique style one doesn't need to watch many of his movies to catch on. le samourai, un flic and le cercle rouge are clearly made of the same cloth: the symmetrical angles; the long shots; the silences; the coats and hats and cigars; the quotes at the beginning; the amazing heists, the fatalism; the unglamorous and inglorious criminal life. everything that's great in melville is present here in top form.and his shortcomings didn't bother me so much this time: the illogical, perplexing behavior of his characters and confusing storytelling, which hurt my enjoyment of his other movies, are almost invisible here. since le cercle rouge preceded un flic that doesn't mean he got better with time; perhaps i'm just getting more used to it and reaching a mindset where it doesn't bother me anymore.melville made unique crime movies. as old as they may be, they show more ingenuity, realism and grace than the modern techno-thrillers in which cool thieves use computer systems and james bond-esquire gadgets to pull off impossible crimes. melville's criminals aren't cool: they're lonely, socially awkward and probably aware they're not good for much more than planning heists. they're society's unwanted, living in the night, always one step ahead of the police in a game they know they'll lose eventually. there's nothing romantic about them.amazingly for a movie of this type, the cops aren't complete idiots either. matei is smart, crafty, patient and even compassionate. he's not an unlikeable villain or a cliché, he's just an old man doing his job and doing it right. he knows when to use force and when to use brains. many movies could learn from him.it's this down-to-earth, unromantic style that makes melville's movies such a joy to watch and puts him on a special pedestal as one of cinema's great crime masters.

le cercle rouge is a very good film, though it does suffer a bit since there have already been similar films. in all too many ways, the movie is reminiscent of previous heist films such as rififi and grand slam and many others. so, while director melville and the actors did great jobs, it all seems like a case of déjà vu. because of this, i had a hard time giving this excellent film a higher score.the one unusual aspect of the film is how the crooks get together. instead of the usual means, vogel escapes from prison and just happens to meet up with corey, a career criminal just released from prison! both are a good match but having them both work in parallel for much of the film until they meet was a clever touch. apart from that, as expected much of the movie concerns the meticulous details in planning and executing the crime. i also appreciated how the film showed the crooks in such a cold and detached manner--something relatively common in french crime films but rare among american films until recent years.overall, extremely well-crafted and worth seeing...if you don't mind that it seems a tad repetitive, you'll see some fine acting, direction and a lot of great tension.

how good is this film? apparently, good enough that they plan to remake it in 2011. jean-pierre melville, who gave us le doulos and the good thief, wrote and directed this film.the film is almost a silent. these are men of few words, preferring to let their actions speak for them. they live by a code that governs their every move.there are some great actors in this film - alain delon (the leopard), yves montand (jean de florette, let's make love), and gian maria volonte (el indio from a fistful of dollars & a few dollars more). the film does not shine on them; they are along for the ride that melville has for them. melville makes the film; they make it better.you see melville's work in the ocean films, but they just get the idea. the can't make it work like he did. a great loss in the seventies, but his work remains for our pleasure.

just as in rififi, the most compelling scene in the movie is the perfected silence of the jewel heist. the scene is masterful in its execution, each of the robbers having their own specialized job to perform, each one successfully combining their own unique talent towards the objective, and each one, until a month before, complete strangers.many of the scenes play out very slowly. in fact, the opening scene is a long character introduction to both corey and vogel, as we see corey getting released from prison and vogel escaping capture on his way to prison. the two characters are then methodically brought together through fate at a roadside diner as vogel hides inside the trunk of corey's automobile. from this improbable break in, the two strangers agree to become partners to commit a perfected and precise jewel heist.however, to pull of this heist they must include the help of a third man named jansen. jansen is hired as the sure shot gun man. his inclusion into the mix was an interesting and desperate choice. at the time of his hire, jansen is in a full battle with dt's and spent most of his day on his cot hallucinating over lizards, snakes and spiders. his transition from the disheveled and hallucinatory world of a william s. burroughs dream into the steady handed and sober sharp shooter is a very quick one and perhaps the only real false moment of the film, but that's just me being extremely picky.one other mildly false note was that of the police inspector mattei. at times he appeared to be brilliant in the ways of strong arming the right people or gathering information and waiting out for his escaped prisoner to make his move. other times he appeared to be 10 years past retirement, especially at the beginning during vogel's escape through the woods.i wonder if i got too much hidden meaning from the beginning of the movie. at the start of the movie, as the police car is speeding through the city, the first image we see is that of a red stop light. my first thought was that this may be the 'red circle' and that if i am to find a deeper meaning in the movie, perhaps it is that this car, or rather the people inside of it going through the red light, will be the ones who will 'stop' the jewel heist. hmmmm? perhaps the red circle refers to the triumvirate thieving ring? perhaps it was the burning sled? no matter.it's a long movie, but it doesn't feel that way. the ending is a bit of a disappointment. it seemed too hurried for a movie that felt like such a delicious slow burn. 9/10clark richards

"they both believed that a hidden sentiment has unified them. this certitude is beautiful,but the incertitude is more beautiful. they believed that they had never been met.nothing has happened between them.but those roads,those stairs,those corridors for all that time they could have been met." although it did not mean to be,it was a swan song.two young people,who are neighbors and have never been met,are found in the same places,the same times,doing most of the times the same things.they finally meet in the dramatic and very brilliant end that brings them together.meanwhile the woman has met an old man.their relation is brotherhood-like.he told her his life.it was like the young one's but with better prospectives.the young man can do whatever the old man has not lived.he can be happy with the woman. the ending is exceptional.there is a ship wreck.the only survivors are the heros of the "three colors".the man and the woman finally meet.the scene lasts a few seconds.the woman there looks like the photo she had taken for an ad in the beginning of the film;sad in a red fond."but every start is only the continue.the book of the life is opened in the middle."

commissaire mattei(andré bourvil) is a single with a little gun who loves cats and his boss at the paris police department is a philosopher who knows that even the police becomes sooner or later guilty. that is what the film is all about. and a jewel robbery at the place vendome.corey (delon) brings the plan from prison, vogel(volonté)joins him and helps him against two tough guys, who are after him, because he took mafioso ricos(andre eycan) money, while rico already took coreys girl friend and left him very much alone for five years in jail. corey and vogel find a third man, jansen(montand), a former police officer and sniper who opens a security lock by shooting special hand made ammunition into a hole. a perfect plan and cooperation, but they have to sell the booty and there is mattei in the role of a buyer in disguise. the circle closes. running to help each other they are shot by the cat loving mattei and his little pistol.it took melville 20 years he says to make a robbery film after he failed to get a contract for riffifi. melville wrote the screenplay and filmed in the south of france and in paris of yesteryear. the great henri decae is as usual the lighting cameraman. it is the one before last picture of melvilles who died after another film with delon in 1972.melville actually wanted belmondo instead of volonté, he didn't like that italian at all, but volonté-vogel is an excellent fugitive and gives next to bourvil the most convincing performance. but mind you: melville notes, that volonté is an instinctive actor, a strange character, very wearying and absolutely impossible on a french set. melville didn't like him at all and didn't want to work with him ever again.melville is wrong. volonté give the most lively character in the nowhere of not so many interesting characters. you can see what he is feeling being chased by mattei and his little dangerous gun and all the dogs of france in winter 70. a wild actor.also andré bourvil, who passed away close to the time of the filming. he also was not first choice, but definitely a great substitute. he carries the instinct of a lonely hunter through the whole film and gets in the end his chance to become guilty once more.jansen has entered at night the jewelry shop with a rifle and a tripod but risks eventually freehandedly a successful shot. when he meets delon the first time we already know that the elegant jansen has a severe drinking problem. after the robbery montand renounces to take his part of the booty and mentions to delon, who looks up to him, that he only got into the red circle, because he wanted to take revenge on the inhabitants of his wardrobe. delon doesn't catch what he means. the audience recalls having seen montand in a great scene in his haunted house fighting helplessly nightmare creatures that come out of the wardrobe and attack him. at that time a very rare scene, one recalls a long time after. i bet it was ever so difficult to arrange and direct that stuff at a time no one imagined the coming days of digital movie making. great artwork when art was made by hand.we sure will remember a crew like the actors, still it seems even after 33 years this one stays the less popular of the six thrillers of melville. what is wrong with it? i am afraid one doesn't take much interest in those three actors (showing three criminals) and their police hunter. we learn too little about corey and his fatal 5 years away from his beautiful girl(anna douking). montand is still a great sniper, but what made him become a drinking man with funny creatures in his wardrobe. delon acts as if he is in an earlier adventure of the samourai, volonté is the man in the trunk of delons american car and superbly moving and mattei is swell to look at, a great actor at the edge of his life. but how could he ever possibly doubt that all are guilty ?in an interview melville states, that there is no woman in the film. not in the very red circle, but i remember well that jolly good looking female anna douking (with no future career). we are in the 70s. there in fact rises a woman from the bed of an old mafioso wearing nothing and walks slowly to the door to listen to the voice of her old lover delon. bardot did something like that 10 years earlier. this time melville was directing. well done.the red cercle has certainly added a few but not many glittering gems to film history. the robbery at place vendome and montands wonder bullet the inhabitants of the wardrobe and volonté escaping bouvil in white underwear and carrying his trousers carefully across a stream. that is too little for a great gangster and robbery movie. but the 110 minutes never bore you and it is a game on a high level. and there are probably some secrets you learn when you see the film over and over again. none of the secrets is that we are all guilty and the late francois perier is also featured.michael zabel

you have loved the shawshank redemption, pulp fiction, vertigo, oldboy.... and i guarantee you will love this one more. its a brilliant thriller. the story is so simple yet so gripping. it keeps you at the edge of your seat till the end. the slow moving scenes, simple music adds more perfection to the movie. its so genuine. the performance is top class the direction the sequences...they are too perfect..if i could i would place it in top 10 thrillers ever made. most entertaining thriller i have seen in a while... *****/***** my vote help me move this movie to top 250you will love it...

i guess melville intended this movie to be the definition of the cool; it has the cool approach of the late '60s/ early '70s thrillersthe same discrete quirkiness. le cercle rouge, a bitter and fatalist story, is also the playground of delon, bourvil, volonté and montand in defining roles.bourvil is a cop who has in his flat three cats and a daily routine. delon is a hoodlum. montand is a sick, failed cop. volonté plays an escaped suspect. le cercle rouge is of course far above a heist movie; melville uses his techniques long wordless detailed depictions of every step of the heist, etc.. yet this particular action drama is far better than his other moviesand it's very unlikely them by being so much better. the look of le cercle rouge is very peculiar to melville, very melvillian.delon was sharp and cool; bourvil brings his craft, and montand makes maybe the finest role of this movie; his performance has an unexpected warmth .on the other hand, the characters are barely sketched, no more than strictly necessary, and are personae. or masks; yet the portrayal is inspired, economic but suggestive.another of the movies that prove delon to be a good, a very good actor; and the fact that he's not a genius does not imply that he ought to be despised as a fourth rate actor. he's good, he can bear the proximity of a bourvil and montand.only ten yrs. before le cercle rouge, melville was doing, towards the end of the '50s, a boring overlong insipid noir pastiche (starring himself)and after only a decade, here he is, in full form, with this quite amazing action drama. stylistically, it's a success.before seeing le cercle rouge, i was not a melvillian fan; now i guess i rather am one.le cercle rouge is a dramanamely, an action drama, one of the most exigent genres. melville scores.

having finally caught up with this "masterpiece," it strikes me that it must have seemed terribly clever, in its day. it's french, arty, under-played to the point of agony, and ultimately downbeat. but viewed from the vantage of 37 years in the future, it's also just a bit vacuous, pretentious and unsatisfying.others have summarized the story, but i don't think anyone has pointed out the dramatic flaw at the heart of this film: the lead characters, corey and vogel, really don't deserve what they get. they play square within their code, never harm anyone who didn't ask for it, and show great courage and initiative. moreover, corey in particular is victimized by his former gangland 'friend,' who stole his girl and who repeatedly tries to have him killed, apparently just because he (corey) dared to 'borrow' a few thousand francs. these are guys who really ought to be due for a break! instead, things go far worse for them than they really need to, within the logic of the story.one might contend that this is the whole point: that the real villains never get caught; that they collude with the police as needed, sell out their friends, and always come out on top. but that's not shown either. corey's old gangster friend is not shown colluding with the police. nor is he shown gloating over his victory. in fact, after materializing several times when he's needed, he's nowhere to be seen at the conclusion, leaving a dramatic tension (his feud with corey) entirely unresolved!nonetheless, i'd say this film is well worth seeing for its beautiful photography, its slow, deliberate pacing, its great deadpan performances, its elaborate heist sequence, and its encapsulation of the art-film style of the late 1960s.

while its not the masterpiece that "le samourai" was (i've accepted by now that jean-pierre melville was never able to top that classic), i find "le cercle rouge" to be much better than "bob le flambeur". i felt that "bob le flambeur" was an above-average and influential b-film, but still a b-film. "le cercle rouge" proves that as a filmmaker melville improved as he continued. john woo is a massive fan of melville, even though their film-making style differs. while woo uses fast-motion for shootouts and an operatic sense of violence, melville has a minimalist style that suits him very well. he wasn't interested in creating quickly paced action films but more meditative crime thrillers. in that department, he was one of the best."le samourai" is still his best work, mainly because it has more character development than this, but on a technical level they're probably equal. besides, while "le samourai" had one great lead performance, this has four. alain delon is once again an ultra-cool gangster on the prowl - this man's silence is fascinating. bourvil is superb as the police inspector on the case of the heist and escaped con. he steals every scene he is in, and proves that he was a skilled dramatic actor (in france he is best known as a slapstick comedian in the mode of buster keaton). yves montand is great also as the shaky and paranoid gun expert. gian maria volontè (a regular in spaghetti westerns) is overshadowed by his three co-stars but still does an adequate job.once again, melville's direction is superb. taking equal influence from both american crime thrillers and the french new wave, the man always seems to know the best shots and angles to choose. this is more slowly-paced than most caper flicks, but it really pays off by the end. "le cercle rouge" is a bit short of being an absolute classic, but is still one of the best heist flicks ever made. tarantino must've seen this before making "reservoir dogs". (8/10)

jean-pierre melville is a director i've only recently gotten acquainted with (i need to see bob le flambeur and le samourai again to fully grasp them), but in watching le cercle rouge (the red circle, supposedly based on a saying in buddhism) i realized i was watching as skillful and absorbing a crime film as i had seen in a quite some time. though his film has dialog, it is mainly to keep the film's scenes rolling along, adherent to the plot. what kept me on the alert, even in seemingly mundane scenes/sequences, was the emphasis on the characters' movements, or behavior patterns. melville has his story laid out, and he is careful to take his time to tell it (this could seem boring to some, but it does seem to work since he puts a little more emphasis on the weight of the characters/environments over plot). yet look at each of the four main players: alain deleon as corey (just released from prison, scheming a new heist), gian maria volonte as vogel (escaping & on the lam from hand-cuffed custody, meets corey by luck), yves montand as jansen (an aged pro with many years of experience with weapons, a friend of vogel), and andre bourvil as mattei (an experienced investigator, who is on the look-out for vogel, and on his toes with internal affairs). each of these actors plays their parts with precision, detachment, and they each have their own kinds of moments that indicate to the audience what their personalities might be besides as criminals and cops. the heist sequence gives little hints, for example, like how vogel cops-a-feel off a female statue while passing down the halls, or how jansen takes out a flask and merely has a whiff of the contents (and what a dream this guy creates). even corey's movements involving a photograph of a woman arouse interest. as absorbing and cool the story becomes, and as great the skills were to make it happen (via cinematographer henri decae, the editing, and the musical score by eric demarsan), it's the people on the screen that gain fascination, in how they stay true to their natures and ideals. not a film to be missed by french new-wave enthusiasts, and modern-day crime movie buffs might want to take the 140 minutes to soak up the atmosphere of melville's work. a suave piece of film-making that still ranks as one of my all-time favorites.

i decided to write a comment on this amazing movie because here on imdb it is cited that john woo, a mediocre director who made some decent films back in his pre-american years but totally ruined his reputation by his latest, made in us films, plans to remake it. well, here are a couple of reasons why it is one of the stupidest ideas for a remake ever: the plot of the film is simple and even clichéd by today's standards, but what makes the film a masterpiece is acting by the four leads, unique direction by mellville, cinematography, music and its style. there is no way any director today can make such film, it is impossible to create such an atmosphere in a movie in today's box-office targeted movie business. john woo did make a more or less decent film which borrowed from melville's le samourai - the killer, but remember, it was made when the director was not spoiled by big budgets and expensive (in salaries) but cheap (in acting merits) actors. so what i'm saying is that this is one of the greatest films ever made, together with another film by melville - le samourai. watch it. and even if the remake will be made, try to avoid it before seeing the great original first.

everyone likes the coolly created, memorable heist movie. alain delon provides the antihero, melville provides the cool, and a handful of other great talent (yves montand, gian maria volonte, and andre bourvil, mostly) arrives to add a crisp engaging movie......with very little dialog. this is great, because one certain aspect of the genre tends to be a lot of dialog involving the quick-witted and their various repartees. this movie, however, could be watched with the sound completely off and not too terribly much would be missed. not to say the sound is bad, oh no, the jazzy soundtrack and the crisp audio catching the little movements makes the slow, patient deliberation of the patients very compelling.what's also really neat about this film is that the color cinematography is pretty fantastic. usually when it comes to cinematography, black and white movies tend to stick out in my mind, but this film has some very strong and beautiful imagery that makes the movie pure visual pleasure to observe.--polarisdib

the red circle (jean-pierre melville - france/italy 1970).this might be the coolest film ever made, in the most literal sense of the term. the men here never lose control and never - not once - show their emotions. no dramatic outbursts in this film. everyone is cool all the time. it's an abstract dream-world, where the men live by their own code, a gangster code with the values of the outside world conspicuously absent. in this masterfully filmed heist saga, melville tackles the american crime thriller in his distinctly dark and desolate style, yet made in grand fashion with a hefty budget of ten million dollars and with four of the greatest french stars at the time. alain delon as the master thief, yves montand as an alcoholic ex-cop, italian star gian-maria volonté as an escaped criminal and andré bourvil in an atypical role as the cynical police chief.melville described le cercle rouge as his penultimate film and it is indeed a masterfully stylized policier. he also claimed he wanted to shoot a film noir in colour and in many ways he succeeded. the two primary influences for this film were john huston's 1950 heist movie the asphalt jungle and jules dassin's rififi (1955). but unlike these films, where we learn much about the background of the individual gang members, with all their petty needs and worries that motivate them, making clear these are not just ruthless underworld types, but ordinary individuals engaged in a world of everyday worries and human endeavour, melville, though, tells us almost nothing about his criminals. why was corey (alain delon) in jail? why was his associate, vogel (jean-marie volonté) arrested in the first place? or why the ex-police marksman jansen (yves montand) left the force, was it his alcoholism? we never learn the motivations behind their actions and never find out what drives these men. women are even more absent than in his earlier films, with the "emotional" ties exclusively between men. they don't even seem to have personal lives. a sort of an emotional twilight zone and although the setting is not as abstract as in his earlier le samourai (1967), melville still sketches a very eerie world. melville's favorite actor, alain delon, is perfect and almost outdoes himself in coolness, if imaginable.deliberately paced and with a length of over 140 minutes, melville takes his time to tell the story, but its slow pace and length seems a perfect way to show the desolate world these men live in. nothing is ever out of place in melville's films and here it's no different, every little detail seemingly of pivotal importance for the story. although le samourai remains my favorite melville film, even up there with the greatest films ever made, this one also belongs to the very best. camera obscura --- 10/10

not having seen this film in quite some time, we caught with it not long ago in the nicely transferred criterion dvd. "le cercle rouge" is a film that owes a lot to other movies, as it keeps reminding us about "rififi", "the asphalt jungle", among others, because they all deal with capers that take center stage in the movie and reproduce it in great detail. unfortunately, one knows that old adage that crime does not pay, and from the start, these men involved in it are doomed from the onset.jean-pierre melville was a director of few words. he didn't fill his pictures with a lot of dialog, as it's the case here. yet, for not being "talky", they had a style of their own as proved with "le dolous", "le samurai", and his masterpiece, "bob le flambeur", among others. mr. melville had a sense of style that comes across in everything he did. in this film, working with his cinematographer, henri decae, he takes us along for a ride through the streets of paris that shows the vibrant city mainly at night and the bleak winter in france. the score is by eric demarsan that emphasizes a jazzy music that accompanies most of the action.although the film shows alain delon, as corey, at the center of the action, it is however, the smart inspector mattei who is the real hero of the movie. as played by the great bourvil, he is a man that shows a lot of patience because he has figured from the beginning how to catch vogel, and in the process he gets involved in the investigation of the jewel heist in which he knows the escaped man he is tailing looms large behind it. bourvil gives an enormously satisfying performance as mattei showing equal parts of determination and tenderness, as it's the case with the three cats he adores.alain delon always responded with interesting performances his appearances in mellville's pictures. in here he is corey, the man who is first seen leaving prison and promising himself he won't go back, but he cannot pass a good thing when he decides to go ahead and participate in the robbery. his association with vogel and jansen, pays off in the way they get the job done, but it will also prove a mistake in the way they will not be able to dispose of the loot as the fence they have relied on has a change of heart.gian maria volonte and yves montand are seen as vogel and jansen, respectively. they were excellent actors who blend well in the action of the film. both actors were at their best moment when they took the roles in the film and it shows. mr. montand has the more complex character to play as we witness him in his first moment in front of the camera as a man with many demons inside his head.jean-pierre mellville got wonderful results from his cast and crew in a film, that although feels a bit longer, but still succeeds in showing his style in one of the most memorable pictures from the director.

irene jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of krzysztof kieslowski's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it succeeds in tying all three films together. i am simply in awe of the amount of talent it took to do one of these stories, let alone all three. everything seems to fit together so precisely, all the elements of filmmaking so eloquently executed, and the end result so much greater than the sum of the individual parts. trois couleurs is epic in nature and belongs on any list of great cinematic achievements. simply brilliant!

wow, i just loved watching all these hot babes! the scenery around malibu and california was off the fizzy. i could watch it again just to see all that flesh crammed into those tiny, teeny bikinis! i recently saw pilar lastra, the steaming hot housekeeper in malibu spring break, as a center fold in my favorite mag, playboy. she is hot, hot hot! the opening seen was bitchin. when the two main girls run out of gas and stop at this desert gas station, they drive the gas-guy nuts with their bodies and skimpy outfits! the slow-mo lets me enjoy every inch of them! my girlfriend liked looking at this shredded hot dude too (now i'd like a bod like that) and at all the other hot dudes....and some of the girls too! any movie that can bring that out in my girlfriend is a 10 + for me!

with some wine, some friends and some good humor, i had a really good time watching this film. i particularly enjoyed the performance of jilon ghai (as "randy"), who was such a kick in the pants! his scenes with charity rahmer ("michelle") were wildly amusing. i wouldn't want him coming on to me, but it was great watching "randy" try to score with "michelle" and even better seeing the results! of course, the girls in the film are lots of fun to watch too. and, a friend of mine showed me the playboy issue that had pilar lastra as the playmate of the month. she's definitely a looker. all in all, this film totally served its purpose, which was to entertain us in a light and care-free way.

i already gave my comment on this movie under the name brucev3. now under brucev13 i want to add something! now after a long time i have seen a lot of so called heroic bloodshed titles! but not many come close to the action shown in john woo movies! that's why after all these years i think it is strange that "china white" doesn't get the credit it deserves! no matter what version you have seen! the action is top notch! the scenery,china town in amsterdam is very unique. you get the impression it is a large district. but having lived in amsterdam myself i know it is only a small area part of the red light district which happen to have a lot of chinese stores and restaurants! but because of the way they shot the movie it actually looks like a big and important territory where people know not to mess with the triads (chinese mafia)! besides the action "china white" is a compelling gangster drama with some good acting! for this i have to give credit to russel wong! too bad we don't see much of him lately,since he has a lot of potential! must see movie!

china white (1989) was ronny yu's first international film. this u.k,/holland/hong kong production was shot in english and was slightly edited for the western audience. the american wong brothers (michael and russell) were supposed to star in the film together but due to prior commitments was unavailable so another western actor steven leigh took his spot. several hong kong stars such as tommy wong (playing a mute) and the always creepy william ho appear as well as the director in an interesting cameo spot.the chow brothers are in holland to run the family business. they want to the family business to go legit but the other asian gangs don't want to and see there move as a face saving move to please the "foreigners" and want to keep on making money the old fashion way. others want to take their business to even a new low by smuggling drugs and what not. after the chow elder is gunned down in cold blood, the brothers make their move against any family who's not with them. can the chow family keep the families from killing one another or while the streets of holland flow with the blood of the innocence and gangsters?a highly underrated movie. i was surprised by how good it was. i haven't seen the hong kong version. that would be a huge treat for me. it's longer and has a lot more stars of the hong kong cinema involved with the production. too bad this film isn't available on d.v.d. the video print i saw was washed out and the sound reproduction wasn't that great.highly recommended for action fans.factoid: this film takes place before the decriminalization of drugs in holland.

as a huge fan of horror, i had given up on the vampire sub-genre due to the fact that in most vampire flicks the vampire has become feminine and non-threatening, benign and basically weak. this was the attitude i brought to a viewing of soul's midnight and i am happy to say that the vampires in this film at least have the hunger to kill old ladies and sacrifice babies! armand assante, one of my favorite actors of all time, was born to play the charming vampire with savage intensity. another thing that interested me is that the central location is the borgo hotel. that is cool because (and i went back to my high school copy to look this up) in dracula, the borgo pass is where jonathan harker must pass to get to dracula's castle.finally, my hats off to whoever made the decision to make the creature a real effect and not a darn cgi! that's the one thing great about many low-budget movies, they cannot afford the garbage computer effects that plague many hollywood monstrosities.bottom line...this is better than underworld for sure, especially if you are a vampire purest. cheers, ja

soul's midnight stars armande assante (simon) who stared in "the mambo kings" and elizabeth bennett (alicia milford). together with sexy vampire vixen, lucila sola (iris), simon lures pregnant alicia and her husband charles into the netherworld of soul's midnight. assante sinks his fangs into the script by writers brian and jason cleveland and you enjoy watching him and iris kill. alicia and charles (robert floyd) try to stay alive while gore keeps your lust for blood sated.(spoiler alert) in today's jaded landscape, it comes as no surprise that a back-stabbing preacher gets bitten. set looks cool  lots of detail at the borgo hotel and cool special effects at the end. i had a lot of fun watching this movie  it doesn't take itself too seriously and looks great.

if you love vampire lore and are a fan of gothic horror, then you might want to check out soul's midnight. i did not know much about this movie before i watched it, and i wasn't expecting much, but i found the movie to be fun and entertaining.starring armand assante as the leader of the vampires simon, soul's separates itself from other low budget vampire flicks by weaving in the mythology of st. george and the dragon in a fun new way.i'm not sure what the budget for this movie was, but i sense that if it was a little more then they might have really been able to hit home the gore and effects.if you're up late one night and you're in the mood for a fun low budget vampire flick then soul's midnight is a good choice.

no matter how many times wile ethelbert "famishius famishius" coyote tries to get road "burnius roadibus" runner, we always know what's going to happen, though our sympathy always remains with wec. the highlight in "hook, line and stinker" is a rube goldberg-style scheme that wec hopes will finally finish off rr; but of course you know what happens.so, wile e. continues hilarious engaging in fanaticism (defined by george santayana as redoubling your effort after you've forgotten your aim) while road runner pretty much never becomes aware of the potential danger - or lack thereof - in which he could find himself. a real classic.and yes, the coyote's middle name is ethelbert. i learned that from "jeopardy!".

just love the interplay between two great characters of stage & screen - veidt & barrymore

most of kieslowski's films seem like puzzles to me, meant to expand mind and soul. the characters are not very believable, are idealized, are schematic. nevertheless, the way kieslowski presents their winding ways through life, their complicated interaction with others, with the universe, with chance or destiny, makes me understand faith, makes me (want to) believe in god. that at some point it all has a meaning, if not to me, then certainly to someone.trois couleurs and especially "rouge" comes closer to making me touch, feel, experience the "truth", the "meaning" than perhaps any other of his films. the only problem being the paths of the "puzzles" explored are a bit too similar to his other films and at some point they become somewhat predictable. there is still plenty of joy to be had here. it is like a familiar brand of wine - you know what to expect and it delivers, sometimes with a newly found bouquet which might come from aging - either the wine or yourself.

"rouge" is part of a trilogy, but very much stands on its own. it isn't a sequel of any sort. the very end, which i won't divulge, ties the three films together, but not seeing the other two doesn't make it too confusing. this film amazes me because it is so spare, so subtle and simple, but is as effective, emotionally and intellectually, as any big-budget spectacle or all-star melodrama. kieslowski here investigates the phenomena of chance and destiny. both themes are loosely woven together in the story. the film is very much a puzzle, but the message is pretty straightforward: everything happens for a reason. love is in all of our destinies as long as we open ourselves to it. the title, "red" refers to the french flag, where red represents "fraternity," or brotherhood. the color dominates the visuals of the movie. i tend to think of it as representing love or passion, or the blood of life. it's great when a film allows the freedom to do that ;)

this show is awesome! i love all the actors! it has great story lines and characters. it is the perfect drama. james caan and josh duhamel have great dialogue. they both can be really funny.i miss vanessa marcil on general hospital, but she's great on here. james lesure is great! he can be hilarious. molly sims plays a dimwit very well. the writing is awesome!they keep up an excellent pace. the show can really leave you hanging, which is one of my favorite elements of a show. i cannot wait until the new season starts. this show makes it to the top ten of all my shows. i hope this show stays on for a really long time. if people know what good is, it will. i never want the show to end. ever.

frankly i just enjoy watching james caan. wonderful actor. with such simplicity you know exactly what he's thinking. a true pro.i have watched the show from the very beginning and found it different - that's something that is unique in hollywood - a new idea - not a 3rd version of a current hit show - i also find the show fun and exciting -i like the pacing - you're never bored - i especially like the mystery in each episode - the way it unfolds. i am a big mystery fan and have read a lot of the great mysteries but i find the stories in the show well written and the outcome is rarely obvious. also extremely interesting to me, probably because i am not a gambler, is the different cons that the 'gamblers' come up with - i was fascinated by the number of schemes that people have come up with to rob las vegas. the music: i like the music at the top of the show. absolutely perfect for the show...sets the tone and atmosphere . just marvelous. and of course, there is james caan.

i was shocked to learn that jimmy caan has left this show, does anyone know why? i regard james as one of the all-time greats and wasn't surprised he ended up on tv, which can be better than the crap you see on the big screen. the stories are slick and the camera faster than a speeding bullet! mustn't forget the rest of the cast: james, vanessa(yum!)nikki, molly, josh, mitch.. also,can anyone tell me why on earth there's a crap theme tune on the dvd sets, but elvis's jxl remix of a little less conversation is used on the initial nbc broadcasts?? does it not make sense to use a tune that you would associate with the gambling mecca of america for dvd releases??

las vegas is very funny and focuses on the substance.....the sets are amazing and the scenes outside are breathtaking; the characters are all very fun and cool.the women are a plus....holly sims is lovable as the daughter of james caan who heads the security of the casino. while josh duhamel is very funny and lets face it, he looks like he can take down anyone.vanessa marcil and nikki cox add that special touch.the story lines are very fun and weird at times.you can easily just relax into this show and doesn't bring the heavy story lines like the other shows that rule the ratings...

i've read the comments on las vegas and do agree with some of them, it's not brain surgery tv, but then again i was under the impression that tv was mainly for escapism, especially with what is going on in today's world. let's face it, a show about vegas (that isn't a reality based programme) isn't going to one based on reality because to me vegas is pure fantasy! it's the sort of place where we can go and pretty much do what we want when we want (subject to funds obviously!).therefore the fact that las vegas is pretty, sexy and cliched with characters that reflect all this seems to be on the money in my eyes. if you don't like it, don't watch it, that what we have a million channels for!we're coming up to the third episode here in the uk and i know that i will be making a beeline to watch it again. i just hope it's not cancelled, something that seems to be happening a lot with most of the shows that come to the uk that are half decent! (firefly and jake 2.0 anyone?!!).it's harmless, great looking fun and everytime i watch it, i want to go back to the real thing :)

las vegas is one of the most brilliant shows of our time, its combines hard-hitting action with light drama and heavy doses of comedy. it features fantastic characters lead by the charismatic tough-guy ed deline (james caan). the show uses cool high-tech surveillance equipment to bring down the cheats and schemers. the characters are joyful to watch especially as their different departments within the hotel/casino cross paths.the show is mainly centred around the surveillance and security part of the hotel/casino. the two leading characters are ed deline, president of operations and danny mccoy (josh duhamel), former us marine who served in iraq but is now head of security. the shows five other main characters are former valet now security personnel mit graduate mike cannon (james lesure); the feisty, sexy casino host samanthat marquez (vanessa marcil); danny's childhood sweetheart hotel manager mary o'connell (nikki cox); danny's current sweetheart also big ed's daughter and manager of mystique delinda deline (molly sims) and ed's adopted daughter from his cia past casino floor manager nessa holt (marsha thomason) who left the show after the second season. each character is unique in their own quirky way, giving the show its energy and charisma that keeps its audience entertained for the entire duration of an episode.every episode features a special quest star either a singer, actor or band who perform at the hotel's nightclub mystique. these cameo appearances by big names is a specialty that is popular among the shows audience.las vegas is a show that can appeal to both male and female audiences. for the guys the show features sexy women, classy sports cars, high stakes gambling, adrenaline pumping action and overall a pool for topless women. for the ladies there is the young and handsome leading man (duhamel) and the tough edgy deline, romance and tanned topless guys around the same pool.the plot of each episode combines action with light drama and comedy to break the ice. each episodes also features 2 even 3 secondary stories which revolve mainly around the female characters. every season also ends with a bang which leaves the audience hanging until the airing of the next season. an excellent way to end a season! with a mix of genre's driving the show and a cast of colourful, charismatic characters and of course lets not forget the topless pool makes las vegas one of the greatest tv shows ever aired.9/10

i think josh duhamel is so great!! the rest of the show is fun to watch, but, i think it is the handsome and sexy josh duhamel that makes the show "las vegas" really fun to see!! in the days of "magnum" i loved tom selleck, i thought he was the sexiest man on the face of the earth!! a hunk on a television show is a must in order for women to enjoy watching something, especially just for purposes of innocuous entertainment!! i would have done anything to "win a date with tad hamilton"!! josh duhamel is incredible and i will always have a super crush on him!! josh is definitely a hunk!! and i will watch "las vegas" all the time, josh duhamel is a big reason why too!!

arguably the finest serial ever made(no argument here thus far) about earthman flash gordon, professor zarkov, and beautiful dale arden traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet. along the way, in spellbinding, spectacular, and action-packed chapters flash and his friends along with new found friends such as prince barin, prince thun, and the awesome king vultan pool their resources together to fight the evils and armies of the merciless ming of mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter priness aura(now she's a car!). this serial is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot, acting, and budget - it is miles ahead in these areas. produced by universal studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from the bride of frankenstein and the opera house from the phantom of the opera just to name a few. the production values across the board are advanced, in my most humble opinion, for 1936. the costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and first-rate. we get hawk-men, shark men, lion men, high priests, creatures like dragons, octasacks, orangapoids, and tigrons(oh my!)and many, many other fantastic things. are all of them believable and first-rate special effects? no way. but for 1936 most are very impressive. the musical score is awesome and the chapter beginnings are well-written, lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memories of the former chapter, and expertly scored. director frederick stephani does a great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating a worthy film for alex raymond's phenom comic strip. lastly, the acting is pretty good in this serial. all too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents - here most everyone has some ability. don't get me wrong, this isn't a shakespeare troupe by any means, but buster crabbe does a workmanlike, likable job as flash. he is ably aided by jean arden, priscella lawson, and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out. but before i get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted, it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the hayes office. i see more flesh on flash and on jean rogers and priscella lawson than in movies decades later. the shorts crabbe(and unfortunately for all of us professor zarkov((frank shannon)) wears are about as form-fitting a pair of shorts guys can wear. the girls are wearing mid drifts throughout and are absolutely beautiful jean rogers may have limited acting talent but she is a blonde bombshell. lawson is also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful. but for me the two actors that make the serial are charles middleton as ming: officious, sardonic, merciless, and fun. middleton is a class act. jack "tiny" lipson plays king vultan: boisterous, rousing, hilarious - a symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism. lipson steals each and every scene he is in. the plot meanders here, there, and everywhere - but flash gordon is the penultimate serial, space opera, and the basis for loads of science fiction to follow. excellent!

flash gordon is, undoubtedly, the best of all american serials. in a date so early as 1936,universal was capable of making such an entertainment story, and twenty years later when i watched it for the first time as a kid it involved me in a great adventure and emotion. buster crabbe was the hero we always wanted to be in our childhood, and jean rogers the beautiful girl we always dreamt to be in love with. dragons, octopus, monsters,gorillas were also the attraction. charles middleton was a great presence as ming, the merciless. a true predecessor of george lucas´s starwars.

flash gordon was a first rate serial. i know there were a few goofs, however, i didn't watch it for the flaws. buster crabbe is flash gordon. he was not a trained actor but he gave a very good, convincing performance. jean rogers is pretty and at 20 yrs. old did, in my opinion, a pretty good job. charles middleton as emperor ming, is superb. he was in a lot of other movies, quite versatile, he could sing and dance. his portrayal of "ming the merciless", in all 3 flash gordon serials, was top notch. the rest of the cast also did a very good job. well, boys and girls, get some popcorn, settle back and enjoy. john r. tracy.

the standard bearer of all movie serials, the definite good guy - flash gordon - versus bad guy - ming the merciless. though the special effects seem awful by today's standards, for 1936 they were top notch. but the essence of the story is the battle between earthman flash gordon (buster crabbe) versus emporer ming of mongo (charles middleton). crabbe and middleton are terrific in their parts. and the supporting characters playing dale arden, dr. zarkov, princess aura, prince barin, vulcan, and the rest are all very good. this serial is far superior to the 1980 movie, basically because crabbe is much much superior to sam j. jones as flash gordon.this serial is the standard bearer for all movie serials. no question about it.

after 66 years "flash gordon" still has an appealing scifi/adventure/epic feel that many of today's science fiction adventures strive for and fail to deliver. the only way to fully enjoy this serial is just to sit back and not pick at anything (hokey effects, dialogue, why flash doesn't go for princess aura etc.). and as for you older people who saw "flash gordon" back on the serial screen or on t.v. "back in the day", if you want this fine serial to remain appealing to future generations, get your kids/grandkids to watch this when they're young. it worked for me (male aged 18 or under). 9 out of 10

my friend gives me these 3 huge boxes. "they're laserdiscs of flash gordon serials," he says. "i'm gonna have some giant coasters," i say. but not so. this serial rocks. (but i had to whine & moan to almost everyone i knew to find a laserdisc player for em).there is really a little of everything in this serial: there are lion-men, hawk-men, shark-men, earthmen, & i guess you'd call em mongo-men. the sets & costumes combine, greek, roman, oriental, egyptian and there's even armour like english knights. awesome costumes. and some of it was a riot. those horrible tights with shorts over em worn by zarkov are beyond description. and the guys in the furnace scene seem to be wearing boxers.it's also funny the way they renamed the octopus to an octosack, the orangutan to orangapoid, and the tiger to a tigron. there's even a dragon (a godzilla-like creature who threatens flash on a couple of occasions before being killed off).you like the invisible man? this has got you covered. you like sword fights, wrestling (both animals & men), fist fights? plenty for any taste. we have an underwater city, a sky city, a city on top of a mountain, and tonnes of secret passages and caves.hokey effects? massive amounts. the sky city is supported by radium furnaces stoked like old-time steamships. the rocketships are "powered" by fireworks and have constant backfires and/or humming noises. lots of wires are visible holding things up (like food when flash was invisible and of course rocketships). there's clouds out in space, but none around the earth when viewed from mongo. "giant" lizards show up briefly. fighting sea creatures supposedly threaten flash & co. on the way to the shark-men's underwater city. the "gadgets" in dr. zarkov's lab crack me up. and they seem to be the same ones no matter what lab he's in (he worked in ming's lab and vultan's).and yeah, we have romance. everyone wants dale; ming, vultan, flash. but at least one person wanted princess aura (prince baron) just not the person she would have preferred. in fact, it seems a lot of the sub-plots concern intrigue on the part of princess aura to try to win flash.man i think the characters are awesome. that fat, horse-laughing, king vultan was hilarious. how he managed those wings was pure artistry. and ming! what can i say about ming? he was perfect. they should have had him for the emperor in starwars. ming has got to be my favourite character in this serial. princess aura was quite a little character too. and she pulled it off nicely. i think she's a better actress than dale arden by a long shot. even the sneaky high priest had a distinctive role. zarkov was good, but not the strongest character---and he always stood in the background during fight scenes holding dale. now we get to flash: flash, of course, was the strong point, the leader, the hero---and he did it well. crabbe is a good actor and this role fit him perfectly.after watching this, i think i know where george lucas got the main idea for starwars. watch this, you'll see what i mean.if you ever considered watching an old serial (or any serial for that matter), this should be your first choice. the only reason i didn't give this one a 10 is because of a few story holes that could have been fixed easily, the way the giant lizards seemed just tacked in there, and a couple of weak characters (king of shark-men & king of lion-men).

this was a thoughtful and well-shot and directed tv movie that took on a huge subject with precision and intelligence, and gives it a film treatment that would look great on a bigger screen -- the palette is a little muted for tv. if you're looking for a war action film or "bosnia lite", this isn't for you -- it's about an ordinary woman who took on an extraordinary challenge for humanity. if you want to learn more about the conflict and how the work of one woman influenced the world in a massive way, watch this film when it comes your way. i don't see that a lot of other tv films have dealt with the issue of genocide and ethnic hatred at this level. the story avoids obvious demonization of "the bad guys", and instead shows the denial and everyday hatred that resulted in deaths of thousands. i was moved at several points, and not in some manipulative hollywood way with driving music and flashy mise-en-scene, but allowed to discover the horror and implications along with the characters. this is a film brave enough to let the content speak for itself, and keep the visuals understated to support it with dignity.the actors do a helluva job at bringing the intense dramatic scenes to life. the scenes where victims give their testimony before the war tribunal are powerful, and wendy crewson, stipe erceg and heino ferch are excellent. william hurt's british accent is awful -- no one else has given him a chance to play a brit, and when he finally has it, he blows it! -- and although john corbett's body was born to play a soldier/commando, he's a little too gee-whiz nice, although he does a good job.

i really enjoyed watching this movie! only a few parts were slow, but it was only setting the mood and building up to the action. i thought this movie was very educational, it taught me more about my croatian heritage. i also learned more about louise arbour, and i can say she has a very great influence on me. time magazine named louise arbour one of the world's 100 most influential people in april of 2004. i recommend this movie to people that like historical movies (obviously). this movie was very dramatic, but still told the truth of events in the former yugoslavia. louise arbour is a brave hero, and i'm glad they made a movie honouring her. if you see the movie, i hope you'll like it.

this movie is pretty good as it is, but the unreleased producer's cut is my favorite movie in the series after the original. jamie's story is handled differently, the death scenes are done 10 times better, there's more footage of ritual type stuff giving more story about micheal, jamie and her baby. there is also an alternate ending which is also better. why they didn't release this version instead i have no damned clue. if you can find this version, see it.

for some reason, i always enjoy movies that people hate, when i really don't think they're that bad - and this is one of those films. in the case of this movie, i think it is way too over-criticized, i really isn't that bad of a film at all. in fact, i think this is one of the better sequels. "halloween: the curse of michael myers" begins on the night before halloween, where michael brutally murders jamie lloyd (who was taken captive by the "man in black" in part 5) after she gives birth to his baby. we are then introduced to the strode family, who is now coincidentally living in the old myers house (which seems to change in each film). kara and her son danny are the main characters, along with tommy doyle, the now adult boy who survived the original killings. they must fight together to save jamie's baby from an evil cult that takes care of michael, while michael himself is driven to kill by an old celtic ritual where he must sacrifice an entire family in haddonfield.this is surely one of the best sequels in the series, in my opinion anyway, and i can't understand all of the hate it has gotten. it had some nice suspense, an interesting plot (but sometimes confusing, i'll admit), some scary moments here and there, and plenty of gore and knife slashings to appease all of you gorehounds. not all of the acting wasn't particularly great, but it was convincing enough for me. marianne hagan is the leading lady and she is very likable. paul rudd plays a grown-up tommy doyle, and is also very talented and plays his part nicely. the rest of the supporting cast (besides the brilliant donald pleasance) isn't much to praise, but it wasn't too bad either, all things considered. i'm still not sure if giving an explanation for why michael kills was completely necessary, but it turned out to be okay in the end and i wasn't upset with the way they tied everything together. the open-ended conclusion was also kind of eerie, but could have been something more. i have also seen the infamous "producer's cut" of this film, the original cut of it, and i think that in some respects, it is better. it further explains the thorn curse that drives michael and has some extra scenes that really helped support the film, plus the ending was a lot better in my opinion. it felt more natural than the conclusion that we're given in the studio cut of the film. i wish that dimension would release this alternate version of the film, because i personally think it is better. the chances of that are very slim though.overall, "halloween: the curse of michael myers" is a very good sequel and will please all of the fans of the series. this movie isn't the best of all horror movies, but it's definitely worth renting if you want to see michael do his thing. just don't expect brilliance, and you'll enjoy it. 7/10.

wow, "the curse of michael myers" what a great film. suspenseful, entertaining, creative and a clever plot which i love. many hate the 'thorn' concept, i love it. i think that it gives the halloween series some plot. marianne hagan is a wonderful actress and turns in a excellent performance, especially for her first film and paul rudd and donald pleasence are great also. my only complaint is that why wasn't danielle harris in this film as jamie? she wanted to return, but the producers said no. i thought j.c brandy was great, but i love danielle harris. still, i love halloween: the curse of michael myers. i think the shape's mask looks the best in this film and george p. wilbur is the best michael myers ever. incredibly creepy and suspenseful, halloween 6 rules! i adore this very violent, but immensely enjoyable film. the halloween horror series - by far the best in the genre.10 out of 10.

this was a really interesting halloween film. i wasnt to thrilled with the whole thorn theory but it still makes for a good film. i liked getting to see tommy doyle back but sadly donald pleasance died right after shooting. the film had a really really bad director who didnt give a flip about the series, from what i heard treated donald bad, and wouldnt let danielle harris come back as jamie. its like he was just trying to bring down the film, but i still liked it. there were alot of cuts and music changes and if you're lucky you can get the producers cut which features over 40 min. of never before scenes. with those scenes it turns into a whole new movie. check it out if you have the chance.

halloween 666 (1995) the producer's cut review!halloween 666 starts of with a recap of the horrific ending to part five. if you thought the last chapter was dark, this one will really blow your mind. a mysterious "man in black" has raided the haddonfield police department freeing micheal myers. in the process poor jamie lloyd was abducted by strange cultists. what they want with her? who knows, but let's just say her long suffering will end soon. doctor loomis is back spending the rest of his twilight years trying to stop michael myers from killing any more innocents (good luck). a friend of loomis, doctor wynn comes back after a four sequel hiatus to help the good doctor. another old face from part one guest stars as well.this dark and dreary sequel was dismantled during the post production editing. for some reason the distributors felt that the final product wasn't worth the average horror film watcher's time. so they decide to dumb it down. then after having the film sit on the shelf for several months it laid an egg at the box office. no matter what they did to the film, they made it worse. they should have left well enough alone. hey, the film company knows better than the filmmakers now....don't they?producer's cut :highly recommended released version: not recommended

this video has heartfelt memories. it has a great cast and all the actors did a great job. i have been searching to buy this video. if anybody knows of where i can purchase, please e-mail me. i really want to add this to my collection.

to understand "crash course" in the right context, you must understand the 80's in tv. most tv shows didn't have any point. the sitcom outpopulated the drama at least 3 to 1. they were still figuring out where the lines were so that they could cross them. (tv shows like "hail to the chief" was quite the bold step!) this made-for-tv movie "crash course" featured an all-star cast, bringing together members from all the 80's classics: "227", "family ties", "who's the boss?", et al. directors must've had a certain penchant for those all-star movies then. still, this movie offered very light fare and a simplistic view of heroism and maturity. and that's not bad sometimes. viva soleil moon frye.

i loved this movie when i was younger, and i have actually been looking for it again!! i would love to watch it again!! the information is all correct, but the cover doesn't look like it would match - i can't say for sure though. from what i remember, the movie was about these kids (alyssa milano, tina yothers, etc.) in a driving class, and it also shows the mischief they get into outside the class. edie mcclurg was alyssa milano's mother in the movie. i remember i really liked it so if anyone knows where i can get a copy (preferably dvd) of the movie listed above (with those stars in it) i would love to know. thank-you :)
