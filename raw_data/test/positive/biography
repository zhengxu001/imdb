the recent history of hollywood remakes of ghost/horror films from the east has been dismal. this film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on e-bay or similar.it is well photographed and the sound is superb. viewing on a good screen and with a good 5.1 or dts enabled sound system is recommended. obviously it is subtitled, so if that puts you off, then i wouldn't bother with this. dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here.it is also genuinely frightening, with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to western audiences. i would particularly single out the stepmother character, who was utterly brilliant. the ending will have you wanting to watch it again, if you can cope. the plot is relentless, and offers no comforting moments of release along the way.if i do have a small criticism, there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the japanese version of the ring. we have, however, accepted straight copies of other peoples' ideas for western films for years, and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 10/10. i believe most fans of this genre will derive huge "pleasure" from this film which i for one hope goes down as a classic.

'a tale of two sisters', or 'janghwa, hongryeon', is a true masterpiece. brilliant psychological thriller, heart-wrenching drama, and gripping horror all wrapped up in one beautifully orchestrated package. from the intricate plot, to the beautiful cinematography, to the absolutely perfect casting, every aspect of this film is extraordinary.for fear of revealing too much concerning the plot, i will just say it is very satisfying. while it may appear to be a little difficult to understand at first, it does a good job of explaining things in the end. and whether you prefer psychological thriller, drama, or horror, i promise you will not be disappointed.from a technical standpoint, its nearly flawless. the set, the cinematography, lighting, and especially the soundtrack, all are captivating. the waltz seemed an odd choice at first, but proved to be an ingenious choice.as for the casting, we're talking absolute perfection. i'm su-jeong is totally convincing as the defiant, yet troubled su-mi. mun keun- yeong is equally convincing as her emotionally traumatized sister su-yeon. these two girls were magical on the screen. i will certainly be looking into their other films. yeom jeong-ah is deceitfully cheerful and hauntingly evil as the stepmother. finally, kap-su kim gives an excellent performance as the weary, broken father.i truly love this film. if you have yet to see 'a tale of two sisters', i strongly recommend locating a copy. it is a real gem, worthy of anyone's collection.(10/10)

this movie was an excellent acted, excellent directed and overall had an excellent story. ive had real life experiance with a boy like 'radio'. at the football program in my town, weve had a mentally challenged boy every year practice, travel, and have fun with the football team. this movie is really true and i can identify with it 100%. a boy like 'radio' just needs to feel like they belong to something; they need to feel like their life is worth living. thats how 'radio' feels and thats why that type of program is set up at my high school. this is a very touching movie that im glad has been brought to the big screen. my dad and i loved it and i will always remember this for being a movie that tells a riveting story of the goodness and kindness of man!

call it manipulative drivel if you will, but i fell for it. sure, there could have been more character development. yeah, there could have been better cinematography and less of a constant "movie of the week" score, but ed harris was impeccable, cuba gooding adorable and touching, and let's face it people, in real life, how many of us really get to know the motivation of others. not many. we did get a little glimpse into the coach's motivation (a very provocative dialog in my opinion, not to be soon forgotten) so in my opinion, this was a lovely tribute to one human being who broke out of his "comfort zone" to reach out to another human being, and in the mean time, touched the lives hundreds more. a lesson we all need to me reminded of. why is it that the right thing to do is so often the hardest thing to do? i recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart. you won't be disappointed. and bring your kleenex. 8/10

i put this film in the queue on a whim after a recent trip to nyc, and i couldn't believe i'd never heard of it anywhere! it has all the makings of a cult classic, starting with the characters. they are archetypal roles we recognize from every stretch of daily life, but were so nuanced and fully realized by the actors playing them (peter stormare and bai ling's performances were particularly strong). their interactions are poignant and grounded while at the same time brimming with a subtle, quirky humor that is (sadly) all too rare in american films these days. writer/director ramin niami does a beautiful job of weaving these scenes together into a funny and moving portrait of a city of the past. highly recommended!

the director, ramin niami, delivers the goods with somewhere in the city. this hilarious farce, i believe, is in the tradition of a mel brooks comedy. niami pokes fun at new york society by creating the believable, eccentric, and tragic characters of one tenement apartment building bringing them to life from the very opening one shots that introduce them. peter stormare's performance as a gay shakespearean actor is absolutely award worthy and the film in general does a good job at showing the hopelessness and laugh-ability of self-centered ambition. sandra bernhard is cast perfectly as the straight, self-obsessed therapist. i really enjoyed sandra's performance immensely especially since i haven't really been a very big fan until now. bai ling, ornella muti, and bulle ogier round out an international ensemble par excellence. i loved the scene with robert john burke and his gang of idiot criminals who couldn't plan a robbery if their lives depended on it. with a cameo appearance by mayor ed koch and a solid performance by paul anthony stewart, the revolutionary momma's boy, somewhere in the city entertains without missing a beat.

i agree with the aussie's comments for the most part. however, there id seem to be a fairly decent plot, if unoriginal. christina (kelli mccarty) inherits a rural property that she intends to open a mountain lodge. she gets reacquainted with chip (bobby johnston) whom she had known when she was growing up in there. the plot thickens when james (paul logan) arrives with his new stripper friend, shene (devinn lane) because christina had been james' stripper friend in years gone by, and the implication is that james had done her wrong somehow. to add interest to the movie sophia linn (monique parent) a romance novelist shows up as a guest at the lodge, as do eric (sebastien guy) and linda (flower), pair of lawyers from the city. james sicks the local building codes inspector on christina's business as one of his dirty tricks to shut her down. so the question is, "how far will james go to sabotage the lodge and will he succeed?"watch for devinn lane here and in "beauty betrayed." she seems to be making a transition from the hard core business to the "r" world. another notable is samantha mcconnell, playing the role of "bait," clearly the most outrageous character name in the movies!

wow, i've sure seen quite a bit of kelli mccarty this summer. i didn't know this woman made so many softcore flicks in the past three years. it's like seeing a future softcore star blossom in front of me, much like michelle hall did a couple of years ago."passion's peak" is the third quality softcore flick i've seen kelli mccarty in, with "girl for girl" and "house of love" being the others. "desire and deception" was okay, but it wasn't spectacular. there's spoilers in this review, so read only if you want to.the story begins with christina (kelli mccarty) heading out of the big city and to the mountains. she has inherited a house from her dear departed grandmother and plans to turn it into a mountain lodge. before she can even set her things down, some woman named kim (uncredited in this film, but quite the aggressive one) begins booking guests to stay there. now she has to get the house into shape quickly--in comes chip (bobby johnston), a childhood friend, to the rescue. chip helps her get the house in workable condition. she hires two local slackers to work in her lodge--chip's sister bait (samantha mcconnell) and her sex buddy hank.now the guests start coming. the first to arrive are eric and linda (flower), two stereotypical money-first lawyers. linda and eric get into a huge argument during a dinner party halfway through the film which leads to their breakup; sad stuff there. next, there's romance novelist sophia, played by b-movie goddess monique parent. she's using that silly alias scarlet johansing again, and she's got a very professional look this time--with blonde hair, of course. it wouldn't be monique if she didn't have at least one scene where she plays with herself--and she obliges, during one of eric and linda's sex scenes.james and shene (devinn lane--yes, the porn star devinn lane) show up for a little weekend getaway as well. unbeknownst to shene, james and christina have quite a history. james and christina used to date, but christina broke it off to head to this mountain lodge. james comes up to the lodge to get christina back, but his plan backfires. christina spills the beans to shene, which causes shene to walk out on him and down to the local bar to strip for the locals. shene ends up in the sleeping bag of the now-single eric, and they leave together. bait realizes she wants something more than just sex with hank, and christine finds true love with chip, with sophia soaking it all in and writing it into her next romance novel. in fact....if you ask me, this whole movie played out like a romance novel. i don't know if the screenwriter was going for that effect, but i sure got that impression. sophia had some of the best lines in this film, playing up the idea that this is a live-action romance novel. she seems to enjoy all the fighting and backstabbing going on.now to the sex. there was a fair amount of it, and it was the usual bump-and grind stuff. monique did her fair share of moaning in her two sex scenes. this film was tapeworthy, and the story will actually keep the audience somewhat interested in between the sex scenes.women: a- (monique was simply monique. out of all the softcore actresses i've seen over the years, she's the best at acting, in my opinion. she can really act and be sexy, which is why she's holding on to the #1 position in my skinemax top 10. kelli mccarty is better at doing softcore films than she is on the soap opera "passions"; i don't know why she's not doing more of these. flower was merely background scenery for the most part in a limited role. samantha mcconnell continues to impress me, and devinn lane is yet another hardcore actress crossing over into the softcore realm and doing a halfway decent job at it.)sex: b (it was good, but not awe-inspiring spectacular. plenty of moaning. don't watch the r-rated version, trust me....most of the good stuff is taken out. my grade is for the uncut version.)story: b (a solid storyline which throws in a contrived "ooh, the building inspector's gonna shut us down" subplot toward the end which messes up things. the underlying story between christina and james was nice, and sophia's dialogue, full of the metaphors and imagery usually found in romance novels, was a nice touch.)overall: b+ (i found this movie to be quite entertaining. it's not a surefire softcore hall-of-famer like "girl for girl" is, but it's a respectable addition to the skinemax collection.)

one of keli mccarthy's best. this movie is filled with sex, and nudity. it has gorgeous, sexy women and some sexy settings.believe me, there are many spicy and steamy sex scenes but not as hot as the women. we have outside settings, a hot tub, beds of course, and some other nice places to have sex.monique parent is great in the opening sex sequence where she behaves like a naughty girl. keli is amazing, she's extremely sexy and performs in at least 4 hot sex scenes. my favorite is when she has sex during a picnic or something like that. she has this short dress removed and the rest you can go figure it out! renee rea also has a sexy sex scene where again, she demonstrates that beautiful cute faces can also perform great in soft core sex movies.the most memorable scene in my opinion comes near the ending. it's a double sex feature that has to do with hottub sex, intense sex! and kelli mccarthy receiving it real hard so loud that the couple in the hottub feel interrupted. the scene is long, steamy, very explicit, and fun. my favorite from 2001.the other good scenes include keli getting it on the woods (really kinky); then dressed as a bride. renne rea, always super gorgeous, dressed like a skater girl has a steamy sex scene. nice!please, watch this movie if you enjoy b-soft core sex. it's among the best from the new millennium. i had a blast with it.

this was a very nice soft-core movie for both men and women. plenty of nudity/sex, but without the overall raunch you'll usually find. they could not have done a better job in casting as the entire ensemble was stunning. trust me guys, if you want to get your woman in the mood, get something with bobby johnston in it! and i'm sure lovely monique parent, samantha mcconnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for any heterosexual male. unfortunately, bobby and monique do not share a scene together and if you are aware of a movie where they do, please pm me! i'd love to know. the photography was much better than usual. so was the story. predictable, but nice, sweet natured and romantic. at the very least it was not one of those annoying predictable murder mysteries full of bottle blonde women with huge fake breasts. i give this 7/10!

don't know what film or version jeff saw, but this entire film was awesome, not just poitier and going. the story was riveting, suspenseful and engaging. and for the guy complaining about historical accuracy, get real. yes there were some black deputy marshals in the indian territory, but they had no authority to arrest whites outside of indian territory. as a rule, they did not "patrol" but exercised warrants on criminals only. i did find it odd that corby didn't seem to have "any' indian friends. i know their numbers were diminished but it still strikes me as strange. even as corby returned to his people, his indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless.

this is a film about loneliness and how the distance  physical and emotional -- between people tends to stultify relationships.the narrative is simple to the point of banality: a young man yusuf (emin toprak), from a rural village, arrives in istanbul to stay with his older and successful cousin mahmut (muzaffer ozdemir); yusuf wants work in the big city. after trying for a few weeks to find work without any success, the strain of having yusuf living with him is too much for mahmut. they quarrel  nothing physical, just verbal. eventually, yusuf goes, leaving mahmut alone again. end of story...except for the fact that the performance of the two men as relatives is one of the best on film. much is said visually; dialog is used to bring out disagreement, distrust, hostility, and insecurity that exist within and between the two men.there are many visual gems in this film. for example, while searching for work, young yusuf, needing a relationship, tries in vain to gain the attention of various young women around the city. the look on his face, as he is thwarted every time, says it all.or, wanting a cigarette, yusuf opens the door to the balcony of mahmut's apartment and lights up in the frigid december air, leaving the door open; mahmut, eventually gets up from his work desk, walks to the door (all glass) and the cousins just look at each other for what seems way too long a time. then mahmut closes the door, leaving yusuf out in the cold. the metaphor is complete.or, mahmut cleaning up after yusuf, grudgingly and with increasing anger; and all the while, yusuf wastes his time chasing skirts instead of looking seriously for work, and spends mahmut's money on a toy for a nephew yusuf is emotional, untidy, impulsive, and vulnerable. mahmut is rational, logical, self-confident and a demanding control freak: the right-brain, left-brain dichotomy beautifully played out by two actors who say more with a look, a gesture, a frown than any words can convey.but, mahmut is not completely emotionless: he still loves his ex-wife who tells him that she's off to canada with her husband-to-be. mahmut affects a distant and confident friendship with his ex, and makes sure that she is okay about going. he wishes her well. he says goodbye. he leaves the coffee shop where they were talking. later when she calls to say a last goodbye, on the way to the airport, mahmut goes there and secretly watches as she leaves. the poignancy of the emotion on his face, as she disappears through a door, is worth the wait.all in all, this is a standout piece of work by the two main actors and the director, nuri ceylan. some might argue that the pace is too slow; but life goes slowly for much of the time, especially for those who are alone. the camera work is relatively simple also: choose the scene, set up the camera and lighting, and let the actors move across the scene, enter the scene and leave the scene, all the while keeping the camera still. there were a few panning shots, some high-angle tracking shots, a few rural scenes  but much of the film is shown as though on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide angle lens. except for tv and radio music within the story, there is no music sound track. and, there are those many long silences as the two men sit and watch tv together and/or engage in very limited conversation.i saw this movie on tv so i was amused to see that, on a few occasions, i was watching tv as they were watching tv also. the silence in the movie matched the silence in my house (i was awake, all others in bed); my chair and position matched that of mahmut's as he watched tv. quite eerie, giving me a sense of almost 'being there' with him and, i guess i was, in a sense.i'll say no more, because i want you to savor the other scenes that i haven't described. it's not a movie for everybody, for sure. more than any movie i've seen, it shows just how much we die when we are all alone  just as we are all alone when we die. mahmut's face, as it fades to black in the final scene, will stay with me for a long, long time...highly recommended for serious movie buffs.

when you're watching distant you know you're not watching a french movie, there's little sex and it's mostly elliptical and people don't talk that much here, there are a few lines scattered here and there and a couple of important conversations, just to let you make sense of what's going on. it doesn't look american either, there aren't any car chases or shoot-outs or violence, unless you consider the killing of a mouse an act of blood or the daily tension of getting by a subdued catastrophe. at times, the relatively long-held medium-distance shots may remind you of 'contemplative' asian cinema, but just reminds you, the director doesn't push things to the radical minimalism of some taiwanese filmmakers but then again, this is not a taiwanese movie, it's a turkish movie. i don't know what that means, i don't even know if that's supposed to mean something.the movie doesn't have a plot proper and yet, those few lines, those somewhat long-held shots and that often mitigated tension gradually build a sense of something happening, a sense of 'plot', for lack of a better word, that grows on you. by the end of the movie you may get the feeling you're going to miss those two cousins who have many things in common but are worlds apart.

for those who are like me and are used to watch and enjoy high budget hollywood films, on huge screens with a surround audio, this film seems to be so distant. however it surprised me how close can it be to any human while i watch it. it is so natural that you feel like nobody wrote a scenario or nobody directed it. you are the director and you are writing the scenario while you watch it. for me, the time i spend on watching a film is the only time which i go to another world. this film is the first sample for me which shows that it is not always a must to watch millions of dollars of budgeted films, surround audio capabilities to go to another world. this films sends you to another world (or maybe makes you return back to yourself) without millions of dollars of budget, or technical capabilities. i felt like that i'm reading l'etranger from camus.

hysterically painful; perhaps the kind of movie chekhov would have made had he made movies. what's really funny is that the two cousins have so very much in common (many descriptions of their relationship on this site are dead wrong).what's really funny and uncomfortable about these characters is that they just can't bring themselves to talk to each other - or anyone else! it's horrible. if you've ever been too shy, worried, self-involved, or just plain scared to talk to someone (and who hasn't?) you'll definitely see yourself in this film. and it won't be pretty.it holds a mirror up to the audience and says, "if you don't like what you see... change it".

it has taken me about a year now after seeing this film to write about it. lord knows i have wanted to, after witnessing it i knew i saw something i hadn't seen before but wasn't sure why. now after reflecting for quite some time i know, it's these characters that even now i still can't stop thinking about.distant briefly and slowly tells the story of a relative (yusuf) who comes from the rurals to live briefly with a well off to do photographer (mahmut) in the city in hopes to find employment. however it becomes clear that after yusuf hypothesizes the idea of being a sailor and his employment prospects dim, that he's really searching for something else, some sort of purpose in his life.through all this soul searching we are taken through seasonal surroundings that are filmed exquisitely. the context in which they happen makes the scenes more powerful in 2 particular ones when a girl yusuf has been following suddenly meets up with her significant other, and the look of yusuf's face as he looks into a basket of fish and the shot and light that reflects off his tortured face. that scene in itself has to be one of the most gorgeously filmed pieces i have witness in i don't know how long.in the end mahmut has his own demons too, but ends up confronting his relative that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave, in a scene that is very simple but has the feeling of true heartbreak.what the viewer is left with is lots of reflecting and pondering for these 2 people who everyone can see a piece of themselves in. you should not be put off by the pace of this film it is truly worth every single breathtaking second.rating 10 out of 10.

people must learn to watch what is up there on the screen. this is a great film that is based on a slow, careful gathering of details which serve to establish the personalities of these two men. the passivity of yusuf (emin toprak), the country cousin, is well described by his fear of talking to women. he has at least three chances to start a conversation with a young woman and loses all of them. he has many decades of bachelorhood ahead of him, and maybe unemployment as well.mahmut is a different case. he got out of the small town by working very hard (we imagine), and his resentment of slackers like yusuf is palpable (he leaves crumbs on the expensive carpet--the slob!). we are shown a group of friends talking about tarkovsky among other things, and we note that mahmut feels regret--but only slight regret--that his work has become commercial over the years. the gulf between the cousins just gets wider and wider. the mouse trap theme is wonderfully vivid, it brings out the compassion and confusion of yusuf, and the cold-blooded problem solving of mahmut.i was reminded of two classic films of men driving each other nuts: les cousins by chabrol (the rich boy with hitlerian pretensions played by brialy is always in my mind) and kiss of the spider woman (william hurt can't figure out why everybody's so mean). nuri bilge ceylan takes his place among the dozen important directors now active. i just hope that in future he will come to rely on collaborators, instead of directing, writing and shooting his films himself.

uzak (2002), a turkish film shown in the u.s. as "distant,"was directed, produced, written, and filmed by nuri bilgeceylan.this movie is a gritty and somber version of the clash between a "city mouse," mahmut, played by muzaffer özdemir, and a "country mouse," yusuf, played by emin toprak. both men are superb actors, and the plot allows them to demonstrate their acting skill. (tragically, emin toprak died in an automobile accident shortly after the movie was completed.)in most country cousin/city cousin tales, the contrast between rural and urban life styles is portrayed in a humorous fashion. in this film, there's little humor or even warmth. both menhave lost touch with human society. mahmut 's work as acommercial photographer for a tile company gives him no satisfaction. he has divorced a woman he clearlystill loves, and has no satisfying human relationships.mahmut has lost his job because of a factory closing in his small town, and doesn't have the skills or the energy to find work in the city. his human interactions are primarily confined to silent observations of the other people who cross his path. he's clearly a warm and caring person, but can't express these qualities in an urban environment.the cousins don't relate well to the world, and they don't relate well to each other. neither makes an effort to act in a way that would provide an opportunity for bonding or closeness. in a sense, this film portrays an opportunity wasted. conceivably, each cousin could have provided at least part of what was lacking in the other's life. instead, they steer parallel unhappy courses. the two men are distant throughout, which is a situation suggested by the film's title.one of my friends mentioned the masterful way in which ceylan builds detail upon detail. these details ultimately tell us more about the characters than we might have learned by simple exposition.uzak was shown as part of the rochester labor film series. it's not a "labor film" in the traditional sense of that genre. it is a labor film because it demonstrates the harmful effects of unsatisfying work (mahmut) and unemployment (yusuf).this is a quiet, absorbing, dark film. although it doesn't make for happy viewing, i walked out of thetheater realizing that i had seen a truly creative andimportant movie. this film is worth finding and seeing!

while sleeping, mr. eko is assigned by his brother yemi (adetokumboh mccormack) in a dream to go with john locke to disclose the meaning of the "?" symbol. with the pretext of chasing henry, mr. eko brings john with him and they find a second hatch called "pearl" underground the question mark symbol marked on the field, where a video explains that the other hatch is a psychological experiment and people behavior pressing the buttons of the computer every 108 minutes are actually subjects. meanwhile, jack unsuccessfully tries to save libby.in this episode, john locke loses his faith in the island when he finds that they have been monitored in the hatch. the disgusting michael sees the anguishing libby wishing that she was dead, while hurley, jack, kate and sawyer are suffering her pain, in a deep emotional contrast. my vote is eight.title (brazil): not available

the most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of a film is not the beautiful lead actors. it isn't their outstanding acting and sizzling chemistry either.to me, it is the mis-en-scene of the entire movie. the settings, the lighting, the props... all add to the mood for love between the main characters. a whiff of smoke from chow's cigarette tells us his state of mind, the ever-changing tight-fitting cheongsams of lizhen reflects the constraints of decision-making, the ruins of angkor wat ties in with the deteriorating relationship of the two leads.the excellent use of mis-en-scene gives the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh out the complicated nature of the characters' relationship. the film leaves the audience fruitlessly yearning for more.

two people living in the same flat complex find their partners are having an affair with each other. as they try and piece together how it happened, they also embark on an emotional journey that aches for a resolutionbuilding on his previous success with happy together and chungking express, wong kar wai gives us this rather old fashioned and marvellous story of reawakened passions, yearning and unrequited love. possibly, in the mood for love is not to everyone's taste. it wanders in rather lazily at 98mins: not particularly long for a film, but it appears longer because not a lot really happens. but this lazy feel conceals a quite tightly constructed film. most of the story is cunningly woven around a series of set piece role plays, where the characters act out presumed scenarios between their respective spouses, trying to work out how the affair started. i say cunning because, of course, this makes it difficult for the audience (and the characters) to tell what is "in-role" and what is genuine. if all this sounds rather arty and self-conscience, that's because it is. unashamedly so. and it is played to perfection by two of hong kong's finest, maggie cheung and leung chui wai, with some excellent support from ping lam siu and rebecca pan.it is also a virtuoso performance by wong kar wai, who treats the audience to a sensory, and sensual, overload. bringing together christopher doyle (who later deployed his lush, over-ripe style on hero) and pin bing lee (whose beautifully understated style can be seen on springtime in a small town) was cinematographic genius. it has all the bold beauty of doyle, without, frankly, the athena-poster cheesiness of his work on hero. the music, as always with wong, is prominent. from nat king cole singing in spanish, to the haunting strings of the main theme, it perfectly matches the eclectic beauty of the images. all in all a top film, whether judged on plot, acting, cinematography or soundtrack. similar to, but more accessible than, wim wenders' wings of desire, this is a beautiful, old fashioned story about love lost and regained. and watch out for tony leung's hotel room 2046, which presaged wong's recent film of the same name.

i won't bore you with story and plot lines, as they have been presented many times already on this page, so it's been along time coming since i have seen such a film. beautiful, elegant and restrained, with a narrative pace to match. a film with sensitivity and understated qualities that is rare in these times of clichéd plots. the beautifully subdued photography, saturated in rich luxurious colors, and for lack of better words, each frame is filled with an air of tension. the settings and locations are used repeatedly but the film manages to breath new life into them each time they featured, there always seems to be a key prop, light fixture, or set piece to slightly clue the audience as to where we are in the characters world.the acting reminds me of the "the bicycle thief", not the style, but the fact that you forget that you are watching two actors engaged in their craft. there is meaning behind every gesture and almost every movement has assigned significance to explain the inside world of the characters, the relationship, the feelings, and situation of the two lovers. the dialogue is sparse but like the rest of the movie, is imbued with meaning. speaking of meaning, the soundtrack is infectious. used here it becomes a story telling device. and although the film is of chinese origins, even a song sung in spanish by nat king cole imparts the film with subtle meaning. the orchestrated soundtrack is repetitive, but the repetition is what makes it comfortable. it is used in conjunction with the story, and not just a means to put music to action, or to cue the audience to feel a certain way at a certain plot point.i would not recommend this film to anybody, i fear most people would be jaded by the calm flow of the story, but i would recommend it to someone who is looking for an alternative to the romantic schlock that fills the multiplexes on our side of the world. i must say that i was completely taken by this film, and continued to watch it night after night. the story takes time to present itself and bears repeated viewings as very few films in this genre are open to such a broad interpretation. a very beautiful movie.

when i fist watched the movie, i said to myself, "so a film can be made like this." wong kar wai's gorgeous poetic love story captured me throughout and even after the film. i must admit this is one of the best love movies, maybe the best of all, i have ever watched. the content and the form overlaps perfectly. as watching the secret love we see the characters in bounded frames that limits their movements as well as their feelings. beautiful camera angles and the lighting makes the feelings and the blues even touchable. i want to congratulate christopher doyle and pin bing lee for their fantastic cinematography which creates the mood for love. also the music defines the sadness of the love which plays along the beautiful slow motion frames and shows the characters in despairing moods. and of course the performances of the actors which makes the love so real. eventually, all the elements in the film combined in a perfect way under the direction of wkw and give the audience the feeling called love.

i was recommended this film as one of the best love stories ever told. and as i am huge fan of love, i bought the tickets and sat myself in the theatre. after 90 minutes i left the theatre with nothing but disappointment and the theme song as the only positive thing of the film. i was appalled at the story itself, that two people can love each other but be so afraid as to never act it. i just couldn't go passed the language barrier and the cultural barrier. the second time i ran into it... i was in a different mood, no longer had any expectation ... and had more patience, more relaxed mind to "see" the film... and as soon as i opened my eyes, i discovered the love... the beauty of the film. i went beyond the language and the love story and saw the acting (not even for a moment did i ever felt like they were acting!) and the cinematography. the first time i heard a definition of what a film is, i was told that it should be a chain of perfectly balanced photographs (shots) and this is the film to match the description. almost every shot has an idea behind it, and combined with the music... and the light effects... the result is just a masterpiece! and a masterpiece is just something that you must have in your collection of films.

in 60s hong kong, a man and woman move in the same day into adjacent apartments with their respective spouses. soon they suspect their ever absent spouses of having an affair with one-another. a strange bond emerges between the man and woman as they cope with their sadness by taking turns playing each other's spouse, before a more complex bond emerges...no summary can do it justice, for hong kong auteur wong kar-wai's "in the mood for love" is nothing short of a miracle. a story about sadness that manages to be touching and at times funny. a romance that never feels forced or fake. no doubt the director's method has a lot to do with that.directed from an inexistent screenplay (though the concept largely flows from a japanese short story) to favor improvisation, the film is immediately set apart by the freshness of it's performances. all the film revolves around that and the rest is pure enhancement. at the core of the film are two characters that will ease into your heart and stay there long after the end credits roll: maggie cheung and tony leung are simply amazing and no language barrier undermines a single fragment of immediacy and truth they display. the additional material is also top-notch: the films is magnificent to behold (in part lensed by "hero"'s christopher doyle) and the music is heartbreaking.this is something everybody must see, if only because it is by far the most heartfelt, mature and authentic "love story" out there. unmissable.

it's easy to see why many people consider in the mood for love to be wong kar-wai's best film. the toned down appeal of the film, centering on the studied view of a relationship put through an emotional ringer, is a retread into happy together territory but without the hyper-kinetic patchwork of jarring film stocks and hyper-saturated sequences that have become a trademark of kar-wai's films since chungking express. like soderbergh's the limey, this is a different kind of curio for kar-wai; where dialogue and plot are forsaken by mood and composition in order to create a tale of two delicate lives in a seemingly confining emotional stasis.it's a testament to the genius of kar-wai that he is capable to making such a simple tale so resonating. chow mo-wan (tony leung) and su li-zhen (maggie cheung) move in next-door to each other within the same apartment building. he's a journalist who dreams of publishing martial-arts novels and she is a secretary at a shipping company. their eventual coupling is obvious from the beginning but the pleasure here is the way that kar-wai ambiguously paints such a journey with his grand masterstrokes.the key to the success of the film is kar-wai's use of the interior space, playing with foreground and background planes in ways that are similar to the works of polanski. during the wooingly sensuous first half of the film, kar-wai isolates leung and cheung within shots in such a way that the second person in a conversation is never visible. kar-wai is concerned with environment and space here, creating a cramped emotional dynamic between his characters. it's also telling that kar-wai never chooses to focus on the physicality of mo-wan and li-zhen's spouses. their faceless partners are noticeably absent from the film, as they are tending to their own love affairs with each other.this is not to suggest that in the mood for love is a confining experience because kar-wai manages to inundate his film with broad splashes of hypnotic camera movement and sound. there is one shot where cheung's slow, sensual rise up a metaphorical stairway turns into leung's descent down the very same stairwell; their movements perfectly compliment each other, bookending the shot and creating a sense of erotic duality between the two figures. their souls have connected but they have yet to physically unite. the erotic displacement of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating, as two star-crossed lovers reject physical consummation due to their humble fidelity.other scenes in the film are punctuated with brief slow-motion shots of cheung erotically moving through her interior surroundings, set to mike galasso's hauntingly beautiful score. cheung's dresses beautifully compliment her exterior space as she moves slowly through her surroundings. her movements slowly build up to what seems to be an inevitable fusion between li-szhen and her dream lover even though the seduction process seems to be entirely sub-conscious.if i make it seem that these two characters are more like two birds unleashing pheromones on each other, it probably isn't that far-fetched of a statement. the tight bond these two characters have with their internal spaces is almost as intense as their relationship to the exteriors. the film rarely moves into an exterior space and when the camera does it is usually to peak through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like confined animals. kar-wai continues to tease us even when the lovers get close enough to touch, shattering the couple's proximity to each other by shooting them through mirrors or through gaps within articles of clothing located inside of a closet. mother nature even seems to respond to their love lust, often unleashing a soft crest of rain over the characters after their bodies have glided near each other.kar-wai's hauntingly atmospheric shots of a waterfall allowed leung's lai yu-fai to experience a cathartic release in happy together, even if leslie cheung's ho po-wing was not there to enjoy it with him. by that film's end, love was so inextricably bound to the act of war that a third man's muted declarations of love signaled yu-fai's realization that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace, even if it would not bring him back his lover. mo-wan's journey terminates within the confines of a crumbling temple. his own emotional depletion is paralleled nicely with the political climate of his country, and the absence of li-szhen is only made tolerable by the fact that kar-wai allows mo-wan to experience a release of sorts. mo-wan caters to an ancient myth and his secretive release into a crack in the temple leaves him capable of living his days with the hope that all his loss and heartache somehow served a higher purpose.

i think that new york times film critic elvis mitchell wrote the best one line review of in the mood for love when he said that it is "dizzy with a romantic spirit that's been missing from the cinema forever." how true those words are! truly romantic films are so rare these days, while films that include plenty of sex and nudity (which are often portrayed in a smutty and gratuitous manner) abound. so, given this cinematic climate, wong kar-wai's latest film feels like a much needed breath of fresh air. in the mood for love is about the doomed romance between two neighbors ("mr. chow," played by tony leung and "mrs. chan," played by maggie cheung), whose spouses are having an illicit affair, as they try "not to be like them." but after hanging out with each other on lonely nights (while their spouses are away "on business"/"taking care of a sick mother"), they fall madly in love, and must resist the temptation of going too far.several factors are responsible for making in the mood for love a new classic among "romantic melodramas," in the best sense of that term. first, the specific period of the film (i.e. 1960's hong kong) is faithfully recreated to an astonishing degree of detail. the clothes (including maggie cheung's lovely dresses), the music (e.g. nat king cole), and the overall atmosphere of this film evokes a nostalgia for that specific period. second, christopher doyle's award-winning, breathtakingly beautiful cinematography creates an environment which not only envelopes its two main characters, but seems to ooze with romantic longing in every one of its sumptuous, meticulously composed frame. make no mistake about it: in the mood for love was the most gorgeous film of 2001. (it should also be mentioned that wong kar-wai's usual hyper-kinetic visual style is (understandably) toned down for this film, although his pallet remain just as colorful.) third, there is the haunting score by michael galasso, which is accompanied by slow motion sequences of, e.g. chan walking in her elegant dresses, chan and chow "glancing" at each other as they pass one another on the stairs, and other beautiful scenes which etch themselves into one's memory. the main score--which makes its instruments sound as though they're literally crying--is heard eight times throughout various points in the film and it serves to highlight the sadness and the longing which the two main characters feel. fourth, tony leung and maggie cheung both deliver wonderful performances (leung won the prize for best actor at cannes) and they manage to generate real chemistry on screen.the above elements coalesce and work so nicely together to create a film that feels timeless, "dizzyingly romantic," and, in a word, magical. in the mood for love, perhaps more than any other film of 2001, reminded me why it is that i love "going to the movies." and i guess that is about the highest compliment that i can pay to a film.

i'm from ireland and i thought this film had the odd minute or two where accents where a little off but no worse than any brad pitt or other american doing the accent. furthermore, i have rarely seen any british actor handle an american or canadian accent except for colin farrel in minority report. this film is a little film and it was entertaining. no it wasn't a blockbuster hollywood production but frankly i'm sick of that shite. i laughed more than a few times and had a good time. it was definitely worth the rental. the main character is a spoof on other hard british gangsters. at least that's the way i saw it. if you go in expecting a $100 million dollar production you'll be disappointed. enjoy it for what it is- a small entertaining film.

superb and charming. justin henry is beautiful as a blissed out and mischievous howard kaylan, lead singer for the top ten hit making band, the turtles. the real magic is the titular sequence with an academy award worthy turn by royale watkins. a performance that completely captures the mystical and yet down to earth jimi hendrix. not many films, unbelievably so, can find the essence of a special moment in a life and times. i'd like to see this available at any home video retail outlet without any hassle. uh..what's the deal?thanks eddie. a worthy addition to the history of the psychedelic sixties. a definite twinkle in the mind's eye.

my dinner with jimi is a glimpse at howard kaylan's giddy and vertiginous ride to fame with his 60's folk-rock band, the turtles. the turtles were kind of a 'second tier' act during the sixties, but the film clearly demonstrates that they could eat, drink, and party with the titans of hippie culture. and, not only that, they had the musical chops to back it up. many of the stellar acts of the era are seen as they interact with the band at work and at play. this provides my only complaint about the film. almost from the beginning of the movie, one sees that it is nearly impossible to find actors who can convincingly impersonate such recognizable stars. too often during the film, i felt that i was watching an engaging exhibition of phony wigs and mustaches. but, if you are a fan of the music of the turtles, or the swinging 60's, in general-this might be the film for you. and, don't forget to view the extras. there is a very funny (and informative) bit by band members, mark volman and howard kaylan, about their disastrous experiences with managers and agents.

i smiled through the whole film. the music is great. the story-telling is great. it's a wonderful film. this picture is made with respect and a true love of the sixties.

i have been trying to track the age of kings down for many, many years.my theater life was filled with the actors in this series. at the time, in 1960 i was not able to follow all of it, as i was myself working in the theater, lots of night work. now in retirement i long to have this and keep it to myself. please, please can it not be issued on dvd, i would not mind what it cost. i see that there are others out there who feel the same. what can we do to get this done? something as great as this should not be sent into oblivion. i have to write two more lines. ok i can do that by saying that i want this series more than anything in the world. just to be able to watch some of the finest actor of our age playing out the finest words of our wonderful shakespeare. isn't that enough! a uzmen

anyone who enjoyed this series when first broadcast (i rushed home from school to see it) now is of a certain age so i can only add my comments to those asking for a dvd release to enable those of us to relive the memories of first transmission before it simply becomes a piece of unremembered tv archive history. if so many old tv series from the sixties and seventies can be released, why not this? surely the rights clearances can't be that difficult. most of the shakespeare lines i can quote comes from this iconic series and i remember swapping them with my school chums as we tried to outdo each other's memories of the text. peter dews rightly deserved the credit for having the foresight to bring it to the screen. this surely was public broadcasting at its finest. robert hardy and sean connery fighting to the death - it's riveting stuff and from the beginning of the bbc television's golden age. come on bbc. clear it and license it please. march 2009 so finally the dvd is here and congratulations to those who have made it happen. the picture quality is remarkably good and the performances every bit as good as the memory thought. now all those who clamoured for it must buy it and relive those magic moments.uk viewers. given the series was made in the uk by the bbc using british actors it's strange that the dvd release is not available there on region 2 (europe) dvd and can only be imported from the us and played on modified players. it seems hardly likely that there are major rights issues, perhaps the market was felt to be too small so why on earth wasn't it released 'region free?' so everyone could enjoy it?

my introduction to a lifelong love of shakespeare. my brother was 5 and i was not quite 7 when wttw chicago broadcast an age of kings. it became a family ritual to watch, including the reruns. as an autumn series, my father used to buy us a rare treat for the midwest--pomegranates; and my mother would pop corn on the stove. wonderful acting from actors whose names meant nothing to me then (although i will never forget the achingly young sean connery as hotspur), but do now! and they published the scripts in paperback so we could follow along and figure out the language. i managed to memorize most of richard iii over that. so glad to see it coming out on dvd! highly recommended for all ages and any level of familiarity with shakespeare or english history.

in 1961, this series was shown on local tv here in southern california. i and many others have been petering bbc for tape or dvd ever since. now all of a sudden, here it is on amazon. i pre-ordered in january and now here on march 30 it arrived. it was a long wait (48 years). was it worth it? so far i have just watched richard ii (i've only had the dvd since 2 o'clock) and i can truly say yea!!! totally worth the wait. the acting, direction, and production are superb and even better than i remember. the production is in b & w but somehow it fits. the video is clear and very good, the sound is flawless. further proof of how timeless shakespeare truly is.i gave this 10 stars even though i have only seen 1 of the 8 plays. i am sure that when i have seen them all i will change my rating to at least a 12.it's currently in stock at amazon (us region 1) at a reasonable price.i'd better stop now so i can get back to watching. next up is henry the iv, part 1 of which is my all time favorite shakespeare play.

a great production, that should be revived/rebroadcast. i doubt that it would be out of date! i'd love to hear from anyone who knows whether videos exist of this series, or any other information about where it could be found or viewed.

i followed this entire series when i was a child in grade school, by choice, not because it was required for school. i used to read the plays at the pace of the series. the experience gave me a life-long love for shakespeare and history. it even gave me a bit of an acting bug, although at an amateur level only. whenever i read any of shakespeare's history plays, the images that come to mind first are from this black and white production, seen on a big "furniture" tv set with a rabbit ear antenna, with all the "ghosts" and wobbles that go with that.although the sets were minimal, if i remember correctly, that was totally irrelevant because the acting was so good. at the time i had no idea who any of the actors were. now i see that many of them have become well known over the years. i particularly enjoyed hotspur and hal, whom i now see were played by sean connery and robert hardy. i would dearly love to see this available in video, especially since many of the plays are seldom performed and even fewer are available on video. it would be valuable also as a document of mid-20th century televised play production.

it was so very long ago (1960), but i have never forgotten this series and often wished it would reappear. so taken with it, i corresponded with mr. rathbun, then president of standard oil, which sponsored the presentation on pbs. he sent me a photo of the tapestry (actually a charcoal rendering) used behind the credits.to the opening theme music of bayco's "elizabethan masque," my family and i gathered around our black & white tv to drink in shakespeare's words as spoken by a group of excellent but relatively unknown players (at least to american audiences at the time).we were introduced to such actors as sean connery, dame judi dench, tom fleming, patrick garland, julian glover and robert hardy. i have continued to enjoy their accomplishments ever since. one of the most interesting things was the way in which the actors continued to age in their respective roles as shakespeare's "king" plays were presented, perhaps for the first time, in chronological order.i wish i could tell those actors just how much that series meant to me.if "age of kings" could be revived on vhs and/or dvd, it would so please those of us who long to see it again and those who missed it the first time around.good news! pbs has just issued a dvd of "an age of kings"! see their july 2009 catalog, page 19, or call them toll free. i just ordered mine!

watched this on kqed, with frank baxter commenting, as i recall. have never seen it since, but would like to find out where it is available.it is amazing how good something can be, but be in black and white, and have zero special effects. in fact, amazing how much better something like that is!

this series has recently been unearthed and excerpts can be seen, at least within britain, via http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/527213/index.html presumably there is some hope that the series may eventually become available more widely. the problem is that this series was followed by the series the wars of the roses that had a similarly stellar cast and which has been available to cable tv, or at least crowding the market. the two series are quite different in dramaturgy; the wars consolidates the plays through extensive rewriting and shifting of scenes; an age of kings follows shakespeare more closely. both series benefit from integral casting.

i saw this mini-series when i was in high school. i remember it as being absolutely brilliant and compelling. at the time, i knew none of the british actors in the series, but have since learned that some of today's stars performed in it, including sean connery (the original james bond among many other roles), judi dench (queen elizabeth in "shakespeare in love" among many other roles) and eilene atkins (probably best known for creating "upstairs/downstairs" but also superb in many acting roles). like the other commentator, i would like to see it again. i'm certain the production remains timeless, and i would hope that it has been or will be released on vhs or dvd. if you get a chance to see it, do not miss it.

all right - it was in black and white and probably on 2" tape - which means the bbc wiped it, right? but it stays in my mind from all those years ago (1960??) as a perfect slice of history enlivened by the most innovative editing and wonderful actors full of youth and bravado.i want to see it again! are you reading this, bbc? find your original 2" tapes or the 35mm film, deal with the actors and directors for the rights, and re-issue! i know, i know, some of them are dead, some of them are missing in action.where else will i be able to see mary morris as the 'serpent's heart wrapped in a tiger's hide'? where else will i be able to see paul daneman do 'now is the winter of discontent....'? or robert hardy deliver his speech about 'that idol ceremony'?

i believe it has been over 40 years since i saw this series, yet memory of it hasn't faded a bit. this would be a natural for dvd re-issue, it seems to me. many of the performers have gone on to greater fame (robert hardy, sean connery, to name a couple); though it was a smallish role, i still remember judy dench, then in her 20's, as katherine of france (henry v). she was very lovely then as now.there is a hint on this site that the series was filmed in color - is this so? who of us would know - virtually no color tv in those days. mores the pity, no vcr's; if so, some might have recorded it. as a way of teaching english history, this series made it come alive in ways few class room teachers can manage.what a fine re-issue this would be!

possibly the finest moment of tv, at least in my memory, as millions could watch shakespeare's gripping kings cycle (richard ii - richard iii) play out on prime time tv (i believe it was on friday nights). no word was left out, and the plays awoke in me (who was then in elementary school) a thirst for history and a hunger for shakespeare and drama.let's see these reissued on dvd. what a set this would be!

boogie nights follows a theme that is extremely familiar to gangster films (although it doesn't fit into that genre itself) - the rise and the fall. we see the rise of several individuals, some of them from complete obscurity, to achieving great heights ... and then falling from grace due to their excesses.i believe that this is the first feature by writer/director paul thomas anderson, and it's a great start! i saw elements of other directors' influences, such as robert altman, but the film holds its own in originality and plot development.character development is the movie's finest feature. i really identified with all of the characters and felt their pain and their success with them. all of the performances were brilliant. (it was especially good to see a small part performed by real-life porn veteran, nina hartley).basically this film combines comedy and tragedy with the result being one of the best films of 1997, which was snubbed at the oscars (probably due to the "racy" - as they would say - subject matter, and the general conservatism of the academy.

this film is a masterpiece. it was exhilarating from beginning to end. writer-director paul thomas anderson's story about a porn star is told with style, grace, humor, even poignancy. the actors and the characters they play are all first-rate, including mark wahlberg in the lead, who proves himself a solid actor and can carry a film. burt reynolds gives perhaps his best performance ever as a porno director who discovers wahlberg. the film recreates the late 70s and early 80s with dead-on accuracy, from the disco scene that begins the film to wahlberg's don johnson "miami vice" outfit that he wears in the final scene. most regular moviegoers who see this film will no doubt compare it to pulp fiction, but it really has much more in common with the films of robert altman and martin scorsese. the film is a triumph in style. the opening tracking shot that begins the film is just as impressive as the ones in the player and absolute beginners. the editing by dylan tichenor is simply phenomenal. i couldn't believe the editing didn't receive an oscar nomination (good will hunting was a better edited film?!). the best scene in the film has to be the one with the firecrackers. i had butterflies in my stomach because the scene is incredibly intense. when i saw the film a second time, i had the exact same reaction to the scene. unfortunately, it may not have the same impact on tv as it did in a theater with good stereo sound. it's a shame that many people didn't see this movie during its theatrical run, because it is the best way to watch it. anderson's use of widescreen will suffer on tv (so get the dvd or a letterbox tape). it is amazing how easy anderson makes it all look, because this is only his second film. the music, sets, costumes, photography, offbeat characters, sex, violence, happiness and heartbreak are captured by a guy who is clearly in love with filmmaking.

this was the best film of 1998 and one of the best of the 90's. yes, it is a rip off of goodfellas. but as the saying goes, good poets borrow, great poets steal. and pta has stolen brilliantly from some of the best, plus added some genius touches of his own. i gave this a ten (which is very rare for me).the main reason i am commenting on this though (cause i could just rave all night) is all those people who have seen it on vhs standard issue...what are you thinking? this deserves the full screen experience. look at the ratio it was shot in! i saw it 5 times at the cinema and haven't bothered to watch it on video.nuff said!

this movie has it all. great actors, good dialog, drama, comedy, and excellent writing and directing by paul thomas anderson. i have seen this film several times and enjoy it more each time. it doesn't get old, it is consistently entertaining and stimulating. easily burt reynolds best role, and he does a great job. john c. reilly and don cheadle also give excellent comedic performances. there is not a weak element in this film.

an interesting companion piece to true documentaries of john c. holmes. unfortunately, it doesn't deal with what ultimately killed holmes, and it certainly could have benefited from doing so. burt reynolds and mark wahlberg got the most praise for this, but i felt the true stars were julianne moore as the cocaine-sniffing mother wannabe, don cheadle as a black man struggling with identity as pornstar/stereo-salesman in some wild getups and william h. macy, who's wife is the ultimate slut. not to mention a nearly unrecognizable alfred molina. macy's new year's eve bash and cheadle's chance for a better life after a donut shop robbery gone wildly wrong are probably the two best scenes in the movie, or at least the two best shot. what this movie does best is show how power can easily corrupt in its various forms. however, none of the characters apparently learn anything from their dark downward spiral as they all rebound and return to their normal lives.

i must admit this is one of cameron diaz's unheard of films and i was also surprised that she had an important role but she was not the lead. i was very touched by it as i really can identify the pain of the loss of a loved one as i have experienced it from close quarters.both camilla belle and jordana brewster were really good in their portrayal of the protagonist phoebe and i must also hand it to the casting people for finding two actresses who look so alike that i really thought they were sisters(in real life). this is one of those movies cameron did for the sake of acting and not for star billing.she looked the part of the gorgeous ,rebellious hippie who wants to change the world though sometimes she comes off as a rebel without a cause.coming from a dysfunctional family where her only source of strength being her big sister faith, little girl phoebe is understandably very upset when faith leaves for europe. as she grows up she goes off in search of her sister and gradually gets disillusioned by the truth about her sister and falls for her sister's boyfriend.great story and equally great location shooting around european.i will watch it again.

one way or the other, you can't get away from the basic message. the strong survive. those who are psychically or emotionally sensitive, leave. they leave a hole behind in the lives of those who love them. a hole that is seen in it's finality as selfish. that's what phoebe realizes in the end. just prior to helping wolf heal from his self-blame. she can accept closure to the missing ...of her sister. beautiful european scenery. a lot of truth in it about idealism and addiction to the next big moment. for a moment, i thought of the baader-meinhoff gang who was around in the early 70s. i liked this movie as it reflected a time when i came of age myself.

if i look hard enough, flaws can be found in this film, primarily with the script. i found the character of wolf not totally convincing. however, those were my only "complaints." because when this movie started on cable, i was just going to record it and watch it later. however, from the beginning, with the eerie music and cameron diaz doing her spaced out 60's dance, i was riveted. i never got up until the movie was over. it seemed like i never even blinked.the acting of cameron diaz and jordana brewster was excellent. the scenes were beautiful, the girls were beautiful, and the music was haunting and very touching. the story was quite unique and at times had a surreal quality. the viewer would tend to like the picture more if they had a good understanding of the state of mind of young people in the 60's and 70's, especially in america. many of the scenes basically succeeded in showing something of that era that is hard to pin down. it was a bit more complicated than the simplistic statement that they wanted to change the world and ended up disillusioned, although that may be the most obvious aspect. phoebe learns more and more about this as the movie progresses.one aspect that didn't seem to be covered by the other reviewers that might bear mentioning, is the way the two daughters seem to drift through life after the death of their father. they both had adored him, and his presence had been a stabilizing factor in their lives and obviously he had loved them dearly. we read so much today about boys who lose their fathers too soon, only to lose their way themselves. this film covers the ripple effect of the loss of the father on the daughters left behind, first on the older sister faith, then on to her younger sister. their mother feels inadequate to try to be both parents. this type of dynamic is not covered in hardly any other movies, especially in so many different layers of plot and subplot. phoebe's inner struggles of reality versus perceptions are gradually peeled away like layers of an onion.speaking of plot, this movie should rate higher than it has here. i kept waiting for some great conspiracy to be found out concerning the death of faith. how it did resolve itself surprised me, even if others may have guessed much sooner.maybe not for everybody, but i could watch this movie many, many times.

i have seen 'the sea within' today and i loved it. the actors of the movie are wonderful (specially javier bardem, of course), but i thought that belén rueda would have a better role. lola dueñas, clara segura and, specially, mabel rivera perform excellent interpretations. and i cannot forget celso bugallo and joan dalmau (brother and father of the protagonist).there are two technical aspects i loved very much: aguirresarobe's photography and the score by amenábar himself. i liked the song, 'negra sombra' ('dark shadow'), by luz casal with music of carlos núñez.in short, i think that the spanish academy should choose 'the sea within' in order to compete in the oscar awards. i liked other spanish productions, such as almodóvar's 'bad education', but amenábar's film is much better than them. 'the sea within' deserves all the awards.

a friend of mine asked: "doesn't one have to be pro-euthanasia in order to like this movie? is it a mistake of the movie to infer most quadriplegics want to end their lives?" interesting questions.as far as i can see (correct me if i'm wrong), there is only one quadriplegic who wanted to end his life in the sea inside. think ramón sampedro addressed this in the movie as well. it is he who wants to die. it is he who is fighting for his right to decide his death. he is speaking for himself and not other quadriplegics. though his pioneering work, depending on one's perspective, may prove beneficial or damaging to quadriplegics down the road, his primary objective is a personal one. but one thing this movie does (my opinion anyway), is that it forces us the viewers to ask ourselves the inferring questions my friend so succinctly put forth.after my first viewing of the sea inside, i walked home in a conflicted blur. i struggled to reconcile with this exasperating notion; why would ramón want to die? given the love, care and sacrifices so unconditionally showered on ramón by the people surrounding him, why would he doggedly cling on to his hurtful decision? then, on my second viewing, a shared thought between ramón and the lawyer lady entered my consciousness. it threw up a telling observation: "...total dependency comes at the expense of intimacy." most human beings crave for such an intimacy. of course, how much we value such "needs", depends largely on the individual.as a person with a familial-biased sensibility, i empathised strongly with the caregivers in this movie. why can't javier consider the sacrifice and the love from his family and friends? is he blind to it all? i would think not. the miracle of the sea inside therefore, is its insightful depiction of a very humanistic tug of war. when we are faced with the guardianship of a sane but incapacitated loved one, whom has expressed a calm, conscious and rational intent to die, what then is the right thing to do? is caring for and keeping this loved one alive, against his or her will, a pious gesture? does it show up the worth of our love? or does it merely soothe our "selfish" fears of irreplaceable loss? with so much understanding accorded to caregivers, wouldn't their invalid charges, by submitting themselves to the total dependency of others for survival, also be an overlooked act of sacrifice? rhetorical or not, how much is "dignity" worth to an individual? is living (or dying) with dignity a privilege or a right? if we really care and love a person, should we also respect their eventual decisions in life (as in death)? a torrent of questions the movie might have asked, answers to which, i'm in no position to provide.in our eagerness to intellectually demarcate the merits of pro-life or pro-choice, we run the risk of ignoring a sea of grey that's engulfing the people most intimately affected, the caregivers and the ones they care for. the sea inside hence attempted to present the delicate yet complex relationship dynamics between them. intuitively, this film understands one thing; that the nature of "sacrifice" is never one-sided. in this tug of war, we should endeavour not to win arguments, but to intently observe and hopefully determine, who is the "stronger" party to make that sacrifice.the sea inside is a sobering film. it opened my eyes to things i don't wanna see. and for that, i am grateful.

it's a soap-opera drawing upon an applied ethics idea. a movie about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie. i didn't get any emotion from it, the ideas are not at all new, the tension lacks, it becomes tedious towards the second half but towards the end i think it becomes quite interesting in a burlesque way. i mean you have this middle-aged, paralyzed bald guy who gets more women than don juan. he doesn't seem to suffer as much as you would expect from someone completely paralyzed for over 28 years, he has no issues with god (and one would probably expect that too), the people around him seem to be the perfect slaves (i can't get out of my mind bergman's cries and whispers, similar to this one in many respects, which simply bursts with emotions, and not all of them humane) etc. this movie is the perfect recipe for housewives who look for some emotional thrill but don't expect to be blown away. the movie is worth seeing among all the cynicism we get today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical issue without any desire to arouse the viewer. amenabar doesn't rub your face in it and he doesn't take sides, he doesn't want to make us fanatics for a particular idea. still i have no clue as to why this movie was so highly regarded.

i suppose it's quite an achievement to be able to present to an audience a true tail about a frail man; a tail in which the protagonist will spend the majority of the film on his back, in a bed and totally unable to move. and yet the achievement is in the film's effectiveness as a dramatic piece; as a recollection of a true story and i guess as an argument as to why people should have the right to die if they so wish to. but the film isn't a political statement and perhaps thankfully it shies away from too many scenes of debate although it does include one for the sake of argument anyway. more-so, this is one of those foreign language films that presents its lead character as a cripple whom can do nothing but talk to the people around him and yet is able to come across as engaging and compelling anyway.so rather than be an out and out argument, the film is more a sweet yet timely dramatic piece about another person wanting something or in search of something; the only difference is that by attaining this 'goal', it would mean the termination of a someone's life and it would be achieved by not physically going anywhere. javier bardem plays real life galician ramón sampedro, an individual who at a much earlier age dived into a clearing of water that was too shallow for such activity. this rendered him bedridden for the rest of his life and his wish to die is the focus of chilean director alejandro amenábar's film. we've seen so many films in our lives in which characters have certain 'goals' or targets one must meet before the film is over to provide a satisfactory experience for the audience, but the change of pace in the sea inside is gentle; it does not involve young, energetic, attractive heroes going off to do battle in far off places but a real person after something that means so much to them.even if you do have a strong policy, either pro or anti-euthanasia, you may find yourself hoping ramón gets what he wants at the end of it all anyway. the film sets its tone very early on with ramón giving a speech on why he wants to die to watching family members, immediately introducing the situation and subject to the watching audience who may not know what the film is about. interestingly, some of the family members are 'anti' what he wishes which might place any audience member that feels strongly about the subject in their respective shoes. but the purpose of this set up is to tell the audience 'no, this isn't one man after something who incidentally has the whole of his family backing him to the end'. quite easily, the film could've gone down a route in which it is the sampedro family vs. everybody else but some are anti-ramón's idea; some are too young to acknowledge what's really going on and others are seemingly too distraught to even have an opinion other than they just want ramón to stick around a bit longer, they love him after all.the sea inside is a following of a story revolving around a victim of sorts. ramón is a quadriplegic and it is his perspective we see things from. this is something that may disjoint viewers or have the film come across as quite odd given we are being presented with a film from the point of view of a victim rather than an instigator or a lead character in a film that is always inducing the cause in the cause and effect drive. but this is no criticism and it's a credit to the director for delivering such an approach in the effective manner in which it is. the film asks questions; it offers a scenario to its audience. if you were in ramón's position: what would you do, or think about or dream of or talk about? consequently, dreams about lawyer juila (rueda) are not so much shot for the audience's pleasure as much as they are an ever so slight window into one man's escapist fantasies from his predicament.the study of julia intensifies somewhat later on when a she begins to share certain similarities with ramón and that is when she begins to have strokes that are a result of a disease of her own. this trait seems timely in the progression of their relationship and adds a further ingredient of connection on top of an already engaging friendship. this is because julia feels the physical pain and restriction, not in a sense that she isn't able to get up and walk, but i think she realises the value of life given how emotionally bad she felt beforehand. while the film is based on a true story and covers the subject of euthanasia, it feels like more of a down to earth drama about a man in a situation in which he is prepared to fight for what he wants but must do so verbally. it's refreshing to see films like the sea inside as it not only references history and gives us an insight into that but as a stand alone film, delivers on an emotional and engaging level.

in the tradition of "neo" film noir flicks like "chinatown", this film focuses on a crime mystery in a bleak realm with a bit of character insight blended in. the typical noir characters thoughout, including the cop out to prove himself, a damsel in distress and a bad, bad guy. sharky's machine gets a 9 out of 10 for its cinematography first, plus its direction, story, strong character acting and superb jazz score. available on dvd, though the soundtrack itself is out of print (but available "used" on some auction sites). filmed on location in beautiful downtown atlanta (novelist diehl's hometown) and the uncluttered, circa 1979 look of the city would make an old-time atlanta citizen or visitor long for the old days before 12-lane interstates crisscrossed the city, a cinematographer's dream at that time. this was rachel ward's first usa feature film.

burt reynolds directed this action movie and (surprise!) he is actually a pretty good director. this movie starts off well as burt's attempted bust of a drug dealer is botched, and he is demoted down to the vice squad. the ensemble cast has some pretty funny scenes as brian kieth is always eating something, bernie casey has more class than all of his co-workers combined, and charles durning loses control of his squad.the vice cops stumble on a high-priced call-girl ring that may have something to do with a series of murders. sharkey spends days staking out dominoe's (rachel ward) apartment, and starts to really adore her from afar.just when they are getting close to the crime leader, dominoe is murdered. i won't give away any of the surprises in the plot, but the first hour of this film is great.unfortunately, the screenplay gets very clichéd and unbelievable after that.why would burt reynolds confront the crime boss with his big secret? sure it makes the guy sweat, but it causes many more cops to be killed. and it is not believable that dominoe and sharkey would make love after they have know each other for one day, much less while their lives are in danger. and at the end, what happened to all the police that run into the building with our heroes? isn't there a swat team? also, the film never actually tells you how all of the bad guys are connected, and why they have to kill so many people.there is a very effective torture scene on a boat near the end of the film, which is probably the only really nail-biting scene of the film. it is a shame that the climax is a typical shoot-em-up. still, this film is certainly entertaining if you like crime and action movies. don't think about the plot holes, and you will have a good time.

in short if you want to watch burt reynolds best films than this one must be included. if you don't like burt you may still like this. if you love burt this may become one of your favorite movies of all time! being from atlanta it does hit home but it's also nice to see a cop/action/drama that takes place somewhere other than ny city, chicago, miami, or la. the film is funny at points with & good plot & good performances from a great supporting cast (every character is real & the bad guys are not so one sided they are really well thought out)a nice offbeat romance in the 2nd half & it has some good old fashion shootouts & fistfights (no cgi thank god real action!)if clint eastwood did his best impression of a burt reynolds movie with "every which way but loose" & "any which way you can" then burt responded with his best clint type flick with this, & it comes off great!

"sharky's machine" is clearly a burt reynolds vehicle designed to allow the star room to strut his talents and he spray-paints the machine, the film plot, with colors from other films and other styles, offering a variety of moods within a nourish story.made in 1981 at 119 minutes (lengthy for the time period), the film did well, with box office grosses at $37,800,000. it had a lot going for it: burt reynolds actor and director, a solid one-two punch; a william diel novel adaptation, and the south land of atlanta georgia, at this time, a land of opportunity for film production out of hollywood.reynolds' tom sharky falling in love with rachel ward's dominoe the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold is here echoed as it was in "hustle" when he played opposite catherine deneuve, and that film also had a corrupt politician at its core, but with downbeat ending not the hollywood happiness in "sharky's machine".the story is pure detective procedure/actioner. sharky a narcotics detective mismanages up a bust of a drug dealer, causing the killing of some innocent bystanders, and gets demoted, literally transferred downstairs to vice, to deal with perverts, and other m misdemeanors that 'upstanding' cops consider latrine duty. his new digs offers him the chance to meet many equally upstanding officers who are doing the dirty jobs no one else wants. when some attention is pointed toward a certain pimp sharky looks over some evidence and discovers that one particular prostitute dominoe (rachel ward) - dominoe is being shielded by police forces and political forces and sharky sets himself up a 24-hour surveillance force to watch her. during the time he watches he learns that the current governor-elect hotchkins (earl holliman) is visiting dominoe, as is a slick italian gangster victor (vittorio gassman). before the police can build a case with the evidence, billy, victor's brother, a coke-snorting gunman (henry silva) shoots through the door of dominoe's apartment seemingly killing the beautiful dominoe, but when sharky discovers that the murdered victim was actually a roommate tiffany (aarika wells) sharky confronts victor and tells him that he is going to have him arrested. sharky is captured by some ninja killers lead by smiley (darryl hickman) and is tortured for information to lead to dominoe, but sharky overpowers them and arrests the governor and in a heated chase kills billy after he has killed victor.reynolds wants to exhibit the inner workings of a hardened policemen falling in love, but the police-story plot, flavored with noir element, and reynolds ability at cinematic development tends to slick over the dynamics of the relationships.we come to learn something about some of the men and this leads us to reason why they are working towards their pensions in vice, instead of fighting real crime- this element of the film seems sketchy under reynolds' off-handed direction and performance.there is always uniqueness to a reynolds film. he likes to hire stars, either character actors or others and then allow them to improvise, sometimes with varying results.with his crew in "sharky's machine" he gets some fine moments, and sometimes some overblown grandstanding but always a sense of ensemble and good-natured-ness. with reynolds as auteur it works.reynolds, the actor/auteur always seems to be smirking at himself and the viewer as if to say it's all fake, but good fun.great line: in the scene with victor when sharky throws down the gauntlet "you're walkin' all over people like you own 'em ,and you wanna know the worst part? you're from out of state." this seems to be the greatest insult the officer can throw at a criminal.reynolds made the film in atlanta at his career point have shot himself reading the phone book and would have surely targeted and demographic.the film did mark the appearance of rachel ward who was nominated as new star of the year in 1981 by the golden globe.reynolds has always had presence and star power and has chosen to make films close to home, georgia.i got my dvd from half.com for $7.99 and unfortunately it doesn't contain any commentary or making-of features, which is a shame. maybe the next generation will have them.the movie is still a lot of fun and both reynolds and ward are great-looking actors in their prime.

people watch movies for a variety of different reasons. this movie didn't have the big budget, there's no special effects, no car chases and there's no explosions. actually reality doesn't have much of these either. at least not in my life. this is a very real movie about very real people, none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos. i am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology, since i'm neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain.so watch this movie for the characters. it is brim-full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk. within the first three minutes kiefer sutherland enacts detective michael hayden's life superbly and he keeps developing the character throughout the movie. excellent acting, very believable. henry czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between his 'harvey' and kiefer's 'mickey' enhances the oppositeness of their characters.i thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady, 'mrs ramsay', i'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends!!!there's a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited here so watch the movie and enjoy them.

working the night shift in a seedy police station, stumbling through life in an alcoholic haze, detective mickey hayden can hardly be said to have a firm grasp on reality to begin with, but when a bump on the head unleashes terrifying psychic visions, things get truly weird. soon he's on the trail of a serial killer and unraveling the mystery of his beautiful first victim, the elusive alice.the role of an embittered burn-out seems tailor-made for keifer sutherland and he makes the most of it. the plot's typical serial killer stuff, but it has enough quirks, twists, and genuine surprises to raise it above the usual genre fare and even make up for a painfully low budget. (one wonders what this film could have been if there'd been money for a few more rewrites and a few more takes.)all in all, 'after alice' is a pleasant diversion for anyone, but for fans of lewis carroll's 'alice' books, it's a real treat. from the topsy-turvy reality in which things are rarely what they've seem, to more obvious references -- a killer called 'the jabberwocky', who leaves playing cards on his victims' bodies -- there's an 'alice' reference at every turn. below is a list of the ones i uncovered. since finding them yourself is half the fun, i've marked them as spoilers.spoilerscast of charactersmickey - in a sense he's alice himself wandering through strange landscapes, encountering odd characters, but harvey, recognizing his true nature, identifies him as the hapless, bumbling white knight. john hatter (mickey's boss) - is he really 'mad'? you be the judgeclaudette - an african-american transvestite. obviously, the black queenmargaret ellison - mickey calls her the red queen, but her brutal nature suggests, more specifically, the queen of hearts.gideon wood - suspected of being the jabberwocky killer, his ambiguous role is more suggestive of a snark (or a boojum perhaps).harvey - his role as unofficial guide to 'wonderland' and his name, evocative of another famous cinematic rabbit, makes me think he must be the white rabbitdr. vera swann - her last name and relationship with mickey suggest the white queen.other connectionsmickey's adventures begin when he chases a man in white and falls down a (rabbit) hole. mickey drunkenly tells his cat to stop grinning at him (cheshire cat)the killer is revealed 'through the looking glass'.the climatic showdown ends in a swirl of playing cards, just as alice's adventure did in the book.the statues in the garden look like giant chess pieces.

i would just like to say that the cure was a fabulious movie to help inform how people who are hiv positive have to function in life. expecially a young boy who cant go to school because he could contaminate someone. and the ignorance of the boys who called them faggots. that just shows how much children are not educated about aids.

on more than one level, i can relate to what happens in this movie in a very personal way. and all i can say about it is, that it's true, what dexter's mom tells eric at the end of the story: he actually did 'cure' her son, by taking away his sad feelings and his loneliness.this movie emphasis a philosophy i can very well agree with. we are all going to die one day sooner or later. in the end, it is not the amount of time we live, but the fun/good times/happiness we have during that time. it is not the quantity, but the quality that counts.i guess all other words used here would only keep you any longer from getting to see this movie, if you haven't already. i really would like to see it released on dvd. definitely it would be added to my 'all time classics' right away!

i had never heard about this movie when it was given to me to translate, so i didn't know what to expect. i checked it out on imdb and got curious. it didn't take long to realize that this was a gem. outstanding performances, great story, and it's both well directed and well written. it's hard to compare it to other movies, but "stand by me" comes to mind, although it has as many differences from "the cure" as similarities. the tale of an extraordinary friendship between young boys, plus the dramatic and humorous elements are the most obvious similarities between this movie and "stand by me". other than that, "the cure" is a fine movie in its own right, well worth a wider recognition. it's dramatic, but also adventurous, sad, but also humorous. i can't think of a single thing that bothers me about it. having said that, i don't want to give the impression that it is a "perfect movie", whatever that means, but rather that i enjoyed it immensely, was very moved by it and wouldn't change a thing in it. i won't go into a detailed description of the story/plot, partly because it would be either too general or too revealing, and partly because you can find that information elsewhere on the site. in closing, i can only say: wonderful movie, see it if you get the chance.

so glad i have hbo right now. i didn't plan on watching a movie today, but when i got home and saw that the next movie on hbo was this one i decided (based on the description) to at least give it a shot. i'm so glad i decided to watch this movie! maybe this movie just caught me at a vulnerable moment (i'm a little stressed out, got a huge test to be studying for), but it definitely gave me quite the perspective on friendship not to mention taught me a valuable lesson on empathy. i'm currently one year away from graduating from pharmacy school and the whole scene involving the doctor and the nurse was definitely a learning point for me!anyhow, i just wanted to post up letting the world know this is an amazing movie and not to be missed. there is definitely something for everyone in this movie!

such an awesome movie -- i was transfixed the entire time and so emotionally overcome in the end! the two young male actors in the movie were more than compelling in their performance as their friendship and support of one another was quite believable and i thought the comparison/contrast between their respective home lives vs. health situations were made so very real between them. the success in bringing this movie to life was obviously a team effort so to actors, ep's, producers, writers, directors, and all of production i say, "well played!" having missed the credits at the beginning of the movie (it was being shown on hbo), i was so very surprised that i had to actually research (albeit briefly) the internet in order to find the title of this movie -- something so great should have been known by me -- a clear indication that this movie must be re-released!

let me start out with saying i was very surprised with the production value of this movie. i managed to catch an early showing and i have to say this is the best (if not only) christian film to hit theaters since the passion.don't let the pg-13 rating scare you off, the rating is appropriate because of the serious issues that are dealt with in this film (divorce, teen pregnancy, drug use, and suicide), but nothing in the film is gratuitous. this is definitely a movie that a junior high youth group could see without upsetting (most) parents, and the message is wonderful. the best part is this is not a film for christians, it is a family film without the cheesy 7th heaven feel.the laughs are there, and several times in the theater everyone was laughing, the bits of humor were natural and didn't seem scripted or forced, and that made for good pacing in such a serious film. teens and young adult, both religious and otherwise, will be able to identify with many if not all of the characters in the film, and i was surprised to see such issues dealt with in this kind of film. the plot is not in any way predictable, and by the end hits closer to home than many will admit. christians, fortunately, are not shown as all mighty know it all's of "the word", but instead people just trying to understand life. humans make mistakes and no one is perfect, not even in this film... not by a long shot.the acting is top notch, the writing spot on, and you aren't hit over the head with all the preachy christian rhetoric. this is a great film that will make you and your teens think, talk, and perhaps question their own morality (or lack thereof). if you want to see a quality family film in january check your local listings for this film, and you might learn something about yourself.and i am a 25 year old male that just wanted to see a free movie.

i was lucky enough to see a test screening of 'el padrino' a couple months ago in santa monica. i was blown away. you don't see films like this anymore. in the vein of scosese, chapa deftly tells the tragic story of kilo as he maneuvers the tough streets of la to rise above the ranks to become a drug lord of escobarian proportions. the characters are complex and conflicted. the emotions are real. the action is fast and furious. the stunts are expansive. and tilly is hot. she hasn't looked this good since her 'bound' days. i'd recommend this to anyone. it's a fantastic homage to the epic action films of the late 80s and early 90s. and to all the naysayers out there watch it again; you obviously had your eyes closed the first time. congrats to all involved in the film. i'm counting the days until the sequel is released. anyone have a date on that?

finally a gangster movie worth watching!jennifer tily should get nominated for her role as tough murdering femme fatal!this movie flies like a bird , just a fast paced non stop gangster mayhem!jennifer tily is just so beautiful and bad in this movie.i was shocked to find faye dunaway still lives! the cast in this movie are so fitted to their roles. a real cool soundtrack rides along side and you get swept into the spanish soul of this film.the story is original deep and poetic.this flick has a lot of substance and never rests.the gang of spanish fire just set everything on screen alight.damian chapa is a joy to watch and a movie star.sit back and enjoy the ride.

this movie is the latino godfather. an unlikely mobster bridges the gap to some unlikely alliances and forms an empire. i enjoyed the action and gunfights along with the brash acting and colorful characters. this movie is no oscar winner, but definitely entertaining. hey, who needs an oscar anyway? chapa has got some balls to direct& act ( i think he produced it too?) this movie. reminds me of another filmmaker who likes to do it all, robert rodrigez. keep it up, is there a sequel in the works? there are a bunch of strings that need to be tied. son comes back and avenges dads death?

i love this movie and i recommend it to anybody.damian chapa and jennifer tilly played their roles perfectly.just the characters alone pull you in to the movie.the directing was also magnificent.the most creative shots i've ever seen.i was stuck to the screen throughout the whole movie,not one scene was slow.the movie also has a lot of action packed scenes,cars blowing up,etc.the movie is just an all around masterpiece. if you like real entertaining movies then watch this because you'll be on the edge of your seat the whole time.i put this movie on my top ten all time list,because there is never a dull moment in the movie,and that is my type of movie.2 thumbs up,all the way up!!!!!!!!!

the movie was better than what i expected. i was working on the movie set for a short period of time when damien was making this film.the gun fire, stunt and acting came out pretty good on the editing tip.all thou the the music wasn't all that great. better music would have top this film.some of the music sound like the hippie days. damien remember you have gang violence gangster's some oldies or hip hop would have did it. it was more realistic than blood in blood out.the casting was picked real well.suspectentertaint did a good job in this film.the movie brought back a fill of a life style i use to live. but than at the end you do not always win. and in my history thats how it was.i adapted to the movie the first time i watched it.damien congratulatoins on this film.

this is, without a doubt, one of my favorite columbo episodes ever. the acting is very well done, the music is very catchy, the script is ingenious, and the direction is fabulous.peter falk, who acts brilliantly in every columbo episodes, acts particularly well in this episode.also, great performances from stephen caffrey, gary hershberger, alan fudge and robert culp.the ending is absolutely brilliant and i love the way columbo describes it.this is a columbo movie that won't, go amiss.

at the end, it is clear that the murderers planted the murder weapon in mrs. columbo's car and it was at the police ballistics lab. but where did the gun under the hood, used in the demonstration, come from? wouldn't the murderers have cleared out the stuff under the hood? they had a whole week? or did columbo's cops replicate the camera/gun under the hood used in the demonstration? how did they do that without breaking and entering the car? perhaps this is why the murders seemed surprised at the end. but how could columbo have replicated their camera/gun device and gotten it calibrated to their key fob? columbo must have gotten the gun back from ballistics and had it re-planted under the hood of the car, and been very lucky that the rest of the device with camera was still there and transmitting.this was a 10/10 show until this glaring plot error at the end.

sorry to repeat myself over and over, but here's another great columbo episode. i guess that's why i'm such a fan - most episodes really are great! the best episodes always have a standout feature of some sort, and in this case the murderer and his accomplice are possibly the youngest ever columbo villains.after watching a lot of episodes where columbo and his adversary act like close friends, it's good to see an episode where tempers fray and bad feelings rise to the surface. it just gives an episode a bit more drama and bite. columbo is rapidly onto the fact that the two students who claim to be helping him are not very secretly laughing at him and feeding him false clues. he happily plays along, deliberately turning up the bumbling in front of them to make them underestimate him! but of course he knows instantly when they are talking baloney.the murder itself is another complicated one, along the lines of the bye bye sky high iq episode, with a sophisticated chain reaction of events that manages to kill the intended target while providing the assassins with a seemingly watertight alibi. in the intervening years between 1978 and 1990, the technology has moved on from record players and firecrackers to remote control car locking systems and hidden cameras.stephen caffrey puts in a great performance as justin rowe, the obnoxious, spoilt student. gary hershberger is low-key but good as his "yes-man" friend cooper redman. and it's nice to see robert culp as mr rowe, justin's dad.a very satisfying episode in all ways.

or any stories reminiscent of the leopold and loeb case, you may find this movie entertaining. the cast includes robert culp,with stephen caffrey and garrison hershberger as the college students.peter falk is his usual self, pretending to be tricked by the precocious students. caffrey ("longtime companion", "buried alive") is excellent, and should do more of these menacing roles. basically the two frat buddies become tired of their demanding parents, who expect nothing less than academic perfection, attendance at the best schools will only be financed if they conform. there is an excellent scene wherein culp rakes caffrey over the coals after he gets a low grade, threatens to cut off his trust funds and caffrey later says to his friend: "i hate him, i want him dead"...all is not well in beverly hills. this is always an excellent theme. i believe this film came out in 1990 right after the menendez killings. if you watch "menedez, a killing in beverly hills" and then compare it to this film, you may find some interesting parallels.

after all these years of solving crimes, you would've expected criminals to know that they can't afford making mistakes with him, especially not with regards to talking much. this timecolumbo goes to college, and actually explains his entire technique, but for some reason the murderer still doesn't pay enough attention. however, this still creates wonderful scenes and delightful dialogues.

columbo is guest lecturer for a criminology class. the students invite him along for their after-class get-together. transiting the nearby parking garage, they discover their regular teacher, next to his car, dead from a gunshot wound. (no, columbo was not after the man's job.) as a class project, columbo involves the students in his sleuthing.two students, tentatively identified by the viewer as culprits, were in the lecture hall for the entire class. furthermore, surveillance camera tapes of the parking garage show that no one other than the professor entered or left after he was last seen unexpectedly departing the lecture hall.reversing the normal routine, columbo is the one that is pestered by the evil (?) duo, eager for progress reports and an ear for their theories. forensic evidence is almost nonexistent. solution of the case hinges on some eventual and interesting good luck.on first viewing, it seemed that columbo had swallowed whole the culprits' misdirection; however, on repeat viewing, small details revealed that not to have been the case at all.this reviewer has yet to tire of "columbo goes to college."

i felt that way when i saw the episode in its original run and still agree when i watch it on reruns. you had the culprits totally mocking columbo throughout the episode and treating him like he has down syndrome. and in the end you see their shock when columbo gets them dead to rights and arrest them. you also get a realistic reaction from the arrogant preppy killers. they stillcouldn't give columbo his props and say he just got lucky. i like the formula where there is an elaborate crime, the killer(s) totally underestimate columbo, and then you get their realization that columbo was totally playing the criminals. i recall in the first few episodes of the post 1989 episodes they weren't following that formula and this was the first episode that i was pleased with.

and i do. peter falk has created a role that will live on forever in tv land! and i'm grateful for that. this isn't one of his finest hours, though. columbo goes to college and basically teaches how he solves a crime, and yet there are bad guys who go ahead and think they're smarter than he is. what all us fans know is that columbo needs a worthy opponent. without a great enemy, how can he be the hero in the wrinkled coat? still, it's better than no columbo, and i'll wait and watch the next one as well.

probably grossly underrated by all who never experienced the hell of living under communist regime. although, it seems hard to believe, all of it happened, actually the reality was even worse than the movie. it resembles orwellian fiction, only this is no fiction. john hurt is excellent as always. yes, the screenplay is not full of action, but life is not either. plot is breathtaking. yes, people were shot, yes thousands of them. their 'crime' was that they wanted to leave communist 'paradise' without government authorization. at times the movie drives tears in your eyes. we need more movies like this to really appreciate what america provides for us. excellent movie, highly recommend! god bless our country, usa!

fun movie! the script is awful but the quality of actors saves the day. john hurt is perfect, as is jane alexander. beau bridges is fair and the actress who plays his wife is very weak. the story is the true star. based on a true story, the pace moves well and the whole concept of escaping east germany sucks you in and holds you. joyous ending provides enough elation to compensate for script. don't expect academy award quality but it's a great ride for the whole family.

what can i say about this film other than the narrative is one of the most exciting in film history...and based on a true story! being old enough to remember the berlin wall when it was still used to contain a country, this film gives you a dark insight into the grim incarceration of east berliners, and their desperate attempts to escape, no matter what the cost. the film follows the lives of two families , who decide to escape using a hot-air balloon manufactured by themselves. forever fearing arrest by the authorities, under scrutiny by neighbours, they have to calculate a plan to reach the other side of the wall. a tense & thrilling story of courage and determination which truly pays homage to all those who succeeded and failed the treacherous journey to west berlin and freedom.

i grew up outside of naila germany(where they landed),every detail of the film was 100% authentic,the power lines that they flew over,the nosy neighbors,the grandmother telling the kids that they cant watch west german tv,etc..this movie brings back lots of good memories to those that are european,a great production from disney...the same movie in german has klaus lowitsch and gunter meisner using their own voices for translating the english version into german...for the german version they also use cookoo birds ,a bird that is native to germany as background noise to let you know that you are in germany..i showed this move to many of my german relative and they really liked this movie.(these people made made a prototype balloon which they had to give up because the materials that they used was too porous and the other 2 balloons that they used for the escape.the burner problem was solved when they turned the propane cylinders upside down.)

i was surprised as i watched this movie, how much it had 'encaptured' me. no the actors didn't act like typical 'hollywood' actors, but that's not always bad either, as this film proves. quite different from the disney standard, it is a refreshing turn none-the-less! they also give you a taste of what it was probably like without being 'educational'. a movie everyone should both see and enjoy. many people love arguing over 'accuracies' in any movie of this type, but just getting the basic idea has plenty to offer. mild gripe; east and west germany, viewed on any map, would have west germany on the left side, east to the right. the movie at times, sets you back slightly, because about half of the scenes have west germany on the right side of the screen, and other times on the left side. even during the same events, they shift back and forth. perhaps, just a little more consistency would have avoided this mild distraction. go see it!

i think that this film has become an important record of the most horrifying aspect of the east german regime - the imprisonment of its people by what the regime called its anti-fascist protective wall. it is a document of desperation and courage not to be missed. i would however like to comment on the actual location of this escape. it did not happen in or around berlin as supposed by some respondents and was nothing to do directly with the berlin wall. the escape balloon was flown over the iron curtain which not only divided germany but it divided the whole of europe at that time. the balloon took off from pössneck, 170 miles south-west of berlin in the german democratic republic (east germany) and flew 14 miles to naila in bavaria and freedom in west germany. the opening of the iron curtain in hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the berlin wall later that year. whilst the balloon flight created entertaining suspense cinema, it should remain as a monument to those who lost their lives whilst attempting to escape from east berlin, other parts of the gdr or other soviet-controlled states.

this movie accurately portrays the struggle life was for the typical east german. watched by the secret police, friends and coworkers, most easterners simply existed.the strelzyk's and the wetzel's were two families that decided they weren't going to take it anymore. despite the extreme danger involved in escaping to the west, they feel the rewards far outweighed the risks. john hurt and beau bridges, portraying the respective family heads hit upon the idea of flying over east germany's heavily fortified border. there are tense moments as they gather and jimmy-rig the necessary materials for the flight. they work their day jobs and construct the balloon at night, right under the noses of the authorities, one of whom is strelzyk's neighbor (klaus loewitsch). the first attempt, involving only the strelzyks, ends in failure when the balloon crashes just a few yards from the border. the crashed balloon is discovered by border guards and an relentless search begins for the conspirators who are determined to try again. with sales of materials being closely monitored peter and guenter still manage to procure bits and pieces of cloth with which to construct a second balloon for their nail biting escape to freedom. the film also features a heartwarming and effective soundtrack by the late jerry goldsmith.

a real surprise. not exactly family entertainment from "disney". some violence, lots of tense moments, and a great story, based on fact. the theme of "night crossing" is, determination wins. never losing sight of their objective, two east german families risk it all, in their daring balloon escape to freedom. the story is both harrowing and heartwarming. time is not on their side. the east german police are closing in and the outcome far from certain, until the very end. if you are looking for a good evenings entertainment, that contains no nudity, and limited violence, then i highly recommend "night crossing". it is pure entertainment. - merk

the movie night crossing captures the feelings experienced by the vast majority of east germans during the period 1961-89. i lived in west berlin during most of 1967 and travelled through the wall into east berlin on a weekly basis. why? excitement, crossing a border into a soviet governed country, experiencing the smells and the feel of east germany, which is why night crossing is excellent, it captures that very feeling, and it is exciting. i was arrested by the vopos in checkpoint charlie and accosted by a man in his leather coat and dark glasses i am led to believe was stasi. when i watch the movie i can smell cheap diesel and cooking oil, i can see the outdated vehicles, the drab clothing the public wore and the lacklustre produce in shop windows. it brings back memories of realising just how lucky i was to live in a free country. in 1988, i toured the ddr from east to west, north to south. east germany had changed little since 1967. the trabants, constantly breaking down, were still the main mode of private motorised transport, the shops still featured nothing much to tempt me, uniforms were still commonplace, but the people, the ordinary people were open and nice once you had gained their trust. watch night crossing, it's as close to the truth as any movie you will see on divided germany, even closer than two other favourites the spy who came in from the cold and funeral in berlin.

from producer/writer/golden globe nominated director james l. brooks (terms of endearment, as good as it gets) this is a really good satirical comedy film showing behind the scenes in the life of a news reporter/anchor/journalist or producer might be like. basically jane craig (oscar and golden globe nominated holly hunter) falls for new reporter tom grunick (oscar and golden globe nominated william hurt), but correspondent aaron altman (oscar nominated albert brooks) also has strong feelings for her. the network prepares for big changes, and sparks will fly with all members of the studio. also starring jack nicholson as anchor bill rorich, moonraker's lois chiles as jennifer mack, mrs. doubtfire's robert prosky as ernie merriman, school of rock's joan cusack as blair litton, peter hackes as paul moore, christian clemenson as bobby, robert katims as martin klein, ed wheeler as george wein and stephen mendillo as gerald grunick. the comedy is subtle but strong, the romance has it's moments, and it is certainly a believable situation film. it was nominated the oscars for best cinematography, best film editing, best writing, screenplay written directly for the screen and best picture, and it was nominated the golden globe for best motion picture - comedy/musical and best screenplay - motion picture. it was number 64 on 100 years, 100 laughs. very good!

"broadcast news" is directed by james l. brooks (terms of endearment, as good as it gets) and has a great cast, including william hurt, albert brooks, and holly hunter. everyone gives a good performance, but they're all too unlikable to really care about them.some parts of the film are really brilliant, such as the prologue, and the short scenes with jack nicholson. the main reason it doesn't entirely work, is it's a film that relies on the characters being amusing rather than amusing things happening to them.you could consider it nothing more than a drama, but it's often too silly to be successful there as well. still, the script makes it worth a watch. certainly not for everyone.7.0 out of 10

i say sadly because if you see this movie now, you realize how low our media has sunk- all the warning signs are in this movie.it's a great film, i think the last great james brooks film, but others may disagree. it has rich characters (who are believable as well), great acting, great writing, and although the music got a little cheesy, i even liked that.william hurt has never been better. holly hunter is stunning. and albert brooks walks away with every scene he's in- this triangle of people is beautifully drawn and compelling and made the whole movie soar above it's vital and important topic of the news, and how it's slowly being compromised in our nation.watch this with network for a truly fun and frightening evening.

james l. brook is one of those directors who always seems to take a quirky look at life. he isn't only the producer for "the simpsons," he has some classic comedies under his belt -- "broadcast news" is one of them.although it doesn't match his later effort "as good as it gets," "broadcast news" is still a very clever, funny and witty movie about a television broadcasting station and all the problems they suffer. there's a great comedic sequence of physical humor where joan cusack is running around the building trying to rush a news tape to the editing room in a matter of mere minutes before it is to be broadcast live on tv.this isn't only very truthful in terms of how hectic broadcasting stations are operated, but also a skillful and honest portrayal of human beings.a low-key, subtle movie with good acting (especially from hurt, who i don't always like so much) and apt direction.

i'm sitting around going through movie listings and not really seeing anything i want to see. my appetite keeps saying, "something like broadcast news." that's what i want. something smart and funny, with adult ideas and great acting and writing, and a directorial style that doesn't call attention to itself. this may well be hurt's best performance (is this or the big chill, to my mind): however eccentric, hurt is smart, and to play an unintelligent person without making sure -- wink wink -- the audience knows -- wink wink -- hey, i'm not stupid... well, that's fine acting right there. hunter is note-perfect, and albert brooks is a revelation. (and he can read and sing at the same time!) great, great work.

essential viewing for anyone who watches tv news as it may help to become a little more sceptical, or even cynical. on a personal note i recall taking a course some years ago about being interviewed for tv - what to do, what not to do. the course instructors impressed on us that tv news was a "branch of show-biz". that depressing view, which is probably even more valid today than when it was made, is reinforced by this film. never mind journalistic integrity, what counts is the ability to look good and smile nicely. and make sure you don't sweat on camera.the interactions between the three main characters form the centre-piece, each with his or her own ambitions, capabilities and beliefs. brooks takes these differences and sets them into the volatile setting of a tv news studio, and adds more than a pinch of love interest to the mixture. the result is a complex, if somewhat overlong, portrayal of how we compromise every day in order to meet our ambitions and take others with us. it is always entertaining, although the final scene was, perhaps, unnecessary given everything that had gone before.

excellent movie about a big media firm and the goings on both on and off camera. covering several years, the film centers on 3 upwardly mobile, young hopefuls, all striving for their place within the corporation. well written dialogue, flawless acting, and a riveting story made for 2 hours of solid entertainment.

i'm not here to tell you "armored" is kubrickian, hitchcockian or fellini-esquire. nope. referenced directors are more like don siegel ("charlie varrick") and walter hill ("the warriors"). those two helmers didn't fool around with niceties like putting women in their movies. no skirts need apply. they unapologetically made guy movies. guns, lots of guns. men met violent death with a twitch of the jaw. their movies were like a sap to the head. you want a friend? get a dog."armored" is so a guy movie. dueling armored trucks? bloody gunshot wounds? exploding money? if that doesn't get the lizard part of your brain excited, then stay away.at 88 minutes, "armored" is all muscle without an ounce of fat. we meet six security guards who drive armored trucks, three per truck. the six, led by matt dillon, scheme up a fake hijack involving two trucks. their mission one day is to deliver $42 million from the federal reserve (i think). the idea is to drive both trucks to a warehouse, stash the cash, then stage a hijack. sure, the cops will suspect them, but if they stick together they'll get through it.trouble is, one of the six, played by columbus short, is a holdout. at first. but he faces eviction. and he's the guardian for his messed up younger brother. he needs cash bad.matt dillon cajoles, pleads, persuades the holdout. no blood on anyone's hands. a clean getaway. all good, no bad. you'll be rich forever. blue skies smiling at you ...right.everything goes to hell, of course. it's one damned thing after another and the stakes keep going up. and it almost all happens claustrophobically inside an abandoned warehouse somewhere in los angeles. in fact, the movie goes out of its way to project a backdrop of industrial urban decay. i happen to like industrial urban decay.kudos to matt dillon, who plays the top bad dog. he goes from charming to disappointed to frustrated to outraged to totally effing insane in the course of the movie. love that guy.also, credit is due to the menacing, throbbing, blistering and totally sinister electronic soundtrack by john murphy. i am guessing he's heard a few tangerine dream records.also, it's surprising that this is a pg-13 movie. i caught one  one!  f-bomb in this entire movie about violent tough-guy robbers. on some level, i like that. take the kids.the director is nimrod antal, a hungarian who made a fine noir set in the budapest subway system called "kontroll." screenwriter is an out-of-nowhere guy called james v. simpson.a lot of the people in this movie are just starting out. i am willing to bet the esteem given to this movie will rise as time goes on and these filmmakers advance in their careers.

i was geared up to not like this movie, and the first 10 minutes or so did nothing to allay my fears. it starts off with 2 high school gangs squaring off against each other with bad kung-fu. a scenario found in countless other korean films. ho-hum. add the fact that the story was written by the same guy who wrote "he was cool" (which was barely passable) and, well, i thought i was in for a nondescript 2 hours.but don't give up so quickly! "a romance of their own" was directed by tae-gyun kim, who also did "volcano high" (which i thought was loads of fun). anyway, "romance of their own" soon takes a turn much for the better. a high school girl, just having moved to seoul, finds herself in the middle of attention from two prospective suitors. each guy has his own merit, and it is not clear which one (if either) would be the right pick.what follows is not your usual teen love triangle. the emotions are complex, and while you may not agree with certain choices or actions as the film develops, you can certainly understand why the characters make them.the movie asks questions of the characters and the audience. who does one choose? at what point is one obligated to even make a choice (and is it unfair to one if it seems he is being strung along)? after you (or your heart) has made a choice, how do you react (and how *should* you react) when new information comes up that sheds new light on the situation? there is one scene, near the end, that is very subtle but perfectly captures what i think would be a real-life reaction instead of over-the-top "movie reaction." the subtlety is in a character in the background of the scene. recent events and revelations have left him confused and emotionally overwhelmed. basically, he doesn't know what to make of things. instead of having him "act out" something, or look all gape-mouthed dumbstruck, he just stares off at some fixed point unable to react or say anything at all. it's like someone just pulled the plug on him. his reaction rang true to me and i appreciated the scene.like most korean films, there is a mix of action, bravado, slapstick, and melodrama. korean films often take abrupt turns (see, "sex is zero" for a great example), which can be quite a shock for the uninitiated. go ahead and initiate yourself with this one. like it, love it, or hate it, i think most viewers will be able to relate to and appreciate the characters' actions and reactions.

let's face it.this movie is incredibly cliché, as korean romance dramas and movies go. first of all, there's a pair of long-lost siblings, one of which falls in love with the other. second, there's a not-so-popular girl and two gorgeous, popular guys who fall for and fight over her. third, one of the characters suffers from a tragic disease, which, eventually, takes his life.still, i like this movie.without the right actors, this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel. but because the actors fit the roles perfectly, the movie is engrossing--i honestly couldn't stop watching. kang dong won, despite his pretty face, gives an awesome, heartrending performance, not to mention lee chung ah and jo han sun, plus all the supporting actors.i'd definitely recommend this movie to everyone.

i watched this because a friend told me it was damn good, and i watched a video on it, so i was really into watching it. i watched it, and, damn, the fighting scenes are really good. if the guys can't fight like that in real life, they sure fooled me. there isn't as much fighting as i would like, i have to say, but the fights that are in the movie are pretty spectacular. they don't show much, but you can tell it's violent and cool. but there's also the plot, that goes around a love triangle between the main characters, though it's a bit twisted. tae-sung is a carefree guy who seems to love getting into trouble, as well as fights. he's the leader of his school, and is the rival of hea-won, who's the leader of his own school - a bit of a playboy, hot-headed and a rich boy. then there's han-kyung, a girl with not a lot going for her - her father just passed away and she moved back with her mother, the guy she liked is dating her old friend -, and then she meets hea-won, who goes to her school, and tae-sung, who calls her "nuna" (older sister). eventually, she discovers tae-sung is her brother, fruit of one of her father's affair, and he loves her despite of their blood relation. meanwhile, hea-won falls for her, and takes her as his boyfriend. but she is torn between her boyfriend and her little brother, who confesses her love to her. overall, it's a wonderful movie, but if i was really depressed after the end, and i just couldn't help but think, damn, are all korean movie i watch about fighting/death/depressing stuff/incest?? 'cause that sure was the case with old boy, and temptation of wolves. it's a very good movie, but people have to be ready to cry at the end.

it's nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead, this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little cliché you cant help but like it.i think the story was a little rushed at the end, but extending that would have made the story even longer. superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with mr arrogant, and possibly tied with my tutor friend.it would make an interesting introduction to korean cinema, not as great as my sassy girl, but still good.

glorifying not glamorizing world war ii.we've had quite a few documentary series about world war ii on the regular television programming. without looking up any information in some encyclopedia or film book, it seems that this old memory can recollect most names entirely on it's own.there was crusade in europe,which was the title of the war memoirs of one general of the army and later the 33rd president of the united states of america, dwight d. eisenhower. it told the story of the conflict in europe as viewed by the supreme allied commander.then there was a crusade in the pacific(subject matter self-explanatory),which i don't remember much about. newspaper man/author, jim bishop was the host/navigator of battleline.and there was the excellent winston churchill, the valiant years.* the series was a co-production of the british broadcasting corporation and the american broadcasting company. it first aired in 1960-61 season here in the states and boasts of having richard burton's speaking the words of sir winston.it is the 1952 nbc television network's production of our subject matter today, this victory at sea that wins the cigar, hands down.to begin with, this had to have taken the production several years of carefully and literally sorting through thousands of hours of film. the movie footage referred to here was the official filmed record taken by members of the armed forces of the united states, independent newsreel film, motion picture record of our other allied partner nations,as well as captured axis pictures from nazi germany, fascist italy and imperial japan.once that was accomplished, the various corresponding film had to be cut and edited into a series of 1/2 hour installments. this was done with great skill, being that there were so many scene changes, whether done abruptly or as a dissolve. the look of ever episode appears as smooth as if it had been a single motion picture project.the writing of the spoken word to accompany this finest of real life film was no less amazing and unique. the highly polished and meaningful eloquence wastes not a word and at times even understates the description of action, rather than exaggerating it. the narration goes to mr. ralph graves, who was a talented actor of stage, film, radio and television. he certainly gained a measure of immortality by way of his golden toned voicing of the written episode descriptions.lastly, victory at sea enjoys the luxury of having an original score, both opening theme and incidental music, penned by richard rodgers of broadway fame.(rodgers & hart, rodgers & hammerstein) his compositions are intricate, full, variable and even "classic" in the true sense.the classical arrangement was played by the nbc sympphony orchestra under the direction of robert russell bennett and as a soundtrack record/cassette tape/compact disk, it has been continually available and in demand ever since its first release, 55 years ago! and, really small wonder, for it is this musical score that is so mesmerizing to the viewer/listener. it truly puts the frosting on this cake.* sir winston churchill, the valiant years also had a beautiful and highly memorable original score. this also was composed by mr. rodgers.** we had in additional "ace in the hole" in our house in the person of our father, the late clement j. ryan(1914-74). dad had been in the u.s.navy during the war, being inducted in 1943 or'44. our pop was always on hand to explain and further elucidate any of the situations that were depicted in the series.he and our mother the now 90 year old bertha (nee fuerst)ryan already had my older sister, joanne(1942-90)as a dependant.

this is the most difficult movie i have ever seen...the emotional content is horrific, yet unforgetable. a woman who is accused of being a political activist is brought in for questioning. the whole movie revolves around her interrogation. alan rickman and madeline stowe have intense and powerful roles for which they deserve oscars for their performances.

the film deals with universal themes, mentioning no specific country as its context: it could happen anywhere--and has, in substance if not form. those concerned about 1st amendment issues, censorship, et al--but don't want to be bored with lectures--need art such as this to illustrate, dramatize, teach, inspire.rickman is certainly an under appreciated character actor; he shines in this film, showing off multiple acting talents that you must see (i have yet to see him give a bad performance, though, even in not-so-great films). stowe gives perhaps her best performance (and proves that she possesses one of the most striking pair of eyes in hollywood)--in two words: stunning, convincing.the set design perfectly matches the situation, in function and mood. the sound editing heightens to appropriate effect. the total contrast conveyed through the animation sequences is a perfect symbolic device-and the welcome and only respite to the bulk of the story's necessary venue. the script is tight and essential, with engagingly dramatic-yet realistic-dialogue (i.e., as it might be and ought to be). perhaps the most amazing aspect to contend with is the fact that 1) this is the director's first time out; and 2) he is the writer. in one phrase: a tour de force--with three recommendations: see it, own a copy, see it repeatedly to fathom all its secrets and grasp all it genius.

this little two-person movie is actually much bigger than it looks. it has so many layers. i've watched it over and over, and always pick up on something new. i am amazed at the depth of the acting, and i feel if this movie had gotten wider release that there would be no question that alan rickman is a major star

the good news: the director is reportedly committed to the cause of amnesty international and eager to deliver a solid message about the freedom of expression and the evil of oppression. the plot is distinctly original and the actors are two of my absolute favourites. the not-so-good news: 'original' is not everybody's buzzword when visiting the movies or video stores. also, noted critics like mr maltin and roger ebert have dismissed the film as a genuinely failed attempt to convert a play from stage into cinematic form. if i remember correctly, the title is taken from the fairy tale stowe's character has written and which has made her a possible subversive and suspect person in the fictitious place where the story takes place. her dreams are dangerous to the government, represented here by rickman as the intense, manipulative interrogator. since those two people are virtually the only ones appearing in the film altogether, the director is in for a real challenge in keeping the viewer's attention. in the end, i found the whole thing fascinating. not flawless and definitely not for everyone, but rewarding. it's nowhere near a masterpiece like kieslowski's 'a short film about killing' or as explanatory as 'dead man walking'. but if you're into those films or any of costa-gavras political thrillers, you may appreciate this one as well. just don't expect any overexplicit sermons or eyefilling action sequences.

this is an amazing movie and is very clever at using the few actors and sets. it is also very shocking - the physical and psychological torture (both explicit and implied) is mixed with calm and even humourous stretches. so the horror is always unexpected, and brutal. i'm not soft, but this would have to be the most shocking film i have ever seen. the message of this film is definitely delivered with a sledgehammer. this is the film i will always remember both actors for.

this 1955 heist film follows tony le stephanois, recently released from prison for theft, as he undertakes the robbery of his life. he teams up with his old heist buddies and they bring in an expert safe-cracker, cesar from milan (played by jules dassin, who also directed. he only directed because he had been blacklisted as a communist in the u.s. and couldn't work in hollywood.) the brilliance of this film is the 1/2 hour during the robbery. during all this time, there is no dialogue and no music, only the muted sounds of digging through the floor or drilling the safe. this increases the suspense and draws you in. they get away with several hundred million francs worth of jewels, but a jewel offered to a dancer by cesar brings their haul to the attention of a trio of brutal brothers. they set out to get the stash for themselves and bring misfortune in their wake. great heist/gangster movie, but i prefer j.-p. melville's films in this genre.this movie is like some lemonade i had last night. i had gone to a caribbean restaurant and the lemonade was made with sugar cane juice instead of sugar. it also had a lot of ice and was heavy on the lemons, leaving it fairly sour (which i like). the sugar cane juice imparted a subtle, slightly more mellow taste to it than actual sugar, and the ice made sure it was cold and refreshing as i sucked it down. 7.5/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies

american expatriate jules dassin makes an award-winning french gangster film. the plot involves tony the stephanois, a hoodlum just out of prison, who takes his band of thieves on a $240 million jewel heist. unfortunately, his ex-wife's relationship with a notorious gangster named grutter, an italian safe-cracker named cesar with a weakness for women, and the missteps of his own friend jo cause the successful heist to turn into a bloody race against time as grutter holds jo's son hostage for the cash in typical "crime never pays" tragedy fashion.the "rififi" in the title is explained in a song to mean slang for basically violence and sex, and the full title, "du rififi chez les hommes" means roughly "some naughty in the house of men", which is pretty much where the fatal flaw of the characters take place. leave it to a gangster film to place most of the emphasis on the missteps on the women, but this time jo's wife gets the last laugh (if you could call it a laugh) when she predicts "all of you are just going to kill each other." the characters aren't the most sympathetic and the women are mostly weak, but dassin still builds an extremely well-crafted suspense film out of them as they pull off a heist that requires the utmost quiet, hide the goods, and then attempt to survive what basically becomes a cross-country cat and mouse game. in the mix are some very amazing photography and a fine attention to detail in editing, leading to a pacing and visual experience that well overstates the otherwise generic plot. it's not only easy to see why this is held as a classic, it's also easy to see why it's among the top 250 on the imdb: it's suspenseful, visually magnificent, full of sex and violence, and maintains that classy gangster attitude we film buffs like so much.

there are not many films which i would describe as perfect, but rififi definitely fits the bill. no other heist film has come close to it, before or after. the plot is simple, but engrosses you. it never ceases to amaze me how absolutely gripping the film is every time you view it. you care for all the characters, even though they are bank robbers, because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and flaws. it's hard to imagine any other actor besides jean servais in the role of tony le stéphanois. when the members of the crew are each talking about what they are going to do with their money and finally get to tony, his answer and the expression on his face says it all. while the 30 minute heist sequence is the most famous part of the movie(and rightfully so)the film actually gets better afterward.the director jules dassin knew what he was doing when he decided to not have any music during the heist scene or the final shootout, but instead inserted a great climactic score during tony's final ride towards his destiny. to think that if dassin, an american director, had not been blacklisted in hollywood and forced to work in france, this masterpiece of cinema would never have been made the way it was. it certainly wouldn't have been as good if it was made as an american film during that time. it was absolutely horrible what dassin had to go through, but he did achieve his greatest work because of it, to the benefit of all of us. i'm just cringing at the thought of the upcoming al pacino remake. most heist films since rififi have already borrowed from it in some way or another. there's no reason to remake this masterpiece other than money. leave the classics alone!

you can take the crook out of the joint, but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint out of the crook. we've seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before (and since): in movies like bob le flambeur, elevator to the gallows, touchez pas au grisbi, the anderson tapes, etc. too many times to mention. what helps make this one one of the more notable is (of course) the heist itself, which plays out wordlessly in real time, and the demeanor of the lead. bogart would think twice before crossing this guy. the ironic ending is perfectly suited to this story (it almost demands it). all around, one of the better films noir.

it's a mystery to me as to why i haven't caught up to this masterful 50s caper film  turned brooding noir until now, but i'm certainly glad to report that it didn't disappoint. i haven't seen any of jules dassin's american films for several years but based on this i'll probably be going back and re-watching "brute force" and "night and the city" quite soon.jean servais, a name unknown to me but a face rather familiar in its world-weariness and coldness, has recently completed a lengthy stay in prison and as is the way in these films (hey, there wouldn't be a story otherwise) isn't coping well with the straight life. an opportunity presents itself: an easy multi-million-dollar jewel heist that can be done at night with no fear of discovery by a few men. the taut filming of the robbery, half an hour of total silence, is what people most remember about the film of course, and indeed it's pretty remarkable; but i liked the half-completed location of the final shootout, once the robbery has gone sour thanks to the big mouth of one of the thieves; the excellent portrayal gritty sides of paris in stark black and white; and servais' channeling of both eddie constantine and humphrey bogart in his spare but brutal performance.perhaps it's a bit too sentimental in the end, but this is one of those classics that really does live up to its reputation just as pure entertainment even if what it has to say about the human condition isn't exactly deep or thought-provoking; george auric's at turns modernist, romantic, and jazzy score is another highlight.

i have been wanting to see this since my french teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago. perhaps the long wait was worth it, since the criterion collection dvd restoration is impressive.in its outline this movie follows the time-worn script: a quartet of men diligently plot a difficult heist of a bank vault, the heist takes place, a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all. even though the heist footage is transfixing, it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film. this film separates itself from the typical heist movie by giving us insights into the personalities of the characters and their motivations - its plays as much as a drama as it does a thriller. relationships play a big role and a kidnapping is tacked on, giving us two movies for the price of one.john servais plays the idea man tony le stéphanois (always referred to as "le stéphanois") with such world-weariness that he could have just stepped out of a camus novel. tony has just recently gotten out of jail and resists re-entering the life of crime until he has a highly unpleasant interaction with his ex-lover (who has taken up with another man) where, as punishment, he physically whips her with a belt. thankfully that scene occurs off camera, but you are not likely to forget it. after that sobering event, since there seems little hope of reviving that relationship, tony meets with two of his old partners in crime, jo and mario, and decides to join them in one last big heist. they enlist the services of cesar, an italian safe cracker - played by director dassin himself - and we are off to the heist.the heist goes off without a hitch. but cesar's womanizing bent is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal for all concerned. however, we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer he has fallen for, since there is a brilliant set piece where she performs a sexy and cinematically inspired nightclub act - it has to be one of the most memorable scenes from any noir film.it is established early on that tony has a close relationship with jo and his family; in fact jo's son refers to him as uncle. i think it is partly to help jo's family that tony agrees to the heist. the ending scenes, where tony saves the life of jo's kidnapped son, partially redeems his more brutal and amoral actions. but only partially.

the fact that after 50 years, it is still a highly watchable movie, says a lot about it. it is more intelligent and interesting than almost all recent movies of the same genre you can find, and has a certain endearing feeling of innocence to it. i am not a big fan of this type of movies, but i could watch the whole thing without being bored, which makes it a good movie to watch with someone who does not necessarily share your taste in films. i liked the black and white palette, the excellent casting, the clever heist scene that keeps you guessing about what trick they will pull next, and the ending like everyone else. watching the heist sequence makes one realize the power of silence, which is unfortunately so underused in today's cinema.

i heard they were going to remake this french classic in 2007, and i see it is in development for 2011. this will be a shame, as hollywood kicked writer/director jules dassin out because of the infamous blacklist. they should not have the right to remake any of his films.i love "caper" films and "film noir," and this combines the best of both.tony (jean servais) gets out after doing a nickle, and after he beats up his old girlfriend (marie sabouret), he plans a big score with his friends mario (robert manuel) and jo (carl möhner), what makes this a great caper flick is the attention to detail in planning the robbery. you see that reflected in the george clooney vegas capers. nothing is left to chance.the caper goes off great but grutter (marcel lupovici) sends his sons, robert hossein and pierre grasset after tony and the gang. after blowing it with mario, they kidnap jo's son. lots of bullets fly before it is over.a great film by a great director. the standard by which other caper films are measured.

in order to pull off a job like this caper in rififi (e.g. the score and its opines), one has to have nerves of steel. this one apparently demands and commands it. jules dassin is the master.i was on the edge of my seat throughout. it deserves to be better known, even though it was not at the time of its release in 1954, due, one supposes, to the director being blacklisted in the hypocritical hollywood of its day.i would recommend this film to anyone who has not has the pleasure of seeing it.i cannot give it enough stars.

after seeing naked city and night and the city (which is still my favorite dassin) i was more than excited to watch his "masterpiece" (o-word criterion) rififi.now i am a little bit disappointed about the story.so i have at least these five questions in my mind:1. in the final countdown louis grutter shot from the inside a house the main character tony le stéphanois. he couldn't know if he is still alive or not, but he didn't care about it and ran directly after it outside the house (with the money) to reach his car. so of course tony wasn't dead and shot him. big questionmark.2. in another important scene the specialist in safes cesar gave directly after the robbery as a present a diamond ring (which was a part of the robbery) a woman which was working for louis grutter in a night bar. stupid, because before this character wasn't that stupid. and of course louis knew directly that tony planned the jewel robbery. small questionmark.3.after the gangsters behind louis grutter murder mario ferrati and his wife,tony and his best friend joe planned a revenge against louis gang. at the same time they don't care for the security of joe's wife and his five years old child. of course louis gang kidnapped the son. cheap and simple.4. the perfect heist: of course this is the best 30min. long scene in the whole plot, without any word spoken in the whole time, but was this a perfect heist?? comparing with other movies which handle with this theme i could only smile when for example tony was taken a fire-extinguisher to banned the alarm. also too simple.5. the grutter gang went to the house of mario, because they knew (however....) the jewels will be there. then they murder mario and his wife. and then? they are not searching for it! no. they ran directly out of the apartment. and more. they not observing the apartment after it so tony can go after a while (which was the same day) inside to take the jewels. big questionmark.over all: it's a good movie. because of the brilliant 30min silent heist scene. because of the very good cut (the end scene in the car through paris is stunning) . because of a very good actor called jean servais. because of this black/white fever you will get while watching it. because of some other reasons too other user wrote about, but please don't tell me this is a stunning story.

a recent re-issue of the french crime film (original title 'du rififi chez les hommes'), with its famous 20-minute silent jewel heist sequence, now comes in the us in a gorgeous new print from the criterion collection with improved subtitles and some extras. jules dassin was an american (born julius dassin in middletown connecticut) who was forced to make films in europe because he was blacklisted. rififi was well publicized in the us and did well in art houses. later dassin became a lot more famous in the us for 'never on sunday' (1960) starring his wife, the greek actress and political activist melina mercouri. (greece was again glamorized and popularized for americans and others with anthony quinn in mihalis kakogiannis' 1964 'zorba the greek', which was even a big hit in cairo.) the new rififi dvd includes a recent interview with dassin. i did not previously realize that one of the main robbers, cesar the milanese, was played by dassin, who stepped in when the original actor became unavailable. he's one of the most memorable characters, a dandified italian safe cracker who speaks no french.although this classic has all the trappings of french film noir--the black and white twilight world of well lit apartments, shiny black cars, men in suits, the nightclub scenes, including a dramatically filmed and lit title song performed at the club, the stony faces and the gauloises in hand or mouth--i don't think it's as atmospheric or has quite as distinctive a style as melville's films do. but there's the mesmerizing robbery, which still holds up today as a tour de force. it goes like clockwork, with a fine sense of craft and teamwork among the robbers. some nosy cops are efficiently dealt with. things quickly go wrong after they go home and distribute the loot when one of the players gets sloppy and gives a dame a ring with a million-dollar bangle in it. has there ever been a heist film whose perps lived happily ever after? it's the wordless heist sequence that guarantees this a special place, and dassin, an american director who had an unusually varied and exotic career, deserves full credit for that. he took a novel so conventional he was going to reject it, and added some key elements that make it special. in the event, he couldn't pass on doing the adaptation: he needed the money too much. jean servais, who plays the lead character tony le stephanois, was an actor rather down on his luck. his grim face is perfect for the role. he was later to play the lead in dassin's he who must die (1957), which used french actors in greece for a political tale. 'topkapi' is a somewhat disappointing 1964 caper film (it pales compared to 'rififi') that also got us distribution. it does have a good setting, but it's wasted, gone all bland and bright and prettified. of dassin's post-hollywood oeuvre, 'never on sunday,' with its catchy theme song and charismatic heroine, is the popular choice (and won best film at cannes 1960); 'he who must die' the political choice; 'rififi' the genre choice. an odd piece is his 'phaedra' with mercouri and tony perkins (1962). purists of tough-guy hollywood genre work would eschew these and favor dassin's early films, which include a prison drama, 'brute force' (1947);a cop flick, 'the naked city' (1948); and two hard core noirs, 'thieves' highway' (1949), and 'night and the city' (1950). personally i tend to like french noir and american neo-noir spinoffs better than the original american noir source material--hence my enduring fascination with 'rififi'. but dassin is rather unique in having not only made hollywood noir but then going over to paris and producing a memorable example of its fifties french derivative.

this is one of those movies that has everything in it. i don't think i would get tired of seeing it. hopefully more movies like this one will be made in the future. the casting was perfect in all respects. in a sense, the song sung by engelbert humperdink "i never got to say goodbye", is the song come to life. you will most definitely laugh and cry throughout the entire scenario for sure. i'm just surprised that i had never seen it before this past weekend. i think that it's positively worth seeing, and your heart will be glowing. it would be nice to cuddle up with your "honey"; sip a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy being in the presence of each other. there is so much heart and emotion at times you honestly don't know where to turn. you will know exactly how the character feels. true family expression is available all the way through. in fact, at times you'll even think you are part of that family or they a part of yours. see it!

i watched this movie again yesterday with a 20-year-old intern from my office (ok - it was the quiet day after thanksgiving) and we both loved it. i love the unique plot, david duchovny, david allen greer, and the way the dog keeps waiting at the door. isn't part of each of us just like that dog after someone we love dies?i also love the old folks at the restaurant - they remind me of some of the older people around southern new england, where your ethnic group is a very important topic of discussion. and i love the wedding at the end.minnie driver is great in this movie - and bonnie hunt should have won an award for everything. bonnie - make more movies!

i love this movie!!!this beautiful, charming love story drew me in immediately with its lovable characters and heart-warming romance. i became so attached to the characters throughout the film that i felt as if i knew them personally. the storyline is very enchanting, and it brought me to tears in several touching moments. duchovny and driver have a very cute, chaste relationship that you can't help getting involved in. this one's worth watching more than once, and showing to all your friends. i'm just curious, why wasn't this a big hit?i give this a 10 out of 10! spectacular film! (and this is coming from a guy who thinks that 9 out of 10 movies aren't even worth watching.)

i saw this movie with my mother, and i loved it! it was such a sweet story, (not to mention funny because of the supporting cast!) they never make movies like this...ever! my favorite part is when grace(minnie driver) finds out about her boyfriend's wife's death, and that she has the deceased wife's heart and she screams, "what was god thinking?" i do believe everyone(no matter who you believe in) has thoughts like that once in awhile. but while it's very sappy, it just might make you believe in true love and destiny for once and for all.(sigh)the comedic timing between bonnie hunt and jim belushi will just make you crack up(especially in the aforementioned scene, it's terrible, and yet so funny!). they make a good pair, and i hope to see them again in something soon. 10/10 stars

i love this movie! it has everything! bonnie hunt did a fantastic job co-writing, directing and co-starring in this film. david duchovny is just plain hot. and minnie driver is as cute as ever. combine all that talent with david allen grier, carol o'connor, robert loggia, joley richardson, and jim belushi you have a oscar worthy movie! i'm surprised they didn't get one. if you haven't seen it, go rent the dvd, watch it once then put directors commentary on...bonnie hunt is fabulous!

my two daughters (ages 11 and 13) and i were lucky enough to see a screening of this movie last night. we were all pleasantly surprised to see how entertaining and funny this movie was. david duchovny was very appealing as the male lead and minnie driver gave her usually competent performance. some of the scenes are laugh out loud funny - especially one scene minnie driver has with a fellow "transplant" donee. i liked the fact that it was a movie that i could watch with my children and i wasn't embarrassed by any scene whatsoever. everyone in the movie theater was laughing and enjoying themselves. thumbs up bonnie hunt!

when i saw the trailer for this film, i said out loud to no one in particular "this film is going to bomb." i also said that about the matrix and look at what happened there. now i am not a box office guru by any stretch but i usually have a pretty good gut about what is going to be good and what is going to really suck. in this case i was blinded by my complete and utter apathy towards david duchovney. let me put it to you a different way: i don't like his as a person ( from what i have read of him in interviews, he is unbelievably pre-madonna like and he is full of himself considering all he has done is x-files ) or as an actor. playing god was a really poor film but he came off thinking that for some reason he deserved big bucks on the big screen. but i am happy to say that even though those things may still be true about the man, return to me is delightful and has it's heart in the right place. bonnie hunt has directed a beautiful story and she has told it with class and grace. this is one of the most romantic films i have seen and even though it may seem to be a bit sad and maudlin in its premise, give it a chance and you will be hooked.it has to be said ( and this pains me to do so ) that the reason this film works so well is because of the story and the cast. duchovney and driver are so wonderful and believable here that i honestly wanted to cry along with them. there is one particularly powerful scene when duchovney comes home after his wife has died and he slumps down on the floor of his house. as it always does, the family dog looks to the door to wait for his wife to come walking in. she doesn't and with his shirt collar still stained with blood, rob ( duchovney ) tells him that she is not coming home, ever. he then calls the dog over to him and they seem to share a cry together. the dog lets out a small moan and then rob cries. and this is one of the most realistic moments of pain i have ever seen in any character in any movie. you can feel his pain and at that moment i forgot i was watching an actor that i generally don't like, and i felt that i was watching someone that i knew moarn the loss of his beloved. this is powerful stuff.another strength of the film is the supporting cast. bonnie hunt has combined an ethnic melting pot of irish and italian characters that share a common bond. they share a pub called o'reilley's italian pub. that is a delicious name all by itself. and heading the diametric scale of clashing cultures is carol o'connor and robert loggia. these are two proud old men that love their homeland but love their granddaughter and niece ( i think it is ) respectively. and that is the character played by minnie driver. this scenario is ripe for comedy and hunt doesn't miss anything here.bonnie hunt and james belushi also share some funny moments together as the middle aged married couple and belushi gets top points as he accepts humility gracefully and shows off his ample keg of a stomach for laughs. with his family consisting of three or four kids, there is very little time for him and the wife to have quality time. and again hunt handles this with perfect elegance. this is a wonderful story of finding true love, knowing how lucky you are to have true love and the power of friendship and family. return to me is a wonderful romance and even though i still don't have a great admiration for david duchovney, i have to admit that he was perfect in this role and i could not picture anyone else playing his character. he was sensitive and believable and the movie was good because of him, not just because of him, but he sure added to the flavour.if you are a sucker for a good romance and you want a good cry, then this is the film for you. 8.5 out of 10 i will see anything that bonnie hunt puts out with her in the director's chair.

i just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it. it still makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate.i almost wrote bonnie hunt a letter to tell her how much i love it. david duchovny's grief scene is so flippin real!!! minnie driver is so natural and honest. my favorite line is when duchovny says "i miss elizabeth but i ache for grace". oh man! i'm crying just thinking about it. also... bonnie hunt and jim belushi are sooooooooooooo the perfect chicago area couple!! i know them i swear! i'm related to them i'm sure. this movie is in my three times a year rotation!!! i'd watch it once a week but i'm afraid i'd get too used to it!!! i always want to make it a special day when i watch it!!

return to me is a movie you will want to own. it is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages. the story, though seemingly impossible, aspires to divine intervention when a man looses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife's heart. david duchovny and minnie driver give warm hearted performances as the designated to-be-lovers who meet by chance. but the real story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial. carol o'connor as minnie driver's grandfather, is authentic in every scene. bonnie hunt as the friend whose wit and encouragement underlines minnie as a 'sister' is funny yet warm in the scenes especially with james belushi as her husband. classic scenes and writing makes this story so enjoyable and touching to watch over and over again. thank you for making a movie that demonstrates families and friends as close knit caring people who love each other through difficult times.

as a non-theist im not going to comment on the great mans theory which changed the world 150 years ago. safe to say, science is based on evidence, religion is based on blind faith. nuff said there then.the film was produced by the bbc, and to be honest, it could quite easily have been shown on television. while the acting is superb, the film itself isn't really worthy of a full blown cinema release. that said, if it reaches a wider audience this way, then so be it. but i have seen many period style dramas on bbc tv and they were well up to the finished standard of this. just don't expect too much of a big budget thrill ride when going to see it.in some ways, i found the movie almost going out on a limb to apologise to religious fundamentalists. while it attains a good sense of tension the whole way through, i couldn't help wanting it to get to the publication of the origin of species much quicker than it actually did (you'll wait right until the end for that). and it seemed to dwell much more than i was ever aware on darwin's struggle with himself and his wife emma, portraying him almost as some kind of insane lunatic at times - which is hardly true. there are many other errors and facts missing in relation to the real story of the lead up to the publication of origin too, but the whole premise of the movie focuses almost entirely on the difficulty darwin faced domestically with the book, and a small portion on the death of his beloved daughter annie. this gives the film its most moving scene, where annie passes away as she asks one final time to hear darwin tell her the story of a captive orangutan which died of pneumonia. though, you'll probably feel a bigger connection with the primate in that scene than with darwin's daughter.with the early controversy apparently surrounding the movie in the usa it will work well to promote it and ensure many more people will get to see it. but to be honest, there is actually very little in it that insults any mythical godhead. its hardly headline news about a theory that has been around 150 years after all. but, as fundamental christians (and many other religions which we're all well aware of) like to wave a placard or two whenever possible, i guess this movie is as good excuse as any. personally, i cant see what all the fuss is about. but maybe they're just monkeying around...

last year was the 200th anniversary of charles darwin's birth, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of "the origin of species", so it's fitting that jon amiel's "creation" got released. the movie focuses on the period of darwin's (paul bettany) life while he was writing his famous work, and the mild strain that it put on his family life.i guess that the movie overplayed darwin's tension with his religious wife emma (jennifer connelly), and his guilt over his deceased daughter annie, but i still like the thought of darwin's theory working like a karate chop on religious dogma. as it was, the us was one of the last countries in which "creation" found a distributor, due to the creationism-evolution debate (yes, it's still going on).all in all, this isn't a masterpiece, but i recommend it the same way that i recommend "inherit the wind". i hope that one day, the creationism-evolution debate won't be an issue. if this film helps put the debate to rest, then more power to everyone in the movie! also starring martha west, jeremy northam, toby jones and benedict cumberbatch.

as this movie unfolds you start to feel the conundrum of human existence. if you carry with you questions, inner wars, unsolved puzzles about the meaning of life then you will feel this movie with every morsel of your body. charles darwin begins a war with an utterly predictable ending. war with god. his theories resemble the fact that god has nothing to do with mankind, has nothing to do with the amazing world that we live in. savage, harsh, ironic and chaotic, this words surround the mind of the character thrown into an universe of material truth, who slowly pushes hope for god, out from his mind. nevertheless, the movie as charles darwin, still sees wonder and beauty beyond god in the universe of infinite evolution.

i have read reviews of this film that found it 'disappointing' and 'confused'. i am at a loss to understand why this should be so. from the beginning i found it a remarkable experience and a complete joy to watch.spoiler: the opening titles overlay a beautiful visual of the evolutionary process, and this introduces the story with a serene and sweeping style. the film isn't about the process itself though, it concerns charles darwin's struggle with his conscience, his love for his wife, his deceased daughter and his search for truth.the appearances of his daughter are the manifestations of a tormented mind that knows it has "killed god". the daughter is an adult, making adult comments about his work and torturing darwin with personal doubts. was he in some way responsible for her death? husband and wife in real life paul bettany and jennifer connelly give truly wonderful performances as charles and emma darwin, as does martha west as annie. bettany's size and awkward gait give darwin's character a genuine sense of reality, whilst connelly seems very comfortable with her english accent and occasionally somewhat severe persona.it's easy to misunderstand the times in which this film resides. the grip that religion had on society and the inner struggles that a man like darwin must have endured to seek the truth in what he witnessed. science and religion have always been awkward bedfellows and although it didn't cost him his life, as it did with so many earlier men and women, science put a barrier between husband and wife, fact and faith. this film portrays that barrier supremely well.i give creation ten stars, because i think it's beautiful, profound, superbly well acted and a genuine, no-extraneous-frills-required look at one of the world's true geniuses.what seems obvious to everyone today (well, almost everyone... see bill maher's wonderful "religulous") was hidden for millennia. the truth, once it was discovered, was undoubtedly painful for many. creation examines that pain, and the realisation that we are all that we possess.a wonderful cinematic experience.

i believe the reason this movie did not get the recognition it deserves is because of the many misconceptions of darwin, pro and con. i would say the real man is depicted here without sterility. he is what he is. although the movie is but a snapshot of the man the technique of storytelling expanded his life far beyond the years touched on in the movie. this is deep movie, a pondering of modern life and the way we think, and can provoke a study into the man whose thoughts (and other who used him) have certainly affected our lives. there are some movies that the historical context is so great that it is the primary job of the actors to stay out of the way. the history carried the day and the actors did their job. good work to them, i say.

real-life husband and wife paul bettany and jennifer connelly star in creation, which recounts the period of charles darwin's life prior to the publication of "on the origin of species" in 1859, his infamous, world changing tome on evolution and natural selection. darwin's research created an enormous rift, a schism between the believers of his day and scientists. he was said at the time to be going to war against god, and even to have "killed god".the film revolves around darwin's life with his wife and four children. jennifer connelly is excellent as his extremely devout and loving wife. a revealing scene at the beginning when she leads the dinner table in prayer and charles fails to say "amen" is foreshadowing of what will follow and of the stark differences between the two. she is convinced that he will be eternally damned and bring misfortune to their family by rejecting god.darwin is torn between his strong love for his wife, her faith and his even stronger reason. there are beautiful moments of him observing animals, dissecting their behaviors and the sequences that make up their lives, explaining phenomenons of selection to his children, the first born, annie, having a very morbid curiosity. we see him interacting with england's first orangutan, jenny, playing with it as if it were a child, deciphering her every look and action. annie, the eldest child, later dies and charles becomes haunted by her death, having been closest to her. in my opinion this part was too long, bizarre and drawn out. i did not like the trippy scenes where he seems to be losing his mind and is pursued by the ghost of his daughter, shouting and ranting. although charles thinks that his wife blames him for her fatal sickness, she very poetically says: "the truth is, if i knew then what i know now, i would marry you tomorrow". their bond is solid and unbreakable despite tremendous differences of belief. when charles finishes his manuscript he hands his wife the final copy, telling her she can burn it if she does not agree. she stays up reading it nights on end and finally presents him with a package, the book ready to be sent to its publisher. in the end, reason and perhaps love as well, triumph, as he makes an accomplice out of his staunchest adversary.it is fascinating that darwin received a full christian burial at westminster abbey, proof that his ground-breaking ideas were seen as controversial of course, but were already then recognized as vital knowledge for the advancement of the human race. the movie definitely draws heavily on darwin's family life, its joys and its troubles. i happened to like this aspect but fabio said it was like watching a documentary on, i quote, "hitler's passion for ping-pong". this is true in some respects and i can't disagree with his desire to have learned more about charles darwin's theories from this film than we do. it remains nevertheless a well executed and flawlessy acted period drama. my rating: 7 fabio's: 7 total score: 14

paul bettany did a great role as the tortured father whose favorite little girl dies tragically of disease. for that, he deserves all the credit. however, the movie was mostly about exactly that, keeping the adventures of darwin as he gathered data for his theories as incomplete stories told to children and skipping completely the disputes regarding his ideas.two things bothered me terribly: the soundtrack, with its whiny sound, practically shoving sadness down the throat of the viewer, and the movie trailer, showing some beautiful sceneries, the theological musings of him and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends as they prepare for a battle against blind faith, thus misrepresenting the movie completely.to put it bluntly, if one were to remove the scenes of the movie trailer from the movie, the result would be a non descript family drama about a little child dying and the hardships of her parents as a result. clearly, not what i expected from a movie about darwin, albeit the movie was beautifully interpreted.

this is definitely a touching movie, and a great expression of charles darwins personal struggle. the movie is not only about his struggle to get his book "the origin of species" published, but also his relationship with his oldest daughter. his daughter was at start the only person in his family to approve of his views, something that she as well had to pay for. een more than him at times.now, this is not an evolutionary propaganda film, as a matter of fact i think it managed to stay very neutral. a hard thing to do in my opinion. of course it does not condone the way the characters was treated by the church, quite the opposite actually. if you need me to use the big words to shed light on this film; it will be liked by deists and atheists alike, but goes away from theism. the movie talks about evolution, and that's it.paul bettany as charles darwin was incredible. of course we all may think of darwin as that old man with the funny beard, but this movie centers around the man in his late 20's, early 30's. jennifer connelly (emma darwin) is great as always, but the actor who impressed me was martha west as annie darwin, darwins daughter. definitely on of the best child actors of the decade. the story is about darwin and his daughter, and it is beautifully acted.except for a few jumps in time that was momentarily confusing, the production of this film is pretty flawless. some scenes were darwin observes nature is just marvelous, and is almost like taken out of a high production national geographic documentary.i must admit though, i'm not quite sure of why they chose "creation" as the title. i doubt it is an irony, the movie is too respectful for that. well, i'm sure there's a meaning too it, just don't let it scare you away. i give this movie a 9/10. this is truly a great tribute to charles darwin, and please give it a chance.

wow! fantastic film in my opinion, i wasn't expecting it to be this good! i was captivated from start to finish- it's a very well made and educational film that really gives us a fascinating insight into the trials darwin had to go through in order to convey his ideas to the world, chronicling his life as he writes "origin of the species"; fighting both personal demons as well as the ignorant society of the time in order to do so. he struggles hard with his mind, body and soul as personal matters get to breaking point and even his family seems to slip away...whilst the rest of the world stand against him as he knows that his findings literally shake the very foundations of their lives, culture and meaning of existence. it's a subtle movie (not over-exaggerated in any way in that typical hollywood way, this is a bbc produced british film) yet thankfully very powerful in meaning and this is thanks to the amazing well directed scenes as well as the superb acting by bettany. connelly acts as more of a light supporting role but i did enjoy her in this and she's as good as to be expected as always, her chemistry alongside her husband was definitely strong and endearing, you could feel the connection, and their real-life husband/wife bond definitely shines through their performances. but the star of the show is definitely bettany and he does a brilliant job, a very touching performance- i both understood and sympathised with him as he battled his own degrading health and impending "insanity" to try to understand what he has uncovered and come to terms with what it all really is and means as he found his thinking contradict his feelings, and found himself losing it all including his wife who of course was a firm believer in religion and a strict christian whilst he was in the realm of science, two worlds which could not see eye to eye, so their relationship was at stake too.anyway- a really very good, well acted emotional drama and dare i say i did shed a tear during the tragic climax which was truly heartbreaking as well as beautifully poignant and moving. the film is symbolic and very intellectually artistic as well, in fact i can't wait to watch it again as there was a lot to take in first time round which i missed. easily one of the best films i've seen this year.

i saw this film on 19sep2009 at the cambridge film festival. the beagle's only in a couple of short flashbacks, the whole thing is about darwin's life from 1841 to 1859, when he was ensconced in kent with his growing family, 200+ pages of origin had already been drafted and he was wondering whether to complete the book. the script is based on randal keynes's book annie's box (annie, charles's daughter, died when she was 10). it is mostly a family drama, but does include sex scenes - however, the participants are married, both on and off screen. not too exciting, not much science but a well-made film that's pleasant to watch and pushes the right emotional buttons. a bit of a romantic weepie, actually. i suppose the conclusion is that you can be an agnostic free-thinking scientist from an atheist family background and still be an emotional romantic as well as an excellent father. some of the characters and darwin himself state or wonder whether he "killed god" but the viewer is able to doubt that. what is beyond doubt, given the deadly struggle for survival and the web of predation on the meadow-bank (well-known before darwin and completely uncontroversial) and the failure of darwin's prayers is that the idea of a kind, providential god who loves "his" creatures is untenable. i really cannot see many americans objecting to it very much. some may have problems with the title, which is probably the most controversial thing about the film, or with the fact that bettany does not have horns, a tail and a pitchfork.

i saw the world premiere at the toronto international film fest, this is a great film.real-life husband and wife paul bettany and jennifer connelly star as charles and emma darwin in the midst of their struggle through the writing of and decision to publish "origin of species". their consideration of the ramifications it may have for their family and the future of humankind are conveyed in such a manner that one suspects only an off-screen couple could achieve.jon amiel (who gave a heart-felt introduction) and john collee do and excellent job of bringing randal keynes' biography to life. they created some very poignant and human moments, great cinematography and sets and a generous helping of tongue-in-cheek about the still divisive theory of evolution.the surprise star is martha west who plays annie darwin, the character around whom much of the story unfurls. she plays the precocious young girl to a tee. if this performance is anything to go by her star should be on the rise.all in all a great film, and although it is a period drama the issues that drive it are still very much alive today.

simply put, paul bettany and jennifer connelly were remarkable. the movie is less about the raw science of darwin's beliefs, and holds the focus very strongly on his relationship with his family, primarily his wife, emma, and daughter, annie.toby jones gives a wonderful turn as thomas huxley, the great defender of darwin's beliefs, and the rest of the cast is up to the task of sharing screen time with bettany and connelly.but it is those two who carry the movie. their real chemistry is apparent from beginning to end, but develops transcendence as darwin grapples with his demons. the scene where darwin relates the ending of the story of jenny, the orangutan, to his dying daughter, annie, is utterly gripping. the world premiere audience at the tiff was spellbound. bettany's performance will be recognized as one of the year's best in short order. equally magnificent is connelly's work playing the religious wife of a man who, in huxley's words, "killed god".the film moves slowly through the entire spectrum of darwin's grief, relishing every detail of bettany and connelly's acting.brilliant.

this sitcom was a big crowd puller in the year 1984-1985.that was a time people could see deserted streets in most of the over crowded indian cities whenever there were sitcom on indian television screens. all this was the result of the setting up of television relay stations across the entire indian nation. this was one of the essential elements of the modernization of indian television network strategy adopted by the late indian prime minister indira gandhi.it was also continued by her son rajiv gandhi. this series provided clean entertainment which a large majority of indian television audience watched on their black and white television sets.a funny thing about this series is that it was sponsored by an indigenous company dealing in ayurvedic products. a couple of days ago i caught sight of some episodes of this series but the overall laughter equation was missing. this goes on to prove that may be with the ever changing passage of time entertainment material lose their charm and hold over people's minds.

i was a huge fan of this series. yesterday i watched it again on dvd. i was apprehensive about whether laughs would come or not? but in a few episodes i was laughing hysterically and some episodes were good. acting wise rakesh bedi(raja} & satish shah is brilliant whereas swaroop sampat is plain bad but i think she gets the job done. maybe a better actress could have been used in place of her. this series shows what good, clean comedy is.if this series were to air in the current year i would have given it 9/10. and to think that this series is almost 25 years old and its comedy is still good. i give it 10/10. i would highly recommend this series for watching on dvd.

i saw this title again on shemaroo. i also asked my nephew who was 17 to watch the same with me. i am 35 and he is 17. he liked it and i did too. it still is funny, a little childish a times but still very clean entertainment. satish shah is hilarious in multiple roles. this sitcom would still fare better than many of the recent serials on tv. but obviously some people obviously like mundane fares that come out today. it would have been nice that shafi inamdar would have continued for all the seasons. he is no longer alive today. i would wish if someone could list all the episodes here.who can forget the lines "yeh kya ho raha hai" "what a relief" "kaat daalu boss" "vyavhaar hai vyavhaar" "30 years ka experience hai"and the title track yeh jo hai zindagi, teaching us to live the life as it comes and take enjoyment out of it. the life of common people.i still like this sitcom. it may not seem as funny at times but certain episodes are still hilarious.

one of the best sitcoms to run on indian television along with dekh bhai dekh and idhar udhar. great acting, well paced and an extremely amusing script made this a truly memorable series. the fun filled opening montage (sung by none other than the inimitable kishore kumar)gave a very accurate picture of what one could expect. i used to borrow it from my local video library years after doordarshan had stopped airing it. i wish indian television would revert back to serials such as these rather than the asinine saas-bahu soaps and reality television which is all its good for these days. anyone who's found of genuinely good comedy ought to go and get this series. you'll might also enjoy a couple of pakistani sitcoms such as ups and downs and aik aur aik which are certainly comparable to india's best.

i am a firm believer that a film, tv serial or any form of art should and would be fully appreciated once the timing factor- as to when written, produced or conceived-should be taken in to account.yeh jo hai zindagi is one such series. i remember watching it in the mid-80's on tv and the re-runs via the video cassette libraries during early 90's. and laughing out loud and being addicted to it. that made me buy the full series dvd set and surprise of surprises- the comedy and the moments of the good 'ol days simply fell flat for me. even the very popular "30 years ka experience" "gulaaaab jamun!" and "sofa cum bed" did not invoke the kind of mirth i thought it would. the timing factor: for the 80's, this was the showstopper. the main event. the mother of all tv comedies. and it worked during the age and time! perhaps the same cannot be said right now, but nonetheless, watching the dvd did bring back pleasant memories.i wish the seasons with shafi inamdar and swarup sampat were longer. satish shah has been un-believably good as the heart of the show, with equally effective support cast of farida jalal, tiku talsania and the bengali neighbours. rakesh bedi hams throughout.all in all, an experience that will bring back memories for those who saw it during the prime times, might not appeal to the younger viewers or first time watchers!

it's taken years for cult icon bruce campbell to get this project off the ground - but he finally has, it's here - and what a great piece of schlock entertainment it is! looking at the plot; it sounds like two things. a great base for a very silly b-movie, and a shameless excuse for bruce campbell to what he does best - evil dead ii style slapstick humour, and this film delivers on both counts. the man with the screaming brain is comic book nonsense all the way through - but there's some really great scenes, and it's almost impossible to be bored with this movie. bruce campbell wrote, directs, produces and stars in this film - and while it's not quite citizen kane, it has to be said that this is an achievement for the man most famous for battling off his own hand in a woodland cabin. the plot follows american businessman william cole on a business trip to bulgaria with his girlfriend. the trip goes awry, however, when he, his girlfriend and his taxi driver end up dead; thanks to the same woman. mad scientist stacy keach is on hand to merge cole and the taxi driver's brains into one; and we've got a cult flick on our hands.the first half hour or so is entertaining and features a few laughs; but once the main plot point has been executed; the movie really picks up. bruce makes best use of the scenario in all kinds of silly situations, from changing his clothes in a waste bin, to deciding (with the taxi driver in his brain) what to eat in a restaurant. the humour is mostly of the slapstick variety, and anyone who enjoyed evil dead ii (which should be anyone who's seen it), will no doubt enjoy this too. it does feel like campbell is playing to his strengths a little bit too much with this whole project, but if you tuned in and didn't see bruce doing what he does best, disappointment would ensue. besides that, no disrespect to the man; but he's never been the actor with the greatest range. despite being lots of fun; the movie isn't great, as it gets a little bit too silly at times; and there's a whole sub-plot with a robot that i didn't like; but overall, the man with the screaming brain is a film that we, sadly, don't see too much of nowadays. the film is an all-out, no holds barred, b-movie; and it deserves respect for that if nothing else.

now, the sci-fi channel original company has made some pretty crappy films (house of the dead 2, all souls day, etc.) but when you leave the job entirely to horror master actor/writer and now director, bruce campbell, you get one of the best damn made for tv independent horror films ever made! i normally hate these movies, in my previous review, house of the dead 2, i could not believe how horrible the film was! but somehow i took a liking for this film, a very good liking for this film. the violence is good and so is the black comedy in the film and i recommend you get it, a true bruce campbell masterpiece! well, since there is only a few more lines left i can say whatever i want about this movie: ijajkasif jhjdj nxd fnehsd fhncfnfvhs djkealjwsns.uhhd sishsnhf ahcnakdjh hndchjndnh jacnd hchjnnhw jhj nashdnfhcka fhnkhad sakasdadj fjkdfa

its really been a long time since the last time somebody created a movie such as like this on. a so called b movie. maybe it was not a great movie, but it is fun to watch, classic bruce cambell, it has its good parts, funny ones, disgusting ones, even artistic ones. ******spoiler ahead*******----------------------- --------------------------------- --------------------------- -------------the part where his wife as a dummy-robot-avenger is about to die, i don't know about you, but it made me feel so weird, so sad and disgusted in a good way. i compare this scene with the scene form the fly 2 where his dog as a monster dies. makes you think oh my god.---------------- --------------------------------------------- ------------------------------ --------------------------********no more spoilers********* if you are a bruce cambell fan, you definitely wanna have this movie in your collection. if you are generally interested in movies, you might wanna. just think that the movies target is to make you smile, gross you out(don't worry not that bad though) and make you have a good time with your buddies. attention, i said buddies, not possible future girlfriend.

ok, well, no one in their right mind(s) would pick up a movie titled "the man with the screaming brain" and expect it to be serious. this is an outrageous b-movie, and that means a truly hokey plot, strange characters, clichés, over-the-top action, and oh-so-cheesy one liners. for that odd segment of the population (including myself) that gets a kick out of that kind of thing, this is a gem.the acting is better than expected. stacy keach is embedded in his character. bruce campbell brings a spirited, convincing performance. his physical comedy skills are truly impressive in this movie and hearken back to the "evil dead" films.

being an israeli jew of naturally sarcastic nature as well as a lover of different and independent cinema, it always gives me pleasure to see a film that takes a view on the holocaust that's sensitive and respectful while also being original and unusual. while i haven't read the book  or, for that matter, heard of its existence prior to watching the film  and therefore cannot, like some other reviewers, comment on how they stack up in comparison, everything is illuminated gave me great pleasure, and i can certainly comment on that.to label everything is illuminated a holocaust film would be to do it great injustice, even though it is undeniably about the holocaust. so would labeling it as a comedy or a travel film, although it's about a journey and is as exceptionally funny as it is moving. everything is illuminated is about jonathan safran foer  played to minimalist perfection by elijah wood, in the most impressive dramatic performance i've seen him in yet, with a poker face that shows nothing and reveals all  a young american jew, and an obsessive collector of family heirlooms and historical artifacts, who travels to the ukraine on a journey to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the nazis. it's also about alex, his tour guide through the ukraine, and alex's grandfather. what's fascinating about these characters is that in the beginning of the film they look like comic relief to balance out the melancholy nature of wood's character; but both alex and his grandfather go through fascinating changes throughout the film, and turn out to be at least as important as jonathan. in fact, boris leskin's as the grumpy, self-declared blind grandfather turns out to be the finest dramatic performance in the film.aside from the surreal nature of the film and the characters, the beautiful mix of original acoustic music and russian folk music, the sensitive cinematography and the chilling contrast between the beauty of the landscapes and the horrors of history, what made everything is illuminated a powerful and moving experience for me was the fact that from alex and his grandfather we get a very different and original viewpoint on this painful subject; several excellent films, such as the grey zone and downfall, have already given us the point of view of the lower-rank nazis who are presented as human beings who aren't necessarily fully aware of the moral implications of their actions but are caught up in the reality of the war. everything is illuminated presents a point of view rarely treated before: alex's point of view is that of a young man who was born many years after the war, who sees it as hardly more than cold historical fact, who finds himself having to face up to the horrors his own people  and maybe his own family as well  were capable of. the change in alex's attitude  and his grandfather's  towards jonathan, towards the holocaust, and towards the jewish people in general, makes the film a fascinating and original study in character development.everything is illuminated is a terrific directorial debut for actor liev schreiber, and one of the most original and unique films of 2005. it's a highly recommended viewing experience, especially or anyone interested in the holocaust and world war ii.

let me start by saying that liev has gained a ton of respect from me after seeing his directorial debut "everything is illuminated". anyone who has read the book knows how saturated the story is with nonsensical and hilarious vocabulary by alex along with countless flashback scenes and crazy dreamlike sequences. liev took all of this and made it work. the movie itself is great - the soundtrack, the performances, the cinematography - it all works. there is a lot of story missing about the town and its inhabitants, but there's only so much you can do with an indie, so this part of it didn't bother me too much. it's just disappointing that not a lot of people will see this movie or even know that it exists because of the lack of promotion that came with it. i didn't even know it was in theatres. i didn't know when the dvd came out. you'd think that since frodo baggins was one of the main characters, somebody wouldve at least released a commercial for it. i had to see the trailer on my "paradise now" dvd (released on dvd in the spring of '06) to even know that it had a "fall of 2005" theatrical release date. haha - sad really.anyhow, if you stumble across this review somehow because one of your friends read the book and loved it or saw the movie and are recommending that you see it - take my advice and watch it. it's a very good experience.8 out of 10.

excellence seems to come rare in hollwood today. many consider just two out of the year's best picture nominees to display sense to the movie industry. and in 'everything is illuminated,' the mark is hit directly.the film initiates its brilliance with the beautiful setting-the-scene entry. from the beginning, you receive a sense of warmth and true family connections and relations between one and another. and also, the cast is introduced perfectly. for elijah wood's character, jonathon, his sensibility is expressed through holding his dying grandmother's hand. and for the character entitled alex, it is easy to see his life in his perspective - the true ukrainian rock star. with the cast illuminated at first, the story slowly eases into our minds as jonathon decides to venture to ukraine to meet the woman believed to save his grandfather, thus the entire family. and from there, the story movies slowly, yet kept at a fast pace from the contrast of tear-dripping drama and laugh-out-loud humor included in scene-by-scene, every scene.although the movie itself is rather awarding, there are several complaints from other sources commenting about liev schrieber's inaccurate adaptation of the jonathon safron foer novel. personally, i have never read the novel. but any movie, especially this movie in particular should not be graded on whether the storyboard of the film matches the storyline of the book, but rather how the major concepts from the novel were expressed and exploited through the film. just because it may be far-fetched from the novel does not mean that this film is no longer a must-see - it still is.throughout the film, new information inundates the audience's mind very slowly. some of these thoughts are never answered; and in fact, the second half of the movie refocuses its entire topic and reason of travel through ukraine onto something different, yet rather similar to the original intentions of this film. the film does however leave you on a satisfied note - yet to the weak-hearted souls, a tear may be dropped. and throughout the film. to the saneful people with common sense of humor may just have to laugh from alex and john's fun and ongoing conversations.i would recommend this film to several different types of people: to those whom enjoy movies that share the genre drama-comedy, for those who have an interest in family connections, and to those whom have an interest in holocaustic subjects. and to those insane people who find slapstick as hilarious comedy, this movie is not for you. and for you whom think that this is a seriously funny and absolutely ingeniously funny film, you are wrong; this film shares comedic moments and dramatic sequences. and to those whom judge a movie based on their likeliness with its corresponding novel, you may or may not enjoy this film, but this film should be taken for much more than whether or not it was close to the book.all in all, 'everything is illuminated' is an ingenious piece of work that will enlighten anyones' hearts.

i went to see this because i have some friends in the ukraine. but the film moved me beyond what i expected by turning out to be a perfect blend of belly holding laughs (alex's strange use of english) situational comedy and heaviness bordering on depressing. i loved the range. it made me want to jump in to an old car and hit the road for the ukraine. alex (hutz) plays his guide part perfectly and provides a great counterpoint to elijah woods' poker faced earnestness. the film shows the positive side of humanity when ppl of differing cultures can bond and do the right thing when they feel the sincerity of the situation, even when they went into it with preconceived notions and prejudices, and how this can open up doorways into deeply buried memories. there is a lot in this film.

"everything is illuminated" is like viewing a fine piece of museum quality artwork. it absolutely inundates the emotions through a very broad spectrum. jonathan safran foer is played with candor by elijah wood. he is in search of his paternal heritage in the ukraine. his travels bring him in contact with alex, played very well and with extreme humor by eugene hutz. his grandfather is the most emotional tie to this film and he is aptly portrayed by boris leskin. if one finds little humor in the human characters in this cinema, then one has only to turn to mikke, a real dog who is called sammy davis jr. jr. by alex and his grandfather. they also call him the "seeing eye bitch". the cinematography is spectacular. the colors are a very important part of the patchwork of the film. it is a film worth the time and emotional investment.

the movie "everything is illuminated" comes from first-time writer-director liev schreiber, adapting jonathan safran foer's first novel. the book was ambitious and sprawling, its magical-realist elements and vivid use of language seemingly impossible to represent on screen. the movie, wisely, attempts less. while the end result is not as wildly original as the novel, it's still an accomplished movie about a strange eastern european road trip, or, as one of the characters would have it, "a very rigid search."that character is alex (eugene hutz), a young ukrainian man who loves american pop culture but can't seem to get the english language straight. nevertheless, his grandfather (russian actor boris leskin), who runs a tour company catering to american jews, convinces him to serve as a translator for jonathan (elijah wood). jonathan is investigating his family history, and specifically trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the nazis. more than one family secret gets revealed during their quest.the movie's jonathan (not to be confused with the author of the novel) is a semi- kleptomaniacal weirdo who steals his own grandmother's dentures to add to his collection of "family things". wood's quiet, wide-eyed, earnest manner works very well in this role. hutz makes an impressive debut as the loose-limbed, easygoing alex. his malapropisms are hilarious, but he is also able to pull off the character's growing self-awareness. the dog mikki is very funny as the demented sammy davis jr. jr., and one of the few movie dogs i've ever seen that isn't cloyingly cute and precocious."everything is illuminated" eventually puts the holocaust on a human scale, asking us to remember it not as a general event, but as millions of specific, small tragedies. reminiscent of a european movie, it also ponders the effect of past events on present-day young people like jonathan and alex. with its original perspective, strong performances and some very striking visuals, "everything is illuminated" is great work for a first-timer, and hopefully schreiber will continue to direct movies.

one of my favorites non-mgm musicals, it's a classic!> rita hayworth is in top form, her beauty leaps out of the screen. gene kelly shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph. phil silvers is the perfect second bananas, and eve arden injects this movie with a lot of class. the structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why, in this era where major broadway shows come from the movies, cover girl hasn't been adapted to theatre.

in brooklyn, the nightclub dancer rusty parker (rita hayworth) has a simple but happy life dancing in the mcguire's, owned by her boyfriend danny (gene kelly). rusty, danny and genius (phil silvers) have a ritual on friday nights: they order oysters in a bar, trying to find a pearl. the life of rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the vanity magazine. she is invited to work in a huge theater in broadway, whose owner proposes her. she loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style, missing the love of danny and her old friends. 'cover girl' is a delightful romantic comedy, very naive and having magnificent parts, such as the beauty and talented rita hayworth dancing, singing and acting; gene kelly, specially in two scenes, dancing with himself and with rusty and genius on the street; the songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectaculars. danny, the character of gene kelly, is almost nasty with his chauvinist behavior. rita hayworth surprised me with her talent: i found her amazing in 'gilda', but she is stunning in 'cover girl'. in accordance with the information on the cover of the vhs, 'cover girl' was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot, giving continuity to the story, instead of just being 'thrown' in the movie. my sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent gene kelly festival and they loved 'cover girl', therefore i dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations. my vote is nine.title (brazil): 'modelos' ('models')

rita hayworth lights up the screen in this fun, fancy and delightful musical starring gene kelly. rita plays nightclub dancer rusty parker who has dreams to be a successful broadway star. unfortunately, her career is getting no where in danny mcguire's night club. when one of her fellow dancers says she's going to enter a cover girl contest, she decides to follow her dreams and enters. she reminds the publisher of her grandma, who he was deeply in love with many years ago. but when she finds this success, her boyfriend is not happy about it.i had never seen rita before this, and i am so glad i did! she has such a scene presence and is a very good actress. there are some good numbers in here, not the best of any musical but they are melodic and good to listen to. one thing i didn't like was gene kelly's character. he should have supported his girlfriend! but anyway, that's perhaps the only criticism i have about this movie. cover girl is a glorious, fluffy film - perfect escapism. not everyone's ideal movie, but a wonderful movie nonetheless, due to rita hayworth's star power. great movie, truly impressed.

i really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it. rita hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous. although a musical, i thought rita hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well. as far as her dancing, i think she was excellent. even betty grable pretty much endorsed rita's dancing in this film as she commented that rita danced rings around her own dancing and let's face it, betty grable was an excellent dancer. the cinematography and vivid colors are also noted. rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but she's also in love with her mentor played by gene kelly. does she leave kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love and broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever? you'll have to watch the film to find out!

a fantastic musical starring gene kelly and rita hayworth. he owns a nightclub where she dances. she's no star yet, but she gets a big break when she's chosen as a cover girl for vanity, whose owner was actually in love with her grandmother. when he sees the resemblance, he picks her right away for a contest his maganzine is running. hayworth's newfound fame at first works wonders for kelly's club, but her star rises so quickly and so high up that his grasp on her begins to falter. this isn't the most original of plots, but the two leads really make it work. it also helps that the screenplay is great. kelly's not yet at his peak, especially his peak as an actor. his dancing, however, wow. hayworth is the star, but kelly claims the film's most memorable moment as he dances passionately with his own reflection. it's obviously a take-off of fred astaire's shadow dancing in swing time, but i think kelly one-ups it, which is hardly believable. in fact, this has got to be the most amazing dance sequence in film history, save perhaps the finale of an american in paris several years later. the rest of the songs are also excellent, and the musical numbers are even better. too bad rita didn't sing her own songs (well, she may have a couple of them, as her singing voice seemed to be different sometimes). her dancing is wonderful, as is the rest of her acting. it's hard not to love her in anything. she's really one of the few truly beautiful women from the classic era. not plastic like many of them; no, you can really see the warmth in that woman. her smile is so disarming. phil silvers has the role as kelly's best friend, and he is also very funny. the trio of kelly-hayworth-silvers is obviously the kernel which became the kelly-reynolds-o'connor trio in singin' in the rain eight years afterwards. one of the biggest musical numbers in the film seems almost completely pilfered with the "good morning" number in singin'. i do think singin' in the rain is the better film, as cover girl is a little rough around the edges. this roughness, though, just adds to the charm. there are aspects of this film that beat singin' in the rain, and even an american in paris. for instance, the central relationship is more emotionally involving. instead of the dominant older man chasing the little girl (leslie caron and debbie reynolds were just teenagers, after all), we have a very nice relationship with two people who seem more like equals. there is no chasing around - an aspect that does unfortunately turn a lot of the best musicals a little sour, you have to admit. kelly and hayworth are a couple from the start, and when that begins to fray, i really felt it. 9/10.

almost missed it. while visiting friends in philadelphia sometime in the early 1980`s, i was channel surfing after everyone else went to bed. it wasn`t just bogart he was obsessed with; but rather the entire era of those old flicks those of my age know so well. add to that a plot liken to the maltese falcon - where so many different characters were interacting with sacchi - and you have a piece of art as far as i`m concerned. about ten years later it appeared on tv and i taped it. >

it was a sweet, intro for the most intelegent sailor soldier, sailor mercury. it consisted with a new "in croud", merciurios. he, at the beganing wrote a love letter to ami, which would be starltling (of course) and, now, ami thiks he is a chibi-einstien, and he is attractive (he ended up looking like umino (melvin)). this was a halarios (expesialy minako's "it's no skin off my neck" scene (hot!)) well, i really like the bishojo senshi sailor moon series, i personally think its the best anime ever!, but, this movie was nice, funny, but not as adventurios as sailor moon r- it was more like the "s" movie. i saw this @ sailor moon univewrse, with real player, and it was pretty good. (over all)

well i don't know much about anything, but i sure liked this film. in short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. in other words, it was everything it set out to be.the story is set around a girl's first love, (as the title suggests) and i certainly should warn you: expect nothing challenging or provocative in terms of the subject matter here. i mean, it is a children's cartoon. it's really just a simple story, but it's told well, and it holds your attention well.in the end: it's short, it's funny, it's cute, it's simple, it's good.

this is one of my favorite movies ever! along with casablanca and cannibal holocaust, this is near perfect cinema. rex allen narrates this wonderful tale of a cougar who just needs a little loving. contains action, adventure, suspense, comedy, and riverbed chaos! see this movie if you have to kill to do it!!! you will not find a better cat picture anywhere, with "cat from outer space" coming in as a not so close second. charlie's performance is magnificent. even includes animal cruelty and intense logging! gotta love disney, for all moral failures!

this has got to be one of the better post-astaire musicals made by columbia. produced by arthur schwartz and directed by vet charles vidor, this picture really put gene kelly on the map and cemented rita hayworth's reputation as cinema's premier female dance partner. she plays a bit of a dual role here since she performs contemporary 1940s numbers with gene and co-star phil silvers, but also puts her in the role of her grandmother, a nightclub performer in the late 19th centry.the music should also be singled out because this was i believe the last project that the legendary jerome kern (most famous today for "old man river" and "smoke gets in your eyes") worked on, and his lyricist was the equally legendary ira gershwin. they supplied a score that is full of charm and characterization. the music for the historical sequences is especially noteworthy because it's so perfectly styled in the early 20th century idiom that was kern's original period. it's a bit like picking up a record from one of your favorite bands from the 1970s and hearing them do a song in the original style of that time.the story is pretty inconsequential, which is fine with me because this film is as close an approximation as you will ever be likely to see of the 1930s/40s golden age of broadway musical comedy style on film. even the 1940s war propaganda aspects of the film's music give it extra charm as the talented trio sing "make way for tomorrow" and even humorously poke fun at america's enemies and use period slang such as referring to "gremlins".probably the most memorable performance in the film is kelly's dance to the "alter-ego dance", which found him arguing with and then dancing with himself as a metaphorical image of the battle of the conscience. this prefigures much of his later work and also stands an effective and memorable scene in and of itself.fans will want to seek this out for various reasons -- kelly fans will see this as a rare chance to see him outside of the confines of mgm with a different set of co-stars and music superior to his usual mgm material. hayworth fans will want to see rita in glorious color at the peak of her fame and ability. and fans of classic broadway musicals will definitely want to hear kern's final score and marvel at the quality of gershwin's lyrics and the compatibility of their styles. this is a definite gem in the crown of columbia's musical program.

a lumberman finds a young cougar in need of help. to young to be on his own the cat soon takes up with the rugged camp workers. nicknamed "good time charlie' his antics amuse everyone at first. his wild nature eventually begins to cause trouble and reintroducing him into his natural habitat becomes an issue. this film is among those wonderful disney nature films that were common in the 50's and 60's lots of action, beautiful scenery and some endearing animal to charm you. these films were not long but included fascinating glimpses into wildlife and the effects of human contact. unlike disney's animated talking animals the animals in these films remained true to their own nature. they also make great travel films for seeing the western states.

this film has not been seen by me in quite a few years. it came on the disney channel in the wee hours of the morning. i stayed up to watch it, and found it even more entertaining than the first time. the story, the scenery and the characters are as good as they come. i know that if anyone takes the time to view this film, they will find it definitely worth seeing a second time. it's very memorable in more ways than one. i would recommend this film to anyone because it is both entertaining and educational for all concerned.s

this is the australian tv series. it is a classic. the stories and actors are excellent. who can forget picker and his gramophone or chet being ambushed? this is cult tv. the australian actors in the series were the best of their day and have immortality in the outsiders. what can i say timeless adventure. the music and song just fantastic. the closing credits starting with the close up of the wheel, then keir sleeping n being jostled around and then the long shot just cannot get much better than that. all 13 episodes are equally solid in the portrayal of the australian myth and i think this is what this series has.it does not matter that the two main characters were from overseas, i think that is the key to the series and why it is so good.

yeah great cult tv series. great atmosphere, top script and good performances make this a class a candidate for dvd release. this is a seminal tour de force of australian tv history and has that unforgettable groovy period piece soundtrack with doug parkinson's gravel and phlegm voice spewing 70's australiana all over your cathode ray box as a amazingly long camera zoom out reveals the religion of the open road in all its antipodean glory. this is a memento from another and not too distant era, and has the proud stamp of the land mighty down under from start to finish in all its raw freedom and gritty grandeur. come on abc! get with the program and release this cool 70's cult baby for all to enjoy - or re-enjoy if you're lucky enough to have lived the dream at the time.

rita hayworth is right there where she should be - as a "cover girl" in this 1944 technicolor film also starring gene kelly, phil silvers, eve arden, lee bowman, and otto kruger. rita plays a beautiful showgirl, rusty, working at a small club owned by the man she loves, danny (kelly). each friday they go out for oysters with genius (silvers), the club comedian. they all hate oysters, but they're looking for a pearl. when they find one, all three of them will have good luck, they believe.rusty auditions and wins the role of cover girl for a magazine - she starts off ahead of the other contestants because the magazine owner (kruger) sees a resemblance between rusty and the girl he once loved, who turns out to be rusty's grandmother. once she becomes the cover girl, the world opens up for her and her dreams of appearing on broadway come true. danny wants her to have her success, but at the same time realizes he's lost her."cover girl" has exuberant dance numbers and songs by jerome kern, with rita dubbed by martha mears. rita is at her best playing both rusty in the present and her grandmother in the past. for such a sexy, desirable, gorgeous woman, she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of domineering men. none of this ever showed on screen, nor did the fact that she didn't want to be a movie star. she is one of the true goddesses and brought everything she did to life. gene kelly is in a serious role here, but gets plenty of chances to dance and sing. phil silvers is very amiable and funny as the in-house comic and best friend.this is a very good movie with no dull spots. the only problem i had is the idea that rusty has to choose between a successful career and the man she loves. when supermodel jinx falkenberg, who plays herself in the film, speaks of getting married, she's warned by her boss not to, that she's too necessary to the modeling business. we're not told if rusty continues with her career or goes back to work at danny's - but all signs seemed to point toward the brooklyn club. why couldn't she have had both? nevertheless, you can't beat "cover girl" for top entertainment, beautiful color, lovely music, great energy, fine performances, and its most fabulous asset, the glorious rita hayworth.

this is one of the best musicals of the 1940s. the glorious technicolor shows off rita hayworth's beauty and spectacular hair. she should have made more movies in color, but then columbia was hardly in a position to splash out money for technicolor spectaculars.rita is a wow as rusty parker - she more than keeps up with gene in some of the most sparkling numbers ever. she also looked beautiful in turn of the century gowns, so she was given a chance to play her own grandmother.the film opens with "the show must go on" - it looks great to me - but danny mcguire (gene kelly) is not impressed. his motto is work, work, work!!! one of the dancers, maurine (lesley brookes) is determined to better herself and is going to audition for vanity's golden wedding cover girl competition. rusty just happens to find herself at the auditions as well. in a very funny scene maurine has just had a so so audition and seeing rusty, gives her a few tips on how to impress the judges!!! "don't be shy and demure - chatter and sparkle". rusty does so with gusto!!!they decide on maurine and go to the show to see her but john coudair (otto kruger) sees rusty - she reminds him of someone from his past. cornelia (eve arden) is still having nightmares over rusty's audition. "whose complaining" features genius (phil silvers) and the dancers, dressed up as working girls - (rusty is a cabbie).john is remembering a long lost love (rusty's grandmother, maribelle hicks) the first time he saw her singing "a sure thing" - set at the races. meanwhile danny, rusty and genius are looking for pearls at their local diner. they then launch into the happiest song of the 1940s (in my opinion) - "make way for tomorrow"."put me to the test" is a spirited song and dance number featuring danny and rusty. in the meantime rusty has been chosen cover girl and danny mcguires' is the place to be seen. lee bowman appears as danny's romantic rival and puts a damper on things. lee bowman is probably the most boring leading man ever - so danny never needs to worry.rusty (dubbed by martha mears) sings "long ago and far away" and it is danced beautifully by danny and rusty. the gowns that rita wears are stunning. travis banton and gwen wakeling designed them. danny wants the best for rusty but is afraid he will lose her. gene kelly is also fantastic in the "alter ego" number where he dances with himself."poor john" is another look back to the turn of the century - it was written in 1906 and is an extremely funny song poking fun at rich relations - hayworth looks gorgeous in an amazingly quaint outfit. look for al norman in both "poor john" and "a sure thing". he was an amazing eccentric dancer, who appeared in several early musicals, including "king of jazz" and "paramount on parade". he was easy to spot.the "cover girl" dance is just wonderful. rita was so talented - beautiful and a great dancer. after a bevy of beautiful models parade through covers of america's top magazines, rusty bursts through in a beautiful gold gown dancing down a ramp to the very catchy "cover girl" song. gosh i just love this movie!!!!highly recommended.

this is a very enjoyable, fluffy, glamorous musical from the 40's. 'cover girl' made rita hayworth (formerly the dark-haired latin senorita margarita cansino) into a bona-fide, all-american star. it confirmed gene kelly's amazing talent as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. it epitomises the exuberance and colour of the musical genre.rita hayworth is great as rusty parker- it is her picture, and her presence is always at the forefront. her singing is dubbed, but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with kelly. i think that rita was highly underrated as an actress- she plays every scene superbly here. gene choreographed the dance sequences (he was basically given almost complete creative freedom here), and his 'alter ego' dance number is amazing. such artistry. the stand-out tunes are 'make way for tomorrow', 'put me to the test', and, of course, 'long ago and far away'. the plot is rather thin, yet it does have a moral. it's about the perils of quick fame and fast money, and how any happiness with only these factors will ultimately be doomed. this will cheer you up, lift you up to your feet and make you laugh.that said, 'cover girl' is not the greatest musical ever produced- it has a number of flaws that must be addressed. one can say that a little bit of phil silvers goes a long way. his character gets tedious rather quickly. however, i was impressed with his dancing ability and how he was able to keep up with gene and rita. another major problem is that too many songs are just not that great. the 'cover girl' number looks fantastic, but i'm not a fan of the lyrics or the singing. 'poor tom' is a huge downer. i think it's one of the worst numbers i've heard in a 40's-50's musical yet. it stinks. the grandmother sub-plot borders on being ridiculous. but that's only my opinion. others may like these elements.still, apart from it's faults it's a very, very good film, much better than most of the product churned out today. the dancing and singing is sublime, the production values are excellent, and it's mood is infectious.8/10.

this is definitely an outstanding 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of charles vidor. rita hayworth, (rusty parker),"charlie chan in egypt", sang and danced with gene kelly,(danny mcguire), "anchors away", danny mcguire owned a night club in brooklyn, n.y. and was in love with rusty parker who was a dancer in his club along with phil silvers,(genius),"coney island", who was the comedian in this picture and also worked and dance together with danny, rusty. otto kruger, (john coudair),"duel in the sun" played the role as a promoter of a cover girl magazine and decided rusty parker was going to be his top model. jerome kern's music is heard through out the entire picture and the song, "long ago & far away" is the theme music for this musical. this film was nominated for many awards and was a big hit at the box office during ww ii which kept peoples minds off of the war that was going on at the time. rita hayworth and gene kelly were instant hits and their career's exploded on the silver screen for many many years. great musical and a film you will not want to miss, this is truly a great classic film. enjoy

rita hayworth as rusty parker is the cover girl du jour--she's one of the dancing girls in danny mcguire's club, the most special one according to danny (gene kelly) and pretty much anyone who comes across her. take for example, vanity magazine magnate john coudair (otto kruger): enchanted by rusty's resemblance to her grandmother maribelle (also played by hayworth in flashbacks), whom he wooed devotedly when he fell in love with her, he tries to relive his youth by fixing what he thinks went wrong between himself and maribelle. he doesn't believe that danny could give rusty happiness, or everything she should be entitled to--he even gets danny believing this himself. when rusty shoots to fame as vanity's 'cover girl', danny drives her away into the ready and waiting arms of noel wheaton (lee bowman). so what happens when danny returns to town with his sidekick genius (phil silvers) in tow, only to discover that rusty is marrying wheaton?as a musical, cover girl benefits from the beautiful score and songs written by jerome kern and ira gershwin, including the oscar-nominated 'long ago and far away' (possibly one of the most gorgeous ballads ever written and beautifully, sweetly sung as a duet by hayworth and kelly), maribelle's number 'sure thing' (the more lacklustre 'poor john' isn't a kern/gershwin collaboration) and 'put me to the test'. the dancing, of course, is top-notch, since gene kelly had more than just a hand in the choreography. it shows in the simplest of dances, for example his dance with hayworth to 'put me to the test', or the joyfully exuberant 'make way for tomorrow' number (performed by the trio of danny, rusty and genius)... which foreshadows the reaction gene's character has to the police cop in the title number in singin' in the rain. kelly especially scored a technological and artistic coup with the 'alter-ego' dance. like its successors in anchors aweigh and an american in paris (jerry the mouse and the 16-minute ballet respectively), this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity kelly brought to the modern film musical: wanting to use the film medium to present dances that couldn't be showcased on a stage, and years before cgi, kelly insisted on dancing with the one person who could possibly match him in talent and style--himself. the number is hardly five minutes long, but it (and kelly's genius) still takes one's breath away, even sixty years down the line. this is the reason i watched cover girl, and if nothing else, this dance is truly worth it.you can tell that a great deal of money was lavished onto cover girl and rita hayworth--not that she doesn't deserve it. witness the scene when rusty hits broadway--the large screen showcasing all the different cover girls gives way to a staggeringly large stage rigged for rusty's entrance. hayworth is indeed one of the most effortlessly beautiful girls on show in the film, and she dances with a style and grace that is almost worthy of kelly. (very few of kelly's co-stars have that honour.) she is hilarious in some scenes, for example her drunk scene when john and wheaton come to get her from joe's.for some reason, however, her performance still lacks the spark of greatness which would help cover girl overcome its general curse of mediocrity. that curse is only lifted whenever gene kelly is on the screen (dancing or no), or when eve arden as john's long-suffering secretary 'stonewall' sidles by with another cutting comment or clever observation. since the film, in the end, belongs to hayworth, neither kelly nor arden can save it as a whole. this isn't to say that the film is bad--it isn't. it's enjoyable, with great songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to look at. but it's just not quite a classic. the dancing is classic though--so watch cover girl for that, and you won't regret it.

"cover girl" is the best musical rita hayworth ever made. ms. hayworth will always be remembered for "gilda", however, the next movie would be "cover girl". the story is great. it is about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes it big in show business. she does it without the help of her talented dancer/director boyfriend (gene kelly). mr. kelly is given the chance to choreograph the musical numbers. the dances are spectacular. it is fun to see phil silvers, a comic, do the musical numbers with ms. hayworth and mr. kelly. the supporting cast is perfect. lee bowman is given a chance to be an interesting third wheel, the other boyfriend.

a good story about rusty parker (rita hayworth) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would have to leave the small dinner theater where she works with danny (gene kelly) and genius (phil silvers). rusty is in love with danny. all three are good friends and every friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl (they never eat them). the story line provides numerous opportunities for songs and dancing. the movie has two questions that rusty must answer: is fame all that it is cracked up to be? and is less really more if you are happy? answering those questions makes the movie. the movie also does a good job of showcasing the talents that all three principals had. never a dull moment!

it took a loan out film to columbia for gene kelly's home studio mgm to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films. cover girl also became rita hayworth's signature film for the gis and their pinup fantasies during world war ii.kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in brooklyn where rita is a featured dancer and phil silvers the comic. of course kelly does a bit of hoofing himself there.hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire otto kruger when it turns out that kruger had loved and lost hayworth's grandmother. in some flashback sequences from the gaslight era, hayworth also plays her own grandmother with jess barker playing the young kruger. you might remember jess barker was the husband of that other legendary screen redhead, susan hayward.broadway producer lee bowman also is attracted to hayward, but he's not interested in nostalgia. he wants her for his ziegfeld follies revue and in fact the biggest number of cover girl is the title song of the film. it's nicely done in follies style.hayworth also gets to sing a sure thing in a gaslight era number and in the only song in the show not written by jerome kern and ira gershwin, hayworth also does an old english music hall number poor john. when i say sing, as everyone knows rita mouths words. singing here is done by nan wynn.the biggest hit of the show is long ago and far away which is introduced by gene kelly. it was one of the biggest hits of the world war ii era and one of the biggest sellers jerome kern ever wrote. it happens in fact to be a favorite of an aunt of mine who with my uncle will be celebrating 60 years of marriage this september. long ago and far away was nominated for best song, but lost to swinging on a star.what really sets cover girl apart and what makes it a milestone film for gene kelly is the two numbers put me to the test and the alter ego number. harry cohn decided to do what louis b. mayer had refused at mgm, to give kelly creative control of his own material. kelly later said the alter ego number was one of the hardest things he ever attempted in his career. in it he dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and intricate. in fact after one more loan out film, christmas holiday at universal, louis b. mayer never loaned out gene kelly for the rest of the time he was at mgm. and he did get creative control from then on.with that dazzling technicolor cinematography and rita's red hair and gene kelly's boundless creativity, cover girl was and is a classic and will forever be so.

when i saw this film, it reminded me of all the greatest dreams i had (mostly filled with robots)i can relate to eledore's problems and i have a similarity to shiro, and this is a great film to watch (if you're a goth who is bitter and eccentric like me!). all in all, watch it before it's out of print!

i just re-watched 08th ms gundam for the 2nd time. it is so much better than gundam wing. i can't wait to get the dvd and see what was edited out of the series. this is great to see the gundams actually move about clumsily through the land. somebody really thought over writing this move script.see this today,.

the 08th ms team features two hopeful romantics from different sides of the conflict. aina, the zeon officer, and shiro, the federal forces' new pilot, meet in a battle in space, throughout the 12 episode series (and one "movie") the two debate their love for each other while trying to come to grips with the war that surrounds them. it features a romeo and juliet romance and unbeatable animation. by far one of the best to hit american shores. suit up!

this gundam series only follows gundam 0083 stardust memory. the story takes place during the same time line as the original gundam in the year u.c. 0079 the time of the one year war, but the mobile suits are designed as new models are and are as a result look more articulate. the hero of the story is a young lt. shiro amada, who may lack any real combat experience but makes up for it with creativity and effort.his life get complicated when he meets aina sahalin a jion ace pilot (the enemy), the to end up falling in love and begin to change their attitudes about the war around them. the other cast of characters in the story are not there for background either, every one in this story has a history to them.there is also another ace mobile suit pilot in this series that can be added into the pantheon of ace mobile suit pilots. right up there with char aznable and anavel gato is norris packard, not the top villain in this series, but his presence give the 8th mobile suit team a hard fight. 3 of them against norris and his single ms-07b gouf custom mobile suit.in conclusion this gundam along with stardust memory is a must see!!

this is how i interpreted the movie: first things first. there was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (taylor) torturing or nailing ben's hands to the wall. however the same cannot be told of the gals. in the end too, u see taylor disappear as he walks. looks like the message there was "there was no taylor". and the whole movie was a figment of imagination of ben. also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as ben. it was taylor all the time. but in real, taylor was ben. if they were two different people, then why was there no scene showing both of them in one frame during the horrific times? but of course before that, u do see both of them together and that cud just be ben's imagination at work. also, when ben was out of jail, the text on screen clearly says that ben's story was unrealistic and there was no such place as he had explained (read mine, cars etc...)even after liz hunter leaves kristy and comes back to find ben, she doesn't find him. why??? because ben (taylor) was out looking for the gals. instead kristy has all the time in the world to check out taylor's (ben) web cam, photos etc...somehow everything sums up to just one fact that kristy and liz, both of them knew that taylor was ben. so, my conclusion is that ben was schizophrenic and the movie where you see him and taylor in one frame was nothing but figments of his imagination. otherwise if there really was a taylor, then they should have found him out given all the detailed explanation coming from ben.

i thought i was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. but at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of aparna sen, i decided to turn up for the movie. going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos i had seen king kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly i wasn't complaining. a great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on shabana azmi and konkona sen sharma's part. shabana azmi a divorcée who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister. konkona sen sharma a schizophrenic(spare me the spelling), who imagines thing all the time. rahul bose also gives a stellar performance. the story is that mithi (sen sharma) is a schizophrenic, and after getting brutally raped on her field job as a reporter, her levels really increase, her fiancée leaves her, for the person she became. in all her world comes down upon her. shabana azmi, her elder step sister, takes care of her, and mithi in her imagination believes that she has been married to her fiancée, has 5 children and they stay in 15th park avenue (which really is a place in new york). the plot goes on as mithi becomes suicidal, as she believe no one believes her and she is being held captive in her home from her husband. as fate would have, mithi and her fiancée meet up when they both are out on a trip. 11 years after the brutal rape, her fiancée has no existence in her real world, she cant recognize him. her fiancée, now married and a father of two children feels it is his duty to correct the wrong he did 11 years earlier and he promises to take her to park avenue. and he does. he takes her to a place in kolkata which supposedly looks like her husband's home. as joydeep/jojo(rahul bose), her fiancée is talking on his cell phone he loses track of mithi. everyone comes looking for her but she is nowhere to be found. she finally gets what was denied to her, her family, her own imaginative family in her own world at 15th park avenue.i must say, that it touched my heart. i myself am now a fan of aparna sen's direction. the camera work is superb. and the quality of performance is spell bounding. konkona sen sharma gives a solid performance as the schizophrenic child. shabana azmi gives another mind blowing role as the divorcée elder sister, who has the load of keeping the family. rahul bose, another neat and quiet role(i don't know why this guy doesn't get big breaks, he has so much potential). lastly aparna sen, she still captivates the audience, even if she is not in front of the camera and behind it. a very well deserved 8/10....

exquisite!! in simple words... both aparna sen and konkona sen seem to understand each other quite well or maybe they both are just too good.this might just be her best performance as an actor and aparna's best as a director. yeah maybe better than mr and mrs iyer. konkona plays the role of a schizophrenic. shabana azmi plays the role of anjali,mithi's(konkona sen's) elder sister. shabana azmi made the best out of anjali's character for she had to play a strong,responsible,arrogant role of an elder sister who had the full responsibility of her family. aparna sen has beautifully crafted anjali's character,a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life,her love for her family.mithi's behavior was'not juvenile at all,for you can expect this from most of indian directors for this role.looks like a lot of research has been done to understand the role of mithi,a schizophrenic. when at times mithi is a normal,sweet college going girl,she also scares you when she is shown ill..both the sides have been beautifully judged and played..believe me it at times reminds you of the girl in exorcist..not that scary though.. overall..marvellous piece of work by aparna sen,konkona sen and shabana azmi...

after mrs and mr. iyer this is yet another very good film by aparna sen(mostly in english). in the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. in this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. as a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on "reality". it is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.mithee the younger sister (konkana sen sharma, the daughter of aparna sen) is suffering from schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister anjali (shabana azmi) . mithee after her marriage with jojo and separation from him believes that she is still with jojo and her five children in 15 park avenue in kolkotta.(there is no such address in kolkotta-it seems there is one in new york) and she is intense in her belief. it is almost like an intense religious belief. ultimately what is reality? in one scene she tells anjali "if i tell you that you are not a professor but only imagine that you are a professor". the open ending reflects this reality. in a supposedly search for her home in park avenue, mithee is lost. the penultimate scene is mithee looking at a group of five children playing and her looking at them with joy of returning to her family and then she is lost. about this concept of reality i am reminded of another film of fifties called harry with james stewart. the protagonist believes that a big sized rabbit (?), called harry is always with him and he is always conversing with him. at the end even the doctor believes perhaps there is harry. what is reality, is it what the protagonist believes or what other believe shabhna azmi dominates the film with her sterling performance as the strong elder sister with undercurrent of frustration. konkana sen sharma gives equally befitting performance as the schizophrenic.yet the film is not as tight as mrs and mr. iyer. there appear to be some loose ends. and perhaps there are too many characters. those who want a closed ending may not appreciate the open ending here. but the ending befits the theme of the film.yet another good film by aparana sen.

from "36 chowringhee lane" to "15 park avenue", aparna sen has indeed traveled a long way. if the first one goes down in history as a débutant's clean sweep the latter will definitely carve a special place as a "mature" film. until you see 15 park avenue you cannot imagine feeling thrilled and moved at the same time. thrilled to see the director's ingenuity and agility in portraying seriously challenging situations and moved by the sensitivity echoing throughout the film. it is not a movie that merely makes you feel 'tchh tchh, how difficult life must be for schizophrenics', but makes you ask a much deeper question about the reality that you see and believe. sen has done a brilliant job in highlighting this supreme fact of our existence that we all are, in some way or other, trying to live in a make-believe world of our own, trying to run after mirages called happiness, peace, contentment. along with the depiction of a delusional mind, sen's magic has brought forth many little nuances of human relationships as they sustain stress and strain. the fact that at times we all lose calm, break down, make wrong choices, be haunted by guilt, behave selfishly and so on, is captured with extreme adroitness by sen. she showed the cruel dilemma which shabana had to deal with all her life, of having to choose between a schizophrenic sister and a normal life with a husband and kids for herself. and in the act of always being beside her sister, always being a strong persona, providing support, making judgments and so on, she unknowingly cut off some of the oxygen that her sister needed to bloom. isn't this a very harsh truth that at times, in an attempt to do the best for someone, we strangle their assertiveness and end up hurting their self-esteem? of course konkona's and shabana's acting deserves laurels as always because had the ingredients not been so good, the dish could not have turned out to be so extraordinary. aparna sen once again made a masterpiece of a movie for those who crave for some "food-for-thought" . bravo !

well its a great work by aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that. well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out. it has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. we all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly.hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways. so when joydeep was discussing with her wife he says that , 'she is looking for a thing which she will never get' and the wife replies 'are not we all?'. so that was a great comment which after the film left me with a great question, 'are we all sick?'

aparna sen's 15 park avenue is a film about nature of reality. a young delusional girl, prone to imagining things and hearing voices, possibly out of sheer boredom, is taken to be schizophrenic by her educated father and control-freak educated elder step-sister. controlled, pitied and treated like an invalid (even if out of love and affection), she has ghost of a chance to develop as a normal person. when a boy offers to marry her, her father and step-sister passionately try to convince him against taking such a step. a traumatic experience, caused primarily due to her sheltered existence, finally takes her across the line of no return, and she lives full time in a delusional world of her own. the family and society around her are intolerant of her delusions,and want to suppress them with medicines, electric shock therapy, anything, even though they all have delusions of one kind or other of their own. her mother doesn't see the irony in allowing a ghost-buster to treat her of the delusions. her step-sister is a professor of physics, teaching among other things quantum mechanics, a subject in which a stream of experts accept parallel multi-universes and many more dimensions in space than the 3 we see. a friend recounts with admiration an experience with a holy person claiming to hear hallucinatory voices. far away, george w bush has real or fake delusions of saddam's weapons of mass destruction, and is allowed to invade iraq. as some viewers have already pointed out, aparna sen shied away from attacking the mother of all delusions -mainstream religions, which is a pity. in other words, accepted reality is what a majority or an influential minority believe in. that's been the case since the beginning, and lot more powerful people than mithali in the film, among them bruno and galileo, have suffered as a consequence. the film's controversial and difficult ending was necessary to show it's a film about nature of reality, and not the case study of a schizophrenic girl. all the cast have given great performances, but shabana azmi and konkona sen sharma have excelled. aparna sen has produced an outstanding philosophical film.

the most beautiful film. if one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. even more beautiful than a beautiful mind itself. simply awesome!! i wish this movie entered the oscars. i cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character. ..the most beautiful film. if one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. even more beautiful than a beautiful mind itself. simply awesome!! i wish this movie entered the oscars. i cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character.

once in a while one come across a movie that forces one to rethink about society's reaction to people who differ from its definition of normal.mitthi having suffered at the hands of unsocial elements,left all alone to cope with her tragedy, retreats into her idyllic world....one which according to her is the real world.....surreal(mitthi's world) superimposes itself on the real(her family).mitthi, suffering from schizophrenia, forces us to reconsider our priorities about trying to rehabilitate 'patients' like them. are we right to drag them back to our reality when all we have to offer them in ours is pain and suffering? what right have we to deprive them of their source of happiness? what right do we have to take away their joy when we are unable to help them in their sorrow? 15 park avenue is one of the best movies on social issues...showing us the need that any patient needs empathy and not plain sympathy.

ms aparna sen, the maker of mr & mrs iyer, directs this movie about a young girl's struggle to cope with her debilitating condition.meethi (konkona sen) has been an aloof kid ever since childhood and has shown signs of delusion, no one knows why. the dormant tendency however slips out of control, when the job assignment takes her to neighboring bihar where she's raped by some political goons. the resulting trauma also leads to episodes of manic-depressive psychosis in addition to her schizophrenia. she careens out of control over the years, progressively getting worse and sinking deeper into her private 'world'.the juxtaposition of an 'unsettled' (divorced) elder sister and how her domineering ways make an already bad situation worse, is indicative of what a fine line there is between abnormal and *seemingly normal*. ms sen also makes an excellent commentary on the social alienation of such individuals. social rehab is standard therapy along with all the deadly mind-altering drugs. but what about the poor and the destitute, who're always left to fend for themselves and usually fall by the wayside?the romantic connection between dr kunal and anu was unnecessary. also the cafeteria scene where dr kunal explains to anu how real their world really is to them, was redundant. anu should already know all that. the english dialog is a bit awkward at times though the acting compensates for that. konkona and shabana prove that their reputation is every bit worth it. waheeda, rahul and shefali play their limited roles very well. extensive research seems to have been done about this illness, its very evident. but its not clear if mdp can coexist with schizophrenia in the same patient, side-by-side. also in the early part, dr kunal recommends e.c.t (shock therapy) while invalidating the fact that it doesn't work for schizophrenics, only for extreme mdp with suicidal tendencies and other forms of bipolar disorder.the ending of the remarkable story is suggestive of an unknown solution (maybe no solution). the movie could have ended on a nicer note, since worldwide the mentally ill can and do lead balanced and fruitful if not very fulfilling, lives under good medical care.nonetheless, its an excellent film made with extreme sensitivity to the subject. hats off to ms sen! no one in india could've done it better.

as everyone knows by now, 15 park avenue is the story of a schizophrenic girl and her half-sister.the manifestation of schizophrenia is still viewed as being an illness which people often feel might disappear if ignored. there are also those, who, however far fetched it may seem when it's shown in the film, think that the illness manifests itself as a result of some sort of supernatural influence. i think ms. sen deserves a lot of praise for "15 park avenue". she has done a good turn, not only to the general public, but also to those who deal with schizophrenics ... relatives, social workers, psycho-analysts. the film actually helps in dispelling a lot of myths and misconceptions about the exact nature of this psychological disorder. i'm told that the film is largely based on her own personal experiences with a person very close to her, who suffers from this mental affliction. to that effect, i'm sure that none of what has been shown, is blown out of proportion ... on the contrary, it is a true representation of facts.the performances are good, on the whole, as can be expected. konkona sen sharma, shabana azmi and of course rahul bose, are very good indeed. they emerge as very "real" characters ... credible enough for one to be able to identify with them at times. people may think me terribly queer, but i think there are moments when one can identify with meethi as well! i suppose all of us have a streak of "insanity" inside us .... perhaps some more than others. these are the people who are singled out. after all, don't we all have our secret fantasies and dreams? impossible ones, at times? would we be dubbed as being "off our rockers" if people could glimpse into these areas of our minds? would a person with low self-esteem, be considered a schizophrenic because he/she shuns company ... preferring instead to live in a world of his/her own because that's the only space where there is a sense of security?konkona, as meethi, is outstanding!! her performance is so effortless ... she lives her part. she has shown the ability to lull the audience into forgetting the divide between reality and acting! a case in point is the part where she's distressed at the scene, shown on tv, of saddam hussein's arrest. her reaction seems so uninhibited and intense ...as if she's really heart-broken at this tragedy! her brand of indian english too, is so spontaneous and natural. however, the same cannot be said for at least a couple of the other actors. kanwaljeet and waheeda rehman, splendid actors both, seem ill at ease when delivering their dialogue in english. their diction is less than perfect ... stilted and affected, the fact that they are making a supreme effort, becomes more than apparent. their dialogue delivery is jarring and tends to break the smooth flow of the unfolding of the tale.the brutal rape of meethi (konkona), seems somewhat unnecessary. any other incident would have sufficed just as well, i feel. the point here is that something triggers off the extreme manifestation of the illness. as the psychiatrist explains, one cannot, with any modicum of conviction or certainty, say that the incident of the rape was instrumental in bringing the hitherto latent propensity towards schizophrenia, to the fore. then why are we subjected to the scene where meethi lies bleeding and unconscious. was ms. sen trying to make a social statement about the state of politics in our country, where the voice of the masses is silenced by a handful of people who resort to violence in order to stay in power?? if so, then the scene of the rape is warranted but not strictly in the context of the main body of the film.the ending seems somewhat abrupt. is the audience expected to find a solution? where does meethi disappear to? does ms. sen want us to feel that perhaps what the psychiatrist says about whose reality is more real and hence credible, holds true? in other words, is she trying to say that we are not without bias when judging who is on this side of the fine line between sanity and insanity? i'm not very sure.a thought-provoking film on the whole and well worth watching. however, if you are the sort of person who likes things to be neat and tidy ... everything cut and dried, with a water-tight solution to each issue that comes up ... this film is clearly not meant for you!

15 park avenue is the address "mithi/mithali" (konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. "prof.anu" (shabhana azmi)is mithi's extremely caring and loving half sister from mithi's mom's earlier marriage. the movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (mithi). the director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of mithi, through her continuous blabbering to anu and others. konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which i am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of mithi in this movie. you can see the look of a patient written on her face, by the drooping lips and sleepy eyes, from the first scene itself. rahul bose has done a good job, but has been reduced to one half of the movie in spite of his importance in their life.watch out for the intense relationships shown between the characters of the movie, mithi & anu, anu & anu's mom and between anu & sanjiv (kanwaljit singh). shabhana azmi, as usual has done a riveting performance to be remembered as the sister, who sacrificed her life for mithi.the movie might not be your usual hindi potboiler, but can certainly make people look at the schizophrenic patients in a different light altogether.as usual, aparna sen brings the movie to a different ending rather than any clichéd ones, we might think off. hats off to her, for this great movie!!!

i must say it was a let down. overall its great to see the way aparna sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia, i am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in a beautiful mind, and here too its interesting portrayal.but the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of english. its true that a new class is being formed/ has been formed in india which talks in english even at home, but i am sure its not as formal as in the movie. moreover, waheeda rehmaan did not seem very comfortable talking everything in english. charu's dialogue in bihari tone was seemingly much more realistic and digestible.the second thing, its about the abstract flavor she has tried to give to the movie. i generally like movies with open ending, but here there were many loose ends. its like cut pieces are joined together to make the movie. also there seemed no central theme to the movie. schizophernia for sure was the main line but intermingling sister-sister, mother-daughter, adding doctor-azmi relation, no real use of brother, bose - bose's wife relations..... all were not required and made the audience loose track of what actually did she try to depict.on the whole, a watch for people who like off-beat movies, a must avoid for the ones who just see movies as an entertainment tool.

i have just seen the movie "15 park avenue" which was the first night presentation movie in the asia society human rights film festival in new york.i was really moved by the subject matter of this movie and also the excellent portrayal of "mithi" by the lead actor konkona sen sharma.i have just one word for everyone who is reading this comment,run to get a copy of this gem and watch it.my sincere thanks to director aparna sen who has done a excellent job again.movie like this comes on once in a blue moon and i was lucky enough to see this movie on screen and also took part in a after movie discussion/question and answer session with konkona sen sharma.in a simple word "a wonderful experience.

spoilers ahead 15 park avenue: my humble take on this film now, for a viewer of cinema having tastes as severely limited as mine, niche films like 15 park avenue ought to be palatable to my sensibilities. with this thought, and a mild sense of embarrassment that i hadn't watched the complete film earlier, i watched this film last saturday. there are some starting similarities with other works like the legendary mulholland drive (david lynch) from which, this film borrows at least 3 concepts:- a) that (at least some) truths are relative b) the first scene of shabana and konkonam going around in a car as the opening credits roll, is uncannily similar to the car ride that betty and rita undertook in mulholland drive. in both cases, the object of inquiry happens to be a place which is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in aparna's film c) the incident revolving around the mad beggar woman is again extremely reminiscent of the whole 'occurence behind winkies' involving a bum but while that scary creature is an embodiment of something and that that 'something' as well as the character per se is seamlessly linked to other works of lynch (notice carefully the disheveled long hair), the effect of the beggar woman in 15 pa appears to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message the other films from which 15 pa also borrows is blow up (especially the last scene is a throw back to the truth vs. perceived truth poser presented towards the end of antonioni's masterpiece). of course, the professor and schizophrenia angle also bring to the mind, "a beautiful mind". although, admittedly the subject here is high brow physics and shabana, who professes it, inadvertently ends up being the brilliant antithesis to the delusional hallucinations of konkona's character through those very prophecies. in an outstanding scene in the movie, some of these elements are juxtaposed with each other and that scene cuts back and forth from the 'real' world of shabana, where quantum physics and the theory of relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe, to the artificial edifice of the 'make believe' world of mithi but for all their differences, the sisters are alike too. both are incapable of forming long lasting relationships- one out of choice and the other out of nature. so, mithi's pain at being rejected in love by joydeep is in harmony with the inability of shaban to form a special bond with either kunal(dhritiman) or sanjeev (kanwaljeet). but i'm getting ahead of myself. viewers generally tend to view this film in one of the following two ways:- hypothesis 1: "it was shabana all along" there is a certain section of the audience who think so. but that explanation is not only too far fetched but also contrived as that would mean she was dreaming up so many other characters too (i.e. all those characters whom she visualized as visualizing mithi along with her) hypothesis 2: "there was a real mithi and the ending is a metaphor" this pov says that the film's essence is summarized in one dialog in the film, when in response to a statement by joy (rahul bose), that mithi is looking for something that she will never find, his wife laxmi (shefali shah) philosophizes that we all are looking indeed for that illusive utopia, the end of the rainbow wherein appears to lie the mirage of happiness and contentment there are other more minor possibilities which have not been embraced that much by our knowledgeable audience like:- hypothesis 3:" shabana and konkona are alter egos of the same person" hypothesis 4: "shabana too is a figment of mithi's imagination" hypothesis 5: "the old, haggard, perhaps mad, beggar woman is the real protagonist of the story" are these hypotheses worthy of even being tested? well, your guess is as good as mine "why 15 park avenue?" contrary to the popular perception that she was thinking of the park avenue in ny, i believe that she got the name from the brand name of a semi popular bathing soap. remember, her stating jo jo's profession as "prime minister of shikakai", which as you may be knowing is a popular ingredient used in manufacturing shampoos. the prefix '15' is used as it was on 15th december that mithi got engaged to joydeep and after his walkout, she remains forever in a time warp. the film has its fair share of flaws- lack of use of a strong background score, which in films like these can really augment the narrative, some sloppy dialogs unabated by some forced dialog delivery. inconsistent performances (shabana and dhritimaan are excellent though imo) by a few of the cast members albeit many members of this ensemble cast have been wasted. shefali chaya's sudden insecurity about her husband seems to be an unimaginatively introduced dimension in the plot. i give it 7/10 as it made me think but not any higher than that because i can easily fathom its sources of inspiration and having experienced (and for the most part, thoroughly enjoyed) those previously, i have already thought on similar lines earlier. so, the experience post 15 pa is bound to be sans a certain degree of novelty. where am i coming from? i gave 9.5/10 to '36 chowringhee lane' (though rumors still persist that one satyajit ray ghost directed it), 7.5 to 'paromiter ek din', 7 to 'mr and mrs iyer' and 5 to 'paroma'. on an existential level, it failed to invoke my interest, not even as much as say a 'truman show'

i went to watch this film with my family who were expecting a neatly conclusive story like ''mr.& mrs.iyer''.and they returned home thoroughly disappointed.so,this is a warning to all ''conclusive story lovers'' to stay away.15 park avenue does not seek to answer questions or provide moral solutions on how to treat the mentally challenged.rather its intention is loud and clear.it questions every human being's,sane or not,sense of reality.in fact for me it even arouses doubts about my taken-for-granted sense of sanity.the security,bondage,satisfaction that i find in my present,is it really what i am or does it really create an illusion that all of us desperately and sometimes ignorantly cling on to just to falsely console the neglected 'meethi' which exists in all of us in some way or the other? so,why does anjali so maniacally makes it a point to show off her strength of mind when she is really harrowed by the realization that she is becoming a monster?aren't we all who think we are ''normal'' ,really monstrous and helplessly vulnerable about it deep down inside? is it not better to be happy even insanely,than to create the impression of 'normalcy' while suppressing one's fragility? meethi bravely,madly,sincerely does that.and society labels her as ''schizophrenic''.the ending did confound me at first,but then you realise that meethi bravery and sincere belief took her where she wanted to go.she found what she was searching for,not caring what society had to comment upon her search. and it is the seemingly 'real' people - anjali,the psychiatrist,and jojo- who never reach anywhere.my family thinks that i am schizophrenic too in trying to make sense of a film that is largely 'insane' to the rest of the world.anyone else willing to believe in my sense of reality...........?

15 park avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from new york and film being set in kolkata. however as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between relationships, social cause and of course the world of schizophrenia. i would say aparna sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. in a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 park avenue'. its an unending search within each of one of us...the powerhouse performance from shabana azmi is a treat to watch. her screen presence brings whole lot of life into the scene. indeed it was surprising to see her in such a powerful act after long because i expected it to be all the way konkona sen's terrain. shabana makes you feel skin deep of an elder sister who is running the whole show for a rather unfortunate family and during this time she almost forgets to live her own life. she burdens all her ambitions and desires with ailing 18 year younger sister ( who is more like a daughter to her ) and an aging mother played by veteran waheeda rehman. as for the leading actress from guide ( that's how i can recall her instantly ) there is hardly anything to say except few lines and tear drops here and there. ever dependable rahul bose plays another pivotal role in the film, he shows the emotions of a middle age man with repent on his face to near perfection. this man really amazes me with the variety of work he has done. from a musician in jhankar beats to a liberal muslim in mr. & mrs. iyer and so many others. he is one versatile i really wish if he had some more shots in the first part of the movie as well. the cameo in the movie is by shefali shah (remember satya and monsoon wedding). she looks really beautiful and depicts the role of a mother of 2 kids with real ease. she gives you a glimpse of today's indian woman who is modern in approach but still conventional when it comes to her husband's prior relationships. the focus of camera has been meethi, portrayed by konkona. she and her schizophrenic world constitute the nucleus of 15 park avenue. she has really worked hard for the character but there are times when she is not able to relate with the audience. the fateful accident of her life tries to rope in sympathy and it has been only partially successful. the movie tries to address quite a few things in one go starting from the unique world of a disabled person to the unequal status of a female even in today's modern india and also the twisted relationships in a tattered family. and i believe aparna has succeeded to certain extent. the helplessness of meethi while she works as a journalist in a rural eastern state really gives us all a naked picture of the country we are so proud of. well after i finished 15 park avenue, there was a sense of unquenched thirst within me. i wanted more out of this movie to drench me emotionally. it has been a commendable effort on the part of director except few hiccups. must watch for all those who like to see a different cinema, something with a strong purpose.

this is a multi-faceted, insightful and bold story about the people in the life of a schizophrenic patient, their (and our) perception and realities. although the main theme revolves around a delusional young woman, the story delightfully flirts with physics, medicine, religion and even politics as it questions our perceptions about what is true and what is real. konkona sensharma beautifully conveys that the world mithi is living in is as real to her as ours is to us. within that world, she is logical and her thoughts are internally consistent, not the gibberish that they seem to us in our world.here are a few outstanding scenes to look out for while watching the movie (don't worry, these are not spoilers). i absolutely loved the way aparna sen wove these commentaries into the story.- the references to quantum mechanics and relativity intermingled with the witch-doctor ("ojha" in hindi) performing his religious rituals that he believes will drive away the "ghosts" sitting in mithi's brain. - the doctor prescribing shock-treatment as a solution that is "believed" to work - windows of perception - the scene about the review of anu's book. - the allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for "maya". - news footage of george bush telling the whole world that there is "no doubt in his mind" that there are wmd in iraq (now, that is not as much about bush's perception, who i suspect knew the truth, as the gullible public's perception about wmd in iraq.)- one of the best scenes in the movie is where mithi tells anu "charu sent this man to beat me" and anu dismisses it as a matter of course. konkona did a fantastic job, bringing out the strange mix of muddled thoughts in a schizophrenic's brain when her world and the real world clash.aparna sen was bold, but not bold enough to pose one big question: is nearly all of mankind delusional to believe in god? she could have inserted some scenes about "normal", "healthy" people praying to and sacrificing for a being that no one has ever seen or heard from in all of human history (the ritual/exorcism scene doesn't go far enough). that would be the ultimate question: what is normal? who's reality is right, the believer's or the atheist's?imho, this movie is a far more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than "a beautiful mind". it looks at the minds of not just the sick person, but also the healthy, and does so from many different angles and illuminates our understanding of our own minds and our world. if the former got 4 oscars, this deserves more - at least one each for story, screenplay, direction, konkona, and shabana azmi. it was truly a treat to watch this movie and i'm glad i bought the dvd for my collection. this was a story very well-told indeed.

if you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (mithi). the movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. aparna sen delivers yet another masterpiece. each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. konkona sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. she pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. shabana azmi is incredible as usual. she plays the dominating and fiercely independent elder sister of mithi who takes care of her ailing sister and aging mother. she refuses to accept that in-spite of all her strength and courage, she still feels lonely at times. this should have been a very easy movie for rahul bose. the role was least bit demanding and anyone could have done the role.the ending of the movie was the most surreal part of the whole park avenue experience. it took me a while to digest that the movie had ended. it left me confused and maybe even a bit disturbed. but later on, it started sinking in. my eyes are black. but if everyone says they are blue, will i still believe that its black??!

i have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has! it was funny and creative; i wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. it ranks right up there with winky dink - another favorite. i was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on rocky and bullwinkle. these early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have. today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances. while the early cartoons didn't address evil very much - it was a much gentler and safer time - they allowed us to develop our own talents and character.

during the brief golden age of the super 8 magnetic sound home movies, we purchased a gaf projector for $148.00 on close-out at a downtown chicago camera store. it seemed that gaf was getting out of the camera & projector business; although they would continue with their other enterprises, such as the former sawyer's vue-master 3 dimensional color slide viewers.little did we know nor anticipate the rapid approach of the video camera, the betamax, the vhs and the eventual dvd revolutions. with the super 8 magnetic sound camera that we also purchased, we took some sound film records as our daughter, jenn's first holy communion and her younger sister, michelle's graduation from pre-school. this was all circa 1979-82.during this time we also purchased a few daddy toys to go with it; like some super 8 magnetic sound laurel & hardy films and w.c. fields' shorts from blackhawk films, davenport, iowa. we also picked up a columbia pictures home movies sound film of a then sort of forgotten classic cartoon, upa's gerald mcboing-boing (united productions of america/columbia, 1951). it was the hit of our home movies time! being members of that baby boomer generation, the wife (deanna) and meself had recollection of the character of gerald mcboing-boing; for gerald had a network tv show on cbs, early sunday evenings, ca. 1955. bill goodwin was the announcer/host. but we had never seen this original upa theatrical cartoon; nor was it known to us that the young master mcboing-boing was a creation of dr. seuss of "grinch", "horton" and "mulberry street" fame.the staff assembled was very talent rich and deep. the outstanding production values are apparent. director robert cannon and supervisoring director john hubley were veterans at the top of their craft. writers were theodore geisel (dr. seuss, himself), phil eastman and bill scott.mr. scott is remembered not so much for his writing contributions to upa, but for being partners with jay ward in such television properties as rocky & bullwinkle, mr. peabody, fractured flickers, george of the jungle, hoppity hooper and fractured flickers. with the jay ward productions he was a writer, voice man and kibitzer-general of the whole company.the cartoon receives its only "voice" from the narrator, radio/movie/tv actor marvin miller. remember him? he was michael anthony on the tv ssries the millionaire (don fedderson productions/cbs television network, 1955-60).bold color schematic and imaginative design went into giving the upa animations a special feelings of loneliness, fear apprehension and eventual triumph. and, we might add, the animation is definitely of the "limited" variety.as with so many great stories, ours starts out with a simple premise; one's being born different. in this case it is young boy gerald mccloy, who has been born to make sound effects in communicating rather than talking. kids can be cruel and soon he is dubbed with his not so flattering nick name by a group of youthful taunters chanting: "nya, nya, your name's not mccloy; it's gerald mcboing-boing, the noise making boy!" at this point, the animation team does an outstanding job in shifting the emotional gears in the young outcast from happy & carefree to isolated & lonely and finally to depression & despair in not being able to turn to anyone for help and understanding; not even to his mother and father.a frighteningly fashioned dark scene involving a highly upa stylized run away scene involving a train and an equally stylized snowfall brings gerald right to the brink of absolute despair. but then, he is interrupted by a gentleman announcing that young gerald is wanted by the producer of some radio program to provide the sounds for the show down at the studio.once the premiere show is done with gerald starring in the sound department, he rides off in a huge limousine (which seems to have anticipated those s-t-r-e-t-c-h limos of our day) to the cheers and admiration of his classmates and the world.it has been said that there are only so many plots and, in that case this story is most likely a variation on the ugly duckling; for after all, a sad and lonely boy finds his place in the world and true happiness.note: united productions of america, or upa for short, was an outstanding center of creativity in the field of the animated cartoon. they were responsible not only for gerald mcboing-boing and several sequels and a tv series, but also the highly popular mr. magoo theatrical cartoons and subsequent tv show (with voice talent of jim backus), the classic original tv cartoon of frosty the snowman and the rather bizarre dick tracy cartoon show (with tracy's voice rendered by mr. everett sloane!).

mcboing boing is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production. if i remember correctly we had to watch it on a uhf station and this meant using a converter in those days uhf not part of regular tv to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious. i remember all the sound effects that gerald used to talk. a great memory from 50+ years ago. i'll have to see what other memories might be hiding on the web. by the way i try to do computer animation thats where the johnl3d comes into the picture

my dad had this movie as an 8mm reel. i loved it when he would pull out the projector, tape a sheet to the wall, and play gerald mcboing boing. the thought of a child who communicated through sounds fascinated me.nine years ago, my son was diagnosised as autistic. the doctors would ask me questions about my son such as "how does he communicate with you?" i would respond, "have you ever seen the cartoon, gerald mcboing boing?" i would love to have a copy of this cartoon to show my son and his educators, this is how my son see he's world.recently, i spoke with a digital transfer specialist who indicated most personal 8mm films did not contain sound until the mid 1970's. i guess i was pretty lucky to have experienced the sights and sounds of gerald mcboing boing in 1972.

if there's one cartoon that helped to put upa on the map more than any other, it's gerald mcboing-boing. this tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years. besides the effects, loved the music, the abstract animation and backgrounds, the narration by marvin miller, pretty much everything. and it won the oscar for best animated short of 1950. glad to have seen it on youtube after reading about this dr. seuss story for so many years. and rocky and bullwinkle creator bill scott also contributed, how awesome! hope to see the subsequent shorts made in the series, if not on youtube, then maybe in a dvd collection. now i guess i'll watch another upa short there...

this short, which won an oscar, spawned two sequels and a tv cartoon show, has minimal animation but adelightful script (by theodore geisel aka dr. seuss) and aneven more memorable and enchanting main character. upa pioneered a style of animation that even influenced disney during the mid-1950s and produced some of the best animated shorts done in the late 1940s and the 1950s. this is on of their finest. god to have it in print. highly recommended.

this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book, brilliantly animated by upa's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award. special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon. later episodes in the series (of which there were four in total) were not actually based on original dr seuss material, although all but the last continued to use his familiar rhyming style. the three sequels were: gerald mcboing boing's symphony (1953); how now boing boing (1954); gerald mcboing boing on planet moo (1956) - although he also appeared in a later episode of mr magoo.

before the wwf became cartoon with hulk hoagan leading the way, the events of wwf tv broadcasts of the very early 1980s resembled the wild, wild west with all kinds of grudges and vicious acts of violence performed by some of the wrestlers that are known today to be the wwf's most beloved stars. some of these seemingly very real moments stand out. a maniacal sgt. slaughter whipped then champion bob backlund with a riding crop after backlund showed him up in a fitness test. welts were all over backlund! sarge made the iron shiek look like a daycare provider! slaughter also issued a challenge to anyone who could break his dreaded cobra clutch hold. this led a legendary and bloody alley match with commentator pat patterson. hall of fame member blackjack mulligan with freddie blassie came into the wwf with a claw hold that was censored on television. he claimed he was the true giant at 6'7" and challenged andre long before big john studd in 1984. adrian adonis used his ominously named "good night, irene" sleeper to take out the competition. a new yorker clad in black leather, he was an ominous figure. george "the animal" steele was far from a crowd pleaser, as well. even jimmy snuka was a fearsome sight as he set out maim opponents until ray "the crippler" stevens delivered a piledriver onto the cement floor leaving snuka a bloody mess. all these encounters took place a decade before hardcore wrestling was ever spoken of.

every saturday morning at 11 a.m. i watched superstars. all the biggest events happened on this show at the time. challenge, which aired sunday mornings, was decent too, but all the big stuff happened on this show. wrestlers would do all their interviews with mean gene on a platform next to the live crowd or talk on their own to the screen in front of a background that promoted them. the matches were usually squashes but sometimes you would see 2 mid carders square off in the main event. there were also interview shows that usually resulted in violence thus setting up a feud. these segments ranged from pipers pit, the body shop, the flower shop, the snake pit, the brother love show, the funeral parlor, and the barber shop. i don't recall any titles changing hands on this show. that usually happened at pay per views and saturday nights main event.

loved the shots of airports -- dallas, phoenix, fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. and the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. fast-forward 75 years....but what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a chinese ideogram adjacent the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. remember when the mutual acquaintance neil and jill encounter says that jim'd become a general in a chinese rebel army? that, based on the hammer and sickle, could only have been the people's revolutionary army of mao tse dung!!! never mind the undies and the unwed twosome in bed -- would that logo and that reference have survived during the cold war? additional observation 12/27: this film of the 30's with the soviet emblem may/must also reflect the influence on and charm of communism in hollywood and much of america during the depression. adds to the historical value of this terrific film. also i liked the american dream aspects of two guys from winnemucca taking at least part of the world by storm, red-blooded (literally and copiously in jim's case)american boys.others have commented more ably than i on the aerobatics, etc. i loved it all.this gem deserved more than the mere 1.5 stars osborne and co. rated it on tcm, if only for recording parts of american history of the early 30s.

many of the earlier comments are right on the money, but some, well, not so much.this is hardly a 'b' movie...it's well produced, the live flying sequences are really superb, and the model sequences are first rate. it's no "cheapie".ricard barthelmess is quite good in this, and it makes a a nice companion piece for "only angels have wings".if you want to spot john wayne, spot j. carrol naish first, they end up together.tom browne is juvenile enough (and somewhat dull), but when they saddle him with the most pathetic pencil-mustache in hollywood history, it makes his character even less believable. sally eilers is much more so.as for later influences, this is wellman in the early airliner-in-distress zone...the opening sequence of this film, with the airline operations guy arriving at the "grand central airport" would have fit very nicely into "the high and the mighty"...just imagine regis toomey...and a 1955 buick.

i saw conrack on a night i couldn't sleep and i was never so glad to have insomnia ! this story of a young white teacher who takes a position teaching poor black kids on an island in the carolina's is a great advertisement for teaching , and for simply helping each other .set in the early 60s , with the civil rights issues , viet nam and all that came with the 60s ,it is forgotten that the peace corps and many young people struck out to make a difference helping the unprivileged .conrack with his open style of teaching is interested in these kids as people , and encourages an honest interaction in his class that scares the power's that be .the greatest part was that jon voight said they had a 20 year reunion and 18 of those kids became teachers !! its enough to make you think we as humans may have a chance to survive ourselves ,maybe , hopefully .see this film .

i'm going to make this short and sweet. it's not surprising that you had no use for this film. this is a story about the power, beauty and possibilities inherent in a meaningful education. based on your pathetically composed comments i can see that your own education has been woefully neglected... or worse... completely wasted. your comments are those of a truly ignorant person. i would advise you to do something about this condition... but in your case i feel it's probably too late. my hope is that you yourself don't intend to go into the teaching profession ( especially in film studies) because you could only do damage. oh... one last bit of advice. in the future, if you intend to write more opinion pieces, you should really proofread your work. it will make people take you more seriously.

our america is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. this movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. it is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. generally, a good movie. it entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. should be seen by all. having lived in the u.s. all my life, i had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens. this movie helps illustrate the diversity of our country by showing this small part of a southern state. the obvious conclusion: if this is really for real, then what else is out there that we know nothing of?

this movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... realistic. movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. the producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. the lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. at least that's how it seemed at the time. in today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. there would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic. the sad fact is that the movie depicted a situation which could not be improved upon without action from the improvement of the relationship between the white southern traditional thinking and the progressive movements of that time.

i not only consider this to be the best film that jon voight (midnight cowboy, coming home) has ever done, but a real tribute to teachers.despite incredible odds, pat conroy (voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. his methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like mr. skeffington (hume cronyn), but teachers like conroy will always be winners.voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him. he didn't overplay the role, and i found him to be totally believable. voight is conrack.besides a love of teaching, we also see another important point in this film. no matter how good you are at your job, if you rock the boat, the bureaucrats will get you.

just watched conrack for the first time. although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. as an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded. the thread concerning the vietnam war rings true even today. well worth a look.

john voight plays the title character in this movie based on author pat conroy's (prince of tides) autobiography. a fine teacher film, it tells the story of a naive pat conroy, a young english teacher whose first assignment is in an elementary school on a rural island. the only white man on the island, he must battle internal and external pressures as he attempts to instill education and values in children who for generations have been systematically denied such things. a solid performance that really makes you think.

i saw this film on tv in the uk some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. my interest has recently been rekindled by visiting hilton head - the next island over from "yamacraw" (daufuskie actually), and reading pat conroy's excellent "the water is wide". with the benefit of knowledge i have reappraised conrack and consider it a masterpiece. jon voight captures the spirit of conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a hollywood rarity. three things still strike me about this tale: 1. the issues of educating the poor and disenfranchised and being inclusive remain the same. 2. education is about more than reading and writing. 3.. these kids were my peers, i was 6 in 1969 when pat conroy spent his year on daufuskie.why this has not made it on to dvd yet?

well, i've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when i first saw it. it is definitely one of the most unique films ever made.i still think martin sheen got "dissed" big-time in the billing, too. he dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than marlon brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours, 17 minutes film (theatrical version). how unfair is that?sheen is fantastic in here, especially his narration, which runs throughout. it's one of the best narrations, if not the best, i have ever heard in a movie. his voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible, nightmare-like adventure. i never fail to appreciate his work in this movie.the other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes, ones i have never forgotten, such as......sheen losing it in his hotel room in the movie's first scene; robert duvall and the totally out-of-place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with wagner's dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters; the playboy bunny entertaining the troops; frederic forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle; the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride; the appearance of hippie journalist dennis hopper greeting the crew in cambodia and then brando's bizarre character. it goes on and on with strange scenes.that's not to say i enjoyed everything. no, there are a few very unpleasant scenes, such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half (can't watch that anymore), an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by sheen's young stoned-out crew, and the crew is a little too goofy at times. then, there is the huge amount of profanity, led by way too many f-words.so, there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this one thing for sure: it is a film you will remember!

from all of the vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out. it has this freakish feel to it. everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you. it is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other vietnam war movies. what does push to such a high level is the: the directing was spectacular here. francis ford coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie. unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war. most others just display and show you the horrors of war. coppola though makes you feel confused, shocked and scared. these feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story. this is something that i have only experienced very few times while watching a film. the writing was of course amazing too. it brought you write into the middle of the movie. it never made me bored and this movie is three hours. the cinematography goes hand in hand with the directing which very much added to the freakish experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calm.the acting was bone-chilling. just look at marlon brando also giving his last great performance playing a deluded, out of whack colonel. when ever i think of a crazy gone made soldier i think marlon brando in apocalpyse now. with brando n this film you don't want to look into his eyes. like the movie he was freakish. to me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in the godfather. martin sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best one of his career making you see everything through his eyes all the craziness he is experiencing and yet wanting him to get to his goal. it is just a wonder why these two did not get oscar nominations. robert duvall was able to show part of that craziness with his ludicrous battle strategies, among those playing music to tell the enemy he is coming. also duvall's character asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was just shocking but believable. other great supporting performances were given by a young laurence fishburne, sam bottoms and frederic forest who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a cliché. also for once cameos were put into good use having dennis hopper and harrison ford who i both love.i would definitely recommend people to watch this movie. it has a message and everyone involved in the making of it is at their best. there is nothing more i could ask of this movie with its great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and great ending. watch and you will see why it lives up to its title apocalpyse now.

after the success of the first two 'godfather' films in 1972 and 1974 respectively, francis ford coppola embarked on an ambitious attempt to bring home the reality of the war in vietnam, which had concluded with the fall of saigon to the vietcong in 1975 the plot was loosely based on the book 'heart of darkness,' a story by joseph conrad about kurtz, a trading company agent in the african jungle who has acquired mysterious powers over the nativescoppola retains much of this, including such details as the severed heads outside kurtz's headquarters and his final words, "the horror the horror" in the film, sheen plays an army captain given the mission to penetrate into cambodia, and eliminate, with "extreme prejudice," a decorated officer who has become an embarrassment to the authorities on his journey up the river to the renegade's camp he experiences the demoralization of the us forces, high on dope or drunk with power although, as a result of cuts forced on coppola, the film was accused of incoherence when first released, it was by the most serious attempt to get to grips with the experience of vietnam and a victorious reinvention of the war film genre in 1980 the film won an oscar for best cinematography and best sound "apocalypse now" was re-released in 2001 with fifty minutes restored as a result, the motion picture can now be seen as the epic masterpiece it is

this movie changed the art of film making, telling a complex story in a powerful new way. the film mixes brutal realism with fantasy, intercutting a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolour smoke. the film uses music not as a score laid in later, but as a practical part of the scene playing from speakers, radios etc. coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration, taking scenes and characters, and putting them into entirely different surroundings. that is a tricky and brave thing to do. then he takes a superstar, brando, pays him a fortune, and films him so that you can barely see his face. the pure guts that such a move requires is astounding, and it works beautifully. this movie belongs in the top ten.

a couple of cowpokes help a group of mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. this low-key western is unusual for ford in that it lacks any big stars. johnson gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and carey work well together. dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. the best performance is given by ford favorite bond, playing the leader of the mormons. in fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running tv western "wagon train" before his untimely death at age 57. featuring beautiful cinematography, ford regarded this as one of his favorite films.

the western can be divided into many sub-genres. one of the broadest divisions is that between town westerns and plains westerns. most westerns are a mix of both, but at one end of the spectrum you have pictures like high noon and rio bravo that take place almost entirely in a settlement, seldom venturing out into the real outdoors. at the other end you have ones like wagon master, where there is barely a homestead on view amid the wilderness.director john ford normally thrived on the "bit of both" westerns, shooting the interiors with an emphasis on their being small and confined, and then contrasting this with the wide open exteriors, which appeared both exciting and dangerous. wagon master has a typical frank nugent script, with some interplay between seasoned oldsters and green youngsters, but still it presents ford with some fresh challenges. in this picture, the dangers do not come from the harshness of the landscape, they come from within the group in the form of the cleggses. what's more, the absence of real interior scenes means the outdoors could lose its impact over time.however, ford was a real maestro when it came to manipulating space. he shoots scenes of the camp or the wagons so the frame is surrounded and we get that same sense of enclosure as we would in a genuine interior. also, compared to his other westerns, he does not in fact open out the space too much, having the wagon trail wend its way through canyons and passes rather than cross the stark and empty plains. one of the few moments where he does throw the landscape wide open is when the indians are spotted and there is the possibility of a threat from outside.wagon master features some surprisingly effective moments of comic relief, and some great contributions from the quirky cast. harry carey jr. was shaping up into a fine actor like his pa, and this is one of his better early roles. joanne dru was disappointing in she wore a yellow ribbon, but she appears more at ease as a character with a bit of sass, and is actually fairly good here. jane darwell, who won an oscar in the john ford-directed grapes of wrath a decade earlier, appears here with sole function of performing a running gag in which she sounds a feeble old horn. still, with her great timing and movement she makes the piece work. francis ford, in one of the many mute drunkard roles he played in his little brother's pictures, is at his cheeky best.and now we come to lead man ben johnson. although he was by no means a bad actor, he was never going to become a big star like john wayne. and yet, with his effortless horsemanship and easygoing drawl, he was one of the most authentically "west" players around. and this brings me onto my final point. this was apparently one of ford's personal favourites, despite it seeming fairly unassuming. wagon master has no grand theme or dramatic intensity, it is simply the genre playing itself out. i think this is what ford loved about it. it's a picture for the ben johnsons and the harry carey jrs, not the john waynes or the henry fondas. small in scope, but worthy in its class.

although i liked this western,i do have to say,it's not one of my favourite john ford westerns.for me,it just lacks a certain something that most of his other films(the ones i have seen anyway)possess)i'm nit sure what that something is.it's not something tangible.anyway,the gist of the story is about a mormon wagon train which is being used by a band of outlaws as a hideout from a pursuing posse.ford employs a lot of his regulars here.there are some interesting characters,some nice scenery,a bit of action,and excitement.it all adds up to a watchable experience.it's certainly not boring.just not quite up to the usual john ford standard.for me,wagon master is a 7/10

watching the wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great ford films, like the searchers, my darling clementine, the man who shot liberty valance, and the grapes of wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. the story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of mormons get to california. along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some navajos. there's a lot of adventure and excitement on the trail, and the film is imbued with fun and beauty. the music is absolutely beautiful. the scenery, again from monument valley, is as beautiful as it ever was. plus, how can you go wrong with james arness? the wagonmaster might not be one of john ford's better known films, but it is nonetheless a must-see if you get the chance. 9/10.

it has been recorded that john ford made the "big, blockbuster" movies so that he could afford to make the "small" movies that he loved so well. wagon master, with a young ben johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. the location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains indian are all trade marks of ford. as in many of his other films, eisenstein, the great russian director's influence is seen in this film. the supporting cast including ward bond, russell simpson, and jane darwell are excellent as well as the many, minor character actors ford used, including his brother (the one who plays the drums). while ben johnson went on to win a well-deserved supporting oscar for the last picture show, his co-star, harry carey,jr. did not reach those heights. although his father, carey, sr. became a western leading man in ford's early films, carey, jr. spent most of his career in supporting roles. for fans of john ford, and for fans of western films, this one is a must.

travis and sandy(ben johnson and harry carey, jr.)are horse traders coerced into selling their animals to a mormon group and guiding them across the frontier to a settlement. what they do not expect is to encounter the notorious clegg murderers, with their wounded leader uncle shiloh(charles kemper). ward bond portrays elder wiggs, the main voice for the mormon group moving the wagon train to the lord's destination. along the way, they also encounter "doctor" a locksley hall and his "hoochey koochey wagon" and lend them help.lovingly directed by ford who pays close attention to detail with realistic problems any group would encounter during a rugged wagon trail. the film has a wonderful cast made up of character actors with nary a true star in the film which is actually a blessing to see, if just not for a change of pace. young johnson and carey, jr. come off real well, but this is bond's film to shine as he has the best lines. johnson is the one who seems to understand ruffians and brutes like shiloh and will certainly come in handy when certain conflict might develop as the clegg boys ride along side them a piece.i'd have to say this is one of his best and most least appreciated westerns and seems to flow very well.

two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. the scenes of the corral in the town where ward bond and ben johnson negotiate prices, and bond introduces the idea of them (johnson and his partner played by harry carey jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with bond. once on the trail they come upon joanne dru, who maybe john ford saw in red river, and offered her a much better part in this film. in the morman train are a number of notable characters. the mormans are a peaceable group who are challenged along the way by a truly lowlife group of outlaws. in their case (the outlaws), in the case of the people on the train, and later a band of navajos whom they encounter, and in the well written characters played by ben johnson and ward bond, the film completely evades stereotypes, while the camera seems to spend as much time giving the viewer the big picture of monument valley framing the train as it moves along with a few water crossings along the way, in stunning black and white and then coming back to what's happening in this rolling community, all to the accompaniment of the beautiful vocalizations of the sons of the pioneers.

together with the even more underrated , the sun shines bright, wagon master was one of ford's favorite films. it is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well acted by members of ford's 'stock company', including jane darwell, alan mowbray, ward bond,and harry carey, jr.like almost all of ford's films,it is a meditation on freedom and community. it is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of indians than in most of ford's movies. ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of american democracy.

one of my favorite westerns and one of john ford's best in my opinion. no major stars, but ben johnson shines in most everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. matching him is ward bond as the crusty mormon elder leading his people west. john ford's stock of character actors, including harry carey, jr., jane darwell, russell simpson and hank worden, provide ample support, as does eerily silent james arness, a member of the outlaw clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train. the mormon trail into utah was one of the most arduous and demanding enterprises ever undertaken. we can't really get the feel of that, but we do see ordeals that had to be overcome by pioneers on the way west; river crossings, long stretches of dry, waterless desert, encounters with indians and the like, all set to glorious song by the sons of the pioneers. the mormons actually did dig sections of the trail with picks and shovels, as depicted in the movie. my main regret is that it wasn't made in color, but i believe there is a colorized version. by the way, those craggy rocks featured in various scenes are called the fisher towers, located near moab. highly recommended viewing.

this little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. because it was a little picture, john ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs. he was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. he was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. some of them such as ben johnson had been discovered by ford and given opportunity to show their talents. johnson was recruited by ford because he was an authentic cowboy from oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work. years later he would win the coveted academy award for his brilliant performance in "the last picture show." ward bond even outshines ben johnson in this movie. he is not the wagon master, that role is played by johnson, but because of this movie he was later given the role of wagon master in the classic television series "wagon train." ironically one of the bad guys in "wagon master," james arness, would star in the hit television series "gunsmoke" on a rival network to "wagon train." ward bond plays the leader of the mormons heading west who often backslides to his sinning days by cussing only to be called down by fellow mormon adam perkins (russell simpson). when any bothersome situation arises elder wiggs (ward bond) yells, "blow your horn, sister ledeyard!" the mormon sister, played to perfection by jane darwell, then blows so hard and loud that even the devil must have been shaken by the sound. darwell and simpson were famous for playing ma and pa joad in ford's classic version of the john steinbeck novel "the grapes of wrath."another of the great character actors in ford's company was hank worden, who plays one of uncle shiloh clegg's notoriously mean but not too bright outlaw sons. worden would become famous a few years later for playing mose in ford's "the searchers." worden lived to be 91. he was still making movies when he died.the wagon master travis blue (ben johnson) and his partner sandy (harry carey jr.) are horse traders who never take their job seriously, having a lot of fun along the way, especially with the local sheriff. they get mixed up with a mormon wagon train heading west. ford's beloved monument valley is the setting for most of the film. the main reason for the teaming is a redheaded mormon beauty prudence perkins (kathleen o'malley) who catches sandy's eye. along the way the train picks up a hoochie coochie show which includes a charlatan doctor (alan mowbray) and two soiled angels (joanne dru and ruth clifford). also joining up along the way is the clegg family, wanted for murder and armed robbery. ford shows how arduous a journey west by wagon was in those days. the songs in the film were written by stan jones of the legendary sons of the pioneers. jones' writing was almost as good as that of bob nolan, who had previously done much of the writing for the group. jones' most famous song, not in this film, is the much recorded "ghost riders in the sky." the sons of the pioneers do the background singing in "wagon master." this adds to the overall impact of wagons rolling west.it should also be noted that the acclaimed native american athlete jim thorpe from oklahoma plays the role of a navajo leader. this was his last film appearance. he died not long after "wagon master" was released.

in crystal city, a group of mormons hire the horse traders travis (ben johnson) and sandy (harry carey jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to san juan river. along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack dr. a. locksley hall (alan mowbray) and the prostitutes denver (joanne dru) and fleuretty phyffe (ruth clifford). then the sadistic outlaws clegg boys decide to join the mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the sheriff of crystal city that is chasing them. when the navajos cross their path, they are invited to visit their hamlet for a dancing party. when the wagon train is near to their destination, the clegg boys threaten the settlers, forcing sandy and travis to take an attitude."wagon master" is another great western of john ford. the sequences with the wagon train crossing the desert and the hills are impressive. the adventure of the group of mormons is funny and very entertaining and the songs fit well to the plot despite being dated. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "caravana dos bravos" ("caravan of the braves")

it takes a while to get adjusted to the sound of sons of the pioneers , but then you thoroughly enjoy it. if the soundtrack would be played by an orchestra like max steiner or dmitri tiomkin it would lose its folkloric character. the music conducts the film, everything seems to follow its rhythm. the whole cast is excellent. ben johnson and harry carey jr. are the young men guiding the caravan. ward bond is the mormon leader and joanne dru is a flirting actress. ford was able to make of what would be an ordinary western, something totally different and original showing us the music, the dances, and most of all, the people.

wagon master is a very unique film amongst john ford's work. mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by john ford himself, the story that was elaborated by frank nugent and director's son  patrick ford and turned into a screenplay, and because of director's personal opinion regarding it, wagon master is the film john ford called the one which `came closest to being what i had wanted to achieve', to say so is not to say a little, but as ford confessed once to lindsay anderson, his favourite was nonetheless my darling clementine and not any other. wagon master has all ingredients one might expect to find in a john ford's film. wonderful cast delivering his best, thou not featuring any major stars, except the most `fordian' of all actors  ben johnson. very peculiar small characters, who provide an obligatory comic relief, and wagon master has quite a few of them such as horn blowing sister ledyard (jane darwell) in her shot but very inspired gigs. and last but not least legendary monument valley with john ford's fifth passage through it after stagecoach, my darling clementine, fort apache and she wore a yellow ribbon. the film starts with two friends cowboys travis blue (ben johnson) and sandy owens (harry carey jr) being hired to be wagon masters or guides for a caravan of mormon settlers who are headed to silver valley, a place that's for them like a promised land. on their way they are joined by a very peculiar dr. locksley hall (alan mowbray) with two beautiful women, who are supposedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors. they are headed in the same direction simply because they were recently driven out of the nearest town and have no other place to go. nothing particularly unpleasant happens till they bump into cleggs, a dangerous family gang consisting of father and his three sons who are on the run from the marshal of the town where they recently committed murder and bank robbery. overall wagon master is no more nor less than one more precious pearl in a necklace of john ford's wonderful westerns. a must see. 9/10

one of the best! as being a fan of the civil war, i was very pleased with the first installment of the north and south trilogy. patrick swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as james reed and leslie ann down. in watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. i was first introduced to this series when i was in the eighth grade. being a young boy, you would think that i wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap. to be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book. i bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome. i am 17 now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war. as a movie director of the future, i will always enjoy north and south: book one.

several weeks back i lost my beloved companion and friend of fourteen years, a golden retriever named sasha. when i came home from the animal hospital, alone, after having made one of the most painful decisions of my life, my teenage daughter sat by my side. . .and we talked about this episode of the twilight zone. i could be wrong, but i recall a line that arthur hunnicutt said, when satan was trying to trick him into hell, but his dog could not go with him. . .and his dog in turn was growling in defiance at the gatekeeper who was trying to trick the old hunter to "step inside,". . .that it would be "one helluva of heaven if dogs were not allowed," and the spirit of the old mountain man and his dog decided to turn away from the gate (of what they had thought was heaven, to wander eternity alone.) what a tearful moment when they meet a "good ole' country boy" on that eternal road, only to discover he is an angel, sent out to find 'em, and "sure neighbor, of course dogs are allowed into heaven." i'll confess i cried as i talked about this with my daughter while we mourned the passing of our beloved golden. rod serling was truly a genius, a voice that in the early sixties spoke out against racism, hatred, "know-nothingism," and was a profound inspiration to me to become a writer. this episode, across forty five years carried a message of comfort to all of us who have lost a beloved friend. i urge you to get a copy the next time there is a one of the twilight zone marathons or purchase it. there will be some tears, but comfort as well. as always, thanks rod, for all that you taught us. . .even now.

in this episode, a man and his dog go 'coon huntin' after eating dinner with his wife of 50 years. he's devoted to his wife and his dog.while hunting, his dog jumps in the river after the dog and he follows. the man dies and doesn't know it. he tries to talk to his wife and his grave diggers to no avail.what follows is a tug of war between heaven and hell for the man's soul and his dog helps make the decision. he's being tricked by the devil and won't go in to "heaven" unless his dog comes with him.it makes you wonder if all the animal lovers have the right idea and want to go to heaven with them.

it's rare that i get the opportunity to review a film for imdb that relates to my own life in such a close way. however, as someone living with cerebral palsy (albeit less severe than michael, one of the main characters in the film) i don't wish to give this film a 'free pass' just because it tackles a subject that's rarely approached; and when it is, is normally treated with po-faced seriousness. there were minor problems i had with the film; and i'd like to address those first, so that people are clear that it isn't my situation which has clouded my judgement of this overall excellent film! * parts of it i felt were unashamedly crowd-pleasing, at the expense of realism. if i had a pound for every time a well-meaning member of the public has mentioned electric-wheelchair racing to me, i'd be much the richer man; but speaking personally, that fits more into the public perception of how we deal with our disadvantages, rather than the reality of what actually goes on. same thing with spending time watching disabled people go to the pub - it's not a big deal to those of us who actually do it, as much as it might be admirable for outsiders looking in. i appreciate that this is from the previously sheltered perspective of michael; but i still think he'd be concentrating more on enjoying the experience, rather than reflecting on what a big deal it was that he was actually there, in the first place. as such, the amount of time we spend seeing them have fun felt like a bit too much.* i felt that the terminal nature of rory's illness was brought to our attention far too late; meaning that it was just used as a cheap sentimental device to come between the pair, rather than something everybody knew all along was going to have to be dealt with.to balance those criticisms, i have to dish out a heap of praise, as well. although i thought some scenes showing them getting to grips with normal life were a touch overdone; the script also ventured into some tricky places i wouldn't have expected, and comes out with a lot of credit for doing so. for instance raising the issue of love and relationships; and showing the daily apparatus often used to aid and assist the lives of non able-bodied people. also, despite the blunt emotional shock tactic of death being sprung upon us, the movie as a whole is far less sappy than anyone has a right to expect these type of films to be.brenda fricker can and has been performing variations of her role capably on autopilot for what seems like years; but robertson and mcavoy share a special interaction that must be noted. inside, i'm doing cartwheels that a group of people somewhere have finally made a film doing justice to the lust for life of many disabled persons.

if you want a film with the full range of emotion, look no further; dramatic and funny, and scenes of wrenching emotion; i can safely guarantee very few will be able to view this warm and very human film without shedding a tear now and then. the acting by the two leads is hard to believe; you would swear the two young men really do suffer from muscular dystrophy (rory) and cerebral palsy (michael); quite simply, two of the finest performances i have ever seen; these are two very believable characters as well, and you never have the feeling things have just been "tossed in" for dramatic purposes or to evoke sympathy. in the dvd release as "extras" they have "deleted scenes" (including an alternate ending) and an "extended party sequence"; why these clips were not included in the final film is hard to understand, as they tie in with the rest of the film perfectly and are in no way superfluous. but without reservation i can heartily recommend this film to anyone; one of the very best i have ever seen.

this is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you. i found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters disability, this was represented in a great performance by both two michael and rory. whether the story is based around a true story i feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human. on the whole this film reach into my soul and i too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity. the whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience, but i feel that theses two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama. certainly one not to be missed!

i got some free tickets via the times to see this little know irish movie called 'inside i'm dancing'... i didn't know a thing about it, so had no preconceptions before i went in.the film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs, and live in a home. michael (steven robertson) suffers from cerabal palsy and rory (james mcavoy) suffers from muscular dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). they form a bond, as rory seems to be the only person who can understand what michael is saying. they eventually leave the home to live in a flat in carrigmore by themselves. they immediately employ the help of an attractive girl (romola garai) to look after them. the two friends eventually both fall in love with the same woman. thats the story in a nutshell, but there are lots of laughs and tears along the way... in fact... being unprepared as i was.. i found the tears were flowing way too often! in fact! i don't think i've cried so much watching a movie since the elephant man!!! this film is a huge drain on the emotions... both in the fun stuff, and the sad stuff. the acting is absolutely spot on! james mcavoy is my tip for greatness... he's a great irish actor and i think he has a great future ahead of him. steven robertson who plays michael was superb too... and it wasn't until today that i found out that he doesn't suffer from cerabal palsy and it was just some superb acting! brenda fricker is also in this film, and plays the part of the home's manager very well. the other great part has to be romola garai, she was wonderful as the love interest, and i reckon we'll be seeing more of her on the big screen in the near future!the thing that makes this film work, is not only the synergies between the two leads, but the script... which is just so #### witty it literally is on fire! i still can't help repeating some of the lines in my head even now.the photography is good, although very bleak, but then it is capturing a certain type of area of ireland. the music is great in this film too, as well as the choice in songs... the use of the johnny cash cover of the nine inch nails track 'hurt' is inspired!! if i had to sum this film up in one word... it would be 'emotional'. this film is very very funny... and then on the turn of a coin its very very sad! i still can't believe that still two days after seeing the film, looking back on it i both laugh and almost cry! this film is amazing... and i hope it goes far! although i can't see that, as its advertising budget is probably very small! so go see it! i urge you... you wont regret it...

i went to the pre-screening of "rory o'shea was here." i like this movie better than i expected, because the excellent casts and the powerful performance. it's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man. rory is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his duchenne muscular dystrophy. he can only move his two fingers but he can talk eloquently and help his new pal, michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. i guess that's enough to start with a weeping drama. well, it is. but with inspiring messages and deeply moving performances. it made me looking at my life for things i take for granted. what would i do if all i can do is to move my two fingers? i should feel grateful for what i have and what i am capable of doing. this is a good flick, although it could have been better.

i've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since i first caught the trailer, and i'm so glad now that i have. it's truly a wonderful film. the actors are superb, the writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was just spot-on. i love james mcavoy in this, and i can't wait to see him in "the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe" movie this december. romola garai is wonderful too. be sure to check her out in "i capture the castle" or "nicholas nickleby," two of my favorite films. overall, i think i liked this movie because it didn't chicken out. it's a difficult subject matter to tell a story about, in that you're very likely to offend a lot of people or mess up and make it into some overly-sentimental-sugary-sweet love fest. but they avoided doing that completely, and instead made a film that's real, honest, and touching, yes, but never over-the-top. very well done. amazingly well done. go out and see it, and you'll know exactly what i mean.

until i saw this film, "life is beautiful" was my favourite film of all time. this film is everything a great film should be. great script, unsurpassed acting and direction that neither approaches the sentimentalism the subject tempts nor leaves it without the emotional impact it demands. this film contains the taste that could not come from hollywood and lacks the pretencion that would come from france. a wonderful movie even above the calibre i have come to expect when i see the handmade films logo come up. i need not go into detail as the previous posts encompass everything why this movie has to be seen by everyone on this planet.

surprisingly effective british drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the "flowering" of one of them. an embittered, "spike"-type youth (mcavoy) with deuchennes md is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (robertson) with cerebral palsy. robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but mcavoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings. the two leads are terrific, especially robertson, who must surely have spent some time studying the disabled to pull off this tricky role. he appears in almost every scene, and acts up an absolute storm. to anyone who doesn't know, they might think he really has cb. highly recommended.

i think i was recommended this film by the lady in the shop i was hiring it from! for once she was bang on! what a superb film! first of all i was convinced james mcavoy & romola garai were irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film i was utterly convinced steven robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure james mcavoy was also! when i watched the special features on the dvd and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise, to say i was blown away would be an understatement!!! i can remember all the acclaim dustin hoffmann got back in the 80's for his portrayal of autism in the film 'rain man' - quite frankly (in my opinion of course!)steven robertson's performance/portrayal blows dustin hoffmann's right out of the water - and he deserves recognition as such!! all in all one of the greatest portrayals of human friendship/love/relationships ever - and it was made in britain/ireland with home grown actors - stick that in yer pipe and smoke it hollywood!

let's get it clear from the start: i am an asshole with the emotional sensitivity of cubic stone. therefore i consider dramas of people with disabilities, social stigma or whatever ailments they have and cry on and on about it as stupid movies with poor taste. i mean, if you have a message, you can tell it without the help of sick or pitiful people.however, i liked this movie. it is about people with incredible bad luck as personal health goes, but they don't cry about it, quite the opposite, they try to live and people try to "protect" or "take care" of them by actively removing them from real life. the message is live life to the fullest, even if the ending is as sad as possible.my conclusion: as sick people dramas go, this one is a keeper. it is sad, yet hopeful. i like james mcavoy, even if he does seem to always play the arrogant rebel. i also say that steven robertson played very well. either that or he really has partial paralysis. :)

i knew nothing about this film until i watched it... my brother in fact suggested i take a look. normally, his suggestions aren't much cop however, but i was stuck for something to watch so i watched it.well, to cut a long story short, i give it 10/10.the film centers around two people, that meet whilst lodging at the same place. one is initially very dependant upon the institution around him, the other is a rebel. one does what he likes, the other as he's told.from the first moments of the film we quickly see the friendship between the two building, and see how they rub off a little on each other. it's a remarkable piece of work, that manages to tell a good story without twist upon twist, people leaping out of bath tubs, or superheros coming to save the day.there's a fair amount of grit and reality in there, not everything can ever go just right - not all gulfs can ever be spanned - and this film delightfully shows the lot.if you watch this film, and are not impressed..... i'd suggest that you don't watch anything again.

damien o'donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalz.this is a fantastic film, its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. tell everyone you know to go see it now- fantastic!the acting is excellent, and dublin plays a starring role. this film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema. i can't wait til it comes out on dvd.

inside i'm dancing (rory o'shea was here)is the story of two handicapped young men, rory o'shea, who is almost completely immobilized and confined to wheelchair, and michael connelly who is debilitated by ms and also confined to a wheelchair.set in ireland, the film opens with rory arriving at a assisted living center. he eventually befriends michael but only after a few tense scenes where rory rebels against the staff and other patients in the usual "movie way" playing loud metal music, using profanity, and general obnoxiousness. his budding friendship with michael is cemented by the fact that rory seems to be the only one who understands michael, or is at least willing to try.eventually, through some trial and tribulation the pair petition, and are granted, the right to live own their own in specially adapted apartment. the apartment is paid for by michael's father who had essentially abandoned him do to his disability. the two also hire an attractive assistant named siobhan (played by romola garai)to help them with their day to day living. this is essentially where the crux of the film develops as both develop feelings for her. michael is struck particularly hard. unfortunately, for both, but michael especially, siobhan does not feel the same and it results in her having to leave. as michael temporarily regresses and wants to return to the asst. living center, rory convinces him to continue to live on his own. the film ends on a sad note, that many viewers may have seen coming, but ultimately, we are left feeling that michael has truly become independent and the future is his, as rory pointed out to him towards the end of movie.you know, i can't say that i've seen a lot of "handicapped films" and i don't know if they could be considered a specific genre. but there is a type of formula to them. one person is unwilling to live beyond his illness until some liberating force compels him/her to do so and inside i'm dancing is really know different. what works however, is it probably is more subtle about the peaks and valleys the two men go through then what you might expect. there are no intentionally gratuitous moments and no "stand up and cheer" manipulations. the sad parts are sad and the funny parts are funny. some viewers might recoil a bit that rory is the spiky haired punk type with the earing in his nose as the too perfect "rebel" cliché, but the actor, james mcavoy, somehow makes it real. the same can be said for steven robertson, who plays michael. when michael's heart is broken it doesn't seem to be invoked by a poor script trying to get the audience worked up, but rather a young man genuinely in pain over unrequited love. the kind of pain many can relate to whatever their physical condition. again, these are the types of things that make the film work and make it poignant without being overbearing and enjoyable on many levels.recommended.

okay. you saw the film and i saw the film. true? if not, there are plenty of plot summaries out there, and there is absolutely no reason for us to waste time on any feeble attempts of mine to create another.the most stunning aspect of the film is unquestionably the performances by the two young men and the young lady in the leads. their emotional honesty was as compelling, if not more so, than any performances i've seen in recent months. i found i laughed, cried and cringed right along with them, and that's saying a great deal because i'm often called a jaded and cynical jerk.as one would expect, the story is rife with clichés and i suppose that's the achilles heel of the picture. it's a story we've all seen many times before; we all know how it will end from the moment they introduce rory. though you may not know exact mechanics, you know there will be a transformative friendship, a bittersweet romance and a gut-wrenching conclusion. if it weren't for the strong cast and directing, this film would be nothing more than the soporific swill that comprises eighty percent of the hallmark channel's program schedule.

ok, maybe it doesn't deserve an oscar. or a golden globe. or any award, for that matter. the acting isn't outstanding, there's no reason to give credits to the directing, and its really just another semi-gory 21st century slasher flick that most people will consider just decent. or maybe even dreadful. but in my opinion, all of this doesn't matter a bit. and thats because i had a great time watching this movie.sure, the first 40 minutes are pretty slow, but as the movie progresses, something in it you will like, if you are like i was, and anybody else should be when watching this movie. and that is: looking for 2 hours of fun, mindless violence. (and a kick-ass ending, which i won't spoil.) yes, there are many flaws in this movie, but don't let the cast list on the front cover fool you. hilton delivers a decent performance that nobody saw coming. even her greatest haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a strip-tease that wasn't as nasty as anything an online pop-up would promise of her, but still not so unbearable as to fast-forward or turn off the dvd.the violence in this surprised me; nobody at school or on the horror board was talking about it like they were about "these new movies called 'saw' and 'hostel'" but i could safely say that "wax" was more graphic than saw, and some death scenes were actually quite disturbing.in conclusion, i'm not surprised house of wax didn't make a place on the imdb top 250, but it is definitely worth a look.

my college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. i have got to say that i think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. though, my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if paris hilton can act. by the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. i'm not exactly one of her fans, but i must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. overall, all the actor's were very good. i'm not gonna go into detail for the plot since i'm sure you know about it. surpirsisngly, the characters are pretty engaging and you actually care for them, especially elisha cuthbert and chad michael murray's characters. we meet them as rival siblings and end with them having to work together. another plus is that it does not have the sleek look of amityville horror or texas chainsaw massacre and feels almost documentary-like rather than a music video (don't get me wrong, i loved texas chainsaw and enjoyed amityville).now for the death scenes. in most slasher movies, whenever a character is stabbed or killed, the scene immediately cuts away to another scene,but not in this one. when a character is about to die, they die pretty gruesomely. but the filmmakers don't stop there and add a little something extra each time for each victim. i won't say anything about the death scenes and will let you see them for yourself.while this is a great slasher movies, it does have the flaws of almost all slasher films (exploring a creepy house when you shouldn't be, getting a ride with a suspicious character, splitting up, and screaming so the killer can hear you). also, there is a kinda stupid plot twist that was unnecessary and didn't add to the film at all. you could tell it was just added in at the last moment and if you took it out, it would not have affected the movie at all.basically, if you are a horror film fan, see this movie. you will not be disappointed. it's got all that's needed to make it a great slasher film, possibly the best of the year even though it's kinda early. the suspense is felt and it is at times a funny movie. if you hate horror films, chances are you may like this one and if you are divided, i encourage you to give it a shot.

**1/2 elisha cuthbert, chad michael murray, brian van holt, paris hilton and jon abrahams. directed by jaume collet-serra.yet another classic horror film remade with dunder-headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. based on the 1953 vincent price film house of wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like tobe hooper's 1974 classic texas chainsaw massacre later remade, despite creativity and so-so acting the movie was still just a gore picture. director serra showed mild enthusiasm with his directing but still worth watching. my final rating 7/10.

i've never seen the original "house of wax" so i really didn't know what to expect when i went to a sneak preview of the new film. after a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters, "house of wax" shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.the plot really doesn't matter too much here - i think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. it's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch. viewers who like their horror movies with lots of blood will be satisfied here, but there are other ghoulish effects as well. the production design and sets are excellent, and the cast makes the most of their under-written roles.of course, many people are probably wondering just how paris hilton's performance is. to be honest, hilton acquits herself quite well, and she doesn't portray "herself," as so many people are predicting. her character is sexy and sweet, and i think her good work will hopefully change a lot of people's opinions about her. elisha cuthbert is also good, moving up from her previous movie, the atrocious "the girl next door." her character is put through a lot, and cuthbert proves to be a feisty heroine. chad michael murray, like hilton and cuthbert, is pretty to look at, but unfortunately is not very convincing as the "bad boy" of the group.i predict good things for "house of wax," as the audience at the screening i attended hollered, screamed and clapped through out many parts of the movie. congrats to the cast and crew for a job well done.and a congrats to paris hilton for proving a lot of people wrong. like she always says - "that's hot."

i do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. it's one of the best "teenager" horror films i've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (a clear example is the mindless "saint ange".) the first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted. after the arrival to the village, though, the horror -a different, twisted kind of horror- begins.with the plot and the details, goofs are minor; the characters are this movie's strongest point, given that so many clichés are broken in it. for example, the two main male characters, nick and wade, are not by any means the idiotic types we're used to; although dalton might fit better in this stereotype, not is he the only one to pay for this lack of consciousness. some scenes are truly, satisfyingly horrible, making up for tense moments scattered around all the film. and, in the end, and although everything is decorously explained, it's easy to see that things won't go so easy to the surviving characters.the only errors i can see, and which do not imply continuity (ie, carly not finding her own cut finger in the unconscious bo's pockets) is the illumination, which is somehow annoying during the first, boring 30 minutes. although, plot and effects-wise, everything is drastically and cruelly twisted with the arrival of the main characters to ambrosia, that little village in the midst of nothing, so i'll give it that. it's been pretty much argued that about 70% of the movie is illogical; "how can two people build an entire house of wax?", "where do they get all the wax from?". these wouldn't be uprising questions if people would have paid more attention to the movie. the sinclair brothers did not build the house of wax; their mother worked making actual wax figures, and they were exhibited at the museum. and the scenario where paris hilton's unfortunate character meets her untimely death is the answer to the second question; what is with all the personal objects (mobile phones, cars, clothes) of the dead people? using their third brother as a connection with the exterior, it's pretty much arguable that the sinclair twins should obtain the money necessary to buy the wax, in a wwii-type fashion.so, that aside, i think the movie deserves a lot more than it gets, and nobody should lose the chance to watch it. so go see the house of wax. right now.

while house of wax will never be mistaken for texas chainsaw massacre or halloween, it does try and ultimately succeed in being a worthy addition to quality horror film making. there is enough tension and enough implied gore in here to please the young audience of today and there is also enough explicit gore to please some of the purists of yesterday. overall, it is quite a well done film that should do okay on dvd.six kids on the way to a football game get stranded in a deliverance like setting and what ensues actually looks like it may have been taken out a discarded deilverance sequel and the backwoods hicks seem to taunt the group. eventually the group has to break up and half of them head into the desolate town to get some car parts. the other half of the group stays behind at camp and this sets up the second half of the film.house of wax has many strengths. the first is that it is blessed with a very likable cast. paris hilton is fine in her role but she is far from the focal point. chad michael murray, elisabeth cuthbert and brian van holt are three very charismatic actors and their presence in the film adds some panache, some credibility and some flair. i had never really heard of chad michael murray, only that he was a pin-up type teen heartthrob. but he has a presence to him. he imbues an intangible to him that seems to translate into his performance. he is instantly likable and he possesses a strong character trait. i enjoyed his performance much more than i figured i would and when he was on screen, the film flowed.the question now becomes, "is this film a worthy horror film?" and the answer to that is a resounding yes. as i mentioned off the top, it is not in the same class a nightmare on elm street or last house on the left, or even the ring, but it is relatively tense, quite graphic and there are some very inventive death scenes. this is not the house of wax that your parents told you about. vincent price is nowhere to be seen and when you start seeing fingers being cut off and hot wax covering comatose bodies, you realize this film is a little on the edge.i'd like to see an uncut director's x rated version. i bet there is one out there somewhere that would be much more violent than this one. be that as it may, this is a very good entry into the horror genre and it is heads and shoulders above weak films like i know what you did last summer and dark water and a few others. it is definitely worth a look.8/10

i wasn't expecting to much of this movie when i went into the theater but i had been waiting for it for many years. to sum it up, it was pretty damn good! chad michael murray was pretty good, i thought he was going to be another chris flynn from wrong turn but i was wrong. elisha cuthbert was also good but the best performance has to go to brian van holt. he played the bad guy too well, i mean he was sick, sadistic, and very cruel. the back story between the brothers was good, plus i liked how no killings took place until about 40 minutes into the film. it gave you time to pick the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die. jon abrahams was pretty good as the goofy best bud of cmm. i liked how chad kind of cried when he found him dead, it was better then just him being like, "whatever, my buddy is dead, who cares". it showed how he really cared. so overall, this was a darn god slasher with some great effects. bravo!

i do not think i am alone when i say that 2005 has not been particularly kind to the horror genre. while "cursed", "hide and seek", "the ring two", and "the amityville horror" all showed glimpses of interest and potential, there have been more misses than hits. for proof, see: "white noise", "boogeyman", "the jacket", "mindhunters", and "alone in the dark". imagine my surprise when "house of wax", tightly written by siblings chad and carey hayes, turned out to be... well, a surprise.carly jones (elisha cuthbert) is a young woman, traveling with her trouble-making brother, nick (chad michael murray), and boyfriend, wade (jared padalecki). they are, along with paige (paris hilton), blake (robert ri'chard), and dalton (jon abrahams), hoping to score tickets to the final football game of the season. along the way, they run into some car trouble, and are forced to enter a desolate town where nothing is what it appears to be.upon hearing of this, a remake of the classic vincent price b-movie, i rolled my eyes. i did not even want to think about what disaster freshman director jaume serra had cooked up for his audience. in a time when most high-profile horror films are disappointments, latent with bad writing, static direction, and amateur acting, i consider myself lucky that serra and the hayes brothers took it upon themselves to make a good, old-fashioned, spook fest. unlike the disappointments that i named before, this flick pulls no punches, and uses every cinematic trick in the book to give everyone exactly what they came for.i am happy that the hayes' actually took the time and effort to create likable and believable characters, thus making the events that much more urgent. it also gives the young actors portraying them something grip on. as she did in "the girl next door", elisha cuthbert proves to audiences what a skilled actress she really is. in the 2003 remake of "the texas chainsaw massacre", jessica biel silenced naysayers by delivering a raw and emotional performance, one that put the viewer right there with her. here, cuthbert does the same. chad michael murray ("a cinderella story"), in one of his first more mature roles, is no slacker as nick. murray exudes charisma and a hard edge, as well as some impressive athleticism on top of it. murray and cuthbert gel perfectly, and have tangible, familial chemistry.more so than anything else, the press and the american public have made a field day about paris hilton's major acting debut. as i expected, hilton does not embarrass herself. in fact, she is just as good as anyone else in the movie (do with that what you will). like cuthbert and murray, hilton has screen presence. she is sexy and playful. i cannot think one of reason why she's gotten the worst of the film's harsh reception, other than they are simply picking on her. jared padalecki (tv's 'gilmore girls') memorably manages to overcome his underwritten role. robert ri'chard (tv's 'cousin skeeter') and jon abrahams ("meet the parents") do not have much to work with, but get the job done. with only one scene, damon herriman ("soar") makes an unforgettable impression, and his presence hangs over the rest of the film. finally, brian van holt ("basic") is superb and threatening in a dual role.once more, kudos must go to the screenwriters for avoiding clichés whenever possible. despite popular opinion, "house of wax" is quite unpredictable for a majority of its running time. take this for example: it seems as if the killer is down for the count and carly bends down to retrieve something from his pockets. what do you expect to happen? see the movie, and you will understand what i mean. it is also refreshing to see a horror film in which the characters show even a modicum of good sense.unlike most horror scores, john ottman's exhilarating work never distracts. however, as with dark castle's other releases, the visual aspects of "wax" are award-worthy, and lift the film above its genre trappings. the talents of cinematographer stephen f. windon, production designer graham walker, art director nicholas mccallum, and editor joel negron highlight the ghoulish imagery. speaking of imagery, i believe that the gore hounds will be thrilled with the many makeup effects and tricks in store here. each death scene is more stomach churning than the last. considering his past in music videos and commercials, it is obvious that jaume serra has a great eye for style. his "in-your-face" approach is a great asset to this film's success. just when you think the camera will turn away, it does not. he is also particularly good a building thick layers of dread and atmosphere. one standout shot is our introduction to the killer, as he slowly emerges from a trap door.in a case like this, i would usually admit when i am in the minority (shut up, okay? i liked "house of 1000 corpses"!). in this case, i firmly that the detractors have gotten it wrong. i am not sure why people are so hard on this film, considering it's much better than recent genre entries. maybe they're afraid to admit that a horror flick starring paris hilton could possibly be worth watching... who knows? this is a horror film, and a commendably stylish and effective one at that. as a lifelong horror fan, all i can say is that i thoroughly enjoyed "house of wax", in all of its lurid and sadistic glory. i safely consider it a great accomplishment in modern horror, as well as (along with "sin city") the first completely satisfying release of 2005.

i saw a sneak preview of this tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! after seeing sneak peaks for boogeyman (horrible! 3/10) and amityville remake (so-so 6/10) i enjoyed this a lot more! as seen in the trailer, one knock i had was believing that a whole town could be "forgotten" but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so i accept it for what it is.my only major complaint is i assumed paris hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan "that's hot" but they didn't do that (how could they resist???).there is no nudity from the 2 girls although paris looks great in her lingerie! i'm surprised they didn't put a 3rd "hot token victim" in the movie for some needless nudity which is the norm for this type of flick! i won't list any death or plot spoilers but i will say that paris & eliza both get roughed up good! the characters are developed decently and are somewhat likable (not like cabin fever where you wanted them to die) and the movie has a decent pace although nothing happens in the 1st 30 minutes like most horror films.i give it a 8/10 as it delivered good scares and gore and i had low expectations going into it. if you go with some friends that like cheesy horror movies you'll have a good time.noah

a lot of people are flaming this film for the presence of paris hilton, but this is not a fair reason to object to the movie. the reality is that paris has a fairly minimal part, she spends the vast majority of the movie off screen. the film also makes fun of her on several occasions, usually involving a camera and at least once in night vision. for those who enjoy paris hiltons stage presence, this may be a movie to see at home when its released on video, because at the screening i was at, we all laughed at her misfortunes through the movie and she is portrayed as a "woman of questionable values".the movie itself was pretty good (unlike the recent flood of weak horror flicks), it has everything a good horror should; a creepy villain, excessive violence, acts which make that average person cringe...this movie hit all the bases. it is definitely worth a watch.

i'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on imdb when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film. this is the definition of being a horror film. i consider myself to be a big horror fan and i must say that this house delivers the goods. house of wax is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo. upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part. the town is creepy and i'm just gonna stop there. because thats when the truly gruesome mayhem begins. trust me when i say if your looking for a horror film go see this you will love it. it's wonderfully diabolical and inventive with it's killing scenes, the story is interesting and the characters are decently drawn with the actors giving them gobs of personality. paris hilton included whom does quite well with her part. the film lies a little on the shallow side but it's so much fun and who cares. this movie should eat up the box office and all horror fans should have part in it. go see house of wax the film that features skin being peeled, super glued lips, dead animal carcasses, hot wax sprayed on a still living person, a finger being cut off, a decapitation, a pole through the head and much more. i was lucky enough to witness this film at the tribeca premiere and all the actors were on hand to promote the film. and boy do they have something to be proud of house of wax is the scariest roller coater ride of the year! 9/10

lana turner proved that she could really dance up a storm in this 1940 charmer about the ultimate sacrifice that her sister (joan blondell) makes for her.when both sisters come to new york, they follow blondell's beau, a wonderful george murphy, in this film. as fate would have it, the director of the show is impressed with turner but sees nothing ahead for blondell except a job as the cigarette-girl. not only does blondell miss stardom, boyfriend, murphy (eddie) falls for turner as well. so as not to hurt her sister, turner is ready to marry the producer of the show, a wealthy womanizer who has wed 4 times.the story concludes as best as possible with blondell taking a fast exit back to nebraska. look for paul ford, as a gossip columnist in the film. he is hard to recognize due to the date of the film and the fact that he is much thinner. the film leaves you with the question of whether ford and blondell could ever get together.blondell, as the devoted sister, sacrifices both career and love, for her sister. this film is sentimental and might have worked better if it had been shot in technicolor.few realize that george murphy, the future republican senator from california, was quite a song and dance man in his day.

the revelation here is lana turner's dancing ability. though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, miss turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film.so, viewers take notice! here, mgm were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet, and were, therefore, consigning her to everything from andy hardy to doctor kildaire.in "two girls on broadway," however, she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number, "my wonderful one, let's dance." this number, is conceived and filmed, as a sort of hybrid between a busby berkely style extravaganza and the sort of routines hermes pan was designing for astaire and rogers at rko.thus, the number opens with george murphy and miss turner depicted as bar patrons (with full chorus) before a curtain of black lame wherein mr. murphy croons the number to miss turner. then the camera, (on a boom) pulls backward in a remarkable crane shot to reveal an enormous stage, and a rotating set equipped with steps, columns, enclosures and sliding walls.from this point on, murphy and turner execute a fast stepping variety of moods and attitudes, including lifts, spins, soft shoe, and ending with an electrifying series of conjoined pirouettes that concludes with murphy both lifting and rotating turner with thrilling speed to a racing orchestra.all told a dizzying feat that proves miss turner was fully capable of more than holding her own as a dancer, though i daresay most of her admirers would balk at relinquishing her from her throne as the queen of melodrama.

i never realized what a fabulous dancer lana turner was until i saw this movie. she was only 19 years old and gorgeous. what a pleasure to watch her dance with george murphy. the story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special. i never tire of watching fred and ginger but lana turner in this movie was just as terrific. i always thought of lana as a so-so actress who tended to over act. she should have done more dancing and less of the maddam x and peyton place roles. i had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing. too bad the "academy" doesn't give an "oscar" for dancing.

i was really surprised to see that unlike most documentaries, this was written, directed and produced by a film critic-- richard schickel. most of the times i know of where film critics had major involvement in films, the films turns out to be bombs (rex reed starring in "myra breckenridge" and roger ebert writing "beyond the valley of the dolls" are prime examples). however, in this case, the critic's powers are used for good and not evil--and the results are better (though this isn't saying much, as the films i just mentioned are among the worst films ever made).as for the documentary, it's narrated by clint eastwood (a pretty good choice) and manages to discuss his long career--from his silent days until his death in the early 1960s. the only negatives, and they are slight, are that the film is awfully short (as are most film documentaries) and there is very little about gary cooper as a human being--you really don't learn all that much about his life. however, as a nice overview of his films, it works very well.

richard schickel's 1991 documentary about gary cooper - "gary cooper: american life, american legend" gives us a look at the tremendous, all-american star through his films and his life. narrated by clint eastwood, the theme is definitely "gary coooper, american" as we are taken through fast clips of his many appearances in westerns, and scenes from "meet john doe," "mr. deeds goes to town, and "sgt. york." the best part of the documentary is the home movies of cooper and his family as well as his childhood photos, showing him as a beautiful blonde kid with the sunny smile he would have his entire life. there is also a hilarious clip of cooper on "the jack benny show" doing the comeback on the number "bird dog" - and benny loses it. the documentary also takes us briefly through his tumultuous affair with patricia neal, which nearly ruined both their lives.there's a certain cohesiveness missing from this bio/retrospective - it jumps around a lot and has no footage of cooper being interviewed, which would have added a lot. also, clint eastwood's narration was described as unobtrusive. what it was, was boring and monotone. given that cooper himself tended to be the strong, silent type on screen, we could have used a little animation.on a personal note, gary cooper was one of the handsomest men who ever lived - there were some looks at him in his early films, but not nearly enough for this fan. that smile, those lips, that bone structure - he was handsome throughout his life, but in films like "morocco" and "desire," he is devastating. instead of sitting through a scene from one of his worst performances, as howard roark in "the fountainhead," giving a speech that he admitted to the author he did not understand - a young, suave cooper in a tux would have been a nice touch. this documentary, alas, was definitely produced by a man.

exclusively for coop's lovers, though clint eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film. it is a biography of gary cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (picasso, hemingway, etc.), as an older man, finally as a sick and close-to-death man. after "the end", i did not have the feeling that i knew the man any much better. but i have spent a very good moment, re-viewing many of the best moments of his movies; and my respect for the very talented actor and great professional was increased tenfold. the film shows, most interestingly, how the career of cooper can be paralleled with the evolution of usa society before and after ww2. two of the great moments are the time when cooper has to answer justice about communism in the movie world; and when james stewart (a very great one, too) received an award for cooper one month before his death. i'm not a weeping pot, but... that was a close one! watch it, if you can: it is so much worth while. ... if you love cooper, that is. or an older america...

are you crazy or what? this movie has talent who are you to criticize a movie that was made by famous directors and producers? i mean you must be watching some crappy version because if you had a proper version you wouldn't think its some low resolution game graphics..this movie is for people who enjoy hongkong cinema the other side to what asian people enjoy watching.. you are such a sellout.. hongkong cinema is totally different to that of hollywood, hk cinema is in a class of its own...so if you don't enjoy watching movies from hongkong producers don't go and ramble on about how its a waste of time to watch.. just let other people enjoy the movie..and personally i've seen this movie and i love its story and the way it was made..

this film was adapted from the well known sutra on journey to the west where a monk with his three students seek out to find a long lost book with regards to the teaching of buddha.though this movie is not as solemn as the previous films made according to the legend, it did however, managed to bring in romance and fun-filled humorous scene.this real objective of this movie revolves around more on the monk who were primarily saved from being eaten by demonic flying creatures. one of his student, the monkey god managed to get him out from the battle in the nick of time, but were in turn captured by the demons and cast into the deep throat of a dragon, locked up in that particular dungeon.the monk awoke in a small village where he found mei yan (the so called ugly serpent daughter) who fell in love over him at first sight. though ugly, she did not let her appearance be casted aside from getting to him. however, a quest for rescuing his three students soon turn out to be filled with obstacles and each of which turned out to get worse with mei yan following the monk. problems crept deeper and this is where conflicts between the relationship gets worse.the rest of the tale would be left at your own disposal, but suffice to say, this film does not depict the typical storyline of the book, it is more for those who wants to seek out for a funny and light picture of what journey to the west and the love obstacles really mean.towards the very end, the whole summary could be described with only one word, and that is love. the monk went to show the heavenly gates, the celestial palace and buddha himself how love can overcome even the worst fear of all and deemed fit as the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of superior powers.a wonderfully created and funny acts awaits those who buys this ticket. there would be of course, no regrets, at least from my side and those who were with me at the cinema that day watching the same film.

right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie i've seen in a very long time. granted i spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once i had accepted that i would never understand everything from the subtitles i was able to enjoy the film.can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy? what does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? why does buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings? does any of this matter when faced with the sheer sumptuousness of the visuals and the sly humour of the characters. any battle for my heart was won once i saw the main protagonist dressed as spider-man - awesome! many people will complain about a lack of story cohesion but for a fun movie to laugh about with a bunch of mates you can't do better, especially if you do an alcoholic shot every time someone says "i will love you 10,000 years".

legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star conrad radzoff (splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by ferdy mayne) dies of a heart attack. a bunch of drama school students steal radzoff's corpse from its crypt and take it to a rundown mansion so they can party with it. radzoff comes back to life and picks off the rude youths for desecrating his grave. writer/director norman thaddeus vane concocts a fresh, original, and even pretty stylish spin on the usual body count premise, offers a neat evocation of the glitzy hollywood milieu, and does a sturdy job of maintaining a pleasingly misty and spooky ooga-booga atmosphere. the kill set pieces deliver the grisly goods, with a gal being set on fire, a juicy decapitation (the severed head rolls right down the stairs and onto the lawn so a raven can peck away at it!), and another poor lass being crushed with a levitating coffin rating as the definite gruesome highlights. kudos are also in order for the stellar cast of familiar b-flick faces: mayne has a deliciously eye-rolling ball with his flashy role, leon askin contributes an amusing cameo as bitter washed-up director wolfgang, nita talbot adds some class as flaky psychic medium mrs. rohmer, plus there are nice turns by luca bercovici as jerky drama student ringleader saint, jennifer starrett as the sweet meg, jeffrey combs as the geeky stu, and scott thomson as the nerdy bobo. popping up in cool bits are chuck "porky" mitchell as a detective, patrick wright in one of his customary policeman parts, and tallie cochrane as a corpse. joel king's polished cinematography gives the film an attractive glossy look. the moody score by jerry mosely likewise hits the shuddery spot. a fun little fright flick.

ugh, what an embarrassing episode last night! it was either a failed script for "abc afterschool special", or the product of an earnest rookie writer, just out of college, making an homage to that classic pc anti-gun homily from 1974, "the gun". in fact hubby & were disappointed that the closing shot wasn't of the gun being melted down like in the movie!no, i'm not some nra shill. it's just that when the producer of an intelligent & nuanced series gets it in his head that i should be subjected to a didactic dramatization of his personal cause, i'd appreciate it if the lecture at least wasn't delivered via 2-by-4. geez!ok, the sociology lesson is over. the message has been delivered. the important episode has been aired. now let's get back to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence.

i have never missed an episode. david morse is a wonderful actor and i am hoping that this show can survive. it certainly beats out that csi crap. i love the storyline and would actually like to see him as a cop again someday. i give the show a 10.

"ahh...i didn't order no amazing hit show"....."we'll you got one" hack is simply the greatest television show ever made. a little bit of me died when i flicked on the t.v. one friday night to catch a little hack and it wasn't on. the show dug deep into key social issues of our culture. i found that at the end of any episode i watched; i walked away having been both entertained and informed. i am actually dumber now that hack is gone. i no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate. since hack has been gone i see them as eyesore's and an unneeded strain on taxpayers. so for the love of god we need to bring back hack!

he's not your conventional cab driver.this guys got issues. with his wife, with his son, a priest, all his fares, his ex-partner and most of all himself. and the greatest thing is they just throw us all into it. so we have to keep watching to find out more about his past.the idea may not be original but david morse makes it so. i think this is a great show, and i hope people catch-on before the season's over. watch this show!!!!!!!!!

this is not your run-of-the mill police story where the characters were only secondary to the gun battles and car chases. the episodes, so far, are more realistic and intelligent.if you are looking for something with a lot of butt-kicking rambo-style cop story, you will not find it here.i gave it a 9. i wish this series lives long. morse is excellent!

everywhere i hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched....well maybe a do-good cab driver in philly is pushing it a little (at least the cab drivers ive met), but that's what makes the show great.the fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun. its highly watchable and even though u know mike wins out in the end he never wins in life. david morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role. his supporting cast is great and i must say the location of the show is especially great!all in all i watch this show not because im looking for a good dose of reality or a show with lots of action, i watch this show because its got great acting, a good premise, and a great story-line every week. it's also a plus when i can pick out the landmarks he drives by, or know what intersection he's at. i love this show and i love philly!! give this show a shot!

it is nice to see a show that has a little more content than just blood and guts for a change! as an added bonus, it is nice to see some local home boys from massachusetts making good in l.a. i hope this show will be a keeper.

an extremely dark and brooding show with an excellent cast. one of the few shows that i try to watch on a regular basis. glad to see bebe neuwirth in a recurring role, but feel andre braugher is underutilized. he is one intense actor! hope cbs gives it a better time slot next season.

okay, so this series kind of takes the route of 'here we go again!' week in, week out david morse's character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle - but what's wrong with that!? david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there, and certainly the coolest, and to have him in a series created by david koepp - a great writer - is heaven!!due to the lack of love for this show by many, i can't see it going to a season series - but you never know? the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me - let's hope something good can make it past a first series!!!

i consider this a breathtaking but deceptive film because it seems so simple and straightforward: a vietnam survivor tells his harrowing tale and some of the story is reenacted on location. reviewers sometimes even claim that herzog's presence in the film is minimal, but how wrong they are. we know that all documentaries are "mediated" to some extent and this one has herzog's subtle hand all over it, most notably in the stunning music, the unbelievably expert selection of archival footage, and the management of cascading images. the evocative power of this film is astounding, starting with its title, the opening title card from the book of "revelation," and the initial voice-over. this is a movie that one can watch repeatedly with increasing wonder, not a simple commodity that is gulped down with one's favorite beverage on the way to the evening news. this is one of those movies that can resonate with you for a lifetime.

(some spoilers) early 1930's educational movie about the horrors of contracting a social disease and the consequences that come along with it: blindness madness loss of ones abilities to function as well as infecting other people with it, even one's unborn children, and finally death. "damaged lives" is far ahead of it's times in educating it's viewers about the dangers venereal deasise. viewed now over 70 years after it's release back in 1933 is as good, if not better, then the many films about that subject made back in the 1940's 1950's and even 1960's.donald bradley, lyman williams, is a top executive of a major shipping company who's been going study with his girlfriend joan, diane sinclair, for some time. both are finally planing to get married and raise a family. out at a party one evening donald meets elsie cooper, charlotte merriam, and together they have one drink too many and before you know it end up spending the night together in elsie's home. thinking nothing of his one night stand with elsie donald later marries his long time love joan and they both plan to have a child, or so they thought. at the office donald get a panicked call from elsie telling him to come over to her place right away about something very important. rushing over donald finds out, to his horror, that elsie has a sexual infection that she got from her boyfriend nat, harry myers, and that she may have given it to donald, and he in turn may have infected his wife joan. telling elsie that she's wrong about him being infected and that she should seek medical attention elsie shoots herself as donald is just about to leave. getting over elsie's tragic death donald gets another surprise later when his doctor dr. bill hill, jason robards sr, comes over to his office telling him to immediately come with him to the hospital to talk to infectious disease specialist dr. vincent leonard, murray kinnell, about his wife joan who's just been admitted there. the terrible truth about donald and his wife joan hits him like a bolt out of the blue and leaves him speechless, just like it did joan earlier. both have been infected and the infection is the dreaded and unspeakable,back in the 1930's, infection called venereal disease. told by dr. leonard that it would take some two years of treatment for both donald and joan to be completely cured it leaves joan in a state of dangerous suicidal thoughts. later in the film joan, feeling that she has nothing to live for, closes all the windows in her and donald's apartment and turns on the gas stove, full blast, in order to kill herself and donald who was asleep at the time. honest film about the ravages of venereal disease and the damage that it does to those who are infected by it, both psychically as well as mentally, and how it could be cured if given immediate medical care instead of hiding it from one's doctor and keeping it hidden, for fear of shame and embarrassment, until it's too late.

yes, this movie was just hilarious and the acting was top notch from the whole cast. except shelley winters german accent wasn't that great but then that doesn't matter as she is hardly in the film. so if you're a fan of hers beware! the two main stars of this film are laurence harvey and julie harris. now before this film, i'd only see miss harris in east of eden with james dean and i own an audio tape of the glass menagerie that she did on stage with monty clift and jessica tandy, so i wasn't sure how she'd be in this role and boy, did she impress me. how hammy was she? i love ham! ;-) mr. harvey, he tickled my fancy! i am now a full time laurence harvey fan! that hair!!! *cackles* omg! it's almost like burt lancasters, that crazy messy look, it doesn't get better than that. he is young and so innocent in this film. see it now! it's definitely in my top ten! :) i am so glad i found a copy that is all mine! unfortunately this movie is out of print and very hard to find on video. :(btw, watch out for the hospital hotel room scene!!!!! it's one of the best parts! or when mr. harvey has convinced himself he's ill and he's trying to get his knee to kick, you know how doctors do with that little rubber hammer ;-) well he does it himself and his leg kicks and it kicks the table *squeals* check out the look on his face, so innocent!!!! i can't describe it but to all those people who say he couldn't act very well and other cockamamie comments, see this film and you will see what a great actor he really was. you'll be bowled over! if you aren't, then i'm afraid there is nothing i can do for you, you're hopeless. ;-)

turning isherwood's somewhat dark and utterly brilliant novel into light comedic romp could easily have been a recipe for disaster, but somewhow it wasn't . the story moves at a zanily rapid pace and the black and white imagery is gorgeous, as are harvey and harris as they ham their way through a wacky weimar berlin. fun!

this british film version of the stage play i am a camera is based on christopher isherwood's "berlin stories." this is the source material for the famous musical cabaret.julie harris, a major stage actress of her day, reprises her 1951 tony award winning role as sally bowles. she's a far cry from the liza minnelli character but the basic "sally" is all here despite the various film codes that would have blocked this story from being filmed in hollywood. harris is perhaps stagy but she's also quite good as the madcap and maddening sally. her singing number is obviously dubbed (by marlene dietrich no less) although harris apparently sings for herself in other moments.laurence harvey (with the very ugly hair) plays isherwood with zero charm and can't even make the character interesting. shelley winters does little with the role of natalia (marian winters won a supporting tony for the play), and anton diffring is ok as fritz. ron randell plays the caddish clive but seems a tad loud. lee seidl is funny as the landlady.yet despite the overall staginess and cheap look, harris takes center stage and she is amazing. this film was released the same year as east of eden in which harris gives a glowing performance as abra. comparing the two performances gives a good look at the talent miss harris possesses. these two characters couldn't be more unalike. harris' sally preens and prances about and growls out a very lascivious laugh. she also acts circles around the boring harvey.without the music and with a familiar storyline, many viewers may find little here to recommend this film, but it's a great chance to see the great julie harris repeating what was probably a very shocking role in 1951.

i have just seen this delightful classic again after many years, the next to last film directed by henry cornelius, who died three years later at the age of only 45 (the same age at which the film's male star larry harvey was also to die in 1973). three future directors were in the crew: jack clayton (associate producer), guy green (cinematographer), and clive donner (editor). this film is based upon the autobiographical story 'goodbye to berlin' by the well-known british author christopher isherwood, which was first turned into a play by john van druten, then made into this film, then turned into a musical, 'cabaret', and finally filmed as 'cabaret', which brought the amazing liza minelli to world attention, with her voice which can shatter a glass at the distance of a mile. isherwood appears as a character in the film under his own name. he was gay, but in those days that was illegal and could land him in prison, so he disguises his proclivities under the description of being what he calls 'a confirmed bachelor'. this is the key to his platonic relationship with the wildly eccentric, wacky, promiscuous, ever-cheerful and thoroughly unique character whom he calls sally bowles. the portrait of sally bowles in this film is a tour-de-force by the young julie harris, who sweeps every scene into a magical and captivating web of sparkling personal charm. what a vehicle for an actress with plenty of charm of her own! it is one of the great cinematic performances of the 1950s. isherwood is played to perfection by the young lawrence harvey, in a finely-judged performance which never allows the comedy to go over the edge, and even the moments of farce bordering on slapstick remain somehow 'almost believable'. larry is so funny at portraying a wimpish hypochondriac. what an irony, considering the total lack of hypochondria shown by his bravery and stoicism in the last year of his life as he died from terminal stomach cancer and behaved with such dignity and lack of complaint. i knew him well in the last three years or so, and he was a generous, warm, and modest person. he adored his little girl domino, now alas also tragically dead.this film was his finest early performance, to be followed by his spectacular work in 'room at the top' (1959), 'summer and smoke' (1961) and 'the manchurian candidate' (1962). larry was often undervalued in his lifetime because he was too handsome, was often cast as a cad, and glamour boys are not always accepted as good actors, but many of the finest actresses played opposite him, and they were in no doubt of his abilities, and he was a strong lead in many of the most important films of his time. if he had lived beyond middle age, he would have gone from strength to strength and become a 'grand old man' of the screen. sitting in his house in hampstead one day, he gave me a glass of his usual white wine from a huge barrel which he had brought from some foreign cellar. i said he always gave me such delicious wine, what was it? he proudly answered that it was a sancerre which he had chosen himself at the vineyard in france and had shipped over specially. he then added with extreme wistfulness: 'you know, i've been waiting for four years for someone to comment on it and ask me what it is, and you are the first person who has ever done so.' what mattered to him was to be recognised for having taste in wine,and his more glamorous friends had denied him that satisfaction. in this film, anton diffring gives a touching early performance as an earnest young man (later he was to have to play nazi officers far too much, poor fellow), and the young shelley winters plays a rich german jewish girl, in her usual noisy but effective manner, but it was not too difficult, as she was a noisy jewish girl herself anyway. this film has such an air of joie de vivre about it, that it is pure delight.

hindsight is a wonderful thing. much reviled when it first appeared, (inspiring the famous review 'me no leica'), this precursor of "cabaret" can now be looked at in comparison and it's not half bad. it's certainly no classic but it has its own wayward charm, (the film version of "cabaret" follows this plot whereas the stage version changed the plot somewhat). one should, of course, resist the temptation to snicker when laurence harvey's christopher isherwood, (it keeps the original author's real name; god knows what isherwood thought of it), describes himself as 'a confirmed bachelor' and while harvey is an utterly inadequate 'hero', (he's virtually asexual), and shelly winters woefully miscast as fraulien landauer, (the part marisa berenson played in "cabaret"), julie harris is a perfectly marvellous sally, (it's a lovely piece of comic acting), and anton diffring is first-rate as fritz, the german-jew in love with shelly's character. of course, if "cabaret" had never come along you might ask yourself would this ever have seen the light of day again. that it has been revived may not quite be cause for celebration but it's perfectly acceptable all the same.

george carlin is probably my favorite comedian. i have seen so many of his specials and even had the opportunity to see him perform live. he had a certain cynicism that always appealed to me. his last 2 specials (life is worth losing especially and complaints and grievances) have lacked a certain spirit and content. george appeared overweight, old and tired (not to mention coming out of rehab). "i said not to mention it"! anyway. life is worth losing was especially tragic as he was overweight, disgruntled, coming off of rehab (there we go again...) and extremely unfunny. if there was a way to feel sorry for a comedian without heckling him off stage, george achieved it with life is worth losing. it is as if the new millennium and post 9/11 america was trampling george's spirit. the bs had become too large to manage.the comeback is partially successful with it's bad for ya! this special is the transmutation completed. george is no longer trying to rekindle his glory days. he is in full acceptance of his age, being old and dealing with the looming prospects of death. he has accepted being a crusty old sob and is relishing in it. this is better than his previous specials, yet far from jammin' in new york. it is a little tragic. his observations are not cutting edge anymore and seem more andy rooney than lenny bruce. george isn't george anymore. he is no longer criticizing us but is the man in the high castle pointing out how things were and how dissimilar modern life is. this is an improvement over the previous two specials, but george does not, as of yet, recoup his old glory (if ever). he has been reduced from critical social and political stinging commentary to mostly personal peeves. when he goes political, he still has something to say. it is heavily derived (especially if you have seen any of his previous work), but it still works somehow, as opposed to his random rantings which lack a certain relevance outside of the baby boom generation. the last 25 minutes is the best this special has to offer.for now i will worship the sun and pray to joe pesci that george can recreate himself as a cutting edge septuagenarian. it's a 50/50 chance. life seems to have become more tedious for george and his "art" is now his life. this is a step in the right direction from his previous 2 specials, but is far from his old self. where does he go from here? he may never recoup but maybe he can further metamorphosing/refine this new ornery old man routine. heres to hoping for 7 more words you can't say on tv or at least a windmill he can handle.

for those of you who like stand-up comedians you must have heard about george carlin. he is really one of the best comedians alive so you must know him.but he died already, god rest him in peace. or hell. he didn't believe too much in religion so he might as well chose hell to live eternity. haha, just joking, don't take it serious!it's bad for ya!, it's one of the latest works of george carlin, before his death--believe me, one of his best works, a must for any fan and an almost best-of of all george carlin's jokes. it's not a best-of... but it's really amusing.it has less political and religious jokes. it's only to have a great time!editing is very good. it's not a concert, so, it shouldn't have quick changing of shots... the slow fading to other shot was well done. fading is the best option in terms of editing!

my brother got me hooked on carlin back in the 70s. i always loved his observational humor. that is, looking at every day things and finding the humor in it, like asking the question,"have you ever tried to throw away an old waste basket? you can't do it! they keep bringing back to you!" and asking questions like why is the word kill more acceptable then the "f" word, while making prefect sense with the discussion.however, during the 90s his stuff was less funny, and more angry. what he seemed to be doing was holding a mirror to society's face and say 'take a look!' at this point, his shows were less of a comedy show, and more of a gripe session. but in all fairness he always made a tremendous amount of sense. he really made you think.here was carlin old and new. he starts out about the fun one could have by getting old, and later slamming the the state of the world. again making perfect sense.this was his best since "jammin' in new york", and as it turns out his last.i think what 'the shootist' was to john wayne, or 'a prairie home companion' to robert altman, 'it's bad for ya' is to george carlin. a fond farewell to a true great icon. love him, or hate him, i think he will be remembered.

this is unfortunately carlin's last recorded hbo concert, from a series that lasted over 30 years. though this may not be his "best" work, it is excellent, funny, and thought provoking. this recording is also a bit different from most of his other concerts that it is a bit lengthier than most of his other concerts.throughout his long, prolific, and influential career, carlin has moved from the more observational humor and fart jokes, towards a more 'humanitarian' viewpoint of society and culture. his focus on the english language and euphemisms increased throughout the years, and culminates in this performance. though, i would argue that his audio book "when will jesus bring the pork chops?" best displays his vast wit with regards to language, euphemisms, and the breakdown of our values. it's bad for ya is quite indicative of his long transformation from a comedian to a writer.if you are offended by foul language or the disparagement of the church, you will probably not like any of carlin's stand up material. however, if you enjoy being mentally stimulated and can tolerate the language and blasphemy, you would probably greatly enjoy this concert.

mr. carlin left our common forum in june of 2008, shortly after going to the hospital for pains in the chest (he had a history of heart trouble). the media, and comics everywhere covered the loss more than i or he would have ever expected ... but, he was the grandfather of observational comedy.this recording was his last production and contains a large section dedicated to the topic of death and the prospects of life thereafter. filming of the project occurred shortly after his seventieth birthday, which he was happy to have attained (observed?). i have followed carlin's career from the days of fuzzy black and white television, and enjoyed his topical record albums.it is a privilege for any carlin fan to at least see (if not own a copy) of this particular show. he was still fast moving, and with great timing, even at 70! as he would say,,, he is not "smiling down from heaven on you". if he's doing anything at all it's not taking harp lessons; perhaps he's looking up!!!

it's bad for ya really showcases more of george carlin's talents. he really is still as sharp as a tack. it is a shame that we lost him this past year, but his comedy will forever live on. this stand-up special is literally one of the funniest i have ever heard a comedian perform. even though he is making fun of small children, it just makes you laugh the way he says some of the stuff. it is true that carlin can literally make something that seems unfunny and turn it into one of the funniest things you have ever and will ever hear. i really enjoyed this stand-up particularly from carlin and recommend that those that liked this check out more of george carlin's stand-up.

it might be a stretch saying this as a die-hard carlin fan, but the material, both written and as performed, in it's bad for ya is some of the best late-era material yet. at 70 carlin bounces back from the level of despair (and some of the stumbles in the act itself) from life is worth losing to a special that is firmly structured but loose and playful- or as much as the "old f***" can get- and is continuously, ceaselessly, funny. and funny as in reminiscent of what some of us had going on when watching back in town or 'diseased' the first time. the material, even if sounding at times a tinge of the previously done (i.e. the whole bit on children in school and camp like the children segment in diseased), is always fresh and with such a sting of truth to everything that it scalds the mind while (here goes) tickling the funny bone.going from the topic of death (how long to wait to scratch off a name from the book? six weeks, unless if on the computer scheduler), the facets of communication, looking down from heaven, spots of god (naturally), kids, and just troublesome gestures involving hats in religion and if people really have "rights" make up the bulk of the special, centered around the premise that what's bad for you, plain and simple, is bs. total, complete bs, which as we also learn (or if you've really learned it you're like the kid waiting at the street corner for a week following dropped off not-quite randomly by the parent) holds the country together. carlin isn't necessarily angry though, even if disdain seems to spout out at most turns, even just to observe how horrifying children's teeth coming in look. it's skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything is not going to be "fine".what it comes down to is this: carlin is to dirty, witty, cautionary stand-up comedy what yoda is to jedis everywhere, which is a small spark of hope via crystal clear wisdom in a world where it's pretty damn hard to get any. at the least, we get classic gc - outrageous lines and bits from the man's 13th (or is it 14th) comedy special, including as far as an eyebrow-raising observation on people who play mozart music during a birth!

i can't say i enjoyed this as much as "the big lebowski" or "raising arizona," and felt a little slighted, but "o brother" is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens' brisk, twisted sense of creativity. the dvd edition contains the featurette, and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques. that surprised me! of course, this movie is not the best example (and i'm only saying this in comparison) and it wasn't worthy of any oscars (many feel it was robbed), but maybe it depends on the appeal. though i enjoyed the coens' previous work, i've never been a fan of old westerns or "the dukes of hazzard" or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn. i guess that's why i didn't feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie, seeing that it revolves around southern folk. for all those from the south who are reading this, i don't mean to offend any of your people! i'm sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like "a bronx tale." when you live in the city all your life, it's hard to get accustomed to films of this nature. but all apologies aside, i found the characters fun and quirky. i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly, and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing. tim blake nelson was also good. of course, george clooney--who i assume is not the best at feigning accents, judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for "the perfect storm"--naturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent. his performance was good, though. you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter (in a short but sweet role) and john goodman (also on screen for a short time, but steals every minute of it).though i don't normally dig country music, i liked the title song "a man of constant sorrow." the dvd also contains the music video for that song. overall, i found the film entertaining and original, but it doesn't have that in-your-face quality that the coens have shown to us in the past. it's a slighter effort, but a good one. i still suggest you check it out. my score: 7 (out of 10)

this movie was sooooooo good! it was hilarious! there are so many jokes that you can just watch the movie over and over and not get tired of it. john turturro and tim blake nelson were awesome as pete hogwallop and delmar! i love those guys! i love the adventures they went on, too. i definitely recommend this movie.also, the music in this movie is terrific! i love singing along with all of the songs!

it takes a rare movie to get better each time you see it. o brother does that and then some. the first time i saw it, i have to admit i had never seen anything like it. then i wanted to see it again, and now i'm up to double digits with this great movie, the coen brothers' finest movie they've ever done, with fargo and hudsucker proxy coming in a tight second and third for me.george clooney gives the performance of his career playing ulysses everett mcgee, a fast-talking know-it-all escaped convict who really doesn't know that much at all. tim blake nelson and john turturro are the perfect sidekicks for clooney, particularly nelson and his portrayal of delmar, a loyal albeit uneducated fellow escapee. john goodman is my favorite bit character as big dan, perfect. it reminds me of his part in raising arizona, he's just a perfect actor for this role. coen brothers' favorites holly hunter and charles durning also provide memorable performances. joel and ethan coen are masters of their trade. it's not like they try to win academy awards every time they make a film, they just try and tell a story that they want to tell, and it's entertaining. it's a loose adaptation of the odyssey, and i mean loose for all of you homer fanatics. it's just great.the most amazing part of this movie though is the coloring. i've watched how they got the dusty feel to the movie and i am still in awe just thinking about it. the coloring does become an important part of the movie. great great movie.

it started off weird, the middle was weird, and the ending was weird, but i really, really liked it. a modern day version of homer's odyessy but that is really irrelevant. interesting story and casting. clooney was great and i applaud him for taking on such an adverterous role - so unlike anything he has done or ever will do again. lots of surprise stars - why isn't holly hunter in more. do something different tonight and watch this really different and unexpected flick.

after seeing the 'oh so acclaimed' fargo and thinking it was nothing more than average, i was wandering if it would be a good idea to rent another coen 'masterpiece'. this time i was much less disappointed than i was with fargo and i must say that most of the credit for that goes to the good jokes and the good acting of george clooney. well done mr. clooney, make more of these and less 'perfect stormish' movies. you can act and you showed it here.7 out of 10

this has got to be the best movie i've seen. you definately have to watch it more than once to find all of the humor and twists. i'm no fan of george clooney, but he shines here. the real performance comes from tim blake nelson and john turturro as pete and delmar. one of the few movies that i own.

'o brother, where art thou' is a gleeful retelling of homer's 'odyssey', set in 1930s mississippi and rampant with splendid quirkiness that is the trademark of the brothers coen. three hapless convicts make their escape to find treasure--and more than their share of adventure--in this delightful film. george clooney is in fine, ingenuous form as the chatty, amiable leader of the trio; but the real acting kudos go to john turturro and tim blake nelson as his goofy but lovable cohorts, dubbed the 'soggy bottom boys' by clooney's character after they receive baptism by full immersion in a river. the three cut a record under that homespun nom-de-plume for the cash, and unwittingly become overnight sensations with veritable 'rock star' status. the film is accompanied by enough music and songs to almost qualify it as a musical. and there are some incredible feats of film-making here: the scene at the kkk rally is a real doozy, and is so similar to the scene when dorothy's friends rescue her from the witch's castle in 'the wizard of oz' that it almost amounts to cinematic plagiarism. and what an amazing work of plagiarism it is! without giving away the ending, i must say the climax of the movie is one of the most breathtaking sequences put to film in recent memory (on a par with the spectacular finale of 'magnolia', another one of my favorites). 'o brother' is a must-see, a perfect 10!

the coen's strike again. i had no presuppositions going in and i was amazed at the bizarre telling of a good-bad guy story. although clooney is easily replaceable in this, his cornball style is welcome. turturro and nelson are dead ringers. and i loved "i am a man of constant sorrow" as performed by the "soggy bottom boys". catchy tune...8 of 10

i've seen just about all of the coen brothers' films now, and i have to say this is one of their better films. i wouldn't dare say it's better than "the big lebowski", but it was very good in it's own right.i thought the story was very interesting and hilarious at times. i loved all the characters, especially tim blake nelson (delmar) and john turturro's (pete).there really isn't anything bad i can say about this movie, but this movie isn't for everyone. it might be safe to say that if you liked the other coen brothers' films, then you'll hopefully like this one too. and if you liked what you saw in the trailer, i think you'll like the film, but don't hold me to it.anyhow, i hope that you like(d) the film as much as i do. thanks for reading,-chris

great movie, great actors, great soundtrack! i loved it! settings are perfect, dialogues, situations, storyline... all together mixed to give this masterpiece! clooney and turturro are magnificent and the soggy bottom boys are simply charming and contagious with their music! :)

this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous. one of the actors is george clooney and i'm not a fan but this roll is not bad. another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack (the man of constant sorrow). i recommand this movie to everybody. greetings bart

they loved him up and turned him into a horny toad! god, that gets to me every time.this is a great movie. memorable lines, from "thank god your momma died given birth; she'da seen ya she'da died of shame" to "i don't understand, big dan." great scenes, from the opening train scene (laughed so hard i cried) to the bluegrass.watch it. it's good, it's great, it's funny, and it's based on a famous story. worth your while, believe me. don't watch this if you have a weak bladder, for you will definitely wet your pants laughing.

the primary plus for this movie is the combination of chris farley and david spade. this was the first film in which this comedy duo displayed their laurel-and-hardy-esque brand of humor. farley's obvious physical comedy skill is perfectly augmented by spade's sarcastic take on every situation they find themselves in.this movie stands apart from other comedy movies. tommy boy ranks in with blues brothers as a comedic work whose individual scenes and bits stem from the plot, rather than serve to break up the storyline and give the film a disjointed feel as so many other comedic films do. thanks to excellent direction by sagal, every scene is tight and immediately foreshadows or acts out the story being told. he is as much to credit for the film's hilariousness as farley and spade are. the acting of dennehy, lowe, ackroyd, and many others (see the gas station attendant 22 miles from davenport) strengthen the film.the film warrants multiple viewings because there are many fine nuaces to the film that may be overshadowed by farley/spade.i believe this film is very well-made and is the funniest movie i have ever seen.

this movie literally had me rolling on the floor (well at least on the couch) laughing. i didn't think i would like it, but it came on cable tv one afternoon, and i watched the whole thing and thoroughly enjoyed myself. since then, i've also seen black sheep, which was pretty good, but not as non-stop-funny as tommy boy.

this movie is hilarious. the laughs never stop. every scene is packed to the limit with hilarious comedy. chris farley is a comic genius, and spade plays his character to a tee. farley was one of the best slap stick comics ever, and in this movie(as with all his movies) we see how much time and energy he devoted to portraying his character the way he saw fit. "tommy boy" is an excellent example of a comedy, it always makes me laugh, no matter how many times i have seen it before.

i've watched this movie on a fairly regular basis for most of my life, and it never gets old. for all the snide remarks and insults (mostly from david spade), "tommy boy" has a giant heart. and that's what keeps this movie funny after all these years.tommy callahan (chris farley) is the son of big tom callahan (brian dennehy), master car parts salesman, and has ridden on that all his life. but after his died dies on his wedding day, tommy learns that the company is in debt, and about to be bought by ray zalinsky (dan akroyd), the owner of a huge car parts company. so in order to save the company, tommy has to go on the road to sell the company's new brake pads. along for the ride, though not by choice, is richard hayden (david spade) a former classmate of tommy's who was big tom's right-hand man.the movie rides on the chemistry between the two snl stars (and real-life best friends) chris farley and david spade. the duo has enough comic energy going between them to power the world. it's the big, dumb guy versus the smart little guy. it works, and some of their scenes are unforgettably funny. farley and spade are actually decent dramatic actors as well. although the film is primarily a comedy, it has its fair share of drama, but spade and especially farley are just as good there as when they're making the audience laugh.forgive me, but i have to talk about chris farley a little more. i read his biography ("the chris farley show: a biography in three acts," for anyone who cares), and understanding who chris was in real life made this movie more special to me. chris farley was a genuinely good person who struggled, and ultimately failed to conquer his addictions. although this was the first movie he had a major role in, it is his best film. it really showed who he was, and just how much talent he had. knowing chris's story adds another layer to this movie, although it doesn't make it any less funny.farley and spade are matched with a good on screen cast. rob lowe is suitably slimy as tommy's "new brother," and bo derek is solid as his step-mother. brian dennehy is great as big tom. dennehy makes it easy to believe that they're father in son. big tom is just as crazy as his son, although he's smarter and more mature. dan akroyd gives one of his best performances as zalinsky, giving tommy the hard truth behind advertising. julie warner is also good as tommy's love interest, michelle.for me, peter segal is one of the great comedy directors. he keeps the pace quick and energetic, but most importantly, he knows how to make comedy funny. he doesn't belabor the jokes, and he understands that funny actors know what they're doing and he allows them to do it. but segal goes a step further. he gives "tommy boy" a friendly, almost nostalgic tone that both tugs the heartstrings (genuinely) and tickles the funnybone.critics didn't like "tommy boy." shame on them. a movie doesn't have to be super sophisticated or subversively intellectual to be funny (god forbid farley and spade were forced to do muted comedy a la "the office"). this is a great movie and one of my all-time favorites.

peter segal's 1995 commercial hit & now cult-classic 'tommy boy' is a hilarious film, an evergreen entertainer. chris farley is a talent which we'll never ever forget!!! 'tommy boy' is a simple story, told in the funniest & zany way possible. farley & spade take a journey which is filled with unstoppable laughter, even the rob lowe portion is damn funny. as a kid, i remember watching 'tommy boy' again and again and again. it's been of my childhood favorites, and it will always remain to be. even today when it comes on t.v. i stick to it as a die-hard fan. i am quite possessive about this film. segal's direction is super. chris farley might have died in 1997, but remains alive for me, at least. what an actor! watch his work in 'tommy boy', he's so much at ease. he delivered fantastic performances later on in films like 'berverly hills ninja' & 'almost heroes', but his work in here remains as his best to date! love you, farley! spade, on the other hand, is as good as ever. he's an excellent actor in all respects! 'tommy boy' rules.... 100 thumbs up from this writer!

well, on the day that rob schneider plunges himself further into the black hole of notoriously bad movies by starring in the absolutely not-at-all-wanted "deuce bigalow: european gigolo" (hmmmm....wasn't there a film called roadtrip which was followed by a sequel called eurotrip? and now there's deuce bigalow: male gigolo followed by sequel deuce bigalow: european gigolo.......i smell a pattern. perhaps soon there will be spiderman: european webs are hotter.....or not) i am writing about this much maligned (at time of release) film. i was one of those maligners, i must admit. i turned my nose up at it even while chris farley shoved cocaine up his nose and the snl cast struggled through one of the worst seasons in their history in '94-'95, the norm mcdonald anchorship notwithstanding. films like happy gilmore, tommy boy, and black sheep came out in the couple years after this period and we realized there was a dark future for the caliber of spade-farley-schneider-sandler films. however i watched this film the other day, ten years after and 8 years after chris died and could not stop laughing. yes it's not particularly sophisticated. farley does what farley does (not unlike manny being manny) but his "van down by the river" motivational speaker shtick in which he laments that while he may not "wash enough" or "wear well-fitting clothes" or "use deodorant more than twice a week" translates well here as the ever self-effacing character who realizes he's not the brightest, not the best-looking, and could stand to lose a few pounds. all the same, he's trying his best to do what he's supposed to. and david spade just tosses off his snide one-liners as he did for "spade's hollywood minute" and basically stings farley's self-esteem. there's really not a whole lot more to say than that. i love the one scene when farley catches spade spanking his monkey and then makes a couple quips about it. can't remember what the first one is but the second one, they're lying in their hotel beds and farley says to spade, "do you like baseball?". spade mutters something inaudible in response and farleys says, "the new york yank-ees?" anyway farley does his awkward, painfully sensitive, frat-boy shtick. if you like, you like it. i couldn't stop laughing.

excellent ! i have to think back a *very* long time to find a film that's made me laugh quite so much. the writing is top-notch, the story is satisfying, and the entire cast is excellent - chris farley has never been better. one of the very best comedies of the 90s.

this film is hilarious. brilliant comedy, but only because of one actor. chris farley. the best 'comedy-actor' i have ever seen. it's something special about him. he is just so funny.what a shame he is not with us anymore. he will sorely be missed.

during my trip in a youth leadership forum, i was channel surfing until i found "tommy boy" on tbs. since i have never seen this film before, i wanted to check it out. my roommate, who have already seen this, told me, "this movie is a classic." after seeing the whole movie, i came to the conclusion that he was right."tommy boy" is constantly funny from beginning to end, thanks to the comedic duo of chris farley and david spade. farley is a riot as the title character, a spastic doofus who just sails through life as if it wasn't important. his slacker-esqe ways soon come to a halt when his father (brian dennehy), a wealthy "break pads king", dies of a heart attack on his wedding day. this leads tommy, with the help of his sarcastic childhood friend richard (david spade), to hit the road to sell enough break pads to save the company.the main reason "tommy boy" works are the funny performances from the lead cast. farley is the funniest person in this movie, the second funniest person being spade and the third being rob lowe as the film's villain who has bad luck. another funny guy is dan aykroyd as ray zalinsky, a well-known auto parts extraordinare.another reason the movie works is the large amount of jokes. chris farley has hilarious slapstick moments, and david spade has funny snide comments and one-liners. the gags in the movie (some which involves a deer and a airplane bathroom) are laugh-out-loud funny, thanks to director peter segal (naked gun 33 1/3), writers bonnie & terry turner(3rd rock from the sun, that 70s show), and the cast."tommy boy" is a really funny movie, although for some unknown reason most film critics (including roger ebert) find it horrible and unfunny. (i wonder when their sense of humor died.) i recommend "tommy boy" for those who are great fans of comedy. thank you very much, roommate.

a kinda remake of planes trains and automobiles in a lot of ways.i think,i think it's such a bad and sad coincidence that both john candy and chris farley left us when they still had a lot of stuff to do.god bless them both,i think the plots of 2 movies are really similar,road trips of two different poles of characters,and a lot of unlucky consequences because of the chubbies, this movie can not be planes trains and automobiles but its a really entertaining movie especially with the great performance of chris farley, the missing part in this movie is the touchy stuff if we compare it with candy&martin classic,but i think its better this way

this movie has everything! it has a good storyline, good acting, great scenery, adventure and some brilliant gags! chris farley plays tommy callaghanhe mega successful company 'callaghan auto parts' has to go on the road to stop the company going under after big tom dies. the trouble is that tommy knows nothing about break pads and needs the help of callaghan auto parts worker richard (david spade). from the moment the two dorks hit the road, the movie is just so much fun. if you love slapstick with a great storyline you'll love this because the gags keep coming thick and fast and the movie will just make you laugh out loud! it was so sad about farley's untimely death in 1997, but a credit to his genius is 'tommy boy'. get it, chill out and enjoy this brilliant slapstick!

i saw this film knowing absolutely nothing about both it and its stars, chris farley and david spade, and i have to say that this film is a comic classic. it is so stupid at times that it can only be hilarious. farley is brilliant as the bumbling idiot who takes to the road with his dad's right hand man (the equally excellent spade) to find the funding to save the families 'auto parts' business. relax, put your brain on auto-pilot and soak up the fun. a great supporting cast features film favourites such as brian dennehy (cocoon), rob lowe (wayne's world) and bo derek ("10"). highly recommended for a good laugh.

as it turns out, chris farley and david spade only made three movies together ("coneheads", "tommy boy" and "black sheep"), but this was truly the "citizen kane" of their pairings. farley plays thomas callahan iii, the dimwitted heir to an auto parts company. his father big tom (brian dennehy) hires mild-mannered richard hayden (david spade) to look after him. big tom is getting married to a "ten" (bo derek), so everything has to be in order. after big tom suddenly dies, tommy and richard have to try to sell half a million auto parts to save the company from bankruptcy. from then on, the movie is pretty much an excuse for chris farley to do what he does best: make a mess of everything.when this movie first came out in the theaters, i saw it with my grandfather. he figured out early on that the bo derek and rob lowe characters were hiding something. but you can completely ignore that and simply luxuriate in chris farley's antics. nothing is safe around his stomach, and hell hath no fury like his happy-go-lucky attitude. the scene where he sets the cars on fire, and later the deer scene, make for a pure laugh riot. chris farley and david spade were truly the john belushi and dan aykroyd of their era. it's a pleasure to always be able to think about "fat guy in a little coat" time and again.

sean bean returns as napoleonic hero richard sharpe in sharpe's honour, the fifth movie in the series and as always patrick harper and the rest of sharpes chosen men are all along for the ride, but this time major sharpe is in serious trouble.under the influence of sharpe's sworn enemy major ducos, a mysterious lady by the name of la marquesa has accused sharpe of rape. her husband arrives at sharpe's camp to challenge his wife's attacker to a dual.the dual is discovered and stopped by the authorities, and as a result sharpe becomes the prime suspect when his opponent is murdered in the middle of the night.as no-one in the british army other than wellington and major nairn consider sharpe anything but a rough commoner with little or no honour, he his given a shambolic trial and is sentenced to death by hanging, and harper and the chosen men have no choice but to look on as their beloved commander walks slowly to the gallows.however, convinced of his innocence wellington and nairn hang another convicted prisoner in sharpe's stead and release him and his chosen men to find the real killer and la marquesa herself, to not only prove his innocence but to find out her reasons for framing him in the first place.daragh o'malley, micheal byrne and hugh fraser co-star with brilliant performances by alice krige as la marquesa and féodor atkine as the villainous major ducos, in what is another exciting, swashbuckling instalment through sharpe's eventful journey through the napoleonic wars.

the banter and humorous rescue scene help to make this one of my favorites of the 14-movie series. wonderful acting, great cast. and this movie contains one of the few oft-noted facts about sean bean's career. the part where he and alice krige fall off the horse into the water was not scripted but was left in since they both went right on acting after it happened.this is a good follow-up to the intense ending of sharpe's enemy.

this is one of the most satisfying of the book to tv adaptations. the actress who make us believe that a borg could be sexy makes us believe that a spy and traitor can have some redeeming qualities.the tv plot line does not follow cornwell's story exactly but is both exciting and rewarding as a retelling of a darn good yarn. if you have a yen for romance in uniform there is a lot of sexual energy sparking between our man sharpe and the lying hussy. made me wish her role was closer to that in the books. but no matter there is enough hero wronged, hero redeemed, hero in rage, hero in flight and hero in battle to keep you clued to your dvd play.

sharpe's honour for the uninitiated, is the fifth entry in a series of tv movies focusing on an english army rifleman during the napoleonic wars and based on the books by bernard cornwell (which i strongly recommend reading). if you were to start by watching this particular one though, you'd get the impression that sharpe is not so much a soldier as the very centrifugal force which the rest of the army revolves around. should that be the case, i'd recommend starting with earlier chapters like sharpe's eagle or sharpe's company, but this is a worthy choice for a second viewing.the story this time is all about the espionage side of things. with the french army retreating in disarray from spain, major ducos, the slimy spy master spots an opportunity to turn the situation round. by pinning the murder of a spanish marques on richard sharpe, hero of the british army, the fragile british/spanish alliance will start to crumble and things will turn around again. when the spanish nobles come to wellington crying for sharpe's blood though, the english general is less than willing to hang his best soldier so fakes his death and soon, he's off on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find out who masterminded the plot. surprisingly enough for a sharpe film as well, there's a gorgeous woman to be rescued along the way, fancy that.what this results in of course is a more adventure style approach. the concentration is less on the workings of the english military with sharpe as the figurehead and concentrates more on his escapades in the countryside, dodging french patrols, hob nobbing with the spanish guerrillas and getting involved in daring escapes from fortified military positions. sergeant harper, his loyal right hand man accompanies him naturally but the rest of the riflemen remain in the camp unaware their leader is still alive. strangely enough though, they actually receive more attention than usual as they wind up in their own subplot involving the delivery of harper's baby.this slightly different approach makes for an intriguing episode but is only a good thing in the long run. and should anyone be worried that there won't be the standard battle at the climax fret not, because once again the poor old french get a right kicking. furthermore, ducos makes a fantastic successor to obadiah hakeswill as the bad guy you love to hate. he is a duplicitous, malicious and absolutely evil son of a female canine and is also strangely reminiscent of that guy in black from out of raiders of the lost ark. elsewhere, hagman stands out quite prominently as he gets the chance for more screen time and comes across as the sort of man you'd want to deliver your first born, even if he does look like a member of iron maiden who got catapulted backwards in time by accident.in short then, another strong chapter in the sharpe series. sharpe remains as heroic as always but considerably more bitter and angry this time given the events in the previous film. it's not the best introduction if you've not seen any of the other chapters but it does show a side to sharpe that we don't normally get to witness: the action hero rather than the professional soldier. and if that's not enough to get you tempted, it's also worth watching just for the rather surreal sight of an enraged sean bean swinging a live chicken at a group of nuns.

face it, folks-- "dk3" is more challenging, innovative, and clever than its predecessor. challenging-- its levels are ridiculously difficult for a considerable amount of time. one especially difficult level is called "lightning lookout," in which you may be struck by lightning at any given time. innovative-- it opened a lot of doors. too bad the snes died out not long after this title. and clever-- the level names range from trademark plays-on-words ("lake orangatanga") to witty references that the game's targeted audience won't get for many years to come ("bleak's house").what irks me about most people's criticism of this game mainly comes down to two words: kiddy kong. he is a worthy "little-buddy" successor to diddy kong, and certainly does not deserve to be referred to as "that retarded monkey." "dk3" will remain a classic until the end of time.

the 1970's saw a rise and fall of what we have come to know as "blacksploitation" films. the term is a reference to kind of broad catch-all, rather than a true genre of film. in short, any comedy, drama, adventure, western or urban cops & robbers shoot-em-up, that are so constructed and so cast as to appeal to the large urban black population of the mid 20th century. that indeed could embrace the widest type of films, as long as the had a slant toward the inner-city black population.it appears that the idea of producing these films of particularly keen interest to black americans had its genesis with the eastertime release of 100 rifles (marvin schwartz prod./20th century-fox, 1969). in it, former syracuse university all-american footballer and several times all-pro fullback for the cleveland browns, jim brown, had a co-starring billing. having appeared in a number of films already, as for example, rio conchos (1964),the dirty dozen (1967), (ice sttion zebra (1968)* and others, it was beginning to make more sense to the studios' "suits" that jim was a hot property.now this 100 rifles brings record numbers of black patrons to the big cities' central business districts on easter sunday to view mr. brown. why not start to film more of these adventure epics and other types of film with more black players and stars? why not, indeed.** so we saw a succession of cops & robbers, bad-ass private detective films, comedies, all going the route. along the way, we eventually got to some more family oriented, wider appealing films. the movie goers were treated to sounder (1972), the take (1974), conrack (1974)and, ultimately, claudine (1974).in claudine, we find no stigma nor easy classification as being "blackploitation", as the story is universal, and could easily have been done as a story about people of any descent, any where, and not just in the 1970's usa.that the story was done of a single mother, claudine (dianne carroll), struggling to keep a family together after "....two marriages and two almost marriages.", is a far cry from a shoot-em-up harlem style. the problems that plague the everyday citizens of our nation are confronted and examined under the ol' sociological microscope.but we also consider claudine's psychological and physical needs as a female. for "woman needs man and man must have his mate",***and we do concede this point. (that's s-e-x that we're talking about, schultz!) claudine meets up with a very masculine, broad shouldered, athletic type in private scavanger garbage man, ruppert b. marshall (james earl jones) and they go on a date.the great welfare state intervenes with the couple as claudine's welfare case worker, miss tayback (elisa loti), comes snooping around to see just who is this unattached male, who is suddenly paying so much attention to claudine's family.after a humiliating experience with the welfare bureau's auditing and "deducting" binge, which would be the norm for the family, the two decide to get married with or without the blessing of big brother.meanwhile, claudine's elder son has gotten involved with some big talking but little doing black activist group. but, with ruppert's help, he and they all come through it a.o.k.it ends on a happy, upbeat and hopeful note. we know that it may not be exactly "...happily ever after!", but rather the'll make it all together! if there is a single criticism that we must state it is that sometimes in a movie like this, a misconception is spread to a large portion of urban blacks. and that is, the apparent implied myth that all whites are wealthy, having none of their kind ever in need of a helping hand, out of work or suffering any disabilities.well, folks, it just ain't true! note: * at one point, jim brown's career was a real hit as a rugged actioner. he was even being tauted as "...the black john wayne." note: ** the idea of producing films with all-black casts, filmed for all-black consumption was not a new idea. in the 1920's, '30's and '40's, we saw productions from people like noble johnson, spencer williams, jr. and rex ingram.note: *** that's "as time goes by", you know, schultz, it's from casablanca (warner brothers, 1942).

i went to the movies to see claudine and loved every minute of it the cast and the soundtrack as well. diahann carroll was never better than in this role. we saw ms. carroll downplayed her looks barely saw her naked,smoked a cigarette, drank beer and oh she cursed. whenever this movie was shown on tv and finally cable i would call my friends to watch it. just the soundtrack from the very beginning of the movie is awesome all thanks to gladys knight and the pips. we saw a black woman struggling to raise her children, dealing with teen pregnancy and everyday life meets a man whom she learns later on has issues himself. finally this movie made it to dvd and well deserving.

claudine is a movie that is representation of the american system at it's worst. the welfare system was initially set up as a stepping stone for those families who needed that extra hand to get back on their feet.the movie showed an accurate portrayal of how the welfare system breaks down the family unit. in other words if the father or any male figure is in the lives of the women and children their financial support from the system would be jeopardized if not terminated. the struggles of the poor can be seen throughout the world. i would like to see a reproduction of this movie back in the stores for all to rent or buy for their library collection.

i love this movie....one of my all-time favorites!!! this was the first big screen movie my mom took me to see when i was 9. i highly recommend it to every african-american. this story is about love, trust, challenges, and everyday life of a black family. all the actors worked well together. i wish it was on video, but as of yet, it is not available that i know of. i caught it on television a few years ago, and recorded it, so whenever i get the urge to watch it...i have it! the soundtrack is awesome too! a must-see!

claudine was one of the very first movies that gave positive role models for both black men and women. i appreciated this movie even more as i got older. this movie shows that men didn't always turn away from responsibility. an excellent movie i'd always recommend for anyone who appreciates a good inner city love story.

caught this recently after noticing james earl jones name on the title. it was better than i expected. of course it's pretty old - made during the early/mid 70's but it actually is a decent drama. it runs a quick 90min or so and showcases good performances from james earl jones and diahann caroll. the plot is conventional in general but told through the perspective of a single black woman on welfare who has 6 children and trying to deal with all the problems that persist. this makes for an interesting view.....also in the fact that the script wasn't too sentimental or overdramatized - it's almost like looking at a slice of the past. all the 70's styles are out in abundance. the ending is kind of kooky though....probably would've done better without the theatrics.

if this film is examined closely, it's a bit sad. it is detailed enough to touch upon very real problems children, who grow up in poor, dysfunctional environments. yet, it retains it's comedic value, with spirited performances by diahann carroll and james earl jones. the sadness lies in the struggles and dysfunction of the mother (carroll), who cannot truly help her children, not because she doesn't want to, or try, but because, it's obvious she doesn't know how. remember, this is a comedy, but if you've never seen this, or if you have, watch this film and see the humanity, in the characters. good film.

i have seen this movie since i was a little girl, and being from new york and remembering how people lived back then brought back a lot of good memories. this movie is not just about wanting a fairy tale ending but understanding the struggles of becoming a better person, woman, and provider claudine attempted to be. it was about the welfare system putting women in a binding situation. it was about the injustice of a system that invaded and put demands on a family to stay afloat. diane carroll was nominated for an oscar for this role, and it was well deserved. if you want to experience a strong family with conflicting but wonderful bonding moments, enjoy claudine. your goal as a viewer is to keep an open mind, and understand the overall frustration.

idiocracy felt like mike judge took my thoughts on society and put them into film. in fact, the movie is a social commentary. almost feels like a documentary at times. luke wilson did a good job playing a boring average joe (like in most of his movies).of course idiocracy was an extreme of the current state of society. but that's what makes most comedies funny, a extreme of any situation. fiction isn't that much different then reality.with kids praising materialist hip-hop culture and taking pride in being ignorant. when people feel useless in life, they breed. giving them a purpose in the world. and it seems only the worse people breed the most. i can understand how others don't like it. it doesn't help most of the jokes were 2nd grade bathroom humor. not much different than a kevin smith film.idiocracy throws away logic, reason, any intelligence (for good reason).mike judges comeback was a knockout.

i would have to say this is a great movie. mike judge has an eye forseeing things that nobody would ever notice hence office space. hemakes a statement about the dumbing down of society and that survival of the fittest is mere pipe dream in 500 years. that pop culture and mass marketing by wealthy companies tend to rule the day. yes there is a lot of potty humor in it and it is to get the story moving and his point across. but the genuine frustration on private joe bowers face is priceless and some cases we can all relate to it at some point in our lives. if you do not enjoy the humor then look at it from a different point of view and watch it again. it took me watching it twice to really appreciate this film for what it isand with said after watching it twicei am going to read a book now.

it's the 1920s. and a man named walt disney was on a mission: to satisfy the families and children all over the world with one thing: entertainment. what did he do? he made cartoons! whoo!!!!! and he made a character that is as great as a mouse...mickey mouse. ha ha! oh boy!two films were drawn out by mr. disney himself: "plane crazy" and "steamboat willie." this review will focus on the 1928 feature, "steamboat willie."ever since i learned about this movie as a little boy, i've always wanted to see this movie. well, in 1997, i rented an ancient vhs that had lots of old disney cartoons on them, starring the mouse!!!!! mickey mouse!!!!! and guess what? that short was on there, and i loved it!!!!! shortly after i took the tape back, this was playing on the old disney channel (note: the "old" disney channel) early one saturday morning.yes, this is a great cartoon; this paved the way for more great disney stuff from 1928 to 2002!10 stars, indeed!!!!!

spoilers as you may know, i have been commenting on a lot of silent short films in the past months. now, i have no idea why i am commenting on steamboat willie, i guess i was just desperate to comment on anything, so i watched this, and now i am commenting on it. this, or course, is one of the very first cartoons, and i believe it is not the first cartoon with sound. here is the plot. mickey mouse is driving a steamboat when pete throws him off and he drives it. when they stop for cargo minnie mouse tried to get on but failed miserably. mickey gets her up by a crane. then a goat eats her sheet of paper with turkey in the straw on it. they use the goat to make the song. when i say that i mean that they used the goat as a victrola. mickey plays the animals on the steamboat for instruments to the song. then an angry pete throws mickey in a potato room and mickey is forced to peel potatoes for the rest of the day.overall, this is yet another groundbreaking silent short film. i mean, this is the third mickey mouse cartoon. yes, the third. also, this is not the first cartoon with sound. i believe there were two more before this one. either way, this film is really, really groundbreaking. mikcey was also more violent than he is mow. i mean, he throws a potato at a bird and may have brutally slaughtered it. 9/10recommended films: plane crazy.

... but it is also minnie's and pete's too! yes, the grumpy captain may not look like pete, but it is! mickey and minnie are the best characters, both of them are very sweet and likable. interestingly, minnie is more of a lady in this than what she usually is today and mickey is less than considerate in this than he is now. pete is still the same old meanie, but he looks a bit different. in this famous episode, on board a little steamboat, mickey, minnie and some side characters have a great deal of fun and a great deal of annoyances. even in their first appearances, the three main characters are very developed. i quite like this episode, although overall i prefer the mickey mouse in the future. i like the animation, the steamboat and music theme, the clever gags - and of course, mickey and minnie! like many early cartoons, this is very random, walt came up with a very basic plot and just added gags to "gear" it along. there is also a parrot side character who is very annoying and rather unnecessary. these are the things i do not like about it. another interesting thing about this episode, that a colour version has not been made for it (or if it has, i've never heard about it)! anyone who just enjoys mickey mouse and disney will enjoy this.

no doubt about it. this is the animated short that put uncle walt on the map of success. when walt's older brother,roy suggested that the next mickey mouse short should include sound, walt jumped at the chance. the result:steamboat willie was a runaway hit for 1928. it was, after all, the first animated short subject with a synchronized sound track (mostly music & sound effects,as dialog was minimal). not to sound like a wet blanket, but the short is far from perfect. animation prior to 1935 was creaky & rather herky jerky (but once equipment made improvements,and better artistic techniques came about,the rest was smooth sailing),and the sound was primitive (disney wanted to use the then well known rca sound system,or the western electric noiseless sound system,but was refused by both firms,prompting disney to use the photophone system that p.a. powers was experimenting with at the time). the plot (there's an actual plot line here?)concerns mickey (as the aforementioned willie)is the pilot of a steamboat, that is terrorized by black pete (captain pete to you),and decides to have a jam session on ship, using the various animals on board as musical instruments (aspca, take notice). if you don't think too much about the technical shortcomings, steamboat willie can be eight minutes of fun (and a piece of history).

'steamboat willie (1928)' is often erroneously touted as the first mickey mouse film, though that title actually goes to 'plane crazy (1928).' the source fuelling this common misconception is probably an episode of "the simpsons," which places the origin of itchy the mouse in a 1928 short called 'steamboat itchy,' obviously a parody of this cartoon. interestingly, 'steamboat willie' was itself a parody, spoofing the latest buster keaton release, 'steamboat bill, jr. (1928),' though the connection stretches little beyond the title and the general story setting. in this walt disney short, mickey mouse takes charge of a river steamboat, much to the annoyance of captain pete the cat, who spitefully casts him aside. but mickey is not to be outdone in nastiness. far removed from the pleasant, wholesome mickey that more recent generations enjoyed, this little mouse cares only for numero uno, inflicting pain and displeasure on a series of farm animals in order to provide music for his own amusement.first there's the laughing parrot, which cops a bucket and a large potato to the head. then a goat is cranked by the tail to provide music ("turkey in the straw") from a guitar it has swallowed. a cat is swung around by its tail, a goose throttled about the throat, and a piglet viciously booted. for a children's cartoon, 'steamboat willie,' directed by walt disney and ub iwerks, certainly has some mean-spirited humour, though i also noticed similar elements (though not quite to this extent) in some later disney shorts, like 'gulliver mickey (1934).' let's not forget minnie mouse, of course, who suffers treatment for which she could today sue for sexual harassment! the jokes may be crude, and the animation perhaps even more so, but this cartoon delivers a bucket-full of laughs, and it's easy to see why this little rodent became one of the most beloved characters in cinema history. if you're a fan of mickey mouse, or disney in general, this is one steamboat you can't afford to miss.

created in 1928, and originally named mortimer before walt disney changed his name (because his wife convinced him), mickey mouse has become the staple of the disney brand. i always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to feature mickey, it is in fact his third, but it doesn't matter, for a six minute animated short it is enjoyable. the story sees mickey piloting a steamboat until captain pete takes him off the bridge, stopping to pick up cargo, and minnie mouse missing the boat. being lifted on she drops her music sheets and a goat eats them, mickey helps her crank it's tail and play the tune, and getting some other animals to be percussion, until pete comes along again to stop him, making mickey peel potatoes. mickey mouse was number 53 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons, and he was number 31 on the 100 greatest cartoons. very good!

this 8 minute gem is not only timeless, but it is a cartoon milestone. it is mickey's third cartoon, and one of his best ones too. it is a cartoon milestone because it was the first one with sound. and my goodness, even after 70+ years it is ever so good, and gives real additional weight to the narrative. the black and white animation is excellent, and the character features are convincing enough. the music is wonderful, i love the soundtrack, it does add to the fun the cartoon has, no matter how thin the story sometimes is. and the cartoon is funny! so many memorable moments, like the cow's teeth being used as an xylophone and its udder as a bagpipe. the characters are also engaging, mickey and minnie two landmark disney characters are well voiced by walt disney, and pete serves well as "the villain of the piece". all in all, "steamboat willie" is just a timeless gem that everybody should see at least once. 10/10 bethany cox

steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history. this second appearance of mickey mouse (following the silent plane crazy earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking. this is because it was the first sound cartoon. while you don't yet hear mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.now if this were just an important historical film, it would be worth seeing--especially to lovers of animation. however, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is. while mickey and minnie behave a bit odd compared to the characters we have grown to love (thanks mostly to the kooky mind and talent of animator ub iwerks), there is an infectious charm about the film. it's just adorable seeing mickey playing "turkey in the straw" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way. clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.

mickey mouse is now 75 years old. he was created by walt disney, a famous creater, producer, director etc: i love the disney movies because it is great fun watching the cartoon movies. altogether walt disney i think is the king of the creations, everyone has got to love this creations and the movies by walt disney. thank you walt for all the classic characters you made.

this was the first mickey mouse cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound. in the cartoon, mickey does not yet wear gloves. he does not yet speak either. all he does is whistle and play music. the song that he plays is "turkey in the straw" using several farm animals as musical instruments. for example, he plays the teeth of a cow like a xylophone and pulls nursing piglets like an accordion keyboard. i taped this cartoon off of the disney channel and i think it is wonderful. it was based on a silent film starring buster keaton entitled "steamboat bill, jr."

this era was not just the dawn of sound in cartoons, but of a cartoon character which would go down in history as the world's most famous mouse. yes, mickey makes his debut here, in this cheery tale of life on board a steamboat. the animation is good for it's time, and the plot - though a little simple - is quite jolly. a true classic, and if you ever manage to get it on video, you won't regret it.

while in one country, spain, luis bunuel and salvador dali combined forces to create the benchmark of short-subject, cinematic surrealism, un chien andalou, walt disney and his collaborator ub iwerks in america worked on steamboat willie, the most prominent of the early synchronized sound cartoons (it was revealed that this was not the first, contrary to other reports). it's also one of the more successfully simplistic and funny of the mickey mouse shorts (still in a silent-film way- the only sounds are little irks and bleeps from the mickey and the animals). it also goes by fairly quickly for its less-than-ten minute run. but in these minutes one gets the immediate sense of how much fun disney has with his characters, and how the newfound use of sound changes how his creation uses the animals as musical tools. there's no story to speak of, just random things that happens and occurs because of mickey (err, steamboat willie) on this boat on a river. and like the better mickey mouse shorts, his lack of speaking acts as an advantage. it's a must-see if you haven't seen it as a kid, but if you have it might still be worth another look.

this was the first mickey mouse cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound. it was based on a silent movie called "steamboat bill, jr." starring buster keaton. back in this early mickey short, mickey did not talk nor did he have gloves. he could just whistle and play music. the song that he played was "turkey in the straw" using several barnyard animals as musical instruments. he plays a cow's teeth as a xylophone and he plays a nursing sow's teats like an accordion keyboard. captain pete, however, is very mad and makes mickey peel potatoes in the galley. pete's parrot flies up to the window and orders him to peel the potatoes. mickey throws a half-peeled potato at the parrot and laughs, thus closing the cartoon. i was able to get this cartoon on tape and i really like it. i think the disney shorts are much better than the feature length movies.

a walt disney mickey mouse cartoon.steamboat willie, a mischievous little rodent, neglects his pilothouse and frolics his way into cinematic history.on 18 november 1928, a struggling young genius debuted the world's first successful cartoon with synchronous sound. there would be no looking back for either walt disney or his alter ego mickey mouse. financial struggles would remain, but essentially the world was their oyster bed and mickey would eventually rival chaplin as the most recognizable cultural icon of the century.as entertainment, steamboat willie is still fun to watch, featuring fine work by animator ub iwerks and showing a mickey with all the passions & indifference of a small child. he must deal with a tyrannical skipper (pete, without his peg leg; he had been appearing in disney cartoons since february of 1925), a wisecracking parrot (in a few years it would be a duck) and a cute little mouse named minnie. together the two rodents rather callously make music on the live bodies of a goat, cat, goose, piglets & cow (a precursor of clarabelle) - all of whom happened to be conveniently on board the steamship. audiences howled for more and the pattern was set for the subsequent mouse cartoons of the next few years.******************************walt disney (1901-1966) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings. as a lad in marceline, missouri, he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper; later, as an ambulance driver in france during the first world war, he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle. back in kansas city, along with artist ub iwerks, walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters. always the innovator, his alice in cartoonland series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe. business reversals sent disney & iwerks to hollywood in 1923, where walt's older brother roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor. when a mildly successful series with oswald the lucky rabbit was snatched away by the distributor, the character of mickey mouse sprung into walt's imagination, ensuring disney's immortality. the happy arrival of sound technology made mickey's screen debut, steamboat willie (1928), a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music. the silly symphonies soon appeared, and walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color, illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development, an arena in which walt's genius was unbeatable. mickey's feisty, naughty behavior had captured millions of fans, but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions: temperamental donald duck, intellectually-challenged goofy and energetic pluto. all this was in preparation for walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films. against a blizzard of doomsayers, walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of snow white, pinocchio, dumbo, bambi & peter pan. walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse, or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off.

steamboat willy was not the first cartoon to feature mickey mouse. the first film to star america's friend was "plane crazy". "plane crazy" was released may 15th 1928 in hollywood california,in the silent movie format. "steamboat willy" was released november 18th 1928 as a sound movie (it was also released july 29th 1928 as a silent film). thus making "steamboat.."the first sound film of mickey but not the first film for the little american mouse. while many game shows have used the question: "what was the first appearance of mickey mouse?" the true answer is "plane crazy" not "steamboat willy". these dates can be checkout on imdb under "release dates".

it's about time "kate jackson" got her credit for this film.., i can remember watching it & trying to understand it on tv.., my grandmother lay in bed dying from cancer & i was barely 15. i didn't find out till years later that richard long had died tho.., i miss him on the other shows/movies he was in.i have a copy of the vhs tape still but it's not "cc'd" or closed captioned for the hearing impaired & thats the only flaw in the movie that i can remember or know of to date.., i haven't been able to find a dvd or vhs copy that has sub-titles in english even. if someone out there knows of either copy on vhs or dvd thats cc'd or has english sub-titles please let me know.thanks - cofffeenut

i happened to catch this on community tv a few years back and was pleasantly surprised how enjoyable a film it was.while a bit corny in certain ways, as its prime function of being a mystery thriller it works superbly, thanks to a script that concocts an ingenious plot; it kept me guessing throughout and the resolution is inspired.the cast is a star-studded one, containing a mixture of those at the end of their careers (indeed richard long died the same year this was made), or those who were on the verge of stardom in hit tv series (kate jackson, tom bosley). they all do a good job, with the exception of cesare danova who sleepwalks through his role.strongly recommended.

i saw this when i was twelve. it was the movie that made me understand what a good mystery really was. i had read the entire happy hollisters children's mystery series and they were about a family of child sleuths who always got their man. but we the readers were not in a position to solve the mystery along with them. this movie showed me that a good mystery is that which makes the viewer/reader, at the end, say, "oh!!!!! of course!!!!!!!"

every time this movie used to re-air on late night tv in the late 70s and early 80s i would always make time to sit in front of the tv and watch it. to see the lovely kate jackson, handsome richard long, the "great" polly bergen whom i've never seen anywhere else except for this tv movie, the endearing tom bosley, and another "great" whom i've never seen outside this movie, celeste holme. this is truly the love boat on a cruise to murder and mayhem and boy was it ever good!! and every time i would watch it i would always forget who the real murderer was.as expected, someone here is already criticizing the movie as if that really is a big help to anyone. this is a great tv movie and worth watching each and every time. i can't say that about half the movies i've seen this month.if you ever get a chance to watch it on tv someday, which isn't likely, watch it. in light of "the girl most likely to" finally coming out this year on dvd, maybe there's hope for a dvd release of "death cruise."

nazarin by the acclaimed surrealist bunuel is ovbviously an attack on the catholic church and its loss of values. it is not a visual film and i think it would have played better on the stage. bunuel takes us through this man, the nazarene that lives like christ lived; a true follower i.e. in poverty, and without a care for property and what the next day bringeth. some might call it a parallel to christ's story but any follower and practitioner of the word, life should be like christ in a way. but in essence bunuel also inquires into the ogle of man's selfishness and need to sin and how goodness may save us all. it is a bold statement to make that may enliven, or recite to memory the movie for some. truth, be told the nazarene is also selfish because he gives without wanting in return or asking for it. his selfishness is his folly and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a coin;with the same face on each side. lots of people represent sides of a coin in this movie, all with both faces the same. but the movie isn't exactly memorable once it ends and one could attack many of its ethical perforations and effusions within the movie's own doctrine. not top-notch bunuel but a "surreal" dream sequence that bunuel stages whithin where the message of the movie is framed and is worth noting for it shows you the capability of the director, bunuel.

luis bunuel's "nazarin" will always be remembered as a great film because it is absolutely honest in its presentation of comical assault on religion.it is one of those outstanding films which must be shown to all people especially young children in order to familiarize them with the notions of good and bad,sacred and evil.the toughest question asked by "nazarin" is about the strengths and weaknesses of organized religion.it has been tackled by involving numerous ordinary people who are not at all above petty affairs in their mundane lives especially sins.bunuel scores tremendously by showing us that various questions related to class differences deserve frank,honest and reliable answers. nazarin appears credible as it has been made in a light,comical vein.this is the sole reason why it can be said that the story of an ordinary priest appears absolutely true to life to all audiences.it is amazing how bunuel approaches quest for true love issue in his film. this black & white gem was shot marvelously by gabriel figueroa,one of luis bunuel's favorite cameraman.film critic lalit rao saw "nazarin" at trivandrum,india during 13th international film festival of kerala 2009."nazarin" was introduced by eminent indian cinema personality mr.p.k.nair as part of a special package called "50 years ago".this is a film which should be with any discerning dvd collector.

a blackly comic tale of a down-trodden priest, nazarin showcases the economy that luis bunuel was able to achieve in being able to tell a deeply humanist fable with a minimum of fuss. as an output from his mexican era of film making, it was an invaluable talent to possess, with little money and extremely tight schedules. nazarin, however, surpasses many of bunuel's previous mexican films in terms of the acting (francisco rabal is excellent), narrative and theme.the theme, interestingly, is something that was explored again in viridiana, made three years later in spain. it concerns the individual's struggle for humanity and altruism amongst a society that rejects any notion of virtue. father nazarin, however, is portrayed more sympathetically than sister viridiana. whereas the latter seems to choose charity because she wishes to atone for her (perceived) sins, nazarin's whole existence and reason for being seems to be to help others, whether they (or we) like it or not. the film's last scenes, in which he casts doubt on his behaviour and, in a split second, has to choose between the life he has been leading or the conventional life that is expected of a priest, are so emotional because they concern his moral integrity and we are never quite sure whether it remains intact or not.this is a remarkable film and i would urge anyone interested in classic cinema to seek it out. it is one of bunuel's most moving films, and encapsulates many of his obsessions: frustrated desire, mad love, religious hypocrisy etc. in my view 'nazarin' is second only to 'the exterminating angel', in terms of his mexican movies, and is certainly near the top of the list of bunuel's total filmic output.

the topic of religion in buñuel films is a point that one, as an eater of films, as an eater of art or as a person need to analyze hardly. one can see to a satirical buñuel in "la voie lactée", "un chien andalou" or in "l'age d'or". is very hard and effective in its critic, but when you have seen this and then you see a movie like "nazarin", after you see this work you begin to be questioned about its author. and much have questioned about what seems to be a contradiction for buñuel thinks, but is better not called in this way, i think that there's not any contradiction in its work, only that buñuel religion point of view is very diverse as unique in films.this beautiful film is based on the novel of benito perez galdós, which told us the story of father nazario, who lived a humble, simple life dedicated to god and to help everyone. he lived in a simple and poor region. there lived too beatriz, who is an abused and abandoned wife. she don't find any sense of her life without her violent, macho man. she have a kind of repulse to him. in the other side is andara, one of the towns prostitutes. father nazario has been stolen again, he blames to andara's cousin. andara hear this and try to fight without success with the priest, who don't believe in violence. that night, andara find that her cousin is actually a thief, she have stole her bellboys. andara fights with her cousin with terrible consequences. with this, andara search mercy from the priest. nazario decides to help her, knowing well that this could be against his church, obviously this thing going to have some consequences. since here, nazario going to be a pilgrim. without nothing, even without shoes, but with spirit and faith. but andara and beatriz want to be with he, and be like he, to serve god.if is the sweetest buñuel film that i have seen so far, is too the most spiritual. is clear here that the thing that most confuse people with the contradiction is that here, we don't see a buñuel against the power of church, we see a buñuel whose film is about church but not in the typical - and great - satirical way. whethever like it is, i don't think that the right word is contradiction, actually i find it pleasant and well done and in spite of contain such religious issues (as his "voie lactée") i found it more a spiritual film but that don't try to touch in diversity the catholic religion as maybe he touch, and laugh of it in another films. "nazarin" is of father nazario and its perspective front god and the same religion but all of this is at the end, analyzed in the spiritual life of this man.the other two women are, not a contrast, but as very well another two perspectives of faith. first we have beatriz, the mistreated woman, that lose all the faith in life, first with her husband and then with a little girl who was in her family. this little girl was very sick. at side of her was too andara, the prostitute who run of the justice. in the family of the child, just religious women, there a big pain, but faith becomes in father nazario when he arrives with nothing to this town. he bless the child, a say later she is fine. the priest want go on walking, but beatriz and andara have recovered the faith in life and want to dedicate their lives to god with father nazario. after some complains, father nazario decide to be with them, discovering with some things until the end how he feels about faith, god, religion and the person in necessity, the people who must request to charity to survive. this last issue then must be noted as one possible explanation for the pineapple ending. this ending we listen the drums (similar to that in "l'age d'or) and a father nazario, walking over asking about this things, when he refuse the fruit at the first time and at the end decide to receive it as a symbol of necessity or maybe, as an answer for its spiritual road that begin being priest. meanwhile, the two women must take away of the father, andara for its crime (beautiful scene where she thanks a man who helps father nazario in jail and then she damn the man who hit the priest in jail) and beatriz because she prefer be with her macho man, in spite that he treat her bad, just because she don't accept that she fall in loved with the priest. father nazario - and here is maybe the unique place in film to critic church- walk to contradict the church, the religion that he serves.father nazario is that then, is a (soft for much, but not for me) critic for some thing in religion (father nazario helping a women who is guilty of a crime, of a sin) but most of all is one of buñuel analysis of faith and life, and he really got it, with a beautiful, tender, sweet and unforgettable film, that is, without a doubt, one of his best.*sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any.

luis bunuel has always been a filmmaker whose work was obscure to me. my first experience with him was the discreet charm of the bourgeosie, often considered his greatest work, with which i became so frustrated and bored that i eventually shut the tape off. likewise belle de jour, which is almost certainly his best known film and also generally considered one of his many masterpieces, didn't interest me very much at all. i didn't hate it like i did discreet, but i didn't like it. third, i saw l'age d'or. finally, i had gotten somewhere. fourth, los olvidados, also good. still, neither l'age d'or nor los olvidados blew me away. great films, but not masterpieces.nazarin is my fifth bunuel, and i like it just a tad more than those other two. it is about a priest from spain now in mexico who refuses to live in the kind of luxury most priests live in. he wants to be more like jesus, leading the meekest life possible. he's also willing to forgive everyone for anything, and to suffer without protest. i'm pretty sure bunuel does not sympathize with the character, and sees him as rather self-righteous. however, i only assume that because of my knowledge of the director, whose most famous quotation is "thank god, i'm still an atheist," which he apparently said in an interview over this very film (i get this information from john baxter's book about bunuel, if you're interested). the interviewer who dragged those words from bunuel's mouth must have been himself confused about nazarin. one who was more predisposed to believe in religious conviction, who also knows nothing about bunuel, might see the priest as a heroic figure. this is especially true if that viewer has his/her own criticisms of organized religion. the priest may be somewhat self-righteous, but he seems to be basically a good man. when he harbors a violent prostitute in his room in order to protect her (and, presumably, to save her soul), people begin to find out and assume that their relationship is sexual. his superiors assume the same and punish him for it. later on, he suffers even worse punishments from clerics.

spanish director luis buñuel career spanned almost 50 years, from 1929 to 1977. arguably, his best films were those he made during his exile in mexico - from the late forties to the early 60s. there he had to deal with very cheap budgets, and work in an industry interested mainly in churning commercial movies to unsophisticated audiences, yet he somehow managed to make interesting, thought provoking movies that have stand the test of time. this movie is based on a novel by spanish author benito perez galdos - and the adaptation is quite faithful, even if the setting is now early 20th century mexico instead of early 20th century spain. the protagonist, nazarin, is a priest who tries to live a life that is as faithful as it can be to the one prescribed by christ. the question many would ask is whether such endeavor would be possible, without incurring in the hostility, incomprehension and mockery of your fellow human beings. as it happens, he suffers a lot of indignities, yet he remains stubborn (until the controversial final shot) to this objective. i think buñuel wanted to show nazarin as a somewhat ridiculous figure, but perhaps inadvertently, his stubbornness (at least to this viewer) comes out as admirable. in any case, a great film.

i love the absurdity and biting humor of buñuel's surrealist films (such as "the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie" and "the exterminating angel", to name two). other, earlier works (like "the forgotten ones", about juvenile delinquents from a marginal neighborhood in mexico) are more serious and provide a strong social message.however, i believe it is "nazarin" which most successfully shoots for the heart of the viewer. while it's true that it's brimming with irony, it nevertheless reveals an aspect of buñuel which would appear to be intrigued by the beauty and solemnity of the spiritual quest. here, while the director (quite typically) throws countless jabs at the catholic church, he also appears to show, surprisingly, a sense of admiration for genuine christian thought and its practice of selfless love."what?? luis buñuel unabashedly praising a jesus-like figure??" i always thought of him as a completely cynical artist without a trace of faith in human virtue... that is, until i watched "nazarin". my appreciation is that he satirically exposes the difficulty of following christ's example in a society infested with meanness, ignorance and sin; but he also presents the hero, father nazario, as quite the beacon of light amidst a sea of darkness. without a doubt, by the end of the film i was looking up to him and not down on him! some would argue that father nazario's doubts regarding his faith point to the loss of his saintly values. (alas, if he can't do good in this world, who can?) but i would say that this "flaw", his frustration, precisely makes his character all the more heroic, because it shows how human he is and how challenging his struggle within must be. and who says the priest couldn't eventually emerge from that "dark night" and regain his confidence? perhaps we've only been presented with a difficult part of his spiritual journey. the elegant, open ending (in which he desperately accepts the fruit offered by a female stranger) allows us to imagine ourselves the final outcome of the story.i recognize in buñuel the aggressive, self-professed atheist endowed with brilliant wit and social consciousness; but after having watched "nazarin", i also sense from him a certain warmth, a depth and maturity that's not so evident in his other work.for the sake of contrast, i strongly recommend watching afterward his short film "simon of the desert" (also made in mexico, several years later). it deals with a similar subject matter -- the abandonment of the ego in the face of temptation --, only it does so in a hysterically funny and totally irreverent style.

when you look at mexico's best movies you will more than likely find that the photography was performed by gabriel figueroa. he is recognized in the world as one of the best that have ever existed. his master control of the cameras gave an added asset to the movies he was part of. if added to his participation we add the direction of luis bunuel, you will never find such a pair of aces anywhere else in the world. this story, nazarin, was written by spain's greatest writer besides miguel de cervantes(don quijote de la mancha). the story in itself is superb: nazarin a priest that lives by his beliefs tries to live a very christian life, but as always there are people that do not accept this. he wanders through many places preaching his christianity but finding, most of the time, people that do not accept him. but besides the splendid story, it is always interesting to try to interpret the enigmatic messages that bunuel sends us throughout the picture in scenes that make you shiver.

this movie is a fascinating example of luis bunuel's storytelling abilities. this is a comedy that is not a comedy, and a social drama that is not a social drama. even though i don't think it was particularly funny, it made me laugh. also, despite the fact that you can never take bunuel too seriously, the movie made think about religion and its importance in some people's lives. bunuel tells the story of a catholic priest, devoted to his faith like no one else and the viewer witness what happens when the priest's undying commitment to serve others is put to test. as usual, bunuel's target is catholicism, but i don't think he tried to mock the church as he often does. at least i didn't take the film as a mockery of the institution. i think he is trying to make an interesting point about how religion could be a nuisance in today's modern society. not because faith in itself is bad, but because people always mange to bastardize the concept. message aside, i think this is one of bunuel's most clever works. francisco rabal is superb as the priest. definitely, one of the filmmaker's best movies.

"nazarin" directed by luis bunuel presents an extraordinary view of religion in mexico. as written by the director and julio alejandro, his notable collaborator, this was a film that put mexican cinema in the international map after receiving the grand prix in cannes that year. it's a disturbing film because mr. bunuel delves deep into what's wrong with the church.nazarin, by all reckoning, is a saint. this young priest is seen living a life of poverty in a seedy pension of a city. he doesn't have enough for himself, but he doesn't mind parting with a coin when a beggar appears by his window asking for help. at the same time, he takes into his small room a prostitute that has been hurt in a fight with another woman. andara, the woman repays his kindness by burning the room and the whole building! nazarin is seen taking to the countryside begging for food. andara and beatriz, two prostitutes from his old town follow him. nazarin's life parallels that of jesus. in fact, this saintly figure makes a case for humility.of course,mr. bunuel had no religion in mind when he and mr. alejandro took it upon themselves to create this film. it's ironic how spain welcomed him after this film was released because they saw it as showing christian qualities, when in reality, this is an acerbic satire on the catholic church and its ministers.francisco rabal, the spanish actor, makes a wonderful nazarin. this was one of his best roles. mr. rabal worked extensively in his native country, but also in mexico and argentina. rita macedo, as andara, is also excellent. marga lopez also makes a valuable contribution with her portrayal of beatriz.a great film by one of the cinema's master film makers: luis bunuel.

nazarin is some kind of saint,he wants to live in life exactly how christ taught man to do.but it's too late:now the catholic church is between the hands of a wealthy bourgeoisie,the bishops live in luxury and don't give a damn about the poor and the sick.that's why our hero can't follow the way his hierarchy asks him to follow.so he divests himself of everything,and on his way to purity,he's joined by some kind of mary magdelene and a woman who's attracted by him sexually (the scene between this girl and her fiancé is telling).in spain (it was the late fifties),they thought nazarin was a christian movie!knowing luis bunuel,it was downright incongruous:all his work is anticlerical to a fault.comparing nazarin and his "holy women" to jesus is a nonsense.on nazarin's way,only brambles and couch grass grow.his attempt at helping working men on the road is a failure,he's chased out as a strike-breaker.all his words amount to nothing.at the end of the journey,he's arrested and offered a pineapple by a woman(bunuelian sexual symbol). thanks to "nazarin" ,bunuel was allowed to return to spain (where the censors had not got a clue ) and to direct "viridiana".

running out of time is probably as close to a perfect film as you're ever likely to see out of hong kong. all the elements click: a terrific script (by french writers julien carbon and laurent courtiaud) that even manages to subvert the odd cliché, reliably imaginative direction by johnnie to, and excellent central performances by andy lau and lau ching wan, the latter displaying his great comic timing to wonderful effect without ever crossing the line into parody (especially in his exasperated reactions to his superior's abysmal negotiating skills). the supporting cast is fine too, with yo yo mung making a strong impression in a tiny role, and even the often histrionic waise lee (looking remarkably, and very aptly, like a bald andy lau) reining it in to good effect. it's best not to know too much about the plot going in beyond the basic set-up  with only a few weeks to live, lau engages in a criminal game with wan's cop with no easily apparent motive  and just sit back and enjoy the ride: it's certainly worth the fare. it also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent movies, and played in a mere three scenes (the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of film-making i've seen in ages). there's also a fine score by raymond wong as well. the most fun playing cat and mouse at the movies in years.

the one thing that can be said about running out of time is that it's an immensely clever film. it's interesting to note that the film's writers are french, which may explain the movie's "out of the norm" vibe, as it doesn't really fit in with what is commonly called "hong kong cinema".the movie concerns a thief who plans revenge on some criminal types using the assistance of an equally clever cop. but first he has to convince the cop to join his personal crusade, and so begins a series of games where the thief manuevers the cop into his plan.quite a clever movie.7 out of 10(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie or full-length reviews of other foreign films)

terrific, deeply moving crime thriller starring andy lau and lau ching wan.from the dizzying opening sequence to the extremely satisfying conclusion, this cat and mouser hardly misses a beat.johnny to, again working with ace composer arthur wong, constructs another operatic actioner that grots in the face of its contemporaries.to's images are strong and moving. his cutting, combined with the extraordinary music cues, is exemplary. you are in the hands of a master cinematician.the two sequences in which andy lau "hides" from the cops on a bus by pretending to accompany a lithe beauty (ruby wong) are testament to to's unique directorial skills.lau ching wan is strong and commanding as the harassed cop while andy lau is dynamic as a dying man avenging his father's death.this is superb movie-making, only mildly compromised by some bad english dubbing in one scene with criminal waise lee.

andy lau and lau ching-wan are both superb in johnny to's tautly directed crime thriller which puts most western efforts to shame. think of it as the hong kong 'heat', only better! everything about the film screams class; from the performances to the soundtrack, the cinematography to the script. the tone remains serious throughout, but the film has a nice line in black-humour, friendship and romance at it's heart. sure, it gets a little preposterous later on, but it would be a hard-hearted viewer who didn't find something to love about this movie. thank god, hollywood hasn't (yet) re-made and ruined a classic. do yourself a favour and see this film!

having seen 'only' about 200 hong kong films in my time, i have to say this film is among my very top favorites. not only is the plot engaging (and in some ways surprising, which these days is rare for any movie), but the chemistry between the two lead actors is superb. top notch casting! and while often even the most serious hk films tend to insert quite a bit of humor in between all the drama and action, often spoiling the mood a bit, here the jokes are kept subtle and woven into the plot, even improving character relations. the music is also very well done, and the two main themes are very beautiful. with the release of the hk special edition, they've even cleaned the picture (first release was grainy) and the subtitles, even if the quality of the translation is still lacking (nothing new there). all in all, if you have to see a hk film that isn't directed by john woo or have chow yun fat in it, this should be at least on your short list! a truly fascinating and entertaining watch!

running out of time rests somewhere in the middle of johnny to's cannon, in the "solid good" category. as a crime thriller it's not terribly original or overwhelming and the action scenes will not blow you away but it has something else going for it. it's a johnny to film after all, it has to.andy lau has 72 hours to live. he decides to play a strange cat-and-mouse game with a hostage negotiator of the hk police, played by lau ching wan. that's the plot in a nutshell. on top of that to piles layers of twists and turns that keep proceedings interesting throughout. it occasionally becomes too convoluted for its own sake but never lets it get the best of it. however, just as johnny to is about to hand over a slick and well-made crime flick (which, let's face it, are dime-a-dozen), he slips in bits and pieces that bring running out of time alive as a full emotional experience, providing the soul and heart to the well-oiled skeleton.the concepts of synchronism and minimalism (staples in his work) are explored in great effect here. always subtle, letting the images speak for themselves, giving them time to develop with long takes and slow tracking shots, exemplary cutting to the score, it's all here. a small love story in a bus between andy lau and a girl is among the highlights of the film and part of the "heart" i'm talking about. so simple yet so powerful. ditto for lau's and lau ching wan's car scenes and the bowling-room showdown.however something stops me from claiming running out of time is a masterpiece. to has all the ability and craftmanship down to a notch but he can also be too workmanlike or bland at times. when he's good, he's real good. there are even isolated moment of pure brilliance that are just too good for their own sake, leaving a bittersweet aftertaste for the rest of the movie. i'm convinced that if he puts his heart to it, he can make a really great film. as it is, this is another one of his films that is flawed but enjoyable. underneath the slick hk style, it's the black humour and heartfelt drama that makes this a compelling film. worth watching, definitely.

i just purchased an zhan (running out of time) on dvd and it was an excellent film i must say. not really action-packed, in terms of gun play, but definitely exciting and witty. i do not think i have seen andy lau in better form. and the editing on this film was very well executed. go watch this now if you are a fan of lau or hk thiller/action film!

this film is a refreshing change of pace from the mindless hong kong triad movies i have grown so tired of. there are no spectacular gun fights. no car chases. and practically minimal action to speak of. the audience is kept in suspense for the most part, though certain aspects of the so called "ploy" by andy lau are quite obvious.the film has been hailed as a departure from the genre of violent triad films, and as an "intelligent" crime film. to an extent, it is. but, to some extent, it still fails the "believability" test. one can hardly picture any triad member to be dumb enough to not see through the female disguise of andy lau in a second. it also seemed to have fallen for the "if someone was seriously ill, the said someone will be coughing up copious amounts of blood regularly" thing chinese films seem to go for all the time.the subtle relationship between the two lead characters is a refreshing change.all in all an enjoyable film, even though the concept is not new and there are few surprises. >

i've recently seen an zhan. not because it was a hong kong film, but because i was looking for a change from the films being produced here in the us. in my humble opinion, i believe the film could easily compete against the action thrillers being produced here, except for the traditional idiocyncracies of hong kong film. the one that still bothers me was the chief inspector character. i still don't understand why there has to be a complete-idiot-comic-relief-type character even in the serious films that come out of hong kong, but i can live with it when the movie is this good. the characters are believable even if the situations they are in are not. the story is fast paced and really sucks you in to it. the real cincher scenes for me were the two bus rides that the thief character takes. overall, a really solid film.

if you're familiar with the work of auteur johnny to and his band of filmmaking cronies over at milky way, you know what to expect with this latest production. all the familiar elements are in place: the strong camaraderie between two characters: usually a cop and a baddie, the coincidences and chances that turn on a dime and pay off handsomely in the end, and the humor that arises even in the most dire of situations.andy lau plays a man who has 72 hours to live and decides to rob an insurance company. lau ching-wan (also brilliant in other milky way films like "longest nite," "a hero never dies," and "where a good man goes") portrays a hostage negotiator/cop who is on the robber's tail, even as the robber sets up a series of tricks and clues that he must follow in order to get his man.funny, poignant, and cool while being subtle, "running" is actually one of the most entertaining milky way films to date. don't miss the performances by the two leads, esp. andy lau, usually considered an average actor who has rarely been this natural and fun to watch. this film is one to go out of your way to see.

not high art, not even exceptionally innovative, but a thoroughly enjoyable movie. funny, fresh, intelligent - there are still people out there who don't need millions of dollars to hide that they're out of ideas.when you compare this to your average hollywood action flick, you're comparing a homemade meal with a big mac.

the late director john frankenheimer directed his first feature film, the young stranger, after starting out directing live television dramas in new york city. this film came on the heels of the success of rebel without a cause in 1955. james macarthur made his feature film debut as a troubled teen with a movie producer father, played by james daly, who doesn't establish enough of a relationship with his son. kim hunter plays the mother, who tries to bridge the gap between her husband and her son. the film uses the popular juvenile delinquent angle of the time to tell its story. macarthur gets in trouble at a movie theater with an overzealous theater manager played by whit bissell. macarthur, in turn, has to deal with a police sergeant, james gregory, bent on teaching him a lesson. the material could easily have turned exploitative, laughable, and sensational, like any number of others of the period did. however, under the sure-handed direction of frankenheimer, the film is a sensitive portrayal of teenage and parental dynamics. the dialog is realistic and most of the scenes hold up surprisingly well. some of the scenes with bissell, as the theater manager, and gregory, as the police sergeant, are a bit heavy-handed and dated. the performances are uniformly good though, which is necessary for a film of this nature and about this topic to succeed. this is an impressive feature film debut both for macarthur and frankenheimer. *** of 4 stars.

***spoilers*** well made and interesting film about the alienated youth of america back in the 1950's. back in those days many parents caught up with making big bucks and living high on the hog forget that their children, especially teen-agers, needed a lot more then a car and and hefty allowance in order to feel part of the family. they also needed love and attention, to their growing up problems, which is what 16 year-old hal ditmar, james macarthur never got from his successful movie producer dad mr.tom ditmar, james daly.never really connecting with his dad hal grows more and more distant from both him and his caring mom helen ditmar, kim hunter, as well as from society. after his dad put hal down about him wanting to borrow his car, a late model luxury sedan, he and his friend jerry, jeffery silver, drive in hal's beat up and barley operational 1930's jalopy to the local treater to catch the latest western flick.feeling like striking out at the world hal acts like a real first-class jerk sticking his smelly feet almost into the faces of a couple, eddie ryder & jean corbett, sitting in front of him and jerry trying to watch the movie. this leads hal, as well as his friend jerry, to not only be kicked out of the theater but with him belting the theater manager mr. grebbs, whit bissell. it turned out that at least hal was willing to leave the theater, without even getting his money back, but when grebbs tries to grab him hal wheeled around and belted him right in the kisser.hal now in real hot water, he's charged with assault and battery, put's on his "james dean" act, at the local police station, making like he's either too cool or just plain stupid to realize what he's done; almost knocked mr. grebbs teeth out. it's when sgt.shipley, james gergory, tells hal that his dad is coming to pick him up when he finally sobers up to the fact of what he's done.the rest of the film has hal try to straighten himself out but is unable to do that because the low esteem that his dad has of him. begging his father to understand that what he did, in belting mr. grebbs, was in self-defense hal's father acts as if he's been there, at the theater, and saw the whole incident with his son hal acting like a street thug instead of of a young man being grabbed and pushed without provocation.not excusing what hal did, in laying out mr. grebbs, he in fact was willing to admit his hooligan behavior but he wanted both mr. grebbs and his dad to at least treat him with an iota of consideration; gebbs in the fact that he provoked hal and mr. ditmas in not even bothering to hear him out! feeling like a wanted criminal without anyone, but his mom, to really turn too hal slowly loses it only to later have both sgt. shipley and mr. grabbs agree to drop the assault charge. you would think that by now hal's has finally learned his lesson but the real lesson, more then a stretch behind bars, that hal's so desperately needed was a lesson that his father totally ignored! being there when his son needed him most and in that mr. ditmar failed with flying colors.things do in fact straighten out for everyone in the movie only after mr. grebbs gets belted, ending up with a butte of a shiner, again by hal who, going back to grebbs theater, tries to get him to phone his dad and tell him that hal was only defending himself when he first, not the second time around, clobbered him. in the end hal learned a real lesson in getting along with people an not letting his problems become other peoples problems. but most of all hal's father mr. ditmar learned the most valuable lesson of all in how to understand his frustrated and alienated son and act like a father toward him instead of a combination jail-keeper and a sugar daddy. like the song says "all you need s love" to get things on the right track and it was both love and understanding for his son hal that mr. ditmar, until the very end of the movie, lacked the most off.

this eloquent, simple film makes a remarkably clear statement about a teenager and his father. though a theatrical release, it has a "made-for-tv" quality. we can attribute this to the director, john frankenheimer, who learned his craft in the early days of live television in new york city. indeed, he directed the teleplay on which the film is based, "deal a blow," on the cbs drama series "climax." "young stranger" represents his hollywood debut. after a hiatus of four years, during which he would do more television, he returned to direct "the young savages" with burt lancaster and, a year after that, "all fall down" with warren beatty and angela lansbury.the casting is competent with james daly and kim hunter (particularly good) playing the parents of the title character performed by james macarthur (his first theatrical film) who played the same role in the television version which was his first appearance on the small screen. look for james gregory and whit bissell in supporting roles.

the world is going to miss john frankenheimer. this was his first feature film and it was four years before he directed his second, but don't let that dissuade you from seeking it out. frankenheimer's direction is assured, and he gets some compelling performances out of his cast.someone else has already pointed them out, but i also want to talk up james gregory and whit bissell in two key supporting roles. both would work for frankenheimer again -- gregory most notably as the bumbling senator in "the manchurian candidate" -- and they do good work for him here.if the whole thing seems too simple in the end, that's merely because frankenheimer and writer robert dozier chose to tell a simple story, and they do it well. keep a lookout for it -- turner classic movies just might show it again.

riding high on the success of "rebel without a cause", came a tidal wave of 'teen' movies. arguably this is one of the best. a very young mcarthur excels here as the not really too troubled teen. the story concentrates more on perceptions of delinquency, than any traumatic occurrence. the supporting cast is memorable, frankenheimer directs like an old pro. just a story of a young man that finds others take his actions much too seriously.

what often threatens to turn into a soppy and soft-headed drama about misunderstood middle-class youth ends up a surprisingly shaded and subdued movie by john frankenheimer (his first, though he had started in television, directing among other things an earlier version of this script).we are still in those semi-mythic 50s when teenagers drove jalopies and jeans were still dungarees. james macarthur (adoptive son of playwright charles and actress helen hayes, and later to enter pop culture as hawaii 5-0's danno) gets involved in a minor incident in a movie theater which escalates to his throwing a punch at the manager (whit bissell) and being booked down at the police station. his dad (james daly), a big-shot movie producer gets the call, doesn't listen to his son's version of the story, and pulls strings to get him off.but macarthur keeps carrying a chip on his shoulder, which even his sympathetic mom (kim hunter) can't knock off. things worsen in the coldwater canyon homestead until macarthur, trying to vindicate himself, stages a reprise of the original incident....the movie doesn't quite avoid the attitudes  and cliches  of its time, but presents them with considerable nuance: every character gets an honorable hearing; every point of view has its merits (and reactions to the movie will depend on what viewers bring to it). there are flaws (the word `crummy,' a standard rebellious euphemism of the era, is used about 30 times too often) but they're outweighed by strengths. the movie benefits from a strong cast (most notable among them the excellent character actor james gregory, as a police detective) and a resolutely non-exploitative way of telling its story. from a vantage point in the new millennium, the hot water macarthur finds himself in may seem a little tepid, but the young stranger remains honest and honorable.

this film is really, really full of sex. hot sex. i watched it (of course) on cinemax; and i liked it of course; those virtual fantasies are played out so much in great style, and i kind of enjoyed the story line. but one must know that when a soft porn film director sets out to make another soft porn film; all he/she wants to do is film good sex scenes. and i got nice sex scenes, full of skin. yet another reason some people call soft porn cinemax films "skinemax."

seldom is seen a film sequel that surpasses or even equalls the greatness of it's original predecessor. such a film is virtual encounters 2.it's about a couple guys in college who sell virtual sex to the entire campus. if you like seeing naked chicks, this one delivers. six-foot tall chrissy styler is an amazing specimen and you will be dreaming about her for days if you ever have the good fortune to catch the unrated version. she wears just the right amount of body glitter in her multiple nude scenes and her giant cans appear to be real. ( = giddyup!!w/the exception of james cameron's "aliens," francis for coppola's "the godfather part ii" and - of course - the zuckers' "airplane 2," this is the only sequel in movie history that takes a classic film and improves upon it. it's criminal the way this film was ignored by the academy. nikki fritz and that broad who gets tied up in the beginning (as well as the brunette who gets a rubdown towards the end) all deserved best supporting actress nods. shame on you, hollywood!!!

this has no relationship to virtual encounters 1, so it's not really a sequel. the two videos just share the general concept of people having simulated sex through a virtual reality machine. so if you were really blown away by the story and dialog in vc 1 (yeah, right), and expecting a continuation in vc 2, just be warned. all the actors and actresses are new, but it has the same excellent director, sybil richards.but like vc 1, you get lots of beautiful women and a lot of great sex scenes that push the envelope of soft core just about as far as it can go.if you have vc 1 and you liked it, you'll like vc 2. if you don't have either, but like really good softcore sex, get both.

i honestly found wicked little things to be a very cool and fun horror film.my friend had given this to me, and i really saw it as nothing but a crappy low class gory horror film.then after i watched this i was wrong it was very cool and very good and while ill say it seemed a bit unnecessary at times, and while it may not be the best horror film ever its still good.i thought the acting was very good especially from the girl who plays the mother(she seemed very believable and to me very likable).and while it is a little cliché'e and over the top its good.overall i gotta say if the afterdark horror fest films are not your style then you should have no business watching this, but if you like horror films, or a wicked little time than check out wicked little things. 8.0 out of 10 stars

i saw part of this film on the sci-fi channel, but missed the ending. i bought the dvd to see the whole movie, and i'm glad i did.a young mother and her two daughters move into a house out in a backwoods area that they inherited from the husband, who died from an illness. it's very run down, but the three women make the best of it. the teen daughter (scout taylor-compton) is warned by a local boy about the zombies that come out at night. she ignores him, but since he has a cute friend, she joins his group. meanwhile, the younger daughter (chloe grace moretz) makes a friend in a zombie girl her age named mary. it turns out that mary and several other kids died in a mine in 1913 while working as child labor. now that they are zombies, they attack and kill anyone who's not a blood relative. this movie was directed by j.s. cardone, whose previous films include the slayer (1981) and shadowzone (1990), two movies i didn't like in the slightest bit. this is why i was surprised that i actually enjoyed this movie. the film is deliberately paced, which i liked. this allows you to get to know the main characters, most of whom are likable. child zombies have been used at least since george romero's 1968 classic night of the living dead. still, i found the tool-using child zombies in this movie interesting. it would seem that cardone finally found the right script and cast. only the stereotypical scenes of the teens smoking, drinking and making out in a parked car were boring to me.taylor-compton also appears in the halloween remake. moretz appeared in the amityville horror (2005) and the horror film room 6 (2006).

from the acting to cardone's direction, this new twist on the familiar ghost's been-done-wrong theme, will keep you glued to your seat. slow at times because it builds this 'what's gonna happen' tension. medium-well on gore but what there is nicely nasty. spoiler: the death of the jockhole and subsequent feast is a highlight for gore hounds.the writers crafted an old story but added twists and re-imagined you typical haunting. cardone brings it to life . . . er . . uh death.lori heuring, scout taylor-compton and the ever fabulous ben cross are real, no signs of acting here. everyone in the cast is committed and truly isn't that what any director strives for. the actors believe, so we believe.along with the traditional ghost story surprises the film is loaded with tons of atmosphere, from the mine, hank's house and the tunny home, there's a creeping fear from the first frame to the last.horror fans, do yourself a favor and enjoy what amounts to be one of the true horror movies out there today.i end with a big kudo to boaz davidson (story) ben nedivi (screenplay)for without inventive writers hollywood would be nothing but an ugly reality tv party.

i have to say i was pleasantly surprised by this movie. other than the mother being a complete moron on a few occasions and the youngest daughter being idiotic enough to go out at night, into woods that scared her in the daytime, this movie was pretty good. had the director had the sense to treat us as if we had brains, maybe he'd have given us a movie where the people didn't have to behave idiotically, but still manage to get into danger. it worked for the plumber and the fellow in the trailer, but apparently the teenagers and the mother needed to be idiots, for the director to get closure in ending this film.atmosphere was great, scenery was awesome and the undead kids scared the crap out of me... i live in a wooded area, so taking out the trash will creep me out for quite a while. the movie works for me accept for what i already mentioned. raise the mom's iq a bit and i'd give it a ten...

may contain spoilers!!! in no way, shape or form does this movie break the horror movie mold. not by a long shot. however, it does deliver a creepy atmosphere, believable enough characters and gore.the story is simple and doesn't bother to unfurl itself anymore than it needs to. a bunch of kids are killed in a mining accident back in the early 1900's. since then, they have stalked and killed the residence of their sleepy little pa town in the mountains.simple: they want revenge on the man that caused their death years and years ago. naturally, his great, great, great grandson is in town and he's a real prick.along with that, a mother and her two daughters inherit a run old house after the husband dies. the eldest daughter is rebellious, obnoxious...a typical teen. the younger is curious, bright-eyed and gets in with the ghost children.the creepiest part of this flick is the sheer emotionlessness of the children and they hack their way through victim after victim. excellent acting. it was so spooky! i mean, the children of the corn flicks are one thing...but this topped any of those (as for the creepy kids).worht a look. i bought it before seeing it and i was not unhappy. but i'm a horror fan through and through.

this work is pretty atmospheric, with a couple of surprises a few really creepy elements. i found this work more rewarding than i first expected, given the rotten reviews this receives here at imdb. the dialog comes across as natural and honest (given the circumstances), although the overall run of the film goes from predictable to cliché with the heroines falling down when they should be running, and investigating strange noises when they should be locking their doors. typical horror movie fare.the local characters are some of the worst clichés, depicting appalachian natives as in-bred developmentally challenged freaks. the characters of the children and the principals are great! the development given is adequate, and scout taylor-compton seems to be developing her talents quite well.now, i'm not going to say that this is entirely original or the best thing since sliced bread (which isn't all that great by the way), but this is interesting and i do not long for my 107 minutes back. i would not say this is an awesome movie by any means, but there are some really good horror elements herein. but there are also some really slow spots where plot/character development seem superfluous to the director's (or the film editor's) whim.all in all, this is good for a rainy night, but not so good for a friday/saturday night's viewing.it rates a 7.6/10 from...the fiend :.

'wicked little things' really separates itself from other zombie movies.first off, all of the zombies in the movie don't exactly starting biting at you and tearing your flesh apart with their bare hands.they kill you with either a pickax or shovel and eat you after wards.second, they can't die.in most zombie movies, you can shoot a zombie in the head and kill them, but these simply won't die.third, which is the biggest reason why this movie separates itself, all of the zombies are children.how did they die exactly to become zombies? they were working in a coal mine when suddenly they were all killed in a collapse.now they wander the forest carrying their pickaxes and shovels, waiting for someone to come by so they can kill them and eat them.oh, they also come out at night.yep, only at night.that makes the movie even more fun then it would be if they came out in the morning.despite all of the violent and gory mayhem in this movie, 'wicked little things' is a great choice if you're looking for a movie about zombie children.don't expect anything great like 'dawn of the dead' or 'land of the dead', but do expect lots of gore and violence that makes this movie a real zombie fan pleaser.everyone give scout taylor-compton from rob zombie's 'halloween' a big hand for delivering a great performance like the one she did in 'halloween'.she really needs to start starring in more horror movies.

this is definitely the biggest surprise of the festival so far and without a doubt the best the festival has had to offer. i went into this film with little to no expectations after learning that the director was responsible for the awful vampire flick the forsaken. and i left pleasantly surprised. the film stars lori heuring of in crowd fame as a young mother whose husband has just passed. she moves into an old family home in the mountains with her two daughters next to a mine that is a gravesite to overworked children back in the day. unlucky for them the children return with a vengeance killing and eating everyone in their path. the film works on many levels. it's well done, suspenseful, it has spots of good cinematography and capable performances by compton especially. the atmosphere is spooky yet slightly underwhelming, the score is decent and the makeup effects are gruesome and simplistic. the film keeps up a creepy and unsettling tone and the kids themselves with pale skin, torn up lips and hollow eyes are pretty scary and unrelenting. the film is original and inventive without being to artsy or complicated. i can't see this film making it into a wide release without some trimming and slight fine tuning. but they definitely have a good product on there hands and should pursue some type of theatrical distribution. however the theatre in which i saw it in was horrible. the sound was dreadfully messed up which i felt took away from the film majorly and it stopped in the middle because they couldn't center it on the screen which killed the mood a bit. all in all though it was the most satisfying of horrorfests entries maybe because it had the least expectations but nonetheless was a welcome addition to genre films.

wicked little things was a really good movie.i will say at some parts it seemed really unbelievable, and others it seemed as if there just wasn't enough thought put into the actions of the characters, but overall it was exciting and entertaining.i don't understand why this movie's rating is so low.nor do i not understand why all the afterdark horrorfest film's ratings are so low.these are b-movies people, and nothing more.they provide great entertainment and most of them don't have many flaws at all.this is definitely worth a look, because you won't be disappointed with the outcome.wicked little things is one of the best 1st annual afterdark horrorfest films, and compared to a lot of other films in the series, this is one of the best overall.

having finally been able to get the dvd of this 1997 hbo film, is at down to watch it. by the time i finished it the old saying "those who can not learn from the past are doomed to relive it" was echoing in the mind. first shown four years after the first bombing of the twin towers (and four years before the events of 9/11) path to paradise reveals the series of close encounters, blunders and official in-decisions that led to the first bombing of the twin towers and the lessons we should have learned from them.path to paradise features a nice cast of believable actors. peter gallagher and marcia gay harden lead the cast as fbi agents john anticev and nancy floyd who face not only the threats of terrorism but the lack of official interest from their superiors along with their nypd counterpart lou napoli (paul guilfoyle). art malik, andreas katsulas, shaun toub and tony gillan are among those who plan and carry out the attack all of whom play their roles not as potential clichés but as real living people and make the film all the better for it. of special mention is ned eisenberg as emad salem the man whom, if it had not been for skeptical fbi officials, could have potentially informed on the plot.the film is also well produced. despite being made for cable this film doesn't feel like a low-budget film at all with its production values particularly in its sets and new york city locations. the film's fascinating cinematography gives the film an almost documentary style at times. when all of these elements are combined with the script it all helps to give the film a sense of reality which makes the events taking place all the more disturbing.the most disturbing thing about he film is its script. the events of the film are true (minus some dramatic license which is always necessary) and in hindsight are made even more shocking then they must have been when the film was first shown twelve years ago. the film reveals just how a group of men were able to smuggle a bomb into the world trade center. they did so thanks to the lack of arabic translators, government agencies failing to pass information to each other, the fbi ignoring leads from a source and police departments being unable to pick up on clues. worse then investigators inabilities to connect dots is the fact that many of these same things not only allowed the 9.11 attacks to take place but in some cases (such as the lack of translators) are issues that continue even today. even more chilling is the ending which really did happen and looks all too prophetic today.path to paradise is a film that should be essential viewing today. the film is not only well acted and produced but teaches us a lesson we should have learned sooner. the lesson of the film? that those who can not learn from the past are doomed to relive it. if you can find this film then watch it and learn from it.

this is a great western story with outstanding veteran actors who made this film great entertainment to view and enjoy. glenn ford,(john parrish),"midway",'76 tries to play low key after having experienced battles in the war and plays the peace maker role for the time being. john parrish decides the town is entirely too rough and tough and goes to visit barbara stanwyck,(martha wilkison),"crime of passion",57, who is the wife of edward g. robinson,(lee wilkison),"the red house",'47. lee wilkison, offers john parrish fifteen thousand dollars for his ranch and john turns down the offer. lee wilkson decides to have his son, brian keith,(cole wilkison),"the wind & the lion",'75, change his mind in more ways than one. there are romantic scenes between may wynn,(caroline vail),"the caine mutiny",'54, and john parrish and some hot encounters with dianne foster(judith wilkison),"three hours to kill",'54, who hates her father lee. if you like edward g. robinson and glenn ford films, this is a film you will want to view and enjoy from beginning to end.

this is a charming movie to say the least. the main character, fanda, is an old man who refuses to be among the living dead by which he is surrounded. he and his accomplice go around pulling pranks and getting into trouble all over town. meanwhile his family is up in arms about what to do with him. from there you see fanda's relationships with his wife, best friend and son develop. it finally leads up to one of the best movie endings i have ever seen.the characters in this movie are rich and deep. they develop well through the course of the film. the movie has quite a range of moods. it goes from light and funny to grim and dark. any slow parts for you in this film will be made up for in the end.autumn spring carries a similar message like a lot of other european movies do -- don't lose sight of the small pleasures in life. if you enjoyed amelie, the eighth day or life is beautiful (all great films btw), you will probably like this movie.8.5/10

renowned czech actor vlastimil brodský, mostly known in north america for his leading role as jacob in the original est german/czech production of jacob the liar (jakob, der lügner 1974) gives us a last brilliant performance as a 80 year old prankster who refuses to admit that he is about to die.jirí hubac's screenplay is exquisite. funny, moving and well-developed. it explores well both the subject of advanced old age and the motivations of characters that are precariously strong and fragile, happy and unsettled.frantisek (vlastimil brodský) and his best friend eda (stanislav zindulka) are up to all types of shenanigans and are making sure to make the best out of their dying days. meanwhile, frantisek's wife is preparing for their death, saving up for funeral money and chastising frantisek for his endless childishness and irresponsible attitude. their son is about to take their apartment over and put them into a retirement home, but frantisek doesn't want to hear any of that. he wants to enjoy life and make people around him laugh. he wants to help and love and give... but at what cost?sure to captivate adults of all ages, this fine piece of film by talented director vladimír michálek is both touching and funny. it makes you think of how we live our lives and why we live our lives. it brings the simple story of a charming stubborn old man to the forefront and allow us to reflect and feel what life is all about.after an active career lasting more than 40 years, it is somewhat sombre to know that vlastimil brodsk died in april 2002, no longer in the grip of terminal cancer. it is however uplifting to think that he had the chance to be a part of such a moving script and to be the catalyst of this ode to joyful old age that has not even started to make the waves it is about to create in north american repertoire cinema.after the international success of jan hrebejk's "divided we fall (2000)", it is starting to be clear that czech cinema has indeed something to offer to the world. this film at least is a must see.

as a czech i am very pleased when i read these comments here. i am absolutely sure that this film is great. and what you maybe don't know is that story was specially written for mr. brodský. the man you can see is him and his typical attitude - to live and to resist death. he was one of great actors and we are very lucky that we he has made so many beautiful films during his life. you are lucky you could see at least one of them. enjoy.

up front, if you're tired, the first hour could be slow. the set up of the story has a natural leisurely pace, unhurried - giving us time to appreciate the kind of everyday life and situations the main characters are in. once you arrived at the climatic segment of the storyline, the turn of events will keep you hooked: how will things turn out, what will happen to our precious fanda (portrayed to utter quiet perfection by the veteran czech actor vlastimil brodský), how will his wife (wonderfully played by stella zázvorková) treat him, what happens to fanda's dear friend ed (played by stanislav zindulka - a matching sidekick to brodský), and jára the son with selfish hidden agenda, blind to the kindness of his parents (sigh!)vladimír michálek sensibly directed the film with sprinkles of humor, preserving the insightful script by jirí hubac. thanks to clear subtitling, i was able to notice for every 'complaining' phrase fanda's wife utters, there's a hint of 'caringness' showing/buried in between the lines - and so did the judicious lady judge observed. fanda is '76 going on 80' and the affection of their enduring (endearing) marriage manifests even in their bantering arguments. his playfulness can be infectious.this is 'growing old together 101' for (at least) the beyond fifties, and lessons learned to sons and daughters not to take parents for granted. one may need to rethink if assuming 'home for the aged' is a means to an end, so to speak. the film is gently shouting to us to live life to the fullest while we can. (hint: there's joy in staying on and watch the end credits roll.)we're fortunate to be able to see an occasional czech film. the sverák ("kolya") father & son's 2001 "dark blue world" was revealing with pathos. it's good to take it slow now and then and appreciate a foreign gem - its subtitles, scenery, melodic score and an engaging human story with elegant performances. "autumn spring" (aka babí léto) is available on dvd. enjoy!

i was delighted when i saw that my husband rented "labyrinth of passion". i love almodovar's films. we both loved the movie. we both couldn't stop laughing. we especially enjoyed the scene in which the transvestite is shooting a photo novel, and while supposedly being menaced by a killer with an electric drill, is told to answer the phone and say, "i can't talk to you right now, i'm being attacked by a sadistic serial killer. if i survive i will call you back". (that would make a great answering machine message come to think of it). we also loved the lady telling her new found beloved, "i went to an orgy after the concert but i couldn't stop thinking of you." (i'm waiting to use that line on twitter). "labyrinth of passion" is a rollicking farce with plenty of high jinks, hilarious dialog and eye candy for everyone. the film has aged well: the 1980s costumes and hairdos add to the wackiness. i would give it a 10 out of 10 rating but i am giving it a 8 for two reasons. the first is the scene which involves laxatives which includes a shot of a lady soiling herself: totally unnecessary, and it brings down the tone of the film to hollywood gross-out comedy for a moment. the second is the suggestion that queti is sleeping with her father: shocking, yes, but again, it ruins the tone of the film. still, i would recommend the film to anyone who wants a sophisticated, spicy, and fun time.

"labyrinth of passion"--with the possible exception of "matador "--is almodovar's best film. it displays his unique personality at its best and least-censored, before he started going more mainstream. almodovar is just about the only modern director that can approach preston sturges' wonderful brand of lunacy. it's pointless to try and explain what the movie is about, the real point being almodovar's willingness and skill in taking his situations to the outer limits of sanity, and sometimes of plausibility and taste as well.

very typical almodóvar of the time and, in its own way, no less funny than many of his later works. and why is that? there is nothing to be provoked or shocked about, and i guess any such effect is more coincidental than intentional. no, the great humor stems from an underlying, almost surreal, absurdity that is woven into the scenery: the characters' nearly complete lack of taboo. it's the same kind of 'comic suspense' you find in his later works, though you'll find it in a more rough version here. he's building up for masterpieces to come, but is not yet there.the sole reviewer who commented on this movie before i did, claimed that it had to be a "very select" group of people who'd find this movie hilarious. i do.

this movie was an amazing tribute to whoever has gone through this type of pain and suffering. the acting wasn't the greatest, i'll admit that, but it was passionate about it's message, sending people into prisons without so much as an attorney or some type of trial is cruel and unusual. they even had a damn trial for saddam, so why doesn't every suspected terrorist have some type of fair and justified trial or hearing as to why they were tagged in the first place? i'm getting off the movie, but i think it's worthy to note about this sick, twisted idea the government has. the movie's way of telling the story and the backstory was a great mystery. the whole movie, i was trying to connect the daughter with the plot and it's made very obvious in the end. there's no doubt that the directing was incredible, but the one thing i didn't care for was that there wasn't as much emphasis on reese witherspoon's character's interest and fight in the ideal she held, a lot of skipping. otherwise it was actually quite entertaining, and most of all it kept my attention and interest for the two hours it played.

when going to see rendition, i was expecting an exciting film on a controversial topic with big-name actors. i was not expecting a film that was so engrossing, exciting, poetic, and sad that picked me up from the very beginning and didn't let me go, even after i left the theater. a word of advice to anyone who hasn't seen it yet, don't let your politics come in the way of enjoying (or not enjoying) this film. take it for what it is. i saw this with my conservative jewish family (i'm the black sheep, the pseudo-liberal college student) and i thought they would write it off as "liberal propaganda". instead, they said it was a great film with excellent performances (they like to fancy themselves film critics).it's sad that a movie like this has to be marketed by its oscar-affiliated actors, while leaving out the constantly underrated sarsgaard as well as new talent like the truly excellent metwally. the entire cast gave good performances, with some standing out much more than others; my only problem with it was that there was a lot going on which didn't allow for much screen time for each of the characters. in fact, i felt like the "sub-plot" with fatima and khalid was just as prominent on screen as anwar's part of the story.the characters all have the potential to fall into stereotypes, but the actors do a good enough job to give them depth with the little screen time they have. streep is truly terrific, as a heartless senator, and as much as i don't want to see the actress in such a terrible role its impossible not to believe her. gyllenhaal, who will probably be one of the oscar nods for this movie, seems a bit unsure in his role at times. h's trying to portray his inner conflict but usually just comes off like he either forgot his lines or he doesn't know how he should feel. sarsgaard gave an excellent performance; his unforgettable confrontation with streep is easily one of the best parts of the movie. metwally, again, was terrific, and i hope to see him in more mainstream films. it's a shame that gyllenhaal with probably get nominated before him. yigal naor, as shown on imdb, has been is some films already but he is a newcomer in my eyes. he, along with mohammed khouas and zineb oukach, all gave great performances.the story of fatima and khalid was not given any credit in commercials, but it brings a sad humanity to the story. the narrative was interesting as i was trying to really connect the two story until it was plainly told to us at the end. i've read some comments on here that say the love story was useless, but i disagree. i think it definitely shows another side to the controversial issue as well as humanity in general. khalid was the real terrorist, but he was doing it to avenge his brother, and even though he is responsible for the attack, you see a humane side to him through the story with fatima. not that i think we should feel bad for actual terrorists, but i think the "we are all people" theme was definitely relevant.whatever your feelings on terrorism, politics, etc. leave it out of the theater. the bottom line is this is an interesting story with a message we all need to hear.

we start all of our reviews with the following information. my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! so we can see whatever we want whenever we want. the point of this is that critics count for zero. your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me. the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! we never ever listen or read the critics. we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. well enough about that. when meryl streep the head of the nsc in the movie says "the united states does not torture" it got a big laugh at this movie. it is of course a lie that the bush administration has denied time and again. it is a very good movie and it is scary in what they can do to us as we lose all of our civil rights. they can simply "snatch" you anywhere and tell know one that they have done it. in this case, they snatch a man who has a name similar to those who killed thousands on 9-11. he is of course just like you or i. and so they take him to a secret location outside of the us to torture and waterboard him. very frightening. well acted by jake and reese and the entire cast.

an arab american man is kidnapped from an american airport and flown to "somewhere in north africa" where he is tortured. the reason? his cell phone received a call from a known terrorist. the cia decides to avoid legal means to determine whether the phone call is implication of guilt or just a mistake. after watching this movie we can only but pray some terrorist doesn't accidentally punch in a wrong number!in addition to the rendition there are several related side stories. one involves the daughter of the chief of intel (secret police?) who is torturing the suspect, and her involvement with her lover who happens to be in night school for suicide bombers. this story is way too contrived, but nevertheless intriguing, especially when we see it's outcome. the director uses a neat time line switcheroo to hook the audience. the second side story is the attempt by the suspects wife to find out what happened to her missing husband. she gets an old lover to help. he (a muted saarsgard) is aide de camp to a senator (alda) and soon gets cold feet when he realizes that his job isn't worth uncovering the truth. witherspoon is wasted in this role. all she gets to do is look forlorn and pregnant, with one brief rage attack. streep is good and cold and stereotypical as the govt. (cia?nsa?homeland sec?) official who seems to be a cheney clone. gylenhall also is wasted as a minor analyst pushed into in area he's over his head in, although he gets to do the "right thing" in the end.i found the movie engrossing, if somewhat languorous, but thought it added little to the subject. it is certainly not to be viewed as definitive, and it certainly has an axe to grind. like "the kingdom" it scratches the surface of a very complicated subject.the movie tries hard to give us an idea about rendition, but can only end up by being a "cautionary tale" about one botched one. the whole point of rendition is not to "torture" but to get "terror suspects" to give intel by avoiding legal (therefore obstructive) barriers. torture, for sure, may be employed, especially if the rendition is out of our hands - although we are obviously not guiltless in this matter - but intel that can save lives is vital in this "shadow war."

rendition is a film not to miss with solid writing from kelley sane and with the direction of gavin hood that takes us on a story which is a ride through a man's journey through hell. once again, meryl streep in a convincing role of the cia today and great performances from a cast of superlative actors in reese witherspoon, jake gyllenhall and alan arkin, along with actors of middle eastern descent who add to the reality of the story.in rendition you see how "terrorism can breed terrorism" and as the film progresses tying the story to what is playing out in the middle east is reality brought to the screen. the external shots add to the intensity of the story and peter sarsgaard does a brilliant job of playing an assistant in the "ass kissing" way of how american politics are conducted. too bad there has not been a larger audience for this film, as along with the valley of elah and lions for lambs, rendition plays an important role in showing an audience how the fight for and the protection of democracy can go seriously astray.

i came out of "rendition" with a list of flaws a mile long, so how is it that my overall impression is that it was a pretty decent movie? it's definitely a film whose sum is better than its parts.those parts include a cast of big name stars, not one of them giving a memorable performance (omar metwally, a relative unknown, is the one you'll remember); serviceable if undistinguished direction; and a screenplay that's both too complicated and too simplistic at the same time. metwally is an egyptian-born american citizen who gets kidnapped by the u.s. government's rendition program, otherwise known as the process by which america tortures suspected terrorists into confessing information whether or not it's remotely true. reese witherspoon plays his pregnant wife, who calls in the favor of an old college friend (peter saarsgard), who works for a senator (alan arkin) and helps to track her husband down. meryl streep plays the head of the rendition program; jake gyllenhaal is a young agent assigned to the interrogation and whose conscience gets in the way. meanwhile, a whole parallel storyline follows the daughter of a top egyptian official who is allied to the american rendition program and her boyfriend, who's in training to become a suicide bomber.ay-yi-yi that's a lot of plot to pack into a two-hour movie, and i was about to wash my hands of the whole thing, especially the egyptian romeo and juliet subplot that felt like nothing more than a distraction. but then near the film's finale, a twist of chronology brings all of the plot strands together in a way that makes you want to reassess everything you thought you knew about the motivations of the various characters, and makes "rendition" a much more interesting movie than it seems like it's going to be.witherspoon, gyllenhaal and sarsgaard all look like high school students playing adults twenty years older than they actually are -- gyllenhaal in particular, usually a fine actor, looks so bored that you wonder if he's going to muster the energy to deliver his lines. and the screenwriter should be arrested for having an actress as good as meryl streep at his disposal and giving her nothing more to work with than this one-dimensional dragon lady. the movie of course strives for relevancy, but instead of addressing the tangled web of arguments surrounding the national security issue, it charges right down the middle of the debate in a predictable fashion. there are moments when you think maybe the film will veer off in an interesting direction -- what if witherspoon did actually begin to doubt her husband's past, for instance? what if metwally actually had been in contact with terrorists, as his interrogators accuse? but no, the movie takes the path of least resistance.but, like i said upfront, i recommend this movie. i know i've done nothing but list a bunch of its faults, but it's got its head in the right place, and it is entertaining, or at least as as entertaining as a movie about torture and interrogation can be.grade: b+

taut, topical political thriller, taking square aim at the controversial us policy of rendition, another appalling orwell-ian phrase (collateral damage, anyone?) for the illegal interrogation even torture of terrorist suspects by-passing due legal process. the inhuman interrogation is overseen by the egyptian chief of police, himself the target of a fundamentalist suicide - bomb plot, thus entwining the two main plot-lines of the movie. both work very well, the bombing set-piece graphic and chilling in its realism, with its denouement revealed in a stylish tarantino-type flashback and the torture scenes on an innocent man also unflinchingly portrayed in all their gory detail. the film scores telling points about the use of torture as a credible means of intelligence - gathering in the war against terrorists and against the unpoliced faceless bureaucracy (here personified by a suitable cold-steeled meryl streep, as the cia boss who casually gives the order for rendition) which can ruin innocent lives. never mind kafka's fiction, think more the recent killing of the innocent brazilian in london in 2005, with the head of the metropolitan police still in his job and no-one tried for the poor man's murder. the acting is excellent throughout - the two key roles of the innocent man and terrorist bomber are realistically and tellingly played by the unfamiliar actors omar metwally and moa khouas. similarly yigal naor as the intimidating chief of police and zineb ouhach as his idealistic lovelorn daughter ring true with their performances, their lack of familiarity (at least to me) adding to their characters' credibility. of the bigger hollywood names present, gyllenhaal's stature grows with succeeding films, here playing the initially detached but later conscience - stricken and anguished government man who does the right thing in the end. witherspoon plays her distraught wife part mainly in one key but is believable all the same, while david fabrizio and alan arkin convincingly show up self-serving senators and their lackeys who'll only go so far to help you until their career prospects are jeopardised. there are a few weaknesses plot-wise; there's little dramatic need to create the "suspense" surrounding el-ibrahimi's escape and streep's character is perhaps too obvious a bogey-man/woman. worst of all is the meaningless inclusion of gyllenhaal's on-the-spot girlfriend, around merely for decoration and a brief gratuitous love-scene. on the whole though, an engrossing thought - provoking cinematic experience.

is torture ever right? no the answer is simple and absolute with no qualifications possible. the reason as this film showed is the effect torture has on a society. the values that have been hard fought for in western society through centuries of revolution and struggle are for all men and women to be allowed to live in a free and open society. one where individuals are treated equally and with respect to their essential rights as humans. to protect this society institutions have been developed to deal with wrongdoing openly, fairly and honestly. these institutions have been adapted and honed through generations of hard work. one could argue that these are the true bedrock of democracy as they belong to us all, allow us all to be heard. if we allow undemocratic, inhumane acts to be committed in our name, if we split our society into those who have rights and those who don't then we undo the work of our ancestors. moreover we are all complicit and all guilty and tainted. whether those that we accuse are guilty or not is of no importance. we are defined by our attitudes and our responses.

the reviews for rendition generally haven't been favorable, so i waited until it moved to the local discount theatre to see it. the film tells the story of anwar el-ibrahimi, an american-egyptian scientist who is plucked from his international flight and hauled in for interrogation after a strange coincidence links him to a recent terrorist attack in an unnamed north african country. not as bad as i'd feared, it's an interesting and thought-provoking entry in the "ripped-from-the-headlines" thriller genre.the film ultimately asks tough questions concerning u.s. methods of prying information from political prisoners: is crossing the formerly-uncrossed line of (openly) employing torture on suspected terrorists something our country should be doing? does it yield useful information that helps save lives? if so, at what cost? what sort of monsters do we create when innocent people are taken prisoner and tortured? by sanctioning the use of torture, what sort of monster do we as a country become? it's always disappointing when a film with such provocative material is sloppy with some of the details that make good films great. for example, i'd like to have empathized with anwar's wife, who spends the entire film trying to track him down, but the only identifiable personality trait she's given is an advanced state of pregnancy. rendition also seems to imply that arab women who don't go along with their fathers' arranged marriages are only asking for trouble, and there's a poorly-conceived scrapbook kept by another of the film's main characters that too conveniently spells out in great detail all the information his love interest just happens to be in urgent need of at that particular moment. i laughed out loud, when the moment should have been filled with dread.the film features a good central performance by jake gyllenhaal and strong (but too brief) appearances by hollywood veterans meryl streep and alan arkin, as well as impressive turns by omar atwally as anwar el-ibrahimi and also by actors moa khouas, zineb oukach and yigal naor, all of whom i would much enjoy seeing in future films that have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism. good luck to them. the five or so stories rendition follows are woven together nicely, until the filmmakers insert a slight-but-effective twist that finally alludes to the never-ending cycle of carnage that violent attacks of terror beget.

this was an excellent movie with good acting and it keeps your attention through to the very end. maybe people are either tired or uncomfortable with the subject matter and that's why it's being trashing so much. it could also be too deep for many of the viewers out there who give movies like the american pie series higher ratings.jake gyllenhaal is a cia analyst, not an agent, who is to observe an interrogation of an egyptian man by moroccans, not egyptians. he's not supposed to be a hardened agent and so comes off as naive of the interrogation techniques used. this is more believable than if he were to come across as being an "old hat" at it.the story jumps around a bit and can be confusing, but it also makes you stay focused on whats going on until the end when everything comes together as the puzzle falls into place. the supporting actors did a good job of helping to carry the movie. i found the movie to be powerful and thought provoking.

to solve a challenging problem, you need to start by asking the right questions. without these, even the biggest library of information is useless. this movie does just that - where other movies guide your thinking along a story board, this film pulls at your emotions and your understanding of justice and what's permissible. these questions will tug at you throughout, challenging your assumptions as the characters develop. this movie is important. it's relevant, and a must see for anybody who stays informed of current affairs. the fact it's highly entertaining and includes a slew of movie stars only improves the execution. my advice: watch it with a serious crowd or better yet, by yourself, not unlike how you'd read an editorial from your favorite news magazine. in this case there is one difference: the answers will be your own.

very good political thriller regarding the aftermath of terrorism and the using of political torture to obtain one's objectives in flushing out the terrorists.the story is interwoven where two families are adversely affected by the terrorist events.this is one of meryl streep's best roles in years. she plays a cold, calculating, cunning director of the cia who allows these things to go on. she is out of the george bush-dick cheney school of handling the war on terrorism. had her part been expanded, miss streep certainly would have been up for an award at oscar time.jake gyllenhaal is our hero. a cia agent who really can't take what's going on.we have a terrorist who actually has a heart and it costs him his life in this well directed, finely paced film.alan arkin appears briefly in the part of a conniving senator. mr. arkin seems to get better with age.

i'm egyptian. i have a green card. i have been living in the us since 1991. i have a very common arabic name. i'm married (non-american but non-egyptian, non-arab wife). i have children who are born in the us. i have a phd in cell biology from the us and i travel for conferences. i make 6 figure income and i own a home in the washington, dc area. i pay my taxes and outside 1 or 2 parking tickets i have no blemish on my record since i came to this country in 1991. i look more egyptian than the ibrahimi character but my spoken english is as good as his.a couple of months ago i was returning from a conference/company business in spain through munich germany to washington, dc (home). i was picked up in munich airport by a german officer as soon as i got off the madrid plane. he was waiting for me. he was about to start interrogating me until i simply told him "i have no business in germany, i'm just passing through". he had let me go with the utmost disappointment. that was nothing compared to what happened at washington, dulles airport (which was not nearly as bad as what happened to ibrahimi in the movie). the customs officer asked me a couple of questions about the length and purpose of my trip. he then wrote a letter c on my custom declaration form and let me go. after i picked up my checked bag i was stopped at the last exit point (some homeland security crap). i sat there for 3 hours along with many different people of many different nationalities. i was not told the reason for my detainment. i was not allowed to use my phone or any other phone. i was feisty at first asking to be told of the reason or let me go but decided to suck it up and just wait and see. i asked if i can call my wife to tell her that i'm going to be late but was told no. when i tried to use my phone and as soon as my wife said "hello", an officer yanked the phone out of hand and threatened me to confiscate it. when i asked about needing to call home because my family is waiting, they said "three hours is nothing, we will make contact after 5 hours". when i asked to use the bathroom, an officer accompanied me there. it toilet was funny; i guess it was a prison style toilet that is all metal with no toilet seat. finally, they called my name and gave me my passport/green card and said you can go. i asked what the problem was, they said "nothing"!! i know it was only 3 hours but i was dead tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and kids.as for the movie, it was very well made. unlike most movies that involve arabs and use non-arab actors who just speak gibberish, this movie the arabic was 100% correct. i assume the country is morocco (north africa).

extraordinary rendition is a frightening practice authorized, surprisingly, under clinton, that allows the u.s. government to seize and hold anyone suspected, seemingly for any reason, of being a terrorist against the united states. this is a touchy issue, especially after 9/11, because supporters of the practice will always criticize the opposition as withholding vital power from the u.s. that it needs to effectively fight terror. fanatic supporters will label the opposition as terrorists in themselves. but like a recent film that lent a similar level of humanity to the death penalty, the life of david gale, rendition shows us a story of the misuse of extraordinary rendition, or at least the ease with which it can be exploited and falsely applied. the story involves anwar el- abrahimi, an american chemical engineer born in egypt who is seized on his way back to america from giving a lecture in egypt. the cause given is that he made phone calls to a known terrorist. no proof is ever given (or needed) that it was anwar that made the calls, that his phone was never lost of stolen. meanwhile, anwar's extremely pregnant wife, isabella, is back in the states frantically trying to find her husband, who got onto a plane to chicago but apparently never got off. the flimsy explanation that he was never there evaporates when she discovers that he made an in-flight purchase using his credit card. lately i have been researching modern chinese history, particularly that of the astonishingly selfish and brutal dictatorship set up by mao tse-tung, and it is more than a little frightening to see the similarities between extraordinary rendition and some of mao's brutal scare tactics, including his public executions (which the people were forced to watch), and extensive use of torture specifically used to extract "confessions." it is pretty disturbing to notice that mao specifically did these things to create an environment of fear in order to achieve obedience from the chinese people. to say that the bush administration has not created an environment of fear and continues to milk it for everything it's worth would be naïve in the extreme, and although extraordinary rendition was not created under bush, it is clear that it does more harm than good.adding to the thickness of the film is douglas freeman (jake gyllenhaal), who works behind a desk for the cia and has little field experience, until his boss is assassinated and he suddenly finds himself supervising the torture of a man that he quickly comes to doubt has anything to reveal. fatima's (freeman's boss) daughter also plays a pivotal role, as does a senatorial aide played by peter sarsgaard, who might have the most satisfying role in the movie. meryl streep is also suitably cold and clinical as a chilly senator with a dogmatic support of the necessity and practice of rendition. as a political thriller, the movie is remarkably well-crafted and paced. but the scariest thing about it is that this is all real. the movie's goal is to get people to really think about the things done in america's name, especially when they claim to be done to prevent those same things. conducting terror in the name of preventing terror will win no sympathy for us, nor will extracting confessions through brutal torture, which is the basest form of criminal investigation. unfortunately, we are gradually heading in that direction, of doing these things more rather than less. the frightening question is what is the event that is going to take place at some point in the future to convince us to stop and head the other way, toward civilization and peace, or will we just keep heading toward a military dictatorship until we finally get there?

cia analyst douglas freeman (gyllenhaal) gets to see his first secret location interrogation when anwar (metwally) is accused of having contact with a known terrorist bomb maker. anwar's wife (witherspoon) is frantic regarding the whereabouts of her husband .don't you just hate it when the title of a movie sends you to a dictionary? i must have an old edition as this rendition is not a musical piece. no, it's the government's way of legally taking a resident or citizen somewhere to interrogate him and possibly use some torture to get the desired information. while watching this movie i was reminded of a similar story line in the crossing jordan tv show (now off the air), and i expect we will see even more of these story lines. it's inevitable. the events of 911 are the catalysts. this is a tough one to watch because we don't like to see people tortured and our government not telling the truth about things. we like the idea that no matter what happens or happened that we can go somewhere to find answers, but when that door is closed to us, we are truly lost and without hope as anwar's wife was. performances by all were first class and it's possible we may see more of igai naor (i have no idea how to pronounce it) because he resembles and can act like telly savalas. no kidding. violence: yes, sex: no, nudity: no, language: yes

some films are designed to just entertain you, others to make you laugh, or cry, or uplift, others, like this, aim to provoke, to make you think, and to make you angry. i was angry during this film, not at the film, but at the fact that it was true, that america, the free, does torture in the illogical view that it is doing it for the greater good. the torture scenes in this movie were harrowing, the indifference of people was shattering, the film was compelling in its argument, and showed just how wrong it is to torture people. of course now that makes me a "bleeding liberal" labels shoved on people by others who shut their minds to the facts that this does happen and should not. people who don't realise that as the movie said, for every person tortured,you get ten or one hundred people rise up to perform acts of vengeance. you get an ever increasing cycle of violence. this film did not make me hate america, although i can see how it could do, but it made me hate the way that america has reacted in its post 9/11 world. there is a significant quote in the film, just after we have learned that 19 people have died and seventy five were injured in the bomb scene, the quote is "one american is dead" - that makes the difference. you cannot kill an american, america can kill thousands but you cannot kill a single american, or they will do whatever it takes, including torture to enact justice. this is the american way apparently. call me a liberal, call me naive (although i think the people who think torture is fine are naive) call me deluded, call me anything you like, but this film is a brilliant example of what is wrong in america and the west today. i wish this film would be shown to all school students, at a minimum. this film will stay with me a long time, part of me wishes i could forget it, because i wish this type of thing never happened, but i know it does, the other part of me wishes i would never forget, because we need to remember these shameful events to prevent them from happening again. whatever happens to me, this film will be with me for a long time, and i will be telling everyone i know to watch it, not to be entertained, but to be provoked, because sometimes we all need to be provoked.

the powerhouse cast pulls the crowd in the theatre, despite the ominous title. jake gyllenhaal guested on conan o'brien to promote the movie and explained that 'rendition' was a euphemism for obtaining information via torture. since 9/11, 'extraordinary rendition' allowed the government's intelligence agency to extricate people unquestioningly without due process and use any means necessary in exchange for information.gyllenhaal plays rookie cia analyst douglas freeman (note the irony) who is torn about his assignment which renders him as a mere observer to unorthodox interrogation proceedings at an underground detention facility outside the us. omar metwally plays the suspected terrorist anwar el-ibrahimi, egyptian national and green card-carrying hubby of american isabella fields el-ibrahimi (reese witherspoon). isabella and her son wait for anwar to come home from a scientific conference when he suddenly disappears from the plane's passenger manifest. she seeks help from her college friend who works in government and learns that the head of intelligence, corrine whitman (meryl streep) is behind it all. rendition is directed by hollywood newbie gavin hood (who is set to do x-men origins: wolverine), and begs the question of whether such 'extraordinary rendition' is exercised in real life. the movie was released locally in the wake of the glorietta explosion (bombing/mishap?), and a pivotal scene in the movie is when a bomb explodes in a public plaza, so that must have sent chills up every moviegoer's spine. seeing the exploding tableau with a lone red and yellow sign aajala (ayala?) on the upper right hand of the screen, plus the effect of silence and slow-moving images magnified the impact of the scene's real-life coincidence. there are lessons to learn from this movie and it all boils down to personal decisions we make, daily. we all have choices we can exercise at will, and we often do not always (want to) see how these affect others, who may end up as hapless victims of circumstance. what 'the greater good' is should not have to be a forced choice our leaders have to take if we each already decide correctly at the source. now that's a utopia worth building.

my family (two 40-somethings, an 8 year old and my 71 yr old mother) saw this at a sneak preview on april 29th. we all enjoyed the movie very much. the story was a good one, and knowing it was based on real-life events made it that much more enjoyable. luke wilson was a hoot (pun intended) to watch as was tim blake nelson. and seeing neil flynn play something other than "the mean janitor from scrubs" was nice. the kids in movie did well and i'm sure they will all appeal to a certain demographic on the heartthrob level. the visuals were just lovely and the jimmy buffet music added to the "florida feel". ok, maybe the story was a little too neat and well packaged for some adults, but hey, who cares? i can't compare it to the book, i honestly hadn't heard of it until the movie came out. it was just a nice movie and it had a good message. plain and simple.

this surrealistic, absurdist movie is the first film i have seen of cult swedish director roy andersson. he is a veteran filmmaker who has made his living filming commercials, directing only four feature films in the last forty years. this background shows: the film seems like a collection of fifty 2 minute arty commercials. there is no story interconnecting these vignettes, though some characters appear in more than one vignette (there is a theme throughout underneath them, though: the absurdity of modern life). some of the film's mannerisms (having the actors appear in light white makeup) are more irritating than illuminating. some of the skits amount to very little (a man unsure in which queue to stand?). other skits are better, though. the best is the one about the rock chick dreaming that she goes on honeymoon with her rock guitarist bride on a house that turns on something akin to a train (you have to watch it to get it). a film worth seeing, even if comparisons made by some film critics with such great filmmakers as keaton, tati and kaurismaki seems overwrought: andersson lacks the vision of them and the lack of a story interconnecting the vignettes is fatal to this film's pretension of being a masterpiece.

i saw this at the 2008 palm springs international film festival. there are some wonderful descriptions of this film from other commenter's here and they seemed to have really enjoyed it so i won't too far into giving a film synopsis but you could see a little of woody allen and maybe a little of federico fellini in this film's collection of some 50 short sketches or vignettes strung together with no real singular plot. a few of the vignettes are related to each other in their character and plot lines however and a a corner bar is used frequently as a central scene where they are always giving last call. the beginning and ending scenes have a common theme too that bookends the film. it took three years to film this and much of the time must have been spent on finding the plainest and homeliest looking people in all of sweden to make the cast. this is sweden's official submission for best foreign language film for the 2007 academy awards. it's a nice movie but hardly worthy of an official submission for best foreign film. last year sweden's official submission was the very weak farväl falkenberg and the year before it was expensive looking but dull zozo, so once again sweden will have no chance in picking up the oscar. this film has it's moments and would have made a good 20-25 minute short film but it gets a little old and cold for a full length feature film. roy andersson directs. gustav danielsson is the cinematographer. editor anna märta waern deserves a lot of credit for the work she must have put into this. benny andersson of abba fame provides an entertaining music score. it's an interesting film with a lot of dry humor and i did like it but it's nothing really special and could only give it a 7.0 out of 10.

roy andersson has managed to craft something that defies nearly all conventions of what a film should be, a piece of art that is both beautiful, funny and evocative at the same time. the end result is a moving, if somewhat fractured tale about humanity in its simplest and most honest forms.this is unlikely to appeal to everyone, in fact the humour is so finely tuned that many are unlikely to get on its wavelength. the almost absurdly long takes, awkward silences and consistent medium shots will most definitely put off even the most willing of audiences. but it is within these disjointed tales and unconventional thinking that andersson shapes a world where every character seems to take centre stage in their own absurd way. each scene is absorbed by the desolate environments, with the characters seemingly left alone in their own oddity its a difficult piece to watch at times, not least because like many of its scenes, it requires patience. but whilst some may hail it upon an artistic throne, others will simply look on in confusion. its a film that blends understated humour with own brand of heart

i enjoy the national anthem. i enjoy the national anthem if for nothing else then, just before the midnight news, i imagine i'm playing the cymbals in the band. not as easy as you may think! one, two, three, four; one, two three, four; but then what? so i have sympathy with the practising bass drum player in roy andersson's wonderful film, patiently waiting for his cue listening to a very 70s cassette player.the 70s motif seems to continue throughout, with some classic, soulless furniture. moreover, every scene has an eerie jade wash which emphasises the minute nuances of the subtlest of acting.which brings me to jessika lundberg's outstanding purple boots. boots which otherwise would have inspired a silk cult advertising campaign.but then the difficult bit. someone asked me what it was about. well there is a scene where the opening line as "i don't have that length in green" brilliant. straight out of a gary larson carton.i can't say what it's about. go see yourself.ron plasmahmm. larson! sounds swedish(viewed 15apr08)

this, which was shown dubbed in italian at a rome cinema (not as bad as it sounds) after being presented at the rome film festival, is very much an art film and a festival film, guaranteed to charm and delight such audiences for its distinctive style, droll humor; ability to draw comedy from the suffering of others; appealing, cheery music; spot-on performances; overriding sweetness and humanity--but doomed, because of its oddity and lack of a compelling story line, to leave average audiences wondering what they're watching it for and why anyone admires it, how it even got made.andersson gives us almost a series of dry skits. running through them are various themes. money: a guy at the next table (waldemar nowak) nicks the wallet of a rich bore talking on a cell phone in a restaurant over a glass of brandy, then goes and orders a set of posh suits made to order; a deadbeat son calls his celebrated father away from an elaborate gathering to beg him for one more loan. a shrink worries aloud about his depleted investments while his wife humps him in bed wearing only a shiny viking helmet.depression: an elementary teacher (jessica nilsson) breaks down in class because her husband has called her a "harpy;" the rug salesman spouse (pär fredriksson) collapses before clients because he's called her that. several men have depressing dreams. but hey--this is sweden. isn't everybody depressed? love problems: a fat bohemian couple is perpetually breaking up; a girl groupie has fantasies about a lead guitarist, micke (eric bäckman). wives slam doors when their husbands start to practice their instruments. (music too is obviously a unifying theme. besides the dashing guitarist there's a tuba and a drum player who're in a dixierland band and also play in marches and funerals. every scene has an added lilt from the music, which niftily links one sequence with another.) a raging storm outside the window of many scenes, violent rain, people out in it, thunder so loud it sounds like a battle raging across the land. this also unifies the tone and gives the impression various scenes are happening on the same dauntingly tempestuous day.andersson is a master of visual composition and the static middle-distance shot and the film has a foggy gray-green look engineered by dp gustav danielsson that's perfect because it evokes the gloom of a swedish winter but also twinkles with the subtle colors of the director's wit, which ends every scene with a smile. one almost never knew drabness could be so beautiful. (or perhaps one did: alexcanr sokurov creates such effects sometimes in very different contexts.) within scenes and in the film as a whole there's a kind of stillness that comes out of the visual style, the pacing of scenes, and the detached humanism of the overall outlook. there's something about a fully mastered style that's calming, reassuring.not everything works equally well. one may feel impatient with the succession of barely related scenes, which read too much sometimes like the work of a saturday night live writer in need of prozac. since some scenes plainly move you or draw a laugh, it's obvious that others fall a little flat.but some scenes are real zingers, and one obviously triumphant climax of pure magic is a dream--described and then visualized dreams being another important thread) in which the girl groupie imagines herself in a wedding dress newly married to her fey guitarist ideal, who plays a delicate series of riffs while a crowd of admirers gathers outside a big window. the viewpoint switches to outside and the window slides slowly away as if the building the dream newlyweds look out of were a train moving out of a station to take them to their honeymoon. it's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.eventually one may feel everything in you the living (du levande) is a dream, including the recurring scene where the barman is always striking a bronze bell and announcing last order time, whereupon all the torpid customers rise from their tables and go up to get one more drink.an italian reviewer called this "a small, great film," and that's right. it limits itself in a dozen ways, but there is greatness in it. roy andersson is a little master (like some medieval miniaturist) of the inner comedies of scandanavian gloom, and this is a film unlike any other. shown this year as a cannes "un certain regard" selection, this is also the swedish entry for the 2007 best foreign oscar. hard to say what bergman would think, but andersson worked with him; is famous for his elaborately produced tv commercials, some of which one can see on youtube. bergman called them "the best commercials in the world." it will be interesting to see if this director, whose craft is as subtle as his viewpoint, will start working in longer segments some time. meanwhile, any good film buff really needs to get a look at this."schadenfreude" isn't quite the right word. that means delight in the misery of others. andersson is teaching us to delight in the misery of all of us.

roy anderssons "du levande" is not totally original as it is counter piece to anderssons previous movie "sånger från andra våningen". still the movie has aura of total originality. some conventions of movie making are still thrown away: most of the actors look nothing like what you would expect in movie and the shots take long time. most of the time camera doesn't move but people move around it. the shots start from somewhere and many times the scenery builds up in amazing proportions. w.g. sebald comes to mind in literature with same technique. because of the time invested in every shot the suspension is really high in many of the scenes. there is a story and isn't - it is left for viewer to build up in his or her own mind. this movie is positive. it is determined not to see this all in negative way and at the same time will not pass the social injustices. one of the messages i got from it was that maybe all failures and accidents are not fatal after all. great movie.

you, the living (2007)mordant. i've never written that word before but it comes to mind here. let me look it up. well, it's part of it--corrosive, but also funny as heck. so corrosively funny. this is a dour film, for sure, with so much dry dry dry wit and quirky humor it's impossible not to like it on some level. filmed in a very spare style, often with a static camera and really balanced, stable compositions, like theater stages, we see a short enactment occur.but that makes it seem ordinary--which it is not. ordinary life is shown to be frumpy, ironic, delightful, coy, and depressing. and impossible. we, the living, must live, and since we're alive, we may as well take note. something like that. i think it was ebert who said you find yourself laughing and don't know why. exactly. and the promo material somewhere said it was a cross between bergman and monty python, and what they mean is it has the dry, silent, probing look of ingmar berman's famous swedish films, but it has the zany, somehow touching elements of the british comedians. i'd say, definitely, definitely watch at least half an hour of this. there is part of me that thought i was through by then--the rest continues in a similar assemblage of little skits and moments, and they do gradually evolve, but there is no great plot to follow or climax of the usual kind. there are some great moments later, even just the attention to the thunderstorm, which takes us out of the mundane human events nicely. the filming is gorgeous in its classical control, almost like a series of gregory crewdson scenes (and outdoing the photographer, actually). and the acting, with all its very ordinary, non-glam folksiness, is right on. a startling, beautiful, odd experience.

i laughed out loud several times during this film though give it a cursory glance and you would think it was something else altogether. i adore the pace and the way it slowly burns into you as you are presented these gobsmackingly beautiful tableaux. andersson gives us something else here. shows us something i had not seen since his last film. he is compositionally exceptional and via his method of fixing the camera and allowing action to take place before us, he opens the door on humanity and we peer into a place that reflects our own lives, our little lives. it is powerful stuff. it is the simplicity with which he allows the events to take place that creates the opposite feeling of complexity. everything in front of the camera is anything but simple. andersson's attention to detail is extraordinary. i believe most scenes, if not all, are sets built from scratch according to his designs. i cannot recommend this film highly enough. for me it took me to a place and i came out of it having witnessed a world frayed and beautiful, starched and pained, barren and splendid. at once alien and familiar. this film is brilliant and life affirming. i know because i came out smiling feeling wonderful. it has taken him seven years to make this. if he only made this one film he would still be up there with the greats.

the large bell in a bar intermittently rings for last orders and the inevitable rush to queue forms at the counter  do we want what we need only when it's too late? or is the irony of the opening scene's wailing cassandra a more resonant reflection of our perceptions on individual existence? there's an endless fascination about where writer-director roy andersson wants to take us in his fourth feature, "you, the living". with fifty or so semi-related vignettes strung together by a penchant for tragicomic hyper-reality, its wistful interpretations and symbolic instances of life that bind us all in this great big cosmic sisyphean struggle. the sheer simplicity of these vignettes act to dramatise the tenuity and immense preciousness of being apart of the symbiotic relationships we have with one another. andersson might whittle down the complexity of the human condition through harsh and fast cynicism more than he should, but he also reminds us of the inherent, reassuring glory of waking up each morning to a new tomorrow when we're all aware of our own distinct forms of arrested development.

you can't really call roy andersson prolific, (6 films in 37 years). nor can you accuse him of being conventional; he doesn't do 'straight-forward', at least when it comes to narrative. "you, the living", his first film in seven years, is like a surreal documentary in which a large number of characters are observed doing nothing very much and if that sounds off-putting, let me assure you it isn't. this is a funny, accessible and surprisingly warm-hearted movie, a slice-of-life far removed from that which we normally see on the screen.of course, 'slice-of-life' is hardly the proper moniker to apply to this movie since most people's lives are unlikely to be anything like this. the incidents on the screen run the gamut from the almost terrifyingly ordinary to the downright wacky and while characters may flit by, sometimes never to be seen again, others to reappear as if anxious for approval, andersson bestows on them all a kind of benign affection. that, and some rollicking music, ensure the time we spend with them is time well-spent.

the details in the big trail were so incredible that i felt that the movie was made at the time it represents. i have never seen wagons that were so real! they were big, loaded with accessories, and even felt as though they had been filled with details under the canvas covers that was never meant to be seen. every speck of dirt, every scratch, every splinter was there. modern day computer technology could never recreate the scenes of the numerous wagons as they move across the land or circle to fend off indians. the wagons were all real, individual vehicles, each with its own real team of horses or oxen.the actors clothing could not have felt more genuine. with the exception of john wayne's buckskin outfit and marguerite churchill's nice dress, the clothes were very common looking, tattered, or dirty in an authentic looking way. many of the actors and actresses were born before electricity and indoor plumbing were common, and they must have felt comfortable with the surroundings. all the indians were real indians rather than white extras painted tan.women of the old west had to be sturdy because there was a lot of work. in every scene showing work done by the people of the wagon train, women are shown chopping wood, hauling logs, etc. this realism was so natural looking that it did not come across as a statement on the role of women of the day rather than a fact of survival.the plot of revenge and romance is played well. nothing is overstated or overplayed.something was lost along the way in the 1930's in hollywood. as much as i love the fake scenery and controlled environment of old movies, the big trail manages to feel real above all else. the more i see big budget movies of the silent era, the more i like them. i can think of few movies of the 1930's that i have seen that equal the grandeur of the best of the 1920's. if there were home movies made in the days of wagon trains, the big trail is what they would look like.

my giving this film a score of 8 is relative to other feature-length films from 1930. by the standards of films made just a few years later, this film might receive a score of only 6 or 7--mostly because the sound quality was so poor. now it is possible that the film sounded better and the fox movie channel did show a degraded print (it did have a lot of lines and scratches), but i assume the sound problem was always an issue. that's because sound in movies was still a novelty in 1930 and many of the hollywood talking pictures of 1930 sounded terrible--with background characters often drowning out the leads, characters huddled together to make sure they are picked up by the microphones or inconsistent quality (such as what was seen in the bishop murder case, hell's angels and other films of the day). this was all made much worse in the big trail because most of the film was shot outside--something unheard of at the time. quite an innovation but also something that really stretched the talents of the sound technicians! so, while the film was very hard to listen to, i realize that they had to start somewhere, so i can forgive this--especially since the outdoor scenes are breathtaking--a major innovation for 1930.the plot is rather similar to cimarron--a western that came out the following year and which captured the oscar for best picture. unfortunately, cimarron isn't all that great a film and i actually like the big trail more due to the scope of the film. while some might balk at the big trail's slow-moving pace, i saw it as a great history lesson about the hardships endured by those traveling west on wagon trains. plus, the whole thing just looked so beautiful, as director raoul walsh went to significant trouble to film on location and the big trail looks almost like a film version of some ansel adams prints.as for the acting, it was pretty good. this was a major break for young john wayne--as his previous screen appearances were, at best, minor and unremarkable. here, he was given the lead and did a dandy job--though he was obviously young and a little less "john wayne-ish" than he was in later films, as his screen persona was not yet firmly established. another interesting part was played by tyrone power ii (tyrone power's father). he looked nothing like his extremely handsome son and looked and sounded almost exactly like bluto from the popeye cartoons! he made very few sound films--dying just a year after making this film--so it's a rare opportunity to see and hear this once famous actor.overall, the film is well worth seeing despite some sound problems and a few overly long scenes here and there. for 1930, it was a remarkable achievement--more so than the much more famous and award-winning cimarron made the following year. much of the reason the big trail didn't win an oscar most likely was because all quiet on the western front came out the same year and it is truly one of the great films.

this movie is important to those of us interested in western history because it makes use of authentic techniques in its production.the scenes of the wagon train are particularly authentic; so far as i know, it contains the only scenes ever filmed illustrating the techniques for river crossings at a bluff. the horses and mules have to be lowered to the river level and the wagons let down by ropes and pulleys. the scene is such that i could watch it over and again just trying to get a feel for what a crossing was like...and the early travelers did it time and time again while crossing the country.melodrama aside, this picture is as authentic in dress and style as they come and worth watching for that alone.

i never expected such an old film to be as impressive as this 1930 western turned out to be. the scenes of the pioneers heading west in their covered wagons, encountering storms and mud, river crossings, indian attacks and every manner of trial and danger, are astonishing in their rugged believability. much of the film was shot outdoors, and the movie has a truly epic feel about it. the actors must have experienced much the same conditions as the original pioneers did, and the results are astounding. the wagons, the clothing, every single detail looks and feels right. the characters are simple but believable, with a straightforward story ,that travels like the wagon train to its destination.john wayne is slim and youthful in one of his first roles, as the scout leading the wagons, and he does a fine job as the idealistic young frontiersman. he's up against a marvelously scurvy trio of villains, including ian keith as a slick gambler, charles stevens as a mexican sidekick and tyrone power, senior, as the growly, bear-like trapper. power's bearded, snarling, larger than life portrayal is both comic and menacing. i keep picturing him with a bandanna, gold hoop earring and black eye patch, with a parrot on his shoulder, as he grunts and growls various threats and insults. his character could easily be transferred to a pirate ship with no difficulty at all. he nearly steals the whole picture.tully marshall is delightful as a wily old frontiersman who is wayne's best friend. the lovely marguerite churchill makes a spirited heroine, whose initial meeting with wayne is a hilarious mix-up, resulting in a long running courtship consisting of insults and feigned indifference on her part, to aw shucks persistence on his. the results are quite humorous and one is glad to see them finally get together at the end.the scenery is amazing, with the wagons crossing real prairies and having to be lowered by ropes down cliffs. indians who are clearly the genuine article, and not white actors in makeup, appear as both friends and foes, and are treated with dignity. wayne's character tells an admiring group of young boys that the indians are his friends, who taught him everything he knows about survival in the wilderness.the big trail is an uncomplicated tale told well by a talented cast and crew. it will probably appear naive to many modern viewers, but there is a quiet dignity about it that never lets it become corny. there is a great deal of intentional humor, including a rowdy rascal of a pioneer, who makes loud animal sounds from hiding , every time the smooth gambler ian keith tries to con the beautiful heroine into marrying him. his flowery speeches about the plantation he allegedly owns are interrupted by very realistic imitations of yowling cats and quacking ducks, causing the would be seducer to look around in annoyance for the unseen creatures.highly recommended, both for western fans and lovers of old movies in general. this is truly a classic film for the ages.

one of the myths of the early sound era is that they couldn't make westerns because they had trouble recording sound on location. in fact, it was the financial restrictions of the depression that temporarily killed off the genre, at least in the "a" budget bracket. however, in the period 1929-1931, before the economic downturn had really kicked in, the "a" western flourished, notable examples including the virginian, billy the kid and cimarron. the big trail was perhaps the biggest of them all  a gargantuan pioneer western shot in an early widescreen process appropriately titled grandeur. thanks to a recent dvd release we now get to see the widescreen version alongside the fullscreen that was shot simultaneously.the director was raoul walsh, a man for whom the spirit of adventure lay in vast outdoor vistas, and thus in many ways a perfect choice. he makes great use of the wider frame to show off the western landscape at its most breathtaking. very typical of walsh are a number of shots towards the beginning, such as the one where a woman is chopping firewood. most of the screen is tightly filled by the wagons and other clutter, but in one corner we see the wilderness stretching out invitingly. when the wagon train gets going, the open plain is gradually revealed to us, with wagons pulling away like stage curtains. these shots are not so effective in the fullscreen version, yet on the wider canvas walsh's expression of the outdoors was never better.but there's an unfortunate flipside to this. when it comes to dialogue scenes, walsh's tendency is to place the actors in the middle of the shot, as if they were in an imaginary fullscreen box. the extra width becomes just that  extra. it may seem logical at first, because it means that height-wise we see as much of the actors as we would in a fullscreen picture. however it makes the players look small and insignificant within the frame, while all the background business dominates the shot  and there is a lot of background business in the big trail. when widescreen formats re-emerged in the 1950s, many directors would make the same mistake, before eventually realising that in talkie scenes it is better to frame actors from around the chest up, losing some of their height but allowing them to fill the screen.it's a pity, because the big trail is a particularly well-balanced and finely scripted effort. the romance and revenge subplots are simple but well defined, and do not threaten to overbalance each other or the pioneer story. it could have been a great intimate epic, but it loses dramatic weight because every time characters start talking to each other we get distracted by herds of cattle, drifting wagons or whatever else is filling every spare inch of frame. still, walsh's sensitivity to deeply emotional romantic moments is still on display, and he manages to make the final scene effective and memorable. there are also some nice comedy touches, largely courtesy of "comical swede" el brendel.the big trail is also notable for being john wayne's first lead role. while wayne is another victim of the distant framing in dialogue scenes, we do at least see his strong physical presence and hear his warm but assertive vocal delivery. he betrays his lack of experience, but the potential is clearly there. sadly that potential wasn't widely realised at the time and he spent the rest of the decade slumming it in b-pictures before he finally hit stardom. also appearing in this picture is wayne's buddy (and later prolific character actor) ward bond. he's not credited, but you can spot him in a number of scenes, most prominently around the 80-minute mark where he is stood to tyrone power's left.the big trail is a glorious epic that manages to defeat itself as a drama. and it was this stupendous scale that would put the western (and widescreen) to bed for some time. and although the 40s and 50s are now regarded as the golden age of the western, it was by then a changed genre, with stories of individual adventure and heroism in an established west  no better or worse, but of a different form. the early talkie period was the end of an era in which westerns could be truly gigantic.

if one overlooks the technical problems of this early (1930) sound movie such as the sound quality and the occasional stiffness of john wayne, one will find this movie to be an epic that is more realistic than almost any movie made since. beginning at the missouri, a large caravan of conestoga wagons, people, and animals head west. the wagons are pulled down huge cliffs and cross a flooded river with considerable risk to the riders in the wagons. indians meet with wayne, and allow the train to pass through their land. later, indians gather west of the train to combat them. the wagons form a huge circle with horses and cattle in the circle, and fire their rifles creating with the circling indians a veil of smoke.when the battle ends, the dead are buried on the spot and the people and wagons depart. this scene is remarkable, as the camera stays with the dead as the living depart. it is unique in the way it links the viewer with the dead and separates the viewer from the living. the wagons encounter a major thunderstorm with torrential downpours and mud everywhere. they finally arrive at their destination near a redwood or sequoia forest in oregon. the film is done in 70 mm widescreen at about a 2.0:1 ratio (in 1930!).i haven't mentioned the plot because it is secondary to the scenic grandeur and the enormous amount of work involved in making this film. moviemakers will never work this hard again to make such a movie or any movie. given the technical limitations of the sound, the music is at times moving, such as when wayne leaves his girl to hunt down his friend's killers and at the end.while all the critics rave about the searchers and wayne's psychology, racism, short temper, and complex characters, the big trail gives us a story of simple people encountering extraordinary hardships. one of the best westerns i have seen.

this is a movie that really makes you think about your life, our culture, family structures and situational actions. i will not give the plot in this post, i think others have beat me to it already. i hope that despite reading opinions on this site, you will take the chance and see this movie for yourself. i went to see this movie with my husband and a friend and i must say, after the movie was over there was total silence in the theater. after a few minutes i looked behind me and everyone in the theater was staring at the screen, lost in thought. this will make you delve deep into your psychological abyss to ponder several things:how much does society influence my life and the lives of my generation?how long does someone have to pay for mistakes that they have made?if there is a second chance given, is it ever realized?is it better to live in a box or to not live at all? my questions are not intended to show my approval or disapproval of leland's actions. i do not want my opinion of them to in any way dictate what you will take away from this film so i am not giving it. see it for yourself. i am still lost in thought, attempting to answer my many questions from the film. i enjoyed it greatly and hope that you will too. this film is not trying to answer questions, condone any action or promote any punishment. this movie is trying to make us all evaluate our lives and take off the rose colored glasses that most of us view the world through.great movie. 9 out of 10 stars

every role, down to the smallest, has been cast and acted with bravado.the extraordinary jena malone never takes a misstep. her two co-stars are equal to her in this film. ryan gosling may be the best actor of his generation. chris klein gives his best performance to date. this is a thought and conversation provoking film that should be seen by teens and young adults. you'll think and talk about this film for days. highly recommended.

there are subtleties in this film that i think a lot of people may miss if they're not careful. you really need to follow what leland says and read his character to figure out the intended "why" the movie presents at the end. nothing it solid, it's not definite, it's about what the individual viewer takes out of it. i think that was the plan from the get-go, people aren't meant to all understand it in the same way, it's almost about forming your own personal relationship with leland in order to maybe feel him a little better.the storyline is interesting but its summary could never explain what the movie really is. it's dramatic and thought provoking, a lot of heavy ideas, but the pace of the movie is almost soothing, even with its more intense scenes with yelling. i think it's probably leland, he's just calm and almost serene, even for all of his sadness. the movie personifies leland in a way.of course it is captivating and draws you in if you let it, but there are some recycled ideas. i mean, leland has a lot of impressive dialogue, he is anything but typical, but he's not a prophet. everything he says is not a revelation, many people i know have mentioned things he mentioned, even i have observed a few things he's observed. leland is the unique and attractive character he is probably mostly for ryan gosling's portrayal.in the end the acting is all exceptional, there are no real bad guys, there is no way to psychologically evaluate leland, only to maybe understand him and life a little better.comparable to igby goes down i think, not comedic, but similar in its general outlook on life.

before i saw this film, i read the comment of someone who wasn't very fond of it. this i must admit made me apprehensive to dedicate 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life to it, but i'm glad i did. ryan gosling is a fantastic actor, i especially loved the believer. don cheadle was also fantastic. the film presented an interesting view on life and death. it was very touching and very sad, yet it kept me interested, which most touching stories cannot do. it is a film that reckless of whether or not you like it, you should see it. it was unique,and i don;t think that anyone will ever be able to duplicate it. all of the young actors did surprisingly well given the subject matter and the emotion that must have gone into it. i was pleasantly surprised.

i am no ebert. what i am is a compassionate and i have never felt more compassion for a fictional character than i felt for leland p. fitzgerald. sorry if i do not offer a critique, but i see nothing but perfection in this film. i am sure that many who watch this film will never see the same things i do, but if you look hard enough maybe you will see something you weren't expecting. i've read that the character of leland was flawed. it seems to me that who wrote this was not able to see past the question this movie presents. i feel sorry for anyone who doesn't see the answers this movie delivers. open your heart more than your mind and you may be able to let this leland p. fitzgerald show you a world that truly has a meaning. excepcional story with extraordinary acting. ryan gosling deserves to be talked about.

this off-beat horror movie seems to be getting nothing but bad reviews. my question is; why? i think this movie is pretty good. dee snider did very well for his first (and only) time directing. he also plays the antagonist, captain howdy (carelton hendriks). this movie seems to have a view of the future. although it came out back in 1998, it seems to be about modern issues. internet predators seems to be the underlying plot here. although taken to another level, this is an issue which we still face today. i'll admit, the story fell short a few times, but that doesn't make this a bad movie at all. robert englund is even in this movie, that automatically makes it better. the acting wasn't bad, the characters were pretty good as well. hendriks was a pretty good antagonist i think. i give this off-beat horror a 7/10. recommend for fans of saw.

everyone told me this movie was downright not good, and sick etc. so i finally rented it and i was amazed . i thought the torture was gonna be much much worse, but it did get shocking near the end but that was about it. i wouldn't call it a horror movie, maybe a mystery or something under the category of silence of the lambs and/or kiss the girls. it did get stupid at times, but the rest of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat. 7/10rated r - for strong torture, violence, language, and sexuality

i don't understand where these bad comments are coming from. the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.the part that gets you is that this could all happen. not to the extent perceived in the movie, but the whole idea is reality. this movie took that reality and twisted it into a dee snider nightmare.three thumbs up (the third one is from the dead body in my freezer).

this thriller is one of the few (film) surprises i've had in quite some time. everybody - and i do mean everybody - i talked to when it was in the theatres said it was awful...but then i got to thinking...none of these people really understand horror/thriller films or metal rock - so why do i listen to them in the first place????? this film kicks ass - but only if you are able to comprehend and enjoy this type of entertainment. in short (too late) - see it with an open mind and it might just open your mind. ...the soundtracks great too...

i didn't really think this movie was bad. sure, the detective kinda sucked at what he did, and he usually happened upon capt. howdy by accident, but he got the job done. capt. howdy himself was pretty scary. the make-up artist did a great job. i really liked seeing dee dressed up all geeky. i laughed so hard when i saw that. i personally don't see how someone can sit through crap like texas chainsaw massacre and call it a great movie, and then watch strangeland, which is more disturbing because a lot of it could actually happen with the internet being so popular, and call it bad. i personally think that texas chainsaw massacre was loads of crap. probably one of the stupidest movies that i've ever seen. i enjoyed strangeland. it was a very disturbing movie because almost all of it actually happens.

dee snider was inspired to do a two part song by a horror movie. this movie he wrote/directed/produced and starred in details the subjects from those songs (horror-terria,from twistedsister/ stay hungry). people have commented he must have a sick mind to put something like this out. i don't hear anybody making comments like that about stephen king, wes craven,dean koontz,or in his own time alfred hitchcock. the movie profiles a modern psychotic created by current trends in society. personally i thought it was pretty well done from sheer imagination and inspiration,also without the benefit of a large budget and interviews with actual victims/criminals. this movie is perfect if you want something to give you nightmares and make you cringe about the possible and probable. it could happen!!

honestly, this is one of the best horror movies i have ever seen. i was captivated by the story, petrified of captain howdy and on the edge of my seat for the whole ride. i do not really understand all the negative reviews.the set up has already been discussed in depth; captain howdy is an on-line predator who sets up meetings with teenagers, abducts them and introduces them to his favorite pastime of body modification and piercing. dee snider is captain howdy and he is one of the scariest psychopaths ever created; maybe the scariest because he is so human and you get the sense (especially if you are into body modification at all) that there are really people like this in the world.but the biggest reason i liked this movie and the reason it is so horrific is that captain howdy becomes the hero. at the beginning of the movie, the roles are clear-cut; the victims are innocent, the cop is the good guy and howdy is pure evil. by the second act, however, things have changed a little. you want howdy to be evil but it turns out that he is really just a victim of circumstance and maybe the good and the bad are not obvious. it is terrifying to find yourself cheering for the "bad" guy.a couple people have mentioned that strangeland should have been broken into two separate movies. to be sure, there are definitely two separate "acts" but this movie works so well because the two acts are back to back. the first act is the typical psycho-thriller but the second act is the most disturbing because of the viewers reaction to the situation. i do not think it would have worked quite the same if the second act were expanded and turned into a sequel.as a big horror movie fan, i highly recommend this film. it is the first horror movie ever to give me nightmares.

strangeland seems to have a love/hate relationship with many of its viewers. i personally loved the movie, and everything about it.the acting in some places could be improved upon, but the filming adds to the atmosphere where the acting can't. in some areas, the dialogue is a bit cheesy and over dramatic, but really, what do you expect from the late 90s? over all, dee did an amazing job in writing what i believe to be one of the most terrifying thrillers i've ever seen. it plays on the fears of many age groups--adult, parents, and children. every parent fears that their children will get too involved with chat rooms and will meet strangers from the internet. and it *does* happen in the real world. and every child and adult fears being kidnapped and tortured against their will; that happens too in the real world. which is what makes this movie such a sensitive subject for many.my only warning is if you *know* you are sensitive to things such as strong violence, visible torture, and gore, then you do *not* want to see this movie. if you are unsure about if this movie will entertain you, then read as many reviews as you can, ask people you know who have seen this movie, and be prepared to turn the movie off at any time should you become disturbed.

a lot of people give this movie a lot of crap, and all of it's really undeserved. people give this movie a hard time either because it's such a sick subject or they harp on some technical aspect of the movie no one else observes when they watch it. if, just by looking at the cover, you think this movie will make you uncomfortable...don't watch it! however, you'd be missing out on one of the better cinematic experiences of the late 1990's, despite what anyone else says.dee snider is wonderful here as captain howdy, the depths of insanity he plumbs to play this character has to be beyond words, and is much farther than any one of us would have to be willing to go. the acting here is wonderful. the film itself beautifully shot. the subject may be a bit too much for many to swallow, but it's still well worth your time. if you haven't seen this movie, check it out.

andrew mccarthy played the role of an atheist very well. i liked the plot of the movie. it gave something to think about other than a comedy. it had a very twisted mind and a good cop versus god. a very well used plot line.

i enjoyed the film, and the fact that it aimed rather high in dealing with some sophisticated material. i saw the film in a preview screening, and it wasn't ruined by any silly video boxes that spoiled the ending. the performances were quite good, especially andrew mccarthy in a more mature roll. i also enjoyed the look of the film which gave it a mysterious, forboding air. i also enjoyed some of the "twists" in the plot, and don't want to give too much away in case other countries' video boxes don't give it all away! the script was a little over the top at times, but i appreciated the fact that the film-makers weren't afraid to challenge the audiences with interesting and puzzling questisons regarding the roll of faith in our world. and, while some might find the ending a little too open-ended, i appreciated the fact that the movie refused to tie everything up neatly with a bow. that's not how life works.

this film was different. it took a sort of typical thriller story and reached for a more interesting, in-depth look at an individual character's struggle with faith. of course, it helped that the main performance, by andrew mccarthy, was quite excellent. the other performances were also quite interesting, although not as consistent. the ending was a bit of a let down, but there were lots of good moments. the film-makers tried something different here -- they didn't just go for the obvious chills and scares. this is a dark film (not for everyone) but if you want to be entertained and not talked down to, try this one.

i saw this movie on my local cable system under the title of 'beyond redemption'. i was searching for new material to watch, since most of the reruns one saturday morning didn't interest me. i've always been a fan of andrew mccarthy and michael ironside, so i chose this movie. i was pleasantly surprised.personally, i enjoyed the film. rich roesing, who posted a comment about the film being spoiled for him by seeing scenes from the movie on the back of a video rental box, are well justified. i did not have the disappointment of knowing beforehand anything about the film. this led me to rate the movie higher than the average score listed on the page.i like suspense movies, and this one was no exception. the movie kept me guessing until the very end. i was surprised by the ending!the moments of reflection and remembrance of past experiences by the main character during the film only added to the suspense. his reactions to those remembrances gave the film a sense of the humanitarian, yet conflictual, side of police work. the struggle with his faith is also a welcome addition.if you like suspense films, but also like films that expound on the character's feeling, personal inflection side, this film is for you.should you find this movie on your local cable or satellite system's guide, watch it!however, if you are looking for a rental video, follow rich roesing's advice and have someone get the video for you before watching it.

look, this is a low budget horror film that suffers from all of the problems that go with low budget movies. but you must see this just to watch lisa erickson as julie. she is smokin' hot and a great little actress to boot! these types of horror movies often unearth a rare gem and the power gave us lisa erickson! nothing i enjoy more than sitting down in my studio apartment with a coke and putting in this film. my friends bob, bill and dennis agree.. lisa is not only brilliant, she is a hottie. the movie itself often plods along and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in that regard. but as soon as lisa hits the screen, things really start hopping. the others are clearly not in her league. this is not the exorcist but as i said, if you want to see a fun little movie with a hot little actress, this is the one to see!

a man named jerry comes into possession of an ancient aztec doll.however this creepy little figure is possessed by an evil spirit,which takes over jerry's body and pushes him to spill the blood...i have seen two other horror movies "the dorm that dripped blood" and "the kindred" made by stephen carpenter and jeffrey obrow and i must say that "the power" doesn't disappoint either.the plot is slow-moving,but there are some effective human goo effects and a little bit of gore.the scene of a female tabloid reporter being attacked by arms that come ripping out of a mattress is a hoot.i liked this low-budget horror movie and you should too,if you are into 80's horror genre.8 out of 10.

abe zwick perfected the one-off, beautifully. he never made another film, but created a brilliant portrait of homosexual self-hatred in this film that is both caustic and affecting. he commands the screen, presenting the crumbling debris of a man breaking down under the strain of an increasingly meaningless life. paul (zwick) is an aging queen who's somehow convinced stanley (wayne crawford), a doe-eyed idiot with no sense of the future, to follow his star. he's a petty thief who's seething hatred has escalated recently. he's been forced to skip town and move to a suburb in miami. as a disguise, he dresses up like a dried up old blue-stocking with as much seething sexual torment as the church lady. he tells stanley to tell his friends that he lives with his "aunt martha". paul himself has no friends, spends far too much time alone in the house, and has to deal with stanley's dissolute lifestyle. it would be enough to make any man cross the line into transgendered homicidal mania. again, zwick portrays paul as a tragic figure who has utterly lost any understanding of how to relate to other people. nevertheless, there is a certain poetry in his anguish, which burns slowly over the course of the film. he's tragic, but also elegant. this is, ultimately, a very sad film. it certainly has many hilarious moments, but there is such an undercurrent of hopelessness and despair, that the humour is bittersweet. this film is worth watching for the performance of abe zwick. he could have really built his career on martha. she's quite a gas, once you get to know her. just make sure you cut your hair and stop your horsing around. she really hates that!

haha, what a great little movie! wayne crawford strikes again, or rather this was his first big strike, a deliriously entertaining little ball of manic kitsch energy masquerading as a psycho killer movie. it's actually a **brilliant** satire on post-hippie american culture in flyover country, though the movie was actually filmed independently in miami. it defies any kind of studio oriented convention or plot device that i can think of: sometimes aunt martha does dreadful things may not be a very technically adept movie, but it is a wonderful little slice of americana, made on the cheap by people who were honest, ambitious, imaginative and had balls made out of steel. it took guts, nerve and guile to make this movie, which amazingly appears to have stood the test of time. this movie is fresh, vital, alive, unforgettable, and charmingly weird enough to recommend to just about anyone with a sense of humor.i dug up last year during a period of time when i was fascinated by "star" wayne crawford (here billed under his pseudonym scott lawrence), a maestro of what can only be called regional film-making, usually of the b grade variety. he's a writer, producer, director, and actor all in one, probably best known for the 80s teen apocalyptic favorite night of the comet. here he plays stanley, the pants wearing half of a couple of truly marvelous characters, apparently homosexual spree killers on the lam after knocking off some old lady in baltimore for her jewelry. unsung screen legend abe zwick is completely convincing as paul, who poses as stanley's aunt martha, the cross dressing brains of the outfit who has conned stanley into thinking he's committed murder to ensure his loyalty. martha looks about as feminine as the sailors from south pacific's supporting choir in their coconut bikini tops, yet somehow nobody seems to notice -- or care? -- that she is a he, has no visible means of income, seems to spend all day fretting about where stanley is, and scurries around the neighborhood in her bathrobe carrying a butcher's knife. only in america ...as the film opens the two of them have just arrived in florida and set up residence in what looks like ward cleaver's old house, a garishly lit & designed television home that is so cliché as to be surreal. during one memorable scene martha and an unwelcome house guest sit on the couch, talk problems and drink cans of budweiser in what is one of the most mesmerizing, subversively ordinary sequences i've ever seen outside of a john waters movie. then there's stanley, always getting into trouble as he is a mop topped hippie with an stp patch on his vest who drives a psychedelic painted van that's about as subtle as the batmobile, drinks his milk straight from the carton, snorts drugs with blond bombshell bimbos, and hoards donuts in an old cigar box for a quick snack. opposites attract, i guess.but stanley also has a thing about not liking it when the young ladies he gets stoned with try to remove his pants, and it always seems to be up to aunt martha to get him out of the trouble that inevitably results. the bodies pile up, a nosy junkie blackmails them into using their house as a flop, stanley's birthday cake gets squashed, and everybody meets down at the local pizza shop before heading to the wood shed on the back property for a hookah hash party where the girls dance in their underwear. things get out of hand when one of the neighbors tries to get a bit too chummy with martha, who naturally prefers to keep people at an arm's length when they rudely invite themselves over for a nice chat. and this is a woman who carries not just a butcher knife but a loaded .38 in her slip. eventually the strange duo find themselves stuck with a body, a baby, and no place to go, and end up taking refuge at an abandoned movie studio where no doubt the technical crew borrowed the equipment used to make the film. i just hope they politely asked for permission first and cleaned up after themselves.a word of course must be said about stanley and martha/paul's relationship, since to dance around the fact that the two are at least suggested to be a homosexual couple would be to miss the primary gist of the plot. we never see the two of them get intimate and indeed even though stanley mockingly refers to being "balled" in one scene, their relationship is more symbiotic than sexual. it certainly isn't a "gay" movie, with abundant female nudity and an air of 70s misogyny that cannot be denied either. stanley & paul never consummating their implied sexuality on screen, even though the movie certainly would have had the guts to do so if it were important. it isn't, the story isn't about their sex, it's about the bond they share, and how weird it is. not their being gay, but their being the distinct individuals they are, who are two of the strangest movie creations ever to inhabit my tv set.the film is unique. it was made for only a few thousand dollars on what look like borrowed studio sets, the occasional location work, and an couple of public locations they managed to sneak a camera crew into when nobody was looking. the dialog is completely bizarre, mundane and delightfully esoteric. it's a movie that will take you by surprise, not everyone will like it but for those with a taste for low budget american horror/thrillers like the night god screamed, help me! i'm possessed, blood & lace and children shouldn't play with dead things, you've got yourself a winner here.8/10: usually i'd say something like "deserves a dvd restoration" but somehow i think doing so would ruin the movie's tacky ambiance. and wayne crawford, you, sir, rule.

the working title was: "don't spank baby". wayne crawford went on to become a successful producer, films like valley girl, night of the comet and others, even though he wasn't too terrific in this little gem. and little known abe zwick should have gotten tons of work from this film but didn't. filmed at moberly studios in hollywood florida, on the same lot the early tarzan movies were filmed. this film is definitely for those who appreciate the abstract. the movie was originally shot with some nudity and much more graphic slasher scenes. for reasons only known to tom casey the director, the bloody slasher scenes were given a tab of lsd, and the nudity was removed. even though this version is worthy of a look for those so inclined, in my opinion, the original version would have packed the punch needed to make this a full on slasher 70's cult classic.

the title refers not to a questionable poker hand, but to six comic players. they come in twos: charles ruggles and mary boland as a couple driving to california for a second honeymoon, george burns and gracie allen as another couple who go along to share expenses, and w.c. fields and alison skipworth as a sheriff and a hotel-owner in a tiny nevada town. no attempt is made to fashion a coherent narrativeit's a collection of comic bits strung together. all the first couple want to do is spend time together, but burns and allen's characters aren't married, so the men bunk together, as do the women. there is a bit of a plot: a bad guy plants $50k in the suitcase pinky (ruggles) is taking out of town, but because the expedition is being guided by gracie, the loot cannot be found. the bad guy shows up in nevada and fields accidentally captures him. a bunch of pleasant bits, ruggles' confused expression, gracie's batty, breakneck talk, and fields playing billiards with a corkscrew cue and doing a fluttery, craven, backwards-stepping double-take when he's threatened, and his wonderfully distinctive way of lingering over words. and trying to remember the name "gracie," he tells skipworth, "hmm. starts with a k... mcgonigle." she answers, "oh no, no, no, no..." "mmmm. wangahanky!" "no, no, no, no no. oh, gracie." "yes, that's right."

the gimmick, as it were, of this 1934 paramount comedy is the six comedy performers, paired off into three man-and-woman teams, who all appear together. w. c. fields and his frequent screen partner alsion skipworth appear in the second half of the film and shine in their roles as a small-town sheriff and innkeeper. fields seems to have been given the latitude to inject plenty of his own one-of-a-kind brand of misanthropic, surreal comedy into his part, and it works wonderfully, especially where he is allowed to do his famous pool table routine, a digression that is totally welcome since it is hilarious.at first thought it might have seemed like a mismatch to conceive of a film to be carried by the subtle domestic comedy of charlie ruggles and mary boland next to the broad, jokey vaudeville patter of the great husband-and-wife comedy team of george burns and gracie allen, but here it works perfectly because of the parts george and gracie are given in the script. they are there are freeloaders hitching a ride to california on ruggles' and boland's honeymoon trip and consistently find ways to annoy them at every step, including, brilliantly, while they are each holding on to the side of a cliff for dear life.making burns and allen comic annoyances to two sympathetic characters turns out to be a perfect way to fit their far-out, larger-than-life comedy characters into a real world setting -- the comedy of people reacting to them in a believable way turns out to be as much as a gold-mine as gracie's famous naive delivery itself.charlie ruggles deserves special mention for his performance as the fussy banker "pinky" whinney. he's marvelously subtle and underplayed, and draws laughs from lines that in another actor's hands might not even have been heard.the script is wonderfully witty all through, and most of the way it's a perfectly extended comedy of frustration in which our sympathies are with the poor whinneys who can't get a moment alone, and the extra bonus is that what frustrates them is just more first-rate comedy material from burns and allen. for the pre-code watchers out there, there is some rather suggestive material in some of the most amusing scenes, as whinney tries to get across to george just why he and his wife want to be alone for a while.there are a few signs of a rushed production here -- the occasional jump cut, one of the most obvious drop sets you will ever see in a movie (right up there with w. c. field's own short "the golf specialist"), and the knot in field's tie is constantly changing in shape. these don't bother me, though, and they shouldn't bother anybody who is enjoying the film."six of a kind" is a real little-known gem and one of the funniest movies i've seen in a while. if you're thinking about whether to watch it, the answer should be yes.

sometimes, but very rarely, a movie tells a story so well that it almost becomes difficult. this movie tells several stories so well simultaneously that it was the first few times a movie i could not watch to completion. it was too real....and the characters so strong that watching it became a personal struggle. seeing these three men and their families deal with their hardships, one in particular, often hit me too hard. now, i have watched in its entirety without interruption several times, and i realize what i always suspected. this movie is a masterpiece. the writing, the acting, the blending of several stories without being even the least bit choppy, everything about this movie is exceptional. seven academy awards? no wonder, it certainly must have deserved them.

blue ribbon banners, stars and stripes forever, decorated generals, and unconditional surrender from the enemies which required tons and tons of radiation, this was the summon substance of the united states victory in world war ii!! the celebration on times square as well as everywhere else in the united states suggests a national zenith!!! america is on top right!! one thing, one agonizing and painstakingly perverse thing..the period of adjustment!!..the actual celebration ended when the bottle of champagne was finished..now everyone needs to get on with their lives...only one problem though...they have to get new lives...the old lives are gone forever...polite and pleasant smiles had a fragile facade with a longevity of ice cubes in boiling water!! everyone of the characters in the movie is paraded by primal doubts, and unable to masquerade a pretense about how nothing was seriously wrong, for the simple reason that it was not true!!! once sergeants, and generals, and their wives, and daughters, and sons and virtually all other americans touched by world war ii, were exposed to disabilities, nightmares and recriminations of world war ii and what it really accomplished as well as negated, nobody was the same!! for now, social and moral issues had a self serving interest...frederick march and myrna loy had to start over!! dana andrews realized that he should never have been married to virginia mayo in the first place!!! theresa wright has become painfully aware of the fact that she is constructively selfish!! las but not least, the character, homer, is about to get married and he thinks that everyone around him is as devastated by his injury as he is, basically in the sense that they are unable or unwilling to cope!!the reason this film is so fabulous is because a happy ending was attained the hard way, once everybody recognized the new beginning of the new united states and the new world overall, tragedy from wwii was recognized, and things that were emotionally torn asunder were taken in stride, and dealt with accordingly!! frederick march and myrna loy need to go back to chapter one in their marriage, homer has apprised his new bride as to what it takes to be married to him (i.e. half the times, she will feel like a nurse) and thresa wright's involvement with dana andrews means that her entrance into adulthood has resulted in partial responsibility for breaking up a marriage...this is tantamount to learning how to drive a car to get your driver's license at the indianapolis 500...the characters in the movie are the typical post wwii americans in that they are stalemated by the rude awakening of coercive changes to their lives...happiness no longer is afforded the luxury of the adjective cop-aesthetic...it is now about formidable conditions, and good winning out over evil by way of the less ugly choice!!...world war ii did not just happen!! it will henceforth dominate the social patterns of american living!!!the aggregate catastrophe of world war ii has mirrored most americans' feelings of personal human inadequacy as well!!i loved this film and so did afi, probably for the reason that it brought out issues that were at one time unjustifiably taboo!!..bottom line, see this movie!! nightmares about combat, dilemmas about marital unhappiness and/or readjustment, coping with your life when stricken-ed by a disability and just basically acting human are portrayed constantly in movies and television today, however!! this is 1946!! very new to americans then....remember that!! director william wyler has illustrated how americans feel about the aftermath of wwii in the days when the movie industry has left him with one hand tied behind his back!!! take that into account and you will probably realize just how sensational this movie really was!!

thirty years prior to the deer hunter came this movie, an excellent meditation on the effects of war inflicted on the american family as seen from both the war heroes and their wives. a truly ironic title, the best years of our lives is anything but since those times have vanished into still images and all that is left is an uncertain future for those involved.truly an ensemble cast despite the top-billing of myrna loy, the best years of our lives focuses more on the stories of the men. al stephenson (fredric march) comes back to a household that has irrevocably changed as his sons have grown although he finds support from his doting wife milly (myrna loy). fred derry, upon returning, cannot find a decent job despite being a war veteran and is trapped in a marriage that he does not want to marie, a happy-go-lucky girl who wants more out of life and who increasingly comes to hate him. homer parrish, on the other hand, has greater problems due to his loss of hands at war and feels the entire world -- including the girl he loves and her family -- thinks he is a freak of nature.at almost three hours of length, the film never seems long and drawn out. there is so much emotions happening even in small moments that the plot breezes by; nothing seems wasted or placed on screen due to a lack of editing. not a performance rings false, though the standouts are those of dana andrews as fred derry, harold russell as homer parrish and virginia mayo as marie derry. even then every character has his or her moment on film, and the time was right to talk about all the pain and suffering that until then had not been seen in american films (including the ones made around world war one, which did not dabble in such topics). while there is never any overt violence, it's all there, in the haunted expressions of the three male leads' faces, in the lot where the planes now reside, ready to be turned into junk (and therefore, forgetfulness), in the cynicism of the store owners who couldn't be bothered to employ these shell-shocked men who had seen battle or even worse, to goad them into wondering what was it all worth for. this is the film in which coming home and born on the fourth of july are indebted to. at a time when america fled from war films, to come up with this when the end of the second world war was still fresh was a necessity in order to make a more honest film-making.

one of the great things about the best years of our lives that even though it dates itself rather firmly in the post world war ii era, the issues it talks about are as real today as they were on v-e or v-j day of 1945. the problem of how to assimilate returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet.and while we don't often learn from history, we can be thankful that for once the united states of america did learn from what happened with its veterans after the previous world war. the gi bill of rights is mentioned in passing in the best years of our lives was possibly the greatest piece of social legislation from the last century. so many veterans did take advantage of it as do the veterans like fredric march, dana andrews, and harold russell who you see here.all three of those actors played archetypal veterans, characters that every corner of the usa could identify with. they all meet on an army transport plane flying to the home town of all of them, boone city, iowa.war is a great leveler of class and distinction. bank employee march, soda jerk andrews, and high school football star russell probably would never meet in real life even in a small town like boone city. but they do meet and war forges indestructible bonds that can never be broken.march is the oldest, a man with two children and hollywood's perfect wife myrna loy. he settles in the first and the best. he has some wonderful scenes, getting cockeyed drunk on his return and later with a little bit of liquor in him, tells the bank officials at a banquet off in no uncertain terms.i also love his scene where another returning veteran, a sharecropper wants to get a bank loan for his own piece of land. watch march's expressions as he listens to the man's pitch for money. you can feel him read the man's soul. it's what got him his second best actor oscar for this film.harold russell was a real veteran who lost both his hands during service in the pacific. he got a special recognition oscar for his performance. because of that it was probably unfair to nominate him in the supporting actor category which he also won in. his performance, especially his scenes with cathy o'donnell as his sweetheart who loves him with or without his hands, is beyond anything that could be described as acting.dana andrews is the only officer of the three, a bombardier in the army air corps. of the group of them, maybe he should have stayed in. he also comes from the poorest background of the group and he was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform. that uniform and those monthly allotment checks are what got virginia mayo interested enough to marry him. the problem is that he's considerably less in her eyes as a civilian.while mayo is fooling around with steve cochran, andrews has the great good fortune to have march's daughter teresa wright take an interest in him. they're the main story of the film, andrews adjustment to civilian life and adjusting to the fact he married the wrong woman. not all veteran's problems were solved with gi bill.myrna loy gets little recognition for the best years of our lives. my guess is that it's because her role as wife was too much like the stereotypical wife roles she had patented over at mgm. still as wife to march and mother to wright she really is the glue that holds that family together.the best years of our lives won for best picture for sam goldwyn, best director for william wyler and a few others besides the two acting oscars it got. it was a critical and popular success, possibly the best film sam goldwyn ever produced. it remains to this day an endearing and enduring classic and will be so for centuries. it's almost three hours in length, but never once will your interest wane.the best tribute this film received came from frank capra who had a film of his own in the oscar sweepstakes that year in several categories. in his memoirs he said that he was disappointed to be skunked at the oscars that year, but that his friend and colleague william wyler had created such a masterpiece he deserved every award he could get for it.by the way, the film capra had hopes for was it's a wonderful life. the beat years of our lives can't get better praise than that.

this show is great for many reasons..the father and mother can communicate with their kids this day in age. its so great to see a real family instead of some stuffy overacting family. i watched this one time and became hooked.it so great to see a black family on tv worth watching. this show left too soon but on its way out it dealt with pregnancy, sexy, drugs, bad dates,death etc .the best thing about the show was that it dealt with it in a real humorous sort of way. great show for the family ..i cant tell you how many times i have sat up watched this show late at night sometimes and laughed my head off. great pg 13 rated show.i loved everybit of this show.

it's one of my favorites tv series. a wonderful cast, great screenplay and a out siding plot.watching the routine of the kyle family is grantee of great moments of humor and great comedy performers. let's see: - damon wayans: no commentaries. he's one of the bests today. se has a perfect timing and always get the point of the joke.- tisha campbell: her's paranoid and sentimental jay is just wonderful to see.- george o. gore ii: perfect for the paper. it's impossible to imagine someone else as the adorable (and dumb) junior.- jennifer nicole freeman: the egocentric claire found the perfect actress. beautiful & talented.- parker mckeena posey: impossible to not fall in love for her.- noah grey-cabey: this boy have future, i'm sure of it.i get very sad when it ends, but this show will be in my mind forever. michael, jay, claire, junior, kadie... we love you!

my wife and kids is a good and funny series that truly shows the worries and problems that happen the most even in the best families.michael kyle (daddy) is a man who is always trying to stop his children from doing teen's stuff like partying, drinking, loving or making love. when they do something wrong, he is right there to correct them (by the way he loves to make bad penalties)janet 'jay' kyle (mother) has a strong personality and rarely agrees with her husband. she understands that their children are teenagers and like to do "wrong" things, unlike michael doesmichael kyle 'jr' is a dumb guy who believes in everything other people say. in the beginning of the series, he's such a cool guy and tries to be like his father, but lately, i don't know why, he becomes a very very dumb dude and he starts being a problematic guy. in the end of the series he falls in love with vanessa and becomes a father, or should i say, a dumb father who does nothing rightkady kyle is a typical teenagers who loves to party, kiss and drink. she has many problems with her parents because they invade her privacy too much. she has a boyfriend called tony who is catholic and is scared of everything, so we can't understand what makes she date him. i can remember one episode that they're prepared to have sex, but michael kyle scares tony claiming that sex is very dangerous and deadly, so he decides to guard himself until he's married.i resume this is the best series of my life and i still watch it everyday after 3 years so i recommend to all of you - mostly for teenagers.

this show was crap when it first came on. the first actress that played the daughter didn't fit the role, the writing was hit or miss, and damon wayans clearly wasn't comfortable doing such a cornball family friendly show. the chemistry between himself and tisha cambell (they're long time friends, as are all of the wayans clan with tisha's husband and will smith and jada pinkett) did work so they retooled the show. once it returned, they recast the daughter, made the son much dumber (a la eric from "boy meets world")and made the youngest daughter into a genius...(later they gave her a little genius boyfriend to do comedic guest appearances). the show, while if often rollercoasters from over the top buffoonery to being corny walks the line enough to keep it as a show that you can see damon wayans be comfortable in his own skin on the set (especially since the main writers, directors and consultants were all members of the wayans family) and in his character. once everyone had been on the show for a while, they worked to everyone in the casts strengths and were able to make a consistently funny show on the air.however, there is too much buffoonery, too many over the top antics, and oftentimes too much chaos happening in the life of the kyle family. they made junior too stupid, they also made the eldest daughter an attractive, clumsy idiot from time to time and the youngest daughter wasn't even spared by the writers. i feel they jumped the shark and signed the shows death warrant when junior got his girlfriend pregnant, she moved in and he married her and her parents were introduced (junior's wife's father's character makes me wince just thinking about him). the show remained funny...but it was a upn show on abc if that makes any sense to the reader.the reruns are funny enough, but i'm relieved it's over...there was nowhere left to go with it. when it's bad it's really bad. it tends to be cornball at times but at least he was a black man who had a sitcom make it to syndication on a major network..who can say that for themselves now? (given the cw merger and the "brownout" on tv networks lately, that is). one.

"my wife and kids," in my opinion, is an absolute abc classic! i haven't seen every episode, but i still enjoyed it. there are many episodes that i enjoyed. one of them was where junior (george o. gore ii) got his driver's license. if you want to know why, you'll have to have seen it for yourself. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. in conclusion, even though it can be seen in syndication now, i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good.

the biggest problem that the tv program key west faced was that it was advertised wrong. if you saw the ads you would think it was a jiggle how, and be sorely disappointed. it was a vastly more complex show than that. i happened to be in key west just before hurricane andrew hit, and i think i actually found myself having a drink or two with some of the cast in rum runners. of course, that was before the show hit. i did see the sailboat that was in the opening go by a few times, and chatted with the guy who you see hacking up coconuts in the opening too. he was a real local. yes, i'd love to see this on dvd.

i think that "key west" might do well as a dvd. there probably are a lot of failed star treks that just never had a chance to succeed. we will never know if this could have been a great series. i would love to know if there is a way to see older shows like this or are they just another hollywood footnote? is it possible to find copies of these shows so that we loyal oddballs can enjoy them again? the show had a great writing talent and some if not all of the episodes left you with a feel for the characters that is often missing in todays hit shows.i often came away with a sense of learning something from the story lines and greatly entertained by the very unique characters. thank you.

we all seem to be in agreement. it was an excellent show and let die way before it's time. i've decided that if i really enjoy a show, it's often the kiss of death. i love the quirky, ensemble cast shows, and a great setting always helps. i really expected to see a lot of these stars in other television productions, but short of mariska hagartay who played fisher stephens crazy girlfriend, i've not seen many of them except in occasional cameo roles. what a shame.key west, northern exposure, gilmore girls, and veronica mars... all great shows, all sadly gone before their time.hear us, loud and clear, we want key west on dvd..... please.

agree that this was one of the best episodes of this show. i remember the series well as i was in the florida keys when the show had its debut. i was looking through old vcr tapes that were "keepers" and came across two that had about eight episodes. i ended up spending part of christmas night (and the next) watching these shows. the singer was bankie banx - saw his name come up on the credits. he's from anguilla and owns a beach front bar called the dune preserve. he's a longtime friend of jimmy buffett and bankie's classic song "still in paradise" is featured on the latest buffett cd/dvd combo called "live in anguilla" - it is track #12 on cd 1 and #8 on the cd. i too would like to someday see this short lived series come out on dvd. keep the faith!

this series, while idealized and fictionalized, has the quirkiness, sultriness, and good-heartedness that does come from living on an island.i lived in an out of the way part of hawaii for a few years and found some hilarious, quirky, and fun people in some remote (non-tourist) areas.every time i see the reruns of this series, i fondly compare my memories of experiences in out-of-the-way parts of hawaii with the memories portrayed and fictionalized in key west.this series is not reality television. i hate reality television.it is from the era when people still wrote creative tv shows. give me a "young writer" who takes their inspiration from the "angels in the spray, wizards in the palm trees and elves in the seashells" any day.

i am right now watching "the big chill" on dvd. one of its actors is meg tilly. i looked it up on imdb which led me to reading meg's bio which mentioned and reminded me of meg's sister jennifer tilly whose filmography included "key west", which was one of my wife's and my favorite shows. i then read this entire thread of reviews.wow, i really loved that show also and agree with all of the sentiments about the quirkiness and uniqueness of the characters and situations.as most everyone else, i wish it was on dvd or otherwise available.the last reviewer says he watches it on reruns so i wish i knew what network, channel, day, times it is on.so if anyone knows how we can watch episodes of "key west", please let us know.

such a shame that this wonderful bright spot on the small screen had such talent in writers and actors, such wonderful scenery that was the ultimate escapism for those in a land locked, sun deprived state. many of the actors went on to bigger things...another indicator that there was something wonderful sadly lost. i lived in columbus, ohio at the time, with all of my (now ex) husband's very large family in a chorus of 'no no!!' every time it would be yet again taken over by a baseball game broadcast. someone who wrote here mentioned it was up against 'rosanne'...all my ex and i noticed was that it was always always always preempted by baseball!!!! yes, fox really wasted something wonderful that one and nothing will ever equal it~! thank you for the memories of it.

key west, for too short a time was "appointment tv" for my family. i'd stop by red lobster and pick up a party tray for the night it was on. the irony of the situation was that i was working for a fox affiliate at the time, and every one at the station was incensed at them not renewing the show. everyone in that cast was excellent. fisher stevens... perfect. who couldn't fail to identify with an "everyman" who dreams of being a writer in key west? jennifer tilly was always remarkable (and she is one heck of a texas hold'em player). you can still find the pilot episode on youtube. wish they'd post the hurricane one. that episode alone, should have won an emmy, as well as the rest of the cast.

"where to begin, where to begin . . ?(savannah in the episode "gimme shelter")" to disabuse: fox/viacom does not, at this point in time, have any intention of releasing the show on dvd. but be not downhearted! that you are reading this reveals that the magic lingers fifteen years on . . . and small wonder. this was post-modern television, a valiant attempt to visualize magical realism. 'neath the blue patina, charm, and brio were scripts bursting with symbolism and metaphor, music that actually interacted with scenes! and, ultimately, an attempt, however doomed, to recapture one's belief in innocence, to reclaim eden, as it were . . . it's potency is perhaps best attested to by the fact that even as we, umm, type, a book is being written about the show wherein will be found the thoughts, fancies, and reminiscences of many of the show's actors, writers, directors, and producers. in the meanwhiles . . . anyone desirous of once again visiting the end of the world and reacquainting themselves with seamus, sheriff cody, savannah, et al . . . should not hesitate to contact me, i may be able to make you a copy. "angels in the spray, wizards in the palm trees . . ."

compared to this, tarkovsky is a speed freak.compared to this, bela tarr is mtv.compared to this, the movie "russian ark" is a roller-coaster ride.i've just described 3 of the sllllowwwwwesssstttt experiences i've ever known, and this one tops them all. but that's not saying it's bad. on the contrary, i really liked it. but it was a chore.i won't describe the plot, because you can easily find that elsewhere. suffice it to say that the plot is insane. it's one of the most creative and bizarre ideas since "becoming john malkovich". i believe the interesting plot is the main reason i kept from nodding off (also, the humour was nice. that's something we rarely see in slow, artsy films).here we see a bizarre reversal of the norm. most movies have little plot & little substance; yet they fill 90 mins with a lot of eyecatching images to keep us enthralled. but "the hole" has 100% plot/theme without much to please the eyes. in that respect, i suppose it's a truly intellectual experience, much like reading a painfully verbose novel like thackaray's "vanity fair" (which i've never been able to finish!).if you have a tremendous attention span, i think you'll really like this film. despite its molassessy pace, it's highly creative and imaginative. it's like jean-pierre jeunet on quaaludes and with a drab, dusty camera lens. best of luck.

this film is like a dirge. until it gets to musical numbers which are like mind f*ck, but gentler, like a mind caress. mind foreplay. the depressing vibe given from the speed & desperateness of the characters can be pretty kill-yourself-awesome until you get to the musical numbers. it's a great film. optimistic. weird. manic-depressive(bipolar). that's it! this movie is bipolar. anyway see it. it's a musical!!! with depth!!!! if you like the existential dross like the stranger, or waiting for godot, then your probably get a real kick out of this one. i had to get the dvd through amazon.com for like 12$. oh & the songs rock. well they rock but they aren't rock, there like calypso, jazz, broadway, but by grace chung, & i can't find the soundtrack nowhere< but i wanna the songs are great, & the dances are so fun.

the whole world is falling prey to a lethal disease, and rain never stops pouring down : nevertheless, in this atmosphere of nightmare, a man and a woman discover that they are neighbors, thanks to a hole in the floor of the man's apartment. they fall in love : at least, all would not have been lost. although this wonderful film expresses the loneliness and the weakness of human being, there is also some room for hope, in the shiny singing scenes.

in the middle of the hole i e-mailed a friend of mine to summarize it. not sure if the film would break down into a series of submissive gestures, i felt a little un-easy recommending it, but then i saw the ending. it's perfect. i've been living in korea for 6 months, and this film could just as easily summarize the strange ennui and frustration of any asian metropolis as it takes on taiwin here. it uses the myth of hong kong musicals the same way godard or hartley use western musicals, but takes it to an extreme, it's gritty world and occasionally kafka-esquire logic make it all the better. i really feel like the hole's closest comparison is hal hartley's surviving desire, but have a kinda bleak edge to what are ultimately hopefully and strangely metaphorical films. anyway, this is what i wrote to esther. hope you like the hole too.hey,watching a move called the hole. taiwanese i think seems a bit to weird for china unless it's hong kong. it's worth seeing so far. it's about a guy and a girl in an apartment complex. the guy's ceiling caves in and the girl starts to get annoyed and well it's kinda a weird metaphor for the simultaneous pleasure ,degregation, and pain of a rather intense crush. there's also a kinda zombie-virus-sub-plot too and a lot of weird little scenes where the girl acts out her desires through rather innocent and kinda fun 50's doo-wop sequences. worth a look.

this movie, one of the best i've ever seen, talks about incommunicability. it does it plunging ourselves in a livid taipei, stained in cold colors, where the rain falls incessantly; a damp world. it does it displaying us the story of two persons living in this world, a man and a woman. a coincidence, or the fate,links their existences, but they're not able to open one to the other with words. characters are the mirror of the difficulty of our society concerning interpersonal relationships. an incommunicability that here is taken to the extreme limits. all the characters exchange only a few words during the movie, dialogues are nearly absent, and when some words are spoken they're often weak and empty, far away from describing people's real feelings. so, the progression of the story, the revelation of character's feelings is developed (brilliant idea!) by the musical digressions, only apparently meaningless, that speckle the movie. the proceeding of the sentimental event, and the drama of female protagonist, lead us to a splendid ending, heavily symbolic. a movie totally different from the usual, a clever realization by a great-talented director. ps. forgive me for my bad grammar!!

it's less visceral than the only other tsai film i've seen ("vive l'amour"), but the idea of doorways (holes) into others' emotions and existences is vividly portrayed here, as tsai sets up long shot after long shot, usually with long takes, suggesting a sense of alienation in taipei. the musical interludes, inspired by grace chang, are perplexing but welcome mile-markers that add new dimensions to the slowly evolving relationship between the young man upstairs and the woman downstairs. it's not necessarily an easy film to watch (although it's not heavy-handed by any means), so i'd warn any casual viewers who are looking for some "indie" entertainment (like tarantino or guy ritchie). but if you'd like to know something about isolation among city-dwellers in taiwan, and something more universal about city alienation and romantic yearning, then watch this film immediately.

(the description of the mood of the movie may be considered as a spoiler - because there is not much action in fact)great one...is it for my peculiar interest for the dystopias and utopias? is it for the atmosphere of the movie. or is there some more magic? if yes, it is for sure the utmost human one...this film is, no doubt, extremely artistic/artificial (depends on taste). i can imagine most of the people who hate to watch slow movies (and those of tsai ming liang (who i didn't enjoy other times) are one of the slowest that i know), suffering during the movie. yes, people are unable to slow down and to let time pass - and to watch it without feeling they waste it. one can take this piece as torture or as a therapy...the topic at the surface? the lack of communication - even if we live in rabbit cages - one next to each other - but not really together? people are tired, sick of something and unable to describe it - just don't want to meet, touch, talk, confront the others... like if they had disappeared. the big block of flats looks void and the rain falling constantly evokes the strange melancholy inside. and sometimes it must be something abnormal, unexpected, some unwanted decay as a hole in the floor of concrete - that allows us to reach each other.one of the possible ways to look at it is this: don't survey the inner world of the characters - consider the whole movie-space to be inside of yourself. and ask - why is it there? where could these depressive states and moods come form? is there a place for them, they don't have a right to be here? and search for the answers (if you need them) among the walls and halls of the block - instead of inside hardly transparent mind of a man.the key to understand is not-to-understand - to let a movie borrow us - as a subject of study - inside itself - and at the end safely return us to our more colorful and "normal" looking reality.then, maybe, you will reach - like me - the feeling of real, possible, non-pathetic hope, that in core we are still humans... and this state of mind can help one much to live in this world.

*minor spoilers*need any further proof that tsai ming-liang ranks among the most original and provocative filmmakers working anywhere today? see this film.working from slight variations of a theme running through most of his work, the hole represents a study in alienation and loneliness - in this case between a man and woman who are upstairs/downstairs neighbors - and how varied structures (real or psychological) of modernity wall people off from one another. here, the woman (the downstairs neighbor) attempts to endure as her apartment is flooded by a prodigious leak from upstairs. a plumber attempts to locate the source of the problem, then disappears after creating a large hole in the floor. already isolated and desperate (both characters are among the few residents of a housing project who haven't fled in advance of a mysterious, near-apocalyptic epidemic). the hole linking the two apartments functions first as yet another in a long line of indignities, but soon begins to take on a significance of near-mythic proportions.tsai's sense of humor, and sense of cinematic history is displayed with a bit more overtness than usual - as the woman's occasional daydreams revolving around her upstairs neighbor are visualized as musical numbers (set to the music of grace chang) which explode from the screen in brief bits of sensualistic, surreal romance and humor - quite reminiscent of the big-screen pennies from heaven. and for all of the ennui and alienation on display here, tsai's skewering of late 90s pre-millennial tensions is funny, absurd, and gives this film a very appealing strageness. the final scene is extraordinary.meanwhile tsai - in typical fashion - subverts most of the usual expectations or preconceptions westerners bring to asian cinema with a nonchalant, casually-revealed directness, focusing on both the absurdist tendencies of the human mind, and the most absolute of mundanities. there's an utter, nonchalant demystification of almost everything about his characters, sidestepping backstory or most cultural signifiers (which does amplify the isolation of the characters), making the hole - and his other films - rather disorienting, but also always fascinating and insightful.

in the final days of the year 1999, most everyone in taiwan has died. a strange plague has ravished the island. supposedly spread by cockroaches, the disease sends its victims into a psychosis where they act like the insects. eventually, they die. the hole takes place in a crumbling apartment building (which is especially well created; kudos to the set designer!). its two protagonists live right above and below each other. the woman is on the lower floor, and the pipes above her apartment are leaking fiercely, threatening to destroy her food supply, not to mention her sanity. she calls a plumber to go check it out, and he accidentally pokes a hole through the floor of the man's apartment. the two have never met before, and they come into contact through the hole.the script is quite brilliant. few films are simultaneously this funny while remaining completely human, deeply exploring the human condition, especially feelings of loneliness and despair. tsai's direction is simply beautiful. like a lot of other taiwanese directors, he uses a lot of long takes. but unlike, say, hou hsiao-hsien, tsai doesn't overuse them. in fact, i don't know if i've ever seen them used better. they're always effective and never tedious. it would be wrong to review this film without mentioning the musical numbers. yes, the hole is also a musical, and a great one, at that. in the film's best scenes - which is saying something, considering how good all the other scenes are - the man imagines that the woman is a singer, almost a cabaret singer. these numbers are fully choreographed, often with backup dancers and singers. in a stroke of genius, tsai has these elaborately produced numbers take place in the crumbling building, the signs of apocalypse and decay unhidden. this provides both a sense of pathos and absurdity.the hole is a film that begs to be seen. it ought to be a cult classic, if nothing else. before i went to see this, i was told that it was a decent film, but probably tsai ming-liang's least good one. well, if that is true, i just cannot wait to see another one! 10/10.

footprints certainly isn't your average run of the mill giallo, and that's no bad thing. unlike his previous effort, the fifth cord (which was your 'classic' giallo) luigi bazzoni's film forsakes almost all of the giallo trademarks and instead of murder; the focus is very on psychological mystery. it's obvious from the outset that this is going to be an entirely bizarre film as the film opens up with a scene set on the moon. things don't get any clearer after that as the lunar sequence turns out to be the dream of alice, a troubled woman. alice is tormented by dreams of an astronaut stranded on the moon, which have apparently come from a viewing of a film called 'footprints on the moon'. after several things go wrong for her, alice decides to go to a mostly deserted former tourist spot named garma. upon her arrival, she is surprised as the people she meets seem to already know her. alice also meets a young red headed girl who also seems to already know her; the girl tells alice she looks exactly like nicole, except nicer and with shorter hair...the fact that footprints doesn't feature much in the way of sex, murder and other giallo trademarks puts it somewhat on the back foot with it's primary audience from the beginning as most people going into this film aren't going to get what they were expecting (or, probably, wanted). but on the other hand, footprints commands respect for the fact that it doesn't just follow on from what went before it. by 1975, the giallo had started to lose it's popularity and many of the films coming out around this period (with a few very notable exceptions) were merely retreads of what came before, so luigi bazzoni would have been taking a big chance on this film. florinda bolkan gives a strong performance in the lead role; and the fact that she's not the prettiest giallo heroine isn't really important. the mystery builds nicely throughout, and while it can become a little turgid at times; footprints is, generally speaking, intriguing for the duration. it probably won't come as a surprise to many once they get there that the ending doesn't make much sense, and doesn't really clear anything up; but it nicely adds to the bizarre cult value of the film, and all in all; i give footprints a thumbs up!

ok ... the end of this may be something of a letdown after what has come before ... and klaus kinski should have had his 10 second appearance cut out ... but there is no getting away from the fact that this is a really wonderful atmospheric euro thriller ... i can't believe i have never seen this till now ... its good to know there are films out there that are still worth tracking down ... and this really is ... stunning visuals ... haunting ... and builds an amazing atmosphere ... florinda balkan is perfect as our heroine ... and the scene on the beach with nicoletta elmi is some of the most relaxed and perfect acting you could see ... lila kedrova is spot on as a fellow visitor to the town who may or may not be who she seems ... if you miss the hay days of euro cinema then chase this out ... there's a decent widescreen print going round ... and please get this out in a restored dvd someone ... they did it with the directors " fifth cord " ... and this is a much better film

footprints is a very interesting movie that is somewhat difficult to categorize. "psychological thriller" is the most appropriate description i can think of. the female protagonist, alice cespi, discovers that she doesn't remember anything of the last three days. the only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel. she is also haunted by a recurring, very vivid, dream about a science fiction movie that she believes she saw many years ago. in her pursuit of the truth behind her amnesia she doesn't trust anyone, but little by little it becomes obvious that she has visited the town where the hotel is located before. this is an exciting flick whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how the events will unfold, and particularly, how it will end. the unusual loneliness of the main character and the unreliability of everyone else ensure that the good old paranoid feeling is present throughout the film, whereas beautiful colors and some spectacularly filmed sequences make this a visually attractive movie as well. the important part of the one and only nicoletta elmi, everyone's all time favorite redheaded obnoxious child star of italian horror, is an extra bonus.

in a bizarre experiment, an astronaut is abandoned on the moon as alice (florinda bolkan), a troubled translator living in italy, wakes from a nightmare about a lunar mission mixed with an old movie that frightened her as a child. she also has no recollection of the last three days except for a torn photo of the garma hotel she finds in her apartment. fired from her job, alice heads to that resort island to try and piece together the mystery...often touted as a giallo due to it's director (the fifth cord's luigi bazzoni) and the presence of evelyn stewart, nicoletta elmi, and klaus kinski, footprints is actually a deliberately paced psycho-thriller with sci-fi overtones. blurring the distinction between dream, reality, memory and movies, the disturbing story is beautifully photographed by oscar-winner vittorio storaro with a pensive score by nicola piovani. it also combines elements of such diverse films as armando crispino's macche solari and lucino visconti's death in venice in it's depiction of alienation, isolation, hallucination, and maybe madness. brazilian actress florinda bolkan, on screen all the time, does a redux of her carol hammond in lucio fulci's a lizard in a woman's skin as alice, a young woman thrust into a mystery that makes her question her sanity. the locations mirror alice's unstable state of mind; the island of garma, off-season, with it's arabic influence and ancient ruins, is a lonely, almost mystical place unwilling to give up its secrets. evelyn stewart has a bit in the beginning as a concerned friend, nicoletta elmi and oscar-winner lila kedrova are hotel guests, peter mcenery plays a handsome biologist trying to help bolkan, and the ever-intense klaus kinski is "blackmann" in the film-within-a-film, "footprints on the moon". footprints is a classy case of "guaranteed 100% euro-weird" but not for everyone. there's only one murder toward the end but you won't see it coming as the film starts to come together.

i first heard of this one while searching the 'net for reviews of another italian giallo/horror effort, the contemporaneous the perfume of the lady in black (1974; whose r2 se dvd from raro video, by the way, i recently acquired)  where it's referenced as being in a similar vein but also just as good. having watched footsteps for myself now, i can see where that reviewer was coming from  in that both films deal with the psychological meltdown of their female protagonist. stylistically, however, this one owes far more to art-house cinema than anything else  in particular, the work of alain resnais and michelangelo antonioni (and, specifically, last year in marienbad [1961] and the passenger [1975] respectively); accordingly, some have accused it of being "deadly boring"  an epithet often attached to such 'pretentious' (read: cerebral) fare! anyway, the film involves the quest of a woman (florinda bolkan) to determine her movements in the preceding three days  of which she seems to have no recollection. following a series of cryptic clues, she travels to the 'mythical' land of garma (nearby locations, then, bear the equally fictitious names of muda and rheember)  where she encounters several people (including lila kedrova as an aristocratic regular of the resort) who ostensibly recall the heroine staying there during her 'blackout'! most prominent, though, are a young man (peter mcenery) and a little girl (nicoletta elmi, from mario bava's baron blood [1972])  the former always seems to happen on the scene at propitious moments, while the latter apparently confuses bolkan with another woman (sporting long red hair and a mean streak!).while essentially a mood piece, this is nonetheless a gripping puzzle: inevitably, vague events transpire at a deliberate pace  and where much of the film's power derives from the remarkable central performance (which can be seen as an extension of bolkan's role in the fine lucio fulci giallo a lizard in a woman's skin [1971]). however, there's no denying the contribution of cinematographer vittorio storaro (who provides any number of sweeping camera moves and an effective color scheme  adopting orange/red/blue filters to create atmosphere and coming up with a saturated look for the disorientating, bizarre finale) and nicola piovani's fitting melancholy score (the composer is best-known nowadays for his oscar-winning work on roberto benigni's holocaust-themed tragi-comedy life is beautiful [1997]).with this in mind, it's worth discussing how footsteps was presented in the version i watched: well, being apparently hard-to-get in its original form (i can't be sure whether it's uncut here or not, except to say that the film ran for 89 minutes while the imdb  lists it at 96), this edition is culled from a fairly battered english-language vhs (the dubbing is surprisingly good, given the international cast) with burnt-in swedish subtitles to boot (besides, the divx copy froze for a few seconds at a crucial point in the story around the 82-minute mark)! still, we do get a welcome bonus i.e. a 9-minute 'highlights from the soundtrack' in mp3 format.i realize i haven't yet mentioned the moon mission subplot, to which klaus kinski's presence is restricted: incidentally, around this same time, he had a similarly brief but pivotal role in another good arty thriller with sci-fi leanings (and also set in a distinctive location)  namely, lifespan (1974). as i lay watching the film, i couldn't fathom what possible connection this had with the central plotexcept that bolkan mentioned a recurring dream about a movie she had once seen, though not through to the end, called "footsteps on the moon" (a somewhat misleading alternate title for the film itself)  amusingly, she at first recalls the picture as being called blood on the moon (which, of course, is a classic 1948 western noir with robert mitchum and directed by robert wise!). that said, i took this 'diversion' in stride as merely one more outlandish touch to the film (given also bolkan's former employment as a translator at a conference discussing earth's future)  and certainly didn't expect the astronauts to turn up on garma's beach at the very end to pursue the female lead, where the sand then turns ominously into the moon's surface! the film's plot will probably make more sense on a second viewing  though, to be honest, this is best approached as a visual/aural experience and one shouldn't really expect it to deliver a narrative that's in any way clear-cut and easily rationalized! for the record, the only other bazzoni effort i'd managed to catch prior to this one was the middling straight giallo the fifth cord (1971), starring franco nero (which i had recorded off late-night italian tv); some time ago, i did get hold of his spaghetti western rendition of "carmen" titled man, pride and vengeance (1968)  also with nero and kinski  as a divx (after i'd already missed a matinée broadcast of it)but the conversion had somehow proved faulty and, consequently, the disc wouldn't play properly!

i was very impressed with with this film which was directed by (luigi bazzoni). the story was about a young woman translator who suddenly has lost all memory of the last three days and has suffered nightmares about astronauts on the moon. she can not explained how this has happened to anyone. one day a postcard arrives for her from the island of garma, where she goes to visit. strangely though people seem to know her even though she has never been there before. also her dreams of astronauts on the moon come back to her.i thought that this was a very strange italian movie that seemed very haunting at times and there was also strange images in the film that seemed to stay with you throughout the the time you were watching the film. i would recommend this film to people just to see how good it is. highly recommended!

this is the first american film i have seen at this year and i think it will be the greatest one because of the feeling . as a teenage singer in america,aaron is not as pop as before,most americans i met said his song is fake and that he even didn't know how to rap.but attention,everyone,he is a kid,how many people can understand him.being a pop fan is difficult,and being a pop star is more difficult.i think this time aaron(jd) has shows something real to us.and i think people should learn to understand each other. at another hand,i like the music in the film very much.i remember the first song appeared in the film is "saturday night" and it also include some aaron's real live show,and the second one is "one better",so i think if you enjoy this film,maybe you'll be a pop fan,too. at last,i hope you will have a great time^^ a voice from a chinese boy.

i love aaron carter but even i expected pop star to be predictable, but i was so wrong! aaron carter was really funny in it and a great actor! also the actress who played jane was a brilliant actress! every one who i no who watched it loved it!the music in it was also really good!the my favourite lines from the film is "you cant send me to a public school mom! im a celebridee!!" and "take your time, it'l come to you!"although the endings kind of cheesy,all the good chick flicks do! this film is great, and a proper good chick flick, that i can watch over and over again!

bergman's skammen is one of the most realistic depictions of war ever set to film. this is not an action film by any means, though the pacing is faster and there is most action than in most any other bergman movie. nor is this a romanticisation of war or patriotism, unlike most war movies. in fact, the gritty realism and the deliberate ambiguity of the character's loyalties has a very contemporary feel.skammen is a darkly lit movie, that should be watched at night, so as to let it work it's magic. many of the effects are conveyed indirectly, but so effectively that some scenes compete in intensity to a contemporary, insanely huge budget film like saving private ryan. of course, the action in skammen is on a much smaller scale but it is impressive none-the-less.while the film-making style feels contemporary, the setting of the film feels timeless and placeless. the war-torn countryside, and even the yet intact provincial hamlet could be anywhere, any time. and this film is not so much about specific historical events, with specific names and dates, but about universal human reactions to adversity and chaos.the acting in skammen, though typically impressive from ullman and sydow, is not of primary importance in this film, unlike most other bergman movies. through much of the film they are spectators, much as we are. bergman has the war imposed on them, and through them on the audience, and their reaction is perhaps what any of our reactions might be.highly recommended. 10/10

i don't recall a film which so deftly shows the emotional destruction of war, as mirrored in one single marital relationship. the focus of the film is the union between ullman and von sydow--the two are in every scene. through the course of the film, they experience a role reversal--one has the strength of survival and the other is reduced to emotional escapism through dreams. both will lose a measure of humanity, but one to a greater degree than the other. the characters and the viewer go through periods of fluctuation in regards to closeness--the camera pulls out and away, sound disappears, words are lost, only for the camera to return to painterly closeups of its facially expressive stars. the confusion and fluctuation may make this film hard for some viewers, but this is all purposeful under the master hand of bergman. i think the use of a "fake" war makes the film timeless, as relevant today as ever before, and by focusing on the human relationship through war, makes the film relevant to everyone. the pair could be anyone. the film is not grounded in place or time, but rather in emotion. a unique and effective war film, unlike any other. bergman's films are virtuosic in presenting human relationships--that he would bring this to a war film is masterful.

when liv ullman's character says, "i feel like i'm in someone else's dream and they're going to be ashamed when they wake up," she is referring not only to being an unwilling player in society's war games, she is referring to being an ignorant participant in life itself. at the film's end, when she says that she had a dream that she had a child and she was trying to take care of it, but she forgot something else, the implication is that she has forgotten what she has learned in the war she's just survived, that like her own mother before her, she will be unable to pass on any vital lessons to her own child. and, therefore, the cycle of the shame of ignorance will continue...ad infinitum...

how is it possible to like and dislike the same movie?the plot is very much like that jody foster thing, sommersby, only not as good. nicole was great....jude was adequate. they didn't give him many lines...is there a reason for that? generally, he's a pretty good actor. she's so elegant, his character is so country bumpkin. it makes one wonder what they see in each other.romance between two such was only successful in lady chatterly's lover.i think the dislike comes about because the movie is too long. they could have told the story in two hours.the story is good. good locations, good filming. the character actors were great.

i really enjoyed this minghella epic, thought not quite so much as "the english patient" (a modern-day classic). the first 20 minutes or so feel awkward, but as inman (jude law) embarks on the journey back to his love ava (nicole kidman), the film picks up in leaps and bounds and it becomes a very memorable, thoughtful romantic drama. apparently it is fashionable to hate kidman at the moment, but i don't agree at all, and she does well here. i actually think that the romance between inman and ada is weakly developed in the script (they really don;t get much screen time together to develop a relationship), but law and kidman give it their all and convince. ada's journey is the crux of the film- she becomes a strong woman who can bear almost anything. zellweger at first seems all wrong as ruby, but she grows on you after all and sparkles in many of her later scenes. the film has beautiful photography and set design, but never really captures the true feel of a period piece. jack white, in particular, has long straggly hair and a pale rocker's complexion that look completely out of place with the setting. cillian murphy fans will enjoying seeing the talented irish actor in an early bit part, and natalie portman actually proves she can act in probably the film's most striking sequence. it's a pity that in "the other boleyn girl" she's so inadequate.

it's initial premise is based on the american civil war but it's ultimately a love story. we start at the beginning of the war where the main characters (kidman & law) are obviously aware of each other and there's an obvious attraction, they have a passionate kiss on the day he leaves for the war. the main thrust of this film is for law's character to return to kidman's and his struggles to achieve that and her struggles to survive until he returns. the reason it fails to convince is that we don't see enough of this relationship before law's character leaves for battle - it's difficult to believe the premise that 2 people yearn for each other so much given they've had so little contact. everything else is just about fine, renee zellweger and her incumbent father and his entourage are lovely additions as is the threat from the gang chasing deserters. sure it's a long film but it does hold the interest and the cinematography is great. an honourable attempt that doesn't quite make it but worth a watch nonetheless.

it's been awhile since i've seen cold mountain,bit i do knew that i enjoyed it immensely.though it does take place during the the last days of american civil war,it's not really a war movie.it's more of a romance/drama.and it works.mainly because of the performances.usually i don't like nicole kidman,but i liked here.i thought she was very convincing in her role.i liked rene zelwegger,as well,who i'm not usually a fan of.jude law is good as usual.the supporting cast.there are some great supporting performances her,too numerous too mention.there's also some breathtaking scenery in the film.and there are also a number of very nice musical pieces as well.the story is sad and tinged with tragedy but it s a beautifully done well told story.for me,cold mountain is an 8/10

watching "cold mountain" gave me the impression that its director, anthony minghella, was deliberately trying to outdo himself and the own film of his' that he was trying to beat was the virtually impeccable "the english patient" from 1996. comparing the two movies, the premise is quite similar. we have a passionate love affair between two people set in a turbulent time of war and they end up treating the war more or less as a disturbance in the background while trying to find themselves back in each other's arms again. the primary plot differences are that nicole kidman's character is not married, jude law's is a deserter, and the conflict is the american civil war."cold mountain" is, story-wise, more watered down and mellow than say "the english patient" and it's more on the level for people who want a simple love story with some kind of an exterior turbulence causing a problem. it is a shorter film, which is a plus for people with less patience. however, it's not as spectacular or original or genuinely gripping as "the english patient." my *only* big complaint about "cold mountain" is, astonishingly, the love affair between the characters of inman (jude law) and ada monroe (nicole kidman). amazingly, their love was the least interesting thing in the picture. they don't have a real relationship; we don't feel any real passion coming from them and the passion that we do see is more physical than emotional. i was more fascinated by the friendship between nicole kidman and oscar-winner renee zellwegger and also jude law's travels across country dodging vigilantes and enemy soldiers. if minghella had strengthened the importance of the love story, then he would have had, i feel, a better picture.of course, the movie is entertaining even if the love story is uninteresting. the civil war sequences are absolutely great; they are of the modern tradition that show war as horrible and dehumanizing. the re-enactment of the petersburg campaign, in which tons of explosives was detonated from underground and then followed by a hand-to-hand battle is horrifying. minghella does not shy from showing blood and gore in an artistic and sensible manner, and he's not afraid to show casualties of innocence and life in these scenes. there are moments where women as well as men are killed, oftentimes by crossfire. and there's more to it. just the sound design of the movie generates tension. there's a scene where inman and another deserter make themselves a meal by sawing off the head of a dead cow. we don't see the slicing, but the sound effects of blade going through bone are sickening.lastly, i must congratulate the cast for the performances. jude law was terrific in the movie and deserved the academy award nomination he received. i feel that nicole kidman deserved one as well, even though her character was a bit shallow. renee zellwegger had the most personality and screen-stealing atmosphere. and then there's just the bit parts that also really work to complete this stylistic world recreating a horrible time in america's past.maybe "cold mountain" would have been better as a war picture, but it most certainly would have been spectacular like "the english patient" if its love story had been powered up and made more passionate by the screenwriters and director anthony minghella. as it is, it's a most enjoyable picture, i wasn't bored by it, and i recommend it. i just say that its love story - though a central plot point - is a little more mellow than it needs to be and all the stuff around it was what really worked.

"how can a name, not even a real name, break your heart?" here's how. there have been few film versions of a celebrated novel that have done better justice to their source material than anthony minghella's movie of charles frazier's cold mountain. if you've read the book you will be able to feel most of the major scenes soul shakingly recreated. i personally cried numerous times while reading the novel and spent much of the evening watching the film through tears. astounding scope, beautiful words, great acting and great music. in the interview on the dvd accompanying the film minghella talks about the multiple layers of the story. all of them work. one of the best films i've seen and an invitation to one of the greatest novels of the last ten years.

i went into this film thinking i wasn't going to like it, but hoping to be surprised, but this, much like the film, ended up being bleak and hopeless. but don't get me wrong, minghella delivers every bit of a grand epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what comes as just that, then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of the better films of the year in their opinion. the acting is of a high quality and will most likely come away with a trinity of oscar noms for law, kidman and zellweger, even though portman's few scenes may be the most powerful in the film. the locations are beautiful and minghella has an eye for a good shot.however, for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going willingly may come away disappointed mainly due to minghella and his adaptation. the film is so utterly bleak it makes for what i consider to be a punching bag epic which is a film that that tries to hit hard with emotion but does so to such an extreme and so often that during the film i didn't have the time to emotionally invest, or hadn't recovered from a previous blow, and it became unrealistic and consequently too difficult to really care, not to mention predictable. overall the "cold mountain" almost left me too drained to even think back on the good aspects of the film, as all i remember is death, which may have been an original motif but ends up being the focus instead of the characters.

i watched cold mountain and the english patient again this weekend. the former is a civil war melodrama about inman (jude law), a confederate soldier who deserts the army to return to ada monroe (nicole kidman) a girl he barely knows. both films were lovingly directed by anthony minghella who does an exceptional job. although, cold mountain is very good it could have been a great movie with the right casting and less folksy, backwoods dialog.romantic epics need a convincing heroine. the english patient, had kristin scott thomas who was perfectly cast as the smart, alluring and beautiful katherine clifton. the main problem with cold mountain is ada who seems silly and dim-witted and lacks that quality would make you believe that inman could become obsessed after one kiss. as an actress kidman has a limited range, she usually plays stern-faced women who face adversity with stoicism. kidman was also too old to play the ingénue and law's love interest. the film needed a young actress who could play charming, warm and vulnerable. for someone who was supposedly enduring hardship and near starvation she seemed ridiculously well-fed and over-dressed. kidman was so impeccably groomed that it looked like she had spent three hours getting made-up for each scene. michele pfieffer in her younger days could have played the part perfectly. even natalie portman would have been an improvement.renee zelleweger was more appropriately attired but her animated performance chewed the scenery but maybe she was trying to compensate for kidman. jude law was in his own silent movie in the odysseus role, but played his part well. ray winstone was excellent as the london/southern villain.during the civil war, people were probably not very well educated by today's standards and maybe they did speak in monosyllables. however if you watch bbc adaptations of dickens, austen or mrs. gaskill everyone is articulate. maybe this is unrealistic but it would improved my entertainment.

i just saw the dvd and loved it. in particular, i thought the director and jude and nicole did an amazing job with the kiss between inman and ada just before inman left. it was the most romantic kiss i've ever seen in a film. i thought it was crucial for setting the tone for the rest of the movie; it managed to make it believable that inman and ada would walk/wait, respectively, for each other for all that time without ever really having had a relationship. i thought the film managed this crucial plot point much better than the book itself. i'm sure many of you will be quick to name other film kisses which best this one, but this one is it for me! jude and nicole had showed incredible chemistry in the far too few scenes they had together.

well, i expected, for all the hype and oscar nominations, an epic civil war drama (& something with the "magnitude" of the "english patient" given the same director). this film isn't of epic stature, but it turns out i was relieved it wasn't. it's a love story in the midst of the horrors of war where young men are sent off to fight, deserters are tracked and killed, and the women and children at home are left to fend for themselves while the men are gone.anyway i thought nicole kidman and rene zelleweger were pretty decent and not knowing much about jude law, he was all right, also. it seems rene z. had the more fun part of the 3 leads and was able to smartly play a spirited, feisty downhome woman with much aplomb. also for me it was good to see actress, kathy baker...someone's who's talent needs to be more recognized/acknowledged.this film is worth seeing this -- i'm can't articulate why really, but maybe because it is a slice of americana. 

this movie worked for me because i see this movie as an exact opposite of 'gone with the wind.' farm owners instead of plantation owners. scarlett fights and connives for what she wants; ada gets depressed and turns inside herself until ruby, (renee zellweger,) shows up to save the day. sort of, in a round about way. deserters instead of officers trying to get back to their families, the lists goes on and on. even the love story was opposite. if this is what the producer and writers were trying to get across it succeeded with me. there are only two things i didn't like about the movie, the rest i thought was well done and i liked it enough to recommend it to friends. first, i couldn't see the attraction between inman, (jude law), and ada, (nicole kidman,) as being strong enough for inman to desert to get back to her. inman said he only had written to her a few times where ada wrote to him almost constantly. second, something or someone getting killed or dying in almost every scene was a little much. i must say it was full of action because of that, but after about the second scene i knew something or someone was going to die in the next scene. i like to be surprised by the next scene, not know what is going to happen before it does.i thought all the acting was very well done, with zellweger the best. she deserved the credit she got for it. i thought she played the part of the hillbilly girl very well. she must have done her homework on the part. zellweger even said in the movie that she was smarter than people thought she was. i think that was true. law did well with his part with all he had to go through to get back to kidman. it must have been a lot stronger love to go through all that than i thought it was. now he showed a lot of emotion in his face during his trials. kidman's part may have had something to do with the fact i chose her performance after the other two. except when she was depressed she didn't show much emotion, i don't know if that is how the part was written or if that is how she perceived the part. she still did a good job, i just thought the other two were better. i liked the scene with the zellweger, kidman and the rooster, even though it was one of those scenes i mentioned above. i thought the 'home guard' was exactly as they probably were back then. even though we don't hear much about them they were a part of that time. i thought the scenery was beautiful. the movie had everything needed to be a good historical romance.

i have not managed to completely block out this film from memory even though it has been two years since i've seen it.don't get me wrong - i have long forgotten the main story line - the relationship between kidman and law, that made no impression on me but it was the torture scenes in the film that really struck me. i cried for about two hours straight after wards. it had never previously occurred to me how people, in war time, could take advantage of something as pure as a mother's love. we see several examples of this here - in both the scenes with natalie portman and with the mother with her fingers in the fence for keeping her son hidden at home. i was shocked at these scenes and will probably never watch the film again as a consequence because the scenes even now are perfectly clear in my mind. however, i am glad i watched the film simply because it has made me more aware to the horrors of war and the horrible cruelty that mankind can inflict on it's own. the blonde albino character has been top of my list of most evil bad guy ever since i saw the film. his horrible sneer and lack of any human feeling for the people he tortured really hit a nerve with me. at one point i wanted to get up in the cinema and kill him myself (see the movie pushed me over the edge of reason,it only occurred to me afterward that i'd only be hitting a big screen - that shows the film's power and intensity at least). i recommend the film for it's sheer experience not for the entwined love story but for the manner in which it depicts war without needing a battlefield.

in cold mountain, north colorado, near to the period of the american civil war, the reverend monroe (donald sutherland) arrives in the small town with his daughter, the shy ada monroe (nicole kidman), due to health reasons. ada meets the also shy inman (jude law), and they fall in love with each other. with the beginning of the war, inman becomes a soldier, and his great support to stay alive is the wish to see ada in cold mountain again. meanwhile, ada meets ruby thewes (renée zellweger), a survivor of the war, who helps her in the farm and becomes her best friend. the story alternates present and past situations, disclosing a beautiful romance. i liked this film a lot. having names such as philip seymour hoffman, natalie portman and giovanni ribisi in the supporting cast, a magnificent direction of anthony minghella and seven indications to the oscar, this movie does not disappoint. my remark is that there are some very important scenes deleted in the story and presented in the dvd. at least one of them, which show what happens with sara, her baby and the three dead bodies in her farm, should not be deleted as it was. my vote is nine.title (brazil): 'cold mountain'

anthony minghela's (writer/director) cold mountain is a carefully constructed, sensitive, and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederacy during the civil war, which deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner. while it accurately depicts the brutality and inhumanity of that war, it also does something that many films related to this period to not handle as effectively - cold mountain studies the southern context from the inside out, and portrays changes among the non-slave owning common people wrought by the war. and, almost uniquely, cold mountain does not over-generalize southerners, northerners or anybody else.the film surfs through genres as needed - never presenting a dull moment. it is a romance, a war story, an action-adventure and historical fiction, all nicely woven into one.the story centers on inman (jude law) and ada monroe (nicole kidman), who are smitten with each other for very simple reasons. as this young romance begins to bud, inman enlists in the confederate army, taking with him a book ada has given him and a photograph of her. ada's character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third person perspective, but the story is clearly hers from the beginning to the end. ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister. she begins the film as a daddy's girl skilled in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives were expected to learn. in other words, as she admits to ruby thewes (renee zellweger), she is a master of everything useless.ada's father passes on, and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself. with no experience of this sort, she struggles, and survives by holding the memory of inman close to her heart. ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father. ruby has all the skills and abilities ada lacks, and as they become inseparable business partners, they grow to love one another as best friends. inman's experience is radically different, but something of a mirror image. during his participation in the war, he sees many friends killed for causes they don't really believe in, and decides to desert. nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to cold mountain and ada, and most of those he meets die.the bulk of the film takes place during inman's long walk, following both of the protagonists as they live, learn, grow and change. an on-going act of will borne of desperation preserves their intense passionate love. for inman, it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation. for ada, it is very much the same thing, but also a symbol and remnant of the old south - a world which is rapidly passing.the cinematography is powerful and breathtaking. there are beautiful shots of appalachian landscapes which give the film a strong sense of history. the script and editing are also extremely strong - emphasizing the broad class and educational differences reflected in the ante bellum southern dialects of the middle and lower classes. with the cast of this film, nothing short of perfection should be expected. and the cast, mostly, rises to the occasion. my one criticism, however, relates to the accents adopted by kidman and law's characters. an australian and a brit probably should not be expected to accurately reproduce southern american speech, but there are a few occasions where these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting vocal slips. i admit my oversensitivity to this, and can say with some confidence that it won't bother most people. zellweger's performance is outstanding and she creates a character i will remember into my senescence.very highly recommended.

this movie moved me more than i was expecting, and i was fully prepared to cry. the acting mainly carried this film, with superb performances from jude law, nicole kidman and renee zellweger, as well as the supporting cast. these actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they lingered the remainder of the night with me, and i had trouble shaking this war drama. the costumes and cinematography were also magical, but didn't get carried away with themselves. they didn't take focus, but added to the whole effect. cold mountain could never become my favorite movie, as that title will always belong to the english patient, but it's in the top five. the story itself was well developed, and stayed fairly unpredictable. i did not find myself guessing what line came next. a heart-wrenching story about humanity and war. in fact, this movie was so strongly real that it was barely noticeable it took place in the 19th century. it seemed to apply to all times.

the first time i saw this film i was a kid. i was ten years old when it was released but since my family never went to movie theaters i saw it on network tv. i remember watching it aloneand crying afterward. it was only the second film to illicit that response (rocky was the first) and there haven't been many since. i can't say why exactly; larry "rain" murphy didn't deserve to win any more that rocky balboa or anyone else. i know i admired murphy, not so much for what he did, but for the way he did his time. stoic. he didn't need a stopwatch or freedom to find dignity. he ran because he could. he needed no other reason. i have a rule today, that when i see this film late at night on cable television (the only time most will come across it) i must watch, no matter what i have to do the next morning. fortunately it doesn't play often like shawshank redemption or other favorites, so i still get plenty of sleep and i never tire of the story of one man's unrepentant imprisonment and personal victory.

a film that deserved theatrical release. this made-for-television movie is a cinematic gem that exemplifies the technique of michael mann with stirring contemporary music tightly integrated to the visual images. always with mr. mann, the amplification of impact by the music is almost as if there is an invisible academy-award-winning actor added to the ensemble of cast, writer, director and cinematographer.this film is definitely one of my all time favorites. while nothing is perfect, this film comes very, very close.along with an excellent script, great direction and masterful acting by richard strauss, there is an all-star ensemble of character actors at their finest: roger mosely; brian dennehy; ed lauter; geoffrey lewis; richard moll; miguel pinero; william prince; burton guilliam; ji-tu cumbuka; richard lawson and billy green bush. you may not recognize the names, but you will recognize every face.if this comes on tv, sit down with popcorn, turn up the sound for an amazing soundtrack and score, and prepare to be riveted for the 97 minutes of the film. i highly recommend recording it, since it is only available on vhs and dvd from holland and the dvd is region 2 encoded.

i love watching the jericho mile. i mean watching peter strauss run the mile is like watching usain bolt sprint the 100 meter. i think peter strauss is a excellent actor and should do another running movie. he is lightning fast has great energy and can run a mile in under 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing. no man alive can out race rain murphy i mean the man runs 80 mile a week no one does that but him. i've watched the jericho mile 100's of times and will watch it 100's more. great movies get watched more than movies that are not. i thank the makers of this film for giving years of there lives to make it.they are great people and i bless them all.thank you for letting me get my word out again thank you all.

all-monster congregation in the final film in universal's renowned cycle of classic horror stories. count dracula (an intense, dapper john carradine), calling himself baron latos, comes to dr. edelmann (onslow stevens) asking to be cured of his affliction. naturally, this is just a ruse. then, coincidentally, larry talbot (lon chaney), a.k.a. "the wolf man", shows up and of course he *really* wants to be cured.as others have noted, the monsters don't get equal screen time. the frankenstein monster (glenn strange) gets thrown in at the end just for the purpose of including all of the universal monsters. stock footage and library music are re-used here as well. the film spends maybe a little too much time with the dracula part of the story, although carradine gives an impressive, non-hammy performance in the role of the count. the film is mainly a showcase for stevens, who goes through a tragic character arc of his own, and does an excellent job. the women are gorgeous, and i have to say that i loved jane adams as the luminous nurse - who happens to be hunchbacked.of course, it wouldn't be complete without the inclusion of angry villagers.competently, professionally made chiller is, just for my tastes, not really scary at all, but entertaining regardless. it's a respectable series entry overall.7/10

a year after the release of the average "house of frankenstein", universal released another monster mash where all their famous character would collide once again. "house of dracula" would reunite dracula, the frankenstein's creature and the wolf man for what would be their final battle and will finally close an era for the studio. directed once again by erle c. kenton, "house of dracula" presents a slight but noticeable improvement over the previous film and delivers a better constructed (although still flawed) story that while far from perfect, is a more appropriate closure than the previous film.the story ignores most of the events of the previous entry, "house of frankenstein", and introduces a new angle to the story. count dracula (john carradine), tired of having to hide during sunlight, asks help to the brilliant scientist, dr. edelman (onslow stevens), a physician famous for his research in biology. edelman becomes fascinated by dracula, and soon begins an experimental treatment, in the mean time, larry talbot (lon chaney jr.), the wolf man, visits edelman with the purpose of get rid of his curse. soon edelman realizes that dracula is a monster that must be destroyed, but his own exposure to dracula's blood is also developing a disease in him. the discovery of the frankenstein's monster (glenn strange) in a nearby catacombs will bring more turmoil to the mind of the brilliant scientist.after the previous clash of monsters, it is good to see the series going back to the roots and delivering an almost straight-forward gothic horror returning to the dark pessimistic nature of this kind of films and moving away from the comic relief of the previous entries. the story (by edward t. lowe jr.), has many interesting themes, as the contrast between dracula and talbot (both looking for a cure, but with different purposes) and edelman's increasing madness. probably among the most interesting themes is the inclusion of the character of nina, a gorgeous but deformed woman who aids dr. edelman hoping to be cured of her condition.director erle c. kenton is back again and this time he finally captures the dark nature of these three characters, a nature that was apparently lost in the previous film. despite the low-budget, kenton crafts a gothic horror that while simple, is quite effective, and even manages to present old partners such a these characters in a fresh way. while it's never on the level of the originals, "house of dracula" recovers that charm that universal studios horror films used to have, and kenton makes sure that at least for a last time the monsters receive a chance to shine.the cast is very good this time, with carradine, chaney and strange reprising their roles (although strange's role is considerably smaller) with more enthusiasm than in the previous film. the addition of onslow stevens, jane adams and martha o'driscoll to the cast bring back the tragedy and the drama to the series, with stevens giving a terrific performance as dr. edelman. a small cameo by lionel atwill and the presence of skelton knaggs as the creepy steinmuhl complete one of the better cast universal horror films has had in years."house of dracula" is a nice addition to the series, specially after the mediocre "house of frankenstein". it's nice to see kenton back in form in a somewhat serious horror film, however, and while the plot is quite original, it suffers not only because of the budget, but because the film attempts to do a lot in a very short runtime with bad results. it's true that the characters have all very inventive story lines, but the film dedicates very few time for each of them to develop, and the film seems very rushed and disjointed.while far from perfect, it's also far from being the worst of the series. "house of dracula" is a nice closure to one of the best times for the horror genre, a time when ghosts and ghouls roamed the foggy nights, and mad scientists gave life to hideous monsters. later the monsters would be back in "bud abbott & lou costello meet frankenstein" (1948), but that would be a whole different context. after the disappointing previous entries, it's easy to dismiss "house of dracula", but give it a chance, and let the monster roam for a last time. 7/10

coming at the end of the cycle of the universal monsters horror films, and before the golden age of sci-fi films, house of dracula is more science fiction than horror and incorporates some of the more cheesy {read:enjoyable} elements which would come to typify the sci-fi films of the coming era. lon chaney jr. plays the wolf man, and john carradine, dracula and glenn strange, the frankenstein monster.a mad scientist sets out to "cure" both monsters of their "sicknesses" by means of modern {read:mad} science. when the scientist's beautiful nurse-assistant is revealed to be a hunchback early in the film, the viewer is thereby alerted to the fact this film is not going to be typical universal fare; this film foreshadows the kind of sleazy exploitation we would come to take for granted in 1950's sci-fi.if you don't mind the slower pacing of the older films and black & white does not throw you off, this film is recommended viewing. afaik, this one is not currently available on dvd, but amc airs it occasionally, so keep a lookout, or you could always wishlist it on your tivo!

this is quite an entertaining b-flick in the universal horror series featuring dracula, the wolfman, and frankenstein's monster. the plot revolves around dracula (john carradine) and larry talbot, the wolfman (lon chaney jr.), separately visiting a revolutionary doctor. they both ask him if they can be cured, and the doctor attempts to devise a way for each. beneath the doctor's castle, they find frankenstein's monster buried in mud (this is apparently a reference to the previous movie in the frankenstein series). of course, if things had went as planned, the movie would have turned out incredibly boring. instead, dracula can't suppress his appetite, and the doctor is eventually infected, by a blood transfusion, with vampirism. as a semi-vampire, the doctor goes insane and awakens frankenstein's monster. as with all of the universal horror series, the ending is completely unsatisfactory. a beautiful woman with a hunchback, one of the doctor's two assistants, has a particularly gruesome end. plus, you just have to feel sorry for frankenstein's monster in this film - he's awake for around two minutes, kills one police officer, and then yet another building (what's this, the fifth now?) collapses on top of him and is consumed by flames. it is also unfortunate that the great character created in the wolf man (1941), larry talbot, is really reduced here. people underrate that film and chaney's performance in it. here, he would be justifiably criticized as wooden. all in all, though, it's a pretty fun movie at just 68 minutes. a nice waste of time. 7/10.

this is another universal fun filled fright fest.many people want to compare it to house of frankenstein.even though it has similar cast and the same director it can stand on its own.(it does appear that erle c kenton directed most of the universal horror films of the 40's).the plot recap:baron latos appears at the home of dr eidlemann seeking a "cure" for his vampirism.larry talbot (who somehow survived house of frankenstein) also shows up at the good doctors door seeking a cure for his affliction.after a failed suicide attempt talbot and the doctor find the frankenstein monster. to complicate matters just before he bites the dust, dracula infects the good doctor with his blood.the doctor becomes a bloodthirsty maniac at certain times.where this leads to is something you'll have to see for your self.carradine actually gives a very good performance as dracula. he isn't chewing up the scenery as he will in later roles. it is hard to repress giggles when he appears in a top hat though.the cape/cloak is traditional but the hat has to go. where does the hat go when he changes into a bat...?onslow stevens gives an excellent portrayal of the doctor. he's torn between his basic kindness and the increasing blood lust he is now prone to. this is a very underrated performance.chaney brings even more life to the wolf man in his 4th appearance in that role.the monster isn't given much to do this time.just lay on the table until the end(some stock footage from the ghost of frankenstein is used).at least in house of frankenstein he was up and around a bit.yes this does stick to the basic universal pattern complete with the angry village mob running amok with torches.but it isn't a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes.it gets a low 8.

this moody, creepy horror flick begins on a castle atop a cliff overlooking the sea, a great setting, as a vampire bat flies in and creeps toward a sleeping doctor (onslow stevens). the bat changes into a man known as baron latos, in reality count dracula (john carradine). he seeks dr. edelmann's help to cure him of his vampirism. eventually the good doctor also wants to help his hunchbacked nurse-assistant (jane adams), the wolf man (lon chaney), and frankenstein's monster (glenn strange). but dracula's trickery contaminates the doctor's blood, and he becomes a jekyll/hyde vampire himself. this is somewhat better than the prior year's "house of frankenstein", being less episodic and more exciting visually. there's a haunting scene where dracula tries to lure the second nurse (martha o'driscoll) into his world, where she is initially playing "moonlight sonata" on the piano, which soon gives way to terrifying music. director erle kenton uses expressionistic shadows and eerie music to frame many sequences, including a wonderful montage sequence that the studio frequently used in their horror features. two performers are of note: stevens, with his wonderful voice, is at first sympathetic, then convincingly menacing. adams, her beautiful face in alarming contrast to her twisted body, exhibits great pathos and sympathy. it all ends in a slam-bang climax, typical of 1940s universal horror, a little abrupt, with footage borrowed from "the ghost of frankenstein" (1942). i hope universal releases it soon on dvd (it was left out of their double-feature releases).

house of dracula works from the same basic premise as house of frankenstein from the year before; namely that universal's three most famous monsters; dracula, frankenstein's monster and the wolf man are appearing in the movie together. naturally, the film is rather messy therefore, but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that the film's sixty seven minutes don't become boring. it's obvious that the idea of making another monster mash came into the writer's head before an actual plot did, as the yarn we're given isn't exactly without holes. the plot sees count dracula arrive at dr. edelman's home asking for a cure for his vampirism. then, what can only be described as a coincidence, sees lawrence talbot, a.k.a. the wolf man turn up asking for a cure for his affliction! it turns out that dracula is on the prowl for edelman's daughter, but talbot really is serious. when it turns out that he can't be stopped from turning into a wolf, the wolf man throws himself into the sea...where he ends up finding frankenstein's monster.overall, this film isn't as good as the earlier house of frankenstein. the 1944 film put its plot together better than this entry in the series does, as the plot here doesn't give equal time to each universal monster. dracula's plot is the biggest at first, but soon fizzles out only to resurface at the end. the wolf man is the star of the show, but his story never really develops, and is essentially just another version of the plot he always finds himself in. frankenstein's monster is given the coldest hand, as he appears in the movie merely as an afterthought, and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie. the story of the doctor who binds all three together is the most interesting, but this is a little disappointing as he isn't the reason why people will see this film. the acting is good enough, with john carradine showing his sinister side and lon chaney jr once again making sure that his character is bathed in tragedy. glenn strange is given nothing to do, and onslow stevens proves the real highlight as dr edelman. overall, this film won't do much for anyone that isn't a fan of universal horror; but as silly monster movies go, house of dracula is worth seeing.

my sister, dad, and i are really into d&d and one night we were browsing netflix looking for a movie to watch when this one came up. we thought we would try it out and i ended up almost dying from laughter. the writing and acting in this movie is so amazing! witty characters, great interaction, and hilarious moments kept us in stitches the entire time. i love this movie! it might not make that much sense for those who don't know about dungeons & dragons, but nevertheless, it is a good movie. this only goes to show that movies don't need an astronomical budget and big name actors/actresses to be a success. check it out if you want a good, clean comedy.

i don't play video games at all but my children do.i got a big kick out of this. would like to see more of this type of film. "very cool" as my youngest would say.interesting characters and the overall story line was interesting. like i said i don't play video games but i think that my children would enjoyed this. it was not full of bad language and that is a pleasant change. this visual concept was different which caught my eye. plus the sound track was pretty good. i might even try out some of the games my sons plays to see because of this film. who knows maybe i'll be a gamer someday.

i am so impressed, really. i expected cheesy gamer humor and nothing else.ok, there's a ton of pretty geeky humor. but the movie is so well done. the acting is quite good.the dialog, while gamer cheesy at times, i guess to cater to the gamer crowd, is not bad at all. at times it's even, dare i say, great.when the female gamer, who built this non traditional fighter type character rather then the usual (min/max) type gets all these additional attacks (seem right, i did not check the rules,) it was cool.the sets are amazing for what must be a fairly low production movie.the story moves right along. the transitions from game world to real world are well done. a male playing a female character would sometimes be played by a female, and sometimes by himself. pretty clever, i thought.the guy who decided to play a female, but kept forgetting he was female was good for a lot of laughs. he even said tag at one point, and the female walked on to play the role ( sorry, i did not look her name up, she did great though.) the guy always trying to "get some", got a bit tedious, but i guess that was more gamer humor.there was just so much to like about the movie. lighthearted. fun! very well done and i am saying that as a movie fan, not a gamer (and i am not a d&d player.) as i said i expected so much less.movies often don't hold my attention, i end up listening to them while working on my computer. this one held my attention. i can't give a movie much higher praise.

there are few films that deal with things that i would consider myself an expert on, this one is.after some years of fantasy role playing we split, me not leaving without a sense of shame of what i had become: a dork.you see, these things are really canonical, it happens to everybody.first you create a character fairly and it dies after the first attack.then you help a little with the constitution, and while you're at it, why not help with strength, intelligence, intuition, charisma and dexterity too? this in turn frustrates the game master who doesn't know how to deal with this invincible gang. and after a while it bores the players too, so they start to create ever more exotic race-profession combinations, no matter how ludicrous it is.i created a druedain warrior monk, yeah, not that far from the film.and that's not all to be said about the destructiveness of the inherent dynamic of this devilish game (think the hunt for experience points), but just watch the film, it shows it all - and of course the stupidity of its most basic premisses.for this end, in turn, there is no better profession than the bard. i don't exactly understand why the bard became a character in the first place, after all, the blacksmith is none. but once it became one, it had to be mapped into the game flow, that is: it had to be made lethal, at least indirectly. the poking of fun out of this never comes to an end and rightfully so.sure, it's not exactly a professional production, but i haven't seen a better satire in ages.

gamers: dr is not a fancy made movie, it's more like amateur video. horrible magic effect, really fake fireball, terribly made dungeon, castle, village...... sword, axe, shield, robe, plate..... okok... everything. you will need about 10 minutes to adjust your expecting on visual, then you will get 105 minutes of fun.i'm from hongkong and it's really hard to find rpers, none of my friends play rpg and i always fancy to be one of the character in the world of d&d. watching gamers: dr just show me what would it be like to be a gamer. you see rule books, dices, game set, etc etc etc; you hear terms like "fighter", "wizard", "hit point", "level", "character", "flaming hand", "chaotic evil".what rpg fancy me is that it let you do anything u want to, not bonded by software rpg. gamers: dr provide the same element, you wont know what happen next and it probably just make you laugh to dead. the movie goes both gamers's real life as well as in the d&d world. you will hear the gamer cast the dice when the character in game take action, which make you feel you really participle in the game.i don't want to spoil anything, but in short, gamers: dr is a must watch movie for rpg lovers. for people never play rpg game, i'm sure you still get many fun from it.

this movie brilliantly captures the atmosphere of a d&d group. while watching, i could not help but notice how vividly characters reminded me of myself and my gaming friends to the point where they acted literally the same as we do. including the bickering, the fighting, the internal jokes, driving the dm crazy. everything.it has it all. jokes that made me cry, action scenes which, even filmed in low-budget, i found uncannily awesome. the story is pretty straightforward and unsurprising, but that doesn't really matter, since the best part of the movie is to see the characters react and interact with each other and the npcs.seriously, if you're playing d&d or any similar rpg, i cannot stress this enough, watch this movie, it captured beautifully the spirit of d&d.

being a retired medical/health field "toiler in the vinyard" i never get tired of seeing this film. paddy chayefsky was a friend of my college comp teacher & visited him & us during several clases back in 1958. his writing ability has stood the test of time & the "hospital" is as fresh as it was in 1971. i can watch it every week & still find something new. so many of the supporting cast members went unto bigger & better roles in both tv & film. george scott made only a few comedies, but his timing & patter are as good as jackie gleason & steve msrtin. mental humour rather than physcial/slapstick wins in my book every time. and still a family film with only 1, four letter word during entire film

plot spoilers!!!! dr. boch (george c. scott) is the chief of medicine at a major nyc hospital. he's left his wife, his children have disowned him, he's impotent, drinks a lot and contemplates suicide. also there's a killer roaming the hospital. then he meets very strange barbara (diana rigg) and falls in love. she wants him to run away with her--but can he completely give up on his old life and start a new one?very strange movie with an oscar winning script by paddy chayefsky. it presents a suicidal main character and shows us a hospital full of overworked nurses and doctors that is run incompetently. it manages (somehow) to actually make this seem pretty funny. it's not laugh out loud humor--it's very black humor. also the acting is right on target--scott is just great (and oscar nominated) here. you see him trying to keep his sanity in a totally crazy situation. riggs character is more than a little odd but her matter of fact manner works and she's also incredibly beautiful. the script is strong and brutal--but never too much. i think it fumbles the ball at the end with a situation that goes way too over the top--but it's still worth seeing. if this had been done totally seriously it probably would be impossible to take. also look for katherine helmond in a small bit and stockard channing and christopher guest in uncredited bits. i personally had trouble taking this seriously. from what i've heard hospitals were this bad back in the 1970s but not anymore. see it for the acting and script. i give it a 7.

dr. bock teaches at the hospital and he is quite good at it. the thing about him is that he is depressed. dr. bock and his wife separated, his children are deviant, he cannot perform in the bedroom and he feels as if he isn't doing a very good job at healing people. he becomes suicidal but meets barbara who changes his ideas for the better. all around this story is a murder mystery and a group of angry protesters outside.the movie is well done and the character of dr. bock is well played out. it's a little sad, somewhat funny and somewhat of a drama. it was good to see a couple stories wrapped around the hospital even if they were somewhat unrelated to what dr. bock was doing. great movie.

i am still waiting for years a new dvd issue of this marvelous film. i own a beta max recording with french language. unfortunately, mgm omits the french track on his recent dvd... just english spoken an french subtitles...i don't know how make mgm to be advised: i wrote emails to them but, of course, no answer. if i insist, it's because exceptionally, the dubbing track in french was spectacular, funny, well written etc... george c. scott acting is always outstanding and, for people born like me during the 50ies, diana rigg represents something very different than madonna (for example). thanks for help... kind regards...

this movie is george c. scott at his very best, bernard hughes at his very best and diana rigg at her most pithy, and of course paddy chaevsky writing at "masterpiece" warp! there are also very brief snippets of future biggies like susan sarandon, stockard channing etc., who have one scene lines that you don't necessarily spot until your fifth or sixth time watching. nancy marchand as a young to middle age nurse supervisor is also superb, as well as practically every "face" in hollywood of 1970.it is one of the few movies that gets better the more times you see it. watch for the "surprise" scene ala "wait until dark"! this is one of the few movies i have ever bought on dvd. it is that superb.

the hospital is a movie that was made ahead of its time. this film, produced by screenwriter paddy chayefsky, who gave us the oscar-winning film, "network", deals with overworked staff, gross incompetence, and bureaucratic corruption at a large conglomerate hospital in manhattan. george c. scott, in a superb performance as the head physician, is driven to alcoholism and a death-wish, as he tries to recover from a divorce, throwing his son out of the house, and worst of all, a medical facility where corruption and incompetence take precedence over caring and healing of the sick and injured.mr. scott makes the movie his own, and viewers will be shocked at what they observe at this medical establishment. you can feel the "pain" (pun intended) of what this hospital has done to him. the vivid images of this hospital's incompetence are so vivid and dramatically powerful that you may find yourself laughing and being deeply disturbed from scene to scene.if only the film had stayed with that premise in a documentary style fashion as it starts out, this picture would be brilliant. unfortunately, there is a sub-plot of scott falling for the daughter of a senile patient. the patient has been murdering people at the hospital. this is where credibility of the picture becomes strained. the romantic dialog scenes add nothing to the picture, and the mental patient, posing as a doctor, i found to be totally unbelievable. a simple security call and records check should have prevented the senile patient from doing the killings. it takes almost the whole movie, before security people are brought into the film to get the patient out of the hospital. i could not see one person doing that much damage, even as corrupt as this hospital is.furthermore, george c scott's character is "overworked" (another pun intended) because the script has too many things happening at once. for example, within a period of 20 minutes, you could have as many as 20 different doctors accused and denying what they should have done or didn't do. with the nurses and aids, it's the same story. someone's chart was read wrong, someone was given the wrong medication and died, the doctor operated on the wrong patient, than another doctor does the same thing, blaming a third nurse who was not on call because the second nurse who was supposed to be admitting the patient was on her coffee break. there is also a lot of subtle, dark humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption being fed to the viewer.this repetition of medical ineptness is unforgettable. however, the murder subplot is a distraction more than a help to this movie. when the focus of this film is on the incompetence of the staff and scott's reactions to this, you are glued to the screen. but the conversations between scott and the mad patient's daughter force the film into a mystery type "who done it?" scenario that seriously hurts the quality of the movie. when the loony patient is revealing how he did the killings, i wondered the following: why did the producers need the "find the killer" mad-patient sub-plot? i think the only point of scott's character having a relationship with the senile patient's daughter, was to give him anybody with whom to communicate. the hospital should have maintained its scathing indictment of the medical profession by removing the love-interest and mad patient scenes. it should have focused on the incompetent b.s within its walls more frequently. in an era where this movie could have been phenomenal, the sub-plot stories make the film very good instead of the great masterpiece it could have been.

this movie is funny funny funny my favorite quote from the movie "i think i saw a half naked indian in my room last night" response that was no hallucination it was a indian in your room" and another is "what the hell are you talking about, just what the hell are you talking about" but if i ever be admitted to an hospital like this one i will be prepared to write my will on the spot...i would say there were in my opinion three very funny characters in this film most funny but three is the funniest to me even though their lines were few.. and don't get me started on the crack-pot patient hehehe that one i will keep secret and fast paced too.

this is one of the greatest films ever made. brilliant acting by george c. scott and diane riggs. this movie is both disturbing and extremely deep. don't be fooled into believing this is just a comedy. it is a brilliant satire about the medical profession. it is not a pretty picture. healthy patients are killed by incompetent surgeons, who spend all their time making money outside the hospital. and yet, you really believe that this is a hospital. the producers were very careful to include real medical terminology and real medical cases. this movie really reveals how difficult in is to run a hospital, and how badly things already were in 1971. i loved this movie. p.s. - i noticed that the incompetent, wheeler dealer surgeon played the head of the firm in la law. the young doctor played in lou grant. i also noticed that the registration nurse has appeared since in becker and other shows.

patty chayevsky was years ahead of most successful screenplay and drama writers in tackling sticky subjects. in this 1971 film he followed sinclair lewis and a. j. cronin (in respectively arrowsmith and the citadel) in looking critically at the world of medicine, although his target is centered on a special stage: a modern hospital in manhattan. chayevsky's point of view is quite direct: are hospital's places for people to go to to get well, or are they money making organizations where people frequently die due to incompetence.as a person who has recently been to a hospital too many times (and will shortly have to return again) i find the hospital a very timely and rewarding satire. george c. scott is dr. block, one of the heads of the manhattan surgical center, a major teaching hospital. he has just started his day when he is told that one of the second year residents has died during the night in an apparent mix-up. it seems he was sedated and drugged while sleeping on a bed (he'd been having a tryst with a nurse), and someone tampered with an i.v. that should have contained water with glucose in it (later it turns out he got an overdose of insulin in the i.v.). soon scott finds that whenever he turns around some other member of the staff dies of a heart attack or of a botched operation. the key to all this appears to be one patient who came to the hospital ten days before for a regular check-up, and has since lost one kidney, nearly lost his other kidney, and is now in a comatose state (barnard hughes). hughes' daughter (diana rigg) wants to bring the comatose dad back to his home on an apache indian reservation in mexico. scott is not totally opposed to the idea - after all, hospital errors almost killed hughes. also, scott is suffering a mid-life crisis with the collapse of his marriage and family, and his growing doubts about what his chosen profession really accomplishes. it is not only looking at a case like hughes'. the hospital is in a constant state of chaos wherein the regular staff (scott, stephen elliot, nancy marchand, stockard channing) is overworked and overtaxed, and is at war with the business staff (typified by frances steenhagen in a really chilly performance). the local community is hostile because of the expansion plans of the hospital - but when they meet to "discuss" matters with elliot they prove to be as divisive among themselves (militant black panthers versus local clergy versus birth control seeking women and pro-abortion clinic types). rigg (who falls in love with scott in the course of the film) becomes more and more certain that leaving the insanity of the city makes sense, and scott also toys with the idea.scott was at his acting height in this film, what with anatomy of a murder, the hustler, dr. strangelove, and patton under his belt before the hospital was made. his angst registered when he and rigg get to know each other (she prevents him from killing himself due to his despair). he can't tell if anything done in the hospital is worthwhile, and screams out the window the words in the "summary line". though he does later relax a little about how good his teaching has been for doctors studying with him, scott really never fully is sure about it all - he does, however, fully accept his own sense of responsibility that others just dump. rigg too was at the height of her international fame (if not her acting abilities) - her stint as mrs. peel on the avengers was a few years old, but she was recognized as a leading stage talent in britain at the time, as well as one of the sexiest women performers of that period. the supporting actors are good too. besides the chilling steenhagen (demanding medicare/medicaid/insurance information from comatose patients in the e.r.), there is hughes as a religious maniac who wins, and elliot as the fed up head of the hospital. there is also my favorite caricature: richard dysart as dr. elwell. elwell is a butcher who has found a real home for himself on the big board of the stock exchange, having incorporated himself for tax incentives. anyone recalling his performances as ethical types such as the head of the law firm in l.a.law or as the friend and physician to melvin douglas in being there, upon seeing his greedy dr. elwell see another facet to this underrated actor's talents.

may i never have to go to this hospital [or hospice, if i want to be politically correct] [which ass coined this asinine phrase, anyway?], for anything other than directions on how to get out of town. george c. did a masterful job playing the burned out, over worked cynic who has come to the conclusion that his life has been a waste, but is helpless to change his environment or conditions even when given a golden opportunity [which probably wasn't so golden anyway]. i got several laughs out of this brutally black comedy, however at the same time was sobered and often chilled to the marrow because i fear this very atmosphere pervades most houses of healing even as i write.

read a biography of the late george c. scott and you'll discover why he was so enormously talent. he was asked by an interviewer what his secret was when making each character he played his own. scott replied, he possessed inside him a burning fire which drove him. in one of his last interviewers, he sadly revealed he had lost the drive. this was not the case when he starred in the movie, "the hospital." in this offering, he plays talented doctor bock, medical director of one of the finest hospitals in the country. however, life has dealt him some crippling problems, such as losing his wife to a divorce, becoming alienated from both his promising children and worse of all, believing himself to be physically impotent. at this point, he is now becoming complacent, morose and frequently fantasizes various ways of committing suicide. to add to his growing list of personal obstacles, his main reason for being, his hospital has come under siege by students and neighborhood protesters, incompetent doctors like dr. welbeck (richard dysart) and a mysterious md. who is killing both patients and doctors alike, because he believes he is "the wrath of the lamb." (barnard hughes). few choices are left to bock. one is promising doctor brubaker (robert walden) whom he confides in by saying, "if there were an oven around here, i would put my head in it." the second is a luscious young woman, named barbara who is attracted to bock because he acts like a wounded bear. paddy chayefsky wrote the screen-play and arthur hiller did an extremely good job of directing this dramatically interesting, dark story, but a vehicle nonetheless, lit by the fire of george c. scott. ****

george scott gave the performance of a lifetime in paddy chayefsky's the hospital, a very dark drama about an aging big city hospital and a middle-aged physician on the verge of suicide. along comes diana rigg as a free spirit determined to save him from himself. their dialog crackles, and it is clear they are made for each other from the outset. but will she save him? their one sex scene is both graphic and memorable for its passion and fury. meanwhile, the hospital is under siege by a group of agitators who don't want it to turn a condemned building into a cancer center. and a serial killer is loose in the hospital, specializing in doctors and nurses. a good part of the movie, though, is squarely focused on scott. as it should be. what a difference a few years made back when this movie was made. 1962 had given us the interns, a hokey, old-fashioned reworking of dr. kildare with terrible acting and a cardboard script. along came 1971 and the hospital. less than 10 years later. hollywood did something right for a change. watching the hospital today is a reminder of how much medical shows like st. elsewhere and scrubs owe to this enduring classic. and if the hospital reminds you of network, it should. same scripter.

absolutely corrosive! director arthur hiller and writer paddy chayefsky dismantle the american hospital system with this wicked comedy/drama/whodunit. the hospital depicted here is fraught with problems...from protesting neighbors to irate patients to a potential serial killer on the loose. george c. scott is the top doctor who, on the brink of his own nervous breakdown, gets involved with free-spirited diana rigg and her wacky father barnard hughes. alternately depressing and uproarious, the hospital features some of the most acid-tinged dialog imaginable (note how scott describes his love making session with rigg). it also has a lot of great vignettes: scott berating head nurse nancy marchand after one of here underlings accidentally kills a doctor; daffy administrator frances sternhagen trying desperately to collect insurance info from a waiting room full of sick people; scott getting sobering advice from the hospital psychiatrist after telling him of his woeful home-life. all of the acting is first-rate. scott and rigg are dynamite and hughes is a real surprise. the movie is a masterpiece with chayefsky's script earning a well-deserved oscar (over such stiff competition as klute & sunday, bloody sunday). the opening narration is priceless.

anybody who goes to the manhattan hospital center is taking his life in his hands. that includes the staff of the hospital.i had never seen the hospital before and i was intrigued at how similar the characters and situations of the plot were to that other paddy chayefsky masterpiece, network. there are elements in george c. scott's character that have both al schumacher's and howard beale's.he's the administrator of the hospital and he's mad as hell and not going to take it any more. he's completely estranged from his wife and kids. it takes a faye dunaway type character in the person of diana rigg to make him snap out of it. one roll in the hay with her and he's shocked back to reality and the fact he still can contribute in the world.but first he's got a real problem. someone is out killing hospital staff, four of them in a 48 hour period. and the nice part is their deaths can be attributed to in large part to the general incompetence of a medical bureaucracy. that's where the comedy comes in.there is an actual howard beale type character in the person of barnard hughes, diana rigg's father. his end is not quite as dramatic as beale's though.back in my working days it was part of my job to pay medical suppliers. some of them could be as big creeps as you'll find portrayed in the hospital. the black comedy satire had some real bite to it for me.george c. scott was nominated for best actor, but having won and refused to accept the previous year's oscar for patton, he wasn't about to get a second chance. he lost to gene hackman for the french connection. still his handling of the role is unforgettable.try viewing the hospital back to back with network and see how many similarities you spot.

if you liked paddy chayevsky's "network" you'll probably like this black comedy as well, as it's another brilliant chayevsky script, a wonderful satire on big-city hospitals and a perfect vehicle for geo. c. scott. he plays a burned-out chief of medicine on the most chaotic day he or his hospital have ever seen. his personal crisis is coming to a head and his hospital's falling down around him, as local residents demonstrate against the hospital and patients and doctors are dying at an alarming rate, thanks to a biblically-inspired and murderous saboteur. the latter, who theatrically declares himself the "fool for christ," "parakleet of kaborka," "wrath of the lamb," and "angel of the bottomless pit," bops doctors on the head, administers lethal injections and swaps patients' identities, causing treatments and operations to be performed on the wrong persons.this film makes you uncomfortable, as deadly mistakes like these do happen (hopefully not so many, not so often and not in one place) and at the same time makes you laugh at the priceless character portraits. one is richard dysart ("l.a. law") as dr. wellbeck, a sort of celebrity surgeon who spends far more time worrying about his investments and publicly-traded stock than about his patients, who suffer lethally from his vast indifference and neglect. there's diana rigg as free-spirited, hippie-ish barbara drummond, who seduces the beleaguered chief of medicine (scott) and tries to get him to run away with her. then there's the deluded murderer, who happens to be barbara's father and who "functions well enough" back at the indian reservation where he lives with his daughter and even runs a clinic, but who's pushed to madness merely by being placed back in civilization. the strongest portrait by far is scott's dr. bock, who bares his soul as former boy genius, failed father and husband, brilliant doctor and responsible administrator, who constantly dreams of suicide but must bear up under the demands of his job. scott is exceptional in this demanding role.until the final scenes one doesn't know if bock will leave the hospital behind for barbara's indian reservation and a quieter, simpler life, whether her murderous father will be caught or whether the protesting, rioting locals will take over and bring the hospital to its knees. watching the crazed killer at work, one suspects chayevsky is telling us our lunatic society makes him do these things, as we're told he's a different person away from cities and people.as my own father was the chief administrator of a number of large hospitals over the years, i had some idea of the demands of his job and the huge responsibility he shouldered. this story makes that responsibility the linchpin on which scott's crisis turns. this is both a funny and scary film, with the actors up to the considerable demands of chayevsky's script. it's also a film i get more out of each time i watch it.

i had never paid much attention to this flick until i learned that paddy chayefsky - author of the brilliant "network" - was the scriptwriter. his work there had instructed me as to his genius, so when 'hospital' appeared on tmc, i was anxious to see it. i was not disappointed. looking at both this film and "network" it would seem that his big theme is the absurdity, inanity, and sheer viciousness of large human enterprises (e.g., hospitals, networks) against the sanctity of individual experience and the human spirit, and all of it delivered with a knife-edge sense of utterly black humor. "hospital" is as black of a comedy as "network" is, and the excellent cast, led by the incomparable scott, does his work full justice. this is a keeper; definitely not to miss.

certainly the highlight of this film is it's cast.diana rigg, george c. scott, bernard hughes to mention a few.i have accumulated more time in hospitals and with doctors over the years than i care to think about.this comedy attacks the pomp and pretension in all aspects of our society, through the setting of one of it's "most haughty" institutions... the medical profession.the idea that such goings on could be possible, might be a shock to some, but is a delight to anyone with the perspective of experience.dr brock (scott) undergoes a mid-life crisis of monumental proportions before our eyes as we, and he, become enamored with the prospect of his involvement with miss drummond (rigg).the thread of the absurd is woven into this wonderful mix in the form of the irony that the hospital appears to be killing it's own workers as they mismanage their affairs in it.the climax is unpredictable (unless you've seen it) and made even more hilarious if you happen to guess.it's not everyone's brand of humor, to be sure, and has uproariously funny "dark moments" if you're open to them.i loved every minute, and was delighted to see it out on dvd.

anyone who has spent time working in a hospital or medical facility has got to appreciate this film. the plot is absolutely wild but entertaining from start to finish. the acting is superb. george c. scott is the brilliant doctor but class a failure as husband, father. diana riggs, a sex symbol of the 1960s and 1970s (of the avengers), saves him from himself. the surrounding cast is superb and the dialogue quite entertaining. i think i enjoyed the film more on viewing it the 4th., 5th. or 6th. time because i caught that much more of the richness of the dialogue and the interplay of the characters. well worth seeing again and again. you just won't want to check in to a hospital in the near future.

another raquel welch classic! this picture hit the theaters november 10 1969 starring raquel welch as michele, james stacey as joe and luke askew as alan morris. nikki is on her way to meet with her girl friends michele and jackie. while on her way there, she runs into her ex husband who wants a second chance. nikki walk away from him goes to the table where she sees michele and jackie. alan approaches her again and she starts to walk away when alan shoots her in the back. nikki is taken to the hospital while michele and jackie go to the police station. michele goes to the hospital where she meets up with jackie only to find that nikki died. alan then goes after jackie who he hits with a car and then tries to run michele down. michele jumps into her car and heads for los angeles. when she gets there, she calls lloyd her boss in las vegas to let him know that she was all right. lloyd tells her to go to the club called the losers to see jeri about a job. however, there's one problem! the bartender has a drug problem and alan knows it so alan and the bartender have a little talk. back in los angeles michele not only gets a job as a dancer with jeri but also hooks up with jeri bouncer joe. now some thoughts on this picture! this picture was far better then raquel last, and this one had nonstop action. luke askew did a fine job of playing nikki ex husband. he was your typical murder with the look that goes with it. as for raquel welch performance, the only word that comes to mine is fantastic. she was awesome in this movie and her beauty stood out and shined like never before. the outfit that she wore on stage to dance was breathtaking. in fact, all the outfits she wore in this movie were breathtaking. of course, it doesn't matter what raquel had on because she looks good in everything or nothing. i give this movie 10 weasel stars for two reasons. the first and by far is raquel welch who's the leading actress and deserves 10 stars. the second reason is that this movie was wall-to-wall excitement from beginning to end.

this short, a formative cartoon featuring pepe le pew, concerns a cat who thinks he'll solve all his problems by pretending to be a skunk. trouble is, he attracts the most unwelcome attention of an honest and for truly skunk (our hero, pepe, entering stage left) being decidedly more attentive, shall we say, than m. cat would like. every great plan has its drawbacks, but this one's a corker! i wonder if jack warner got a call from the hays office over the fact that pepe and the object of his adoration were both male. after all, betty boop was in part responsible for the production code coming into existance. subsequent "conquests" were clearly and most definitely female. very good cartoon, but pepe is a character who works better as the focal point, rather than supporting. well worth watching. recommended.

the brilliant chuck jones, master of warner bros. cartoon comedy, brings us the first (?) pepe lepew cartoon. an alley cat, tired of being pushed around, paints himself in the colors of a skunk, and with a healthy dose of limburger, turns the tables on his tormentors. then along comes pepe, and you know the rest. many of pepe's famous gags were born here, including his chase/hop, in which he hops casually along while his prey runs himself to exhaustion.in my opinion, warner bros. cartoons became less inventive and more ho-hum in the 50s. this 1947 'toon is one of the few examples of mel blanc putting his absolutely crazy voice into pepe's mouth. but the kicker is the ending, where pepe is revealed to be an american "wolf in skunk's clothing"! a must see! classic warner bros...

this is the first pepe le pew cartoon and in some ways it's very similar to the later ones but in a few other odd ways it is not. while the object of pepe's affections is a cat, oddly it appears to be a boy cat! this whole predicament occurs because a cat is tired of being abused by others and dresses up like a skunk and tries to smell like a skunk so it can be left alone. unfortunately, this attracts our hero, pepe. most of the action is pretty typical until the very funny and unexpected ending--and this actually makes this one of the best of all cartoons in the series. excellent animation (though the style is different than later examples), excellent writing and a good sense of humor make this one a keeper.

and thus was born the most amorous skunk ever to grace the silver screen. while the plot has an abused cat painting himself like a skunk and inadvertently attracting pepe le pew (called henry here), pepe certainly steals the show. no doubt chuck jones realized that this love-seeking member of the genus mephitis had that special something necessary to be a star in his own right, and so he cast pepe in "for scent-imental reasons" four years later, firmly establishing plp's enduring presence on screens everywhere.so, while "odor-able kitty" may be a place holder otherwise, i try to imagine watching it for the very first time in 1945. could anyone have guessed that this supporting character would soon join the ranks of bugs, daffy, porky, and the rest? whether or not anyone did, pepe remains one of the most likable characters to this day. c'est l'amour!

one day a red alley cat is fed up of being kicked by people and attacked by dogs and muses that life would be better if he were a skunk. he then paints himself black with a white stripe down his back and adds a bit of limburger cheese to make him stink. at first life couldn't be better for him, the dog flees and the butcher abandons his shop letting the cat walk off with a pile of meat. just as he is thinking everything is perfect he is noticed by a real skunk, not just any skunk but the overly amorous pepé le pew. pepé mistakes the poor cat for a female skunk and pursues him thinking his protestations are just shyness. our poor cat thinks he has escaped when he throws a skunk skin from a tall building so that pepé will think he is dead, at first it seems to work but as he sneaks off pepé sees him and instantly forgets the dead skunk. in the end the cat realises he was better off being kicked and attacked than being lusted after by a randy skunk... there is a nice ending for the skunk too when his wife finds out what he has been up to.this was a fairly funny introduction to pepé le pew who back then was just overly amorous but now looks like a randy sexually harassing stalker, although he was punished for his behaviour in the end.

once a wise man from india once said, "first they will laugh at us. then they will hate us. then they will fear us." know that yes this film's budget was a bit off, but even then with its story still takes our interest many yrs later, regardless of how it may have looked. but know soon, in due time "masten thrust" will arise to the big screen once again. then he and the new redesigned t-rex will more then shock you. it will scare many for centuries to come!! this film is in current pre-production and will be nothing like anything you have ever seen before! this will be beyond thx format.....right into 4-dx format. "be afraid, be very afraid!"

i was 9 when i first saw this on tv. on a friday night. i remember the full page ad in the tv guide with the picture of the rex. amazing how some things stick in your mind after 30 years. anyway if your a kid who likes monster movies this one is entertaining enough especially with boone and keats raging at each other. special effects are no harryhausen but its worth the hour and a half if you find it somewhere on late night tv. haven't seen it in a few years for some reason these classics fade from cable tv. if you do catch it on late night don't be too critical just grab some snacks and enjoy it. it might be cheesy but i thought it was a lot better than the kong remake that came out in the theaters a year before.

the last dinosaur is a film that is meant to be fun and exciting. it succeeds at doing both.maston is a big game hunter who hunts big game(go figure). owning a company he is planning on going on an expedition with a group of people including a photographer named frankie, a japanese scientist, a guy who works for his company named chuck, and an african guy who has aided him on many safari's named bun ta. the point is to study what is believed to be tyrannosaurus rex, dinosaur that killed the last expedition to the area. they will be getting to this prehistoric area taking a drilling vehicle that travels underwater called the polar borer. after getting to the area they soon find the tyrannosaurus, which maston tries to shoot but his gun gets jammed. chuck immediately senses that maston wanted to hunt the dinosaur all along to add it to his collection of "stuffed animals". while they were away, tyrannosaurus invades their camp and takes the polar borer away from their camp. upon returning the group realizes that they may be in the area longer than they expected and maston states that he will kill the tyrannosaurus.the story is great for a science fiction film. drilling to a prehistoric area is something that seems could really happen. the scenery is beautiful and it looks like a place where dinosaurs could still reside.also i liked the characters in this film. maston is the typical big time hunter who wants to get anything that could be a trophy kill. also great was bun ta, played by luther rackley formerly of the nba, who really looks and acts like an african tracker. jackie is the typical female who causes problems for the group and seems to not belong in the wilderness. chuck is the former employee of maston who has his view of his boss change when he is in the wild with him.the tyrannosaurus in this film is one of the best in a film. it stands a little too up-right like godzilla does and it drags its tail, so it is a guy in a suit. but the suit looks good, especially the head and the tail, and the tyrannosaurus looks good and very scary. i have seen plenty of other films where dinosaur suits look way worse. tyrannosaurus in this film sometimes emits a roar sounding like godzilla's and other times roars like king kong from "king kong escapes" and "king kong vs godzilla". so a great tyrannosaurus.there is plenty of action in the last dinosaur. of particular note is a great fight between tyrannosaurus and triceratops. also a great scene where bun ta tries to spear the tyrannosaurus. there are other great parts that i wont give away. you have to see for yourself.i recommend this film to everyone. watch it and you will not be disappointed.

stupidly beautiful. this movie epitomizes the 'so bad it's good' genre of films. the only two talents in it are richard boone and joan van ark, and only boone is any good. it's kind of sad that the man who rose to fame as paladin should wind up in this ugly pile of celluloid. while he turns in a fantastic performance, i couldn't help but feel that he so outclassed all his fellow actors in this piece that he shouldn't even have been there.the effects in this film are laughable, but fun. the idea of a dinosaur being buried in the wall of a cave and suddenly coming to life is b-movie gold. when the 'triceratops' gets killed, watch how it falls. it's clear that the stunt performer in the front of the costume knows the timing best. he falls to the ground, well before the back half of the dinosaur follows suit.speaking of 'suits', there is nothing good to say about the purple tyrannosaur, in this flick. it seems to have some kind of stealth technology, since bunta (reputed to be the best tracker in the world) twice fails to notice it until it's within biting range of him. i don't know how all the prints are, but in the version i own, the tyranno's roar contains godzilla's trademark bellow.this is loads of fun, to watch, if you like bad movies. i love them, and especially bad monster movies, so i consider this the gem of my collection. if bad movies are your thing, definitely get this one.

the last dinosaur was one of those "out of nowhere" movie-of-the-week films in the 1970's that was pretty exciting for the time especially to fans of japanese tokusatsu films. originally slated for a theatrical release (around when the dino king kong was out in the previous december) it was suddenly pulled and made into a friday night abc movie of the week. rankin bass-who were no strangers to japanese co-productions were the guns behind this production, co-produced with tsuburaya productions of japan-the people who brought us ultraman in various forms. starring mostly an american cast including the late richard boone, joan van ark and the late steven keats, it told the tale of a prehistoric pocket of time in what was a superheated volcanic caldera somewhere at the frozen arctic circle, containing dinosaurs. it plays a lot like the films the land unknown(1956) and the land that time forgot(1975) in feel and pace. sure the dinosaurs were guys in suits(a triceratops with front knees!) but they were filmed in such a way, the music and score was so well done, and the cast did a fine job that this didn't matter much to many of us brought up on godzilla. the film has a lot of class to it, from the opening score by nancy wilson "the last dinosaur" to the overall "big" feeling of the film-the locations at hot springs in northern japan were excellent and lush- and the undeniable feeling of kaiju eiga to it. there are some amazing set pieces-the t-rex's "bone yard" and a tracking shot that takes us deep into the jungle to see the t-rex eat a giant fish from a stream. tsuburaya's fx people did their job in style here and aside from a few dodgy matte shots, they do their job well. this film is considered the best 1970's "kaiju" film from japan, even over the five godzilla films made during that decade. rankin bass did several other co-productions with tsuburaya providing the creatures or miniatures- the bermuda depths(1978) and the ivory ape(1980)-but neither measured up to the epic look of this film.

prepare to meet your messiah - they call him masten thrust. male role models have become increasingly difficult to find in today's overexposed society. every other day an apparent role model is forced to tearfully apologize for a youthful indiscretion or he innocently gets a few youngsters drunk on his ranch. the last dinosaur is the story of the last great hunt of masten thrust, an old, grizzled, big game hunter who serves as role model supreme. despite his haggard features and bulbous nose, the females, including joan van ark, are attracted to him like meatloaf is to cheesy lyrics. thrust is openly sexist and makes no apologies for his elaborate lifestyle, which includes a red kerchief and a private jet with a working fireplace.thrust embarks on a mission to find and hunt the last dinosaur on earth when ironically, after a rich full life, he is truly the last dinosaur. despite his propensity for yelling at everyone in his presence, his employees and lady friends are unwaveringly loyal to him. he may act as though he's perpetually drunk, but make no mistake, if he calls you a 'ding dong' you are a 'ding dong'.not to be denied his own ballad, thrust's song shamelessly praises him and his manliness. a sampling of lyrics includes: "few men have ever done, what he has done, or even dreamed, what he has dreamed/few men have even tried, what he has tried, most men have failed, where he's prevailed/the world holds nothing new in store for him, and things that startle you and me, are just a bore to him/few men have ever lived, as he has lived, or even walked, where he has walked'. even bmtg banned artist clay aiken could belt out those lyrics and become an rump-kicking machine.thrust and his crew of scientists strap themselves into the 'polar borer' wearing mini bike helmets, though thrust affords himself the luxury of the red kerchief around his neck. the giant human filled drill bit digs through the earth and ice to come popping out into a lagoon. dinosaurs from the air and land soon descend upon the scientists forcing thrust and crew to run for their lives. after narrowly escaping a charging dino, masten lays back and blasts out a hearty laugh, not so much to celebrate life but to acknowledge 'the game is afoot'.soon after, it is little surprise that we see a few slightly hunched over cavemen sneaking peeks at their visitors. thrust, not content with simply killing a dinosaur, decides then to make it his mission to bag a cave broad. throughout the movie, the lone t-rex contradicts the belief that dinosaurs have a brain the size of a peanut. despite its enormous size, the local t-rex is able to sidle up next to its victims virtually unnoticed. with the element of surprise, t-rex simply crushes a scientist or two and loots the campsite. every so often the bloated and cagily faced thrust is seen yelling at someone, shooting at something or flirting with a primitive j-lo in manly fashion.thrust is like james tiberius kirk, not only in his addiction to love, but also when is comes to making complicated weapons using limited natural resources in a short period of time. thrust and the remaining crew members construct a highly accurate catapult that flings a large boulder into the skull of the cunning t-rex. upon realizing that even he, masten thrust, cannot top this addition to his trophy case, thrust decides to stay in his prehistoric surroundings. the ever-dwindling crew then leaves thrust to live out his days with his lovely, although a bit gamely, cavewoman and introduce her to his personal collection of stds. this is only a brief synopsis of a movie so complicated and rich in bmtg tradition that it takes several viewings to absorb its message and realize that masten thrust is the answer. the press conference, complete with a yelling thrust, mumbling reporters, and the introduction of the great bunta, is a classic moment. also look for a body, resembling a dead ricky schroeder, lying on some logs, and the most powerful use of someone being called a 'ding-dong' in cinematic history.

i have read a couple of reviews of this film, which has recently been released on dvd by eclectic. apparently, the opening titles are letterboxed, but the remainder (most) is full-screen. the first release, in 1982 by planet video, is completely letterboxed. though it was a primitive release, it did get the compositions right. later releases had sharper and better picture quality, but they were fullscreen as the dvd is. any release of this film should be letterboxed, as it adds significantly to the visual experience of the old planet tape.

this is my favourite indian movie of all time. it is comic genius. salman khan is hilarious. but amir khan steals the show with his witty dialogue. karisma kapoor's outfits tell a story of their own - makes you wonder if the stylist deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the movie funnier (at one point she looks like she's wearing a nappy). andaz apna apna is the only comedy genre movie to make me laugh from the beginning till the very end. there is not one dull moment, every scene is hilarious, even the songs and dance moves will have you in stitches of laughter. i especially loved the scene in which amar (amir khan) 'regains his memory'. i've seen this movie so many times i've lost count. and i'm so glad to say that this time bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic movie as far as i know a.a.a it is not a replicate of a hollywood movie (thank god). overall i recommend this movie to anyone who understands hindi/ urdu and loves good comedy.watch it you'll love it!!!!!

andaz apna apna is a movie that i treasure and its one movie, i don't mind seeing at any time... well almost any time! this movie is simply marvelous and according to me, is the funniest movie i've ever seen! and yes, i do put it over hera pheri... reason? hera pheri has scenes you'll watch out but andaz apna apna? not possible! simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for! aamir & salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes but i'll put the characters in order of favoritism: rank # 1. crime master gogo (shakti kapoor's best performance till date and yes, this happened before the casting couch): gogo is an innocent character who belongs to well reputed family of mogambo (mr. india fame). crime master gogo is actually mogambo's nephew but for mogambo, he's more than a responsible, handsome, charismatic charming son. gogo, makes the biggest mistake of life by lending 36,000 rupees to teja (who is as balla had once said, "a fraud and a cheat!"). now, gogo's only goal is to get back what's his and in his journey of recovering his lost money, gogo realizes that there is more than 36,000 that he needs to achieve and thus begins... gogo's struggle against the sinner-world.rank # 2. teja (teja main hoon, mark idhar hai!): teja is an evil character who is ram gopal bajaj's twin. originally named shyam gopal bajaj, teja chooses to change his name to suit his personality. teja, as a child had always envied his brother and then one day, things took a turn for the worse when his father gave his entire wealth to ram bajaj. teja decided to kill his father but in the night's darkness, instead killed munshi harish chandra (raveena's dad), though teja doesn't regret his actions. teja's sole mission, now, is to get back his property somehow and start his own poultry & bakery farm. teja also needs to return back the loan to gogo (but has no intentions whatsoever to do so). in order to achieve his evil goals, teja employs two people: robert (vijay khote, who is very good at aiming) and balla (shahzad khan, ajit's clone and son... who is a very very smart boy!) rank # 3. amar (aamir khan): wants to marry the rich heiress raveena, so he sells his father's cheap saloon and heads off for mumbai. amar, has no problem taking care of the big business that raveena's father will hand him over after their wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and shift to london, if needed.rank # 4. prem (salman khan): after gogo, prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie and the way amar tries to take advantage of him in the mask of a friend, is tragic.i won't reveal any more characters because jesus christ! i just wouldn't stop typing! the movie is outright stunning! go and get the dvd now and beware of those cheap vcds as they have omitted many good scenes out of the movie.the background music is stud and the action is better than the matrix, especially the final encountered between prem and crime master gogo (watch out for it), it appears in the climax. andaz apna apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teach us a lot about life and values and ethics. it teaches us about bravery (why else would amar ask prem to stay back when they go to meet the kidnapper, even though prem was complaining that he had to go to the toilet???). andaz apna apna is also a tragedy, especially the scenes where salman is targeted by aamir and is given overdose of stomach-upsetting pills, the part where teja reveals his sad feelings regarding why he couldn't go to london and the part where gogo is arrested in the ending, without even getting back his 36,000. andaz apna apna is overall a complete package.... sit back and enjoy the ride! bet there'll be a second ride after that... and then a third!the movie was considered a flop back then and i bet no one liked it but buckle up guys! this movie is a big hit! even if it didn't have enough people coming to theatres, the movie is one of the highest selling home dvds and one of the most frequently movie on most of the channels so the producers have laughed their way to the banks long time back!

it'll soon be 10 yrs since this movie was released....still makes me laugh.... if u enjoy this film, try the new hera pheri....t'is as hilarious. and my favourite bit of the film must be when salman realises that he has no bullets left in his gun while he has the upper hand and has everyone at gun point...and he actually says it out loud!!! u just wanna bash him....but u know u can only do that if u stop laughing!!!! fantastic film.... 10/10

i have been watching this movie repeatedly, since it came out. even though it is 8 years old now, it still cracks me up. the jokes are still hilarious and the way the characters are portrayed will make anybody of any age laugh like they've never laughed before. enjoy it

its a very good comedy movie.ijust liked it.i don't know why i love this movie i just love it.storyline:it is a story of two boys amar (aamir khan) and prem (salman khan) who want to get rich quickly by taking all the short-cuts in the book. amar is the son of an honest barber, murli manohar (deven verma) in mumbai, while prem is the son of bankeylal bhopali (jagdeep), a hardworking tailor in bhopal. both amar and prem sell their father's shop and house respectively, and zero in on a hill station where a beautiful wealthy heiress raveena (raveena tandon) has come from london accompanied by her friend cum secretary karishma (karishma kapoor) with the intention of getting married to a virtuous indian. the lucky man to wed raveena will inherit her father ram gopal bajaj's (paresh rawal) entire wealth. amar and prem see their get rich quick chance and woo raveena, each trying to out do the other. enter teja (paresh rawal in a double role) whose sole ambition in life has been to grab his twin brother ram gopal bajaj's millions. so teja plants bhalla.

there are some movies that are loved by almost everyone who you come across and yet happen to be box-office failures. andaz apna apna, an intelligent and hilarious comedy falls in that catogory. for once, an indian director has kept in mind the sensibilities of the audience, and not churned out a kader khan type stereo-typical hoax. the movie is about two guys who dream of riches, and try to accomplish that by wooing a millionaire's daughter. a humorous drama unfolds while a lot of complexities surface in the story. the complexities add to the sheer comedy of the entire plot. aamir khan plays the a street-smart guy, while salman khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the dumb guy. the villian played by paresh rawal,and his henchmen, junior ajit and "kaliaa" make you laugh in your sleep. although the movie borrows from a lot of other movies, despite shoddy camerawork, and despite being "loud" at times, it remains one of the scarce "funny" movies bombay has come up with after movies like padosan, golmal and other amol plaekar movies. it is sad that it didn't do well at the box-office, for that means producers turn back to formulas and creativity is abandoned.

its a spoof, its an intelligent comedy, it has some a pathetic action and choreography (and mind it, it is intentional), good hummable songs, good performances by the entire cast, brilliant by amir, salman and paresh and over all an script which is so rare in indian cinema that too in comedy (watch david dhawan, harmesh malhotra etc). story is of two wastrels whose only aim is to get rich and famous by any which ways. they come across one such way when they find out that a rich nri is coming india to get married. rest of the story is about oneupmanship and how these wastrels try to out wit each other. entire cast is perfectly cast right from deven verma till viju khote. songs are rightly placed and are funny. surprise package is salman who acts with perfect timing and this particular act gave him his style of comedy.all an all a fum film which you should not ignore if you like and watch indian cinema.

it's simply ridiculous how underrated this movie is. it is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. it never lags, it never slows down, it is a movie that has a wonderful flow to the plot. that along with the brilliant writing makes this an awesome movie. aamir and salman are outrageous, even raveena and karishma are funny in this movie. paresh rawal and shakti deliver some great bad guy comedy, but viju khote and the ajit-wannabe are the best with their dumbfounded bad-guy intentions. if you want to laugh, and enjoy a movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, you will not regret it. most indian movies tire me out by the end, cause they are 3 hours long. this movie is just as long, but i wish there was more when it ends, cause it's an amazing flick.

andaz apna apna is by far my second favorite comedy of all time, first being namak halal (even though that was technically a drama). story is nothing groundbreaking, but the complications that are added to it make it awesome. aamir khan is a total cartoon. just watch his expressions in the song yeh raat aur yeh doori. he is amazingly good at comedy, i never knew. salman khan was also good as the somewhat dimmer of the two characters. the noises he makes are almost as funny as aamir's faces. raveena and karisma serve their purpose but are nothing amazing. the real pick of the lot is paresh rawal as usual.the plot is rather simple, amar (aamir) and prem (salman) are useless sons of poor fathers. they don't believe in hard work and just want to get rich the easy way. so both their brains come across an idea to woo a rich man's (paresh rawal) daughter (raveena tandon) who comes to india to look for a husband. so amar and prem meet on the trip and join hands to drive off the hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl. when they succeed, they now have to get rid of each other. somehow both of them get into raveena's house, amar as an injured guy and prem as his doctor. from here on they try to oust each other. but things are complicated as raveena's friend (karisma kapoor) falls for prem and pursues him. and rich man's evil twin brother (rawal also) tries to get rid of the heiress and her father so he will inherit the money and sends in his two most trusted but bumbling fools to do the dirty work.this is a movie you do not want to miss. watch it! it will be worth it. i even own the dvd, its that good. and if you like this movie, i'd also recommend gol maal if you haven't already watched it. other good comedies are namak halal and hera pheri (new).

this movie is simply excellent. for some reason it wasn't a success at the box office in india. in new york, however, i have yet to come across a person who disliked this movie. this is definitely the funniest movie to come out of india. everyone gives a good performance; amir khan; however, just takes over and puts the movie over the top.

there have been very few great comedy films in the history of hindi cinema. andaz apna apna happens to be one of them. the film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (aamir and salman) who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaire's daughter (raveena). aamir and salman khan try their best to outwit each other and woo raveena. the plot thickens when paresh rawal & co. plan to take over all the wealth. the movie is well paced and very funny. rarely does one come across a hindi comedy which is both funny and intelligent. this is one of the few films with aamir and salman together (probably the only film!). unfortunately it did not succeed at the box-office, and we might never see a film of this calibre again. aamir khan is brilliant in the film and has proved his versatility as an actor in this film. salman khan gives a very good performance as a dim-wit. raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl, and karishma who is raveena's assistant/friend is also funny. paresh rawal, junior ajith, shakti kapoor, deven verma, jagdeep and tiku talsania just add to the flavour of the film! all in all, the best hindi comedy ever made and i wish they make more quality films like this one. you will want to watch this film time and again.p.s - for those of you who have watched this film, i also suggest gol maal, chupke chupke, chhoti si baat, naram garam, hera pheri (old and new), etc.

this movie fully deserves to be one of the top hindi comedies ever made . rajkumar santoshi is mostly known for his gritty hard-hitting social dramas , but this is easily the most effortless movie he has made .the plot revolves around two small-town buffoons amar (aamir khan) and prem (salman khan) . they want to get rich quick and so move to the big city . they hatch the same plan separately - to woo a rich heiress raveena (raveena tandon) who is the daughter of a rich businessman ramgopal bajaj (paresh rawal) . thus the one who marries raveena gets his hands on all her wealth . but when they get to know each other's plan , there is an intense tussle of one-oneupmanship over who marries raveena . hilarious gags and situations ensue as the battle rages on .at the same time ramgopal bajaj's identical twin brother shyamgopal bajaj wants to eliminate his brother and niece and usurp the family fortune . add to this an assortment of funny characters including a raveena's maid karishma (karishma kapoor) , a mistake-prone butler named robert (vijoo khote) , a manager named bhalla (shehzad khan) who mimics yesteryear's villain ajeet and a funny gangster gogo (shakti kapoor) who looks more like a pirate and a rollicking comedy awaits you .do not waste your time looking for logic in the movie . leave the company of your brains and just enjoy . the actors are so much in sync with the script that no room is left for mistakes . dialogues (rajkumar santoshi , dilip shukla) are witty . music (tushar bhatia) and lyrics (majrooh sultanpuri) are memorable . the picturization and choreography (saroj khan) of "yeh raat aur yeh doori" , "ae lo ji sanam" and "dil karta hai tere paas aaoon" is fitting and will remain etched in my mind forever .the film starred two superstars-in-the-making , aamir khan and salman khan (they eventually became superstars) . aamir khan is impeccable in his first all-out comedy role . i salute his sense of comic timing . salman pales in comparison with aamir but is still likable . among the supporting characters , paresh rawal stands out in his dual role of ramgopal and shyamgopal .the movie surprisingly failed at the box office . i fail to understand why . i recommend it to all nevertheless .

in a minute to pray, a second to die, clay mccord (alex cord) is an unhappy outlaw with a ten thousand dollar bounty on his head and degenerative epilepsy.realizing his days as an outlaw are numbered, he wants desperately (though somewhat reluctantly) to take advantage of an amnesty being granted by rough and tumble territorial governor robert ryan, (excellent performance) who badly wants mccord to renounce his ways and accept the amnesty as an example to others while in the bandit hub of escondito, outlaw mario brega plans to kill mccord to stop that from happening.also starring arthur kennedy, aldo sambrell and a slew of other familiar european faces, this is co-written and produced by (american) spaghetti western pioneer albert band, also responsible for the pre-leone film gunfight at red sands.though the solution to the main character's "epilepsy" is lifted straight out of howard hawks' el dorado, the script is solid, pretty fresh and unpretentious. this has a great balance of action and story and alex cord is great in it. he really should have been a bigger star.in defense of the shorter (well dubbed) english version: personally i'm past that age where the longer version is always the better version and the ending where mccord is ironically gunned down by grimy bounty hunters after his pardon, is needlessly nihilistic and completely destroys the film's message about hope and redemption.call me old-fashioned, but i rooted for mccord and felt he earned that happy ending!

i found this to be an underrated, quietly compelling spaghetti western (also known as dead or alive). despite modest credentials (apart from multi-purpose co-writer/producer albert band, the only notable crew member is composer carlo rustichelli), the film clearly benefits from the presence of its three american stars (newcomer alex cord is an ambiguous anti-hero, while veterans arthur kennedy and robert ryan lend a mythic quality to the proceedings) as well as the unusual plot (involving a crippled protagonist, an amnesty ruse covering a strategic clean-up of the town, and which has the law finally siding with the gunfighter against a horde of mexican bandits).there are several tough action scenes on hand  the film is capped by a terrific climax in which the star trio is besieged inside a blazing cabin  plus a couple of outrageous moments which are something of a spaghetti western trademark: from the middle of the street, cord sees a hidden gunman at a window reflected in a whiskey bottle; a man who helps cord escape is repeatedly immersed in a pool of oil by the villains. nicoletta machiavelli also makes a nice impression as a village girl with whom cord lodges; the supporting cast, then, is peppered with familiar (if largely anonymous) faces  all of them essentially genre fixtures.i wasn't aware of the fact that the english-dubbed version of the film on mgm/ua's r1 dvd was cut: i was fooled by the wrong running-time being listed on the back-cover; the film was only 99 minutes long and not 118  apparently, cord's character is killed in the longer italian version!

i caught this for the first time a few nights ago on television. i expected to only tune in for a few minutes, but found myself intrigued by the movie. i ended up watching it all and found it surprisingly compelling. the acting by the three american leads was quite good, especially that of alex cord. he plays a gunslinger with quite a degree of vulnerability. very different from how most of them are portrayed in westerns. he ended up in several situations where he was at the mercy of the bounty hunters. the final shootout between the three leads and the bad guys was very good, as was the scene where the doctor digs a bullet out of clay mccord. somewhat gruesome, but realistic. i must admit that, despite my initial misgivings at watching a "spaghetti western", i ended up enjoying this film quite a bit. i would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns.

"a minute to pray, a second to die" is a quality spaghetti western with a solid cast and an interesting storyline. it is filmed beautifully, with a relatively high production value for a film in this genre.alex cord does a terrific job portraying clay mccord, an outlaw who is suffering from increasingly debilitating seizures. he is seeking amnesty before his enemies close in on him, but is being too cocky for his own good when he asks for it. robert ryan delivers the best performance in the film as the governor of new mexico. mario brega and arthur kennedy are also great here.this movie is very good, but it doesn't stand out to me as being one of the best spaghetti westerns out there. it's lacking too much in style to be in the same league as any of the great ones. it does have some cool spaghetti overtones, but overall it's a bit too much like an american western. this is especially evident in the music score, which is ok as movies go in general, but pretty dull by euro-western standards. the soundtrack kind of reminds me of the music from "the unforgiven." although there is an interesting story here, it is told in a manner which is a bit too conventional for my tastes. if a spaghetti western fan and a hollywood western fan had to watch a movie together, this one would be the perfect compromise.all of this is not to say that anyone should avoid this film. i did enjoy watching it very much. as i said, it is a very well-done film and i recommend it to anyone who likes westerns, spaghetti or otherwise.

the cast alone tells you this will be a notch above the usual italian western. veteran actors robert ryan and arthur kennedy team up with alex cord who, at the time, seemed on the verge of stardom. the result is a movie that's both off-beat and down-beat and yet it'll satisfy those who seek more from a western than just gunplay. especially interesting here is the character played by alex cord. one expects the "hero" in these westerns to be taciturn and introspective, but "clay mccord" is an extreme example and, surprisingly enough, he's often shone in a passive, even weak position. much is made of the fact that he fears falling prey to the epileptic fits which immobilized his father, and in these moments of helplessness he's either at the mercy of those who wish to harm him or those who wish to help him. to emphasize his passivity, clay mccord -- don't you love that name? -- is often shone stripped to the waist as if he were little more than an attractive plaything being put on display. there's even a strong masochistic streak in his nature, most in evidence when he's used as a punching bag by his enemies and then suspended by his wrists and left hanging above the middle of a street. not only does he often fail to protect himself, but mccord is equally ineffective in protecting those around him. nearly everyone who helps him is killed. while "a minute to pray, a second to die" is far from being a complete success, it has a depth and a tone which sets it apart and causes it to linger in the memory. it's also a good showcase for alex cord whose career tended to decline after this point following a few promising years in the mid-1960s. he must have been about 36 years old when he filmed this -- in his physical prime -- and the scene of him hanging by his wrists, bare-chested and sweaty, is a memorable piece of cinematic "beefcake."

there are a number of reviews that comment on the cast of this film. suffice it to say that alex cord plays a strong lead opposite robert ryan and arthur kennedy. what concerns me is that many of you may not be aware of the (at least) two existing versions of this film. in the u.s. version clay mccord gains amnesty from governor lem carter and then rides out of town redeemed. i agree that ending is less than satisfying. however, in the original italian cut clay mccord rides out of town (weaponless as he has turned in his pistols to the governor) and is bushwhacked by the bounty hunters that have been slowly depopulating the bandit town of escondido. the bounty killers are excited at the prospect of splitting the $10,000 reward but are disappointed to find mccord's amnesty agreement in the corpses pocket. as they ride away one is heard to comment,"if this amnesty keeps up i'm gonna start hunting buffalo !" . this alone takes a minute to pray...a second to die and places it on an even playing field with movies like keoma and the big gundown. as the end credits say in the italian cut "fine".

a charming movie enhanced by the musical and vocal background, especially during the competition. my understanding is that there was never a soundtrack but could you, through your sources, advise me where i might get information on the singer and the likelihood of getting a copy of the song he sang. your help would be appreciated. the song really touched me and my wife and we would like to secure a copy wherever possible so that we might play it as background music when we have our family and friends over for our "italian nights". if you are able to get this information to us we would be eternally grateful. even if you can advise of the studio contact so that we might go direct.regards,john payling

i loved this movie, it was cute and funny! lauren holly was wonderful, she's funny and very believable in her role. costas mandylan was also very good, nice to look at too!! brenda vaccaro, as usual was a pleasure to watch, she did a great job with her character. it was a pleasure watching a movie that is funny, interesting and can be watched by the whole family. it's difficult to find nice wholesome movies anymore. thank goodness for the hallmark movies, they are wonderful! i wish i could buy it, if anyone knows where i could purchase this movie, please let me know!! i have purchase several hallmark movies and am very happy with them. i hope i can buy this one!!

marco poloni (costas mandylor) was born into a baking family in the bronx. although the polonis have been well known for their confections over the decades, the business has fallen on hard times. meanwhile, grace carpenter (lauren holly) is a most talented dessert maker in manhattan but, she can not seem to land a prime confectionery position because of the glass ceiling. an accidental meeting between marco and grace results in a conversation about a possible solution for them both. there is a high profile bake-off, the golden whisk, taking place in the near future and marco wants grace to partner with him. there is a hefty amount of "dough", haha, at stake for the winners, enough to set grace up in her own business and save the polonis eatery, too. reluctantly, grace agrees. but, there are complications. some of the judges and fellow contestants may have past issues with both grace and marco. then, too, although marco and grace both feel some sort of attraction for the other, grace has a long standing, very rich boyfriend. can marco and grace win the contest? this is a lovely film for the romantic at heart. first, there is the nice cast. holly has always been a lovely actress with a notable husky voice that furthers her attractions. in this film, she is perfectly cast as the determined but beautiful grace. mandylor, a newcomer, delights, too as the good-looking rival baker. the rest of the actors, including the wonderful brenda vaccaro as marco's mother, is quite nice. as a hallmark movie, the costumes, sets, and production amenities are beyond reproach and the script still manages to seem fresh and funny, despite some familiar themes. treat yourself, romcom lovers, to a most sweet confection by securing a viewing of this film. it is definitely the movie equivalent of a big box of quality chocolates.

i watched this movie because of costas mandylor and lauren holly. i adored them together on picket fences, so it was a treat to see them together again. this was not the best movie ever made, but it was cute. very predictable, but sometimes mindlessly fun movies are just what i need.the desserts were gorgeous, and i wanted to eat all of them. i did love it when that one fell apart though. i bet it still tasted good.costas and lauren still had the great chemistry that they had back on picket fences, and i swooned as they kissed in this movie.i wouldn't watch this again, but it was a great filler for one night.

this is a great valentine's day gift. a gorgeous guy and a pretty girl fall in love while trying to beat the competition at a baking contest. very romantic. i'm a real fan of costas mandylor since his days at picket fences and he hasn't lost his appeal. lauren holly is still lovely and adorable and the two still have great chemistry together. the supporting cast was good as well. seeing all those wonderful desserts being made was a delicious sight in itself. i loved that costas and lauren teamed up to win in the baking competition and in love. this is the kind of film that satifies all palates, romantic and otherwise. hallmark always shows excellence in their programming and this is no exception. the whole family can view this film. also shows that sometimes love triumphs over any adversity. i found myself sighing and wishing for more for this film and also yearning for those wonderful desserts. i recommend this film highly for all ages. a great treat for all.

this is a made for tv movie by hallmark. hallmark has always made quality movies that are family orientated. just desserts is a boy and girl fall in love while working together movie. two bakers competeing for a $250,000 prize against a field of professional bakers. it is fun and light hearted. the desserts look great. the movie has a catchy, upbeat little song played during the competition. i assume that it is a made for the movie song by roger bellon. to bad that no soundtrack is available. i would really like to get a copy of the song. i don't even know the name of the song, because the credits are squished at the end of the movie to make room for hundreds of promos. anyway, the cast is great. it is always nice to see brenda vaccaro. she is very bubbly and upbeat. lauren holly is always a plus and costas mandylor rounds out the good guys with a wonderful performance. professional chef wolfgang puck has a guest appearance. the movie is worth watching.

sometimes, you're up late at night flipping through the stations, bored out of your mind, and wanting some light and fluffy romantic comedy that doesn't make you feel bipolar. and this movie fit that exact billing. sure, the plot was ripped right out of the 1930s....the writing as schmaltzy as the hallmark greeting card company's legendary poetry, and the one- dimensional characters were played by a cast plucked straight from central casting - but it was cute, and exactly what i needed last night. lauren holly and costas mandylor have great chemistry together - i liked it on "picket fences," and i'm happy to say they still have it over 10 year later. costas mandylor, at 41, is still possibly one of the handsomest men to grace the screens since ol' rudy valentino kicked the bucket 80 years ago. rrrowrr! bonus points for casting that funny man who used to be on the roller skates on that show about the cartoon lady. i always thought he was something straight out of a hepburn-grant comedy. bravo!some people will probably say this was the corniest piece of cinema ever made, and i would probably have to agree - but come on! it's on the hallmark channel. what were you expecting? just sit back, relax, eat some sesame sticks, and watch a sweet little movie with two cute people and down a bottle of zinfandel. trust me, you'll love and accept the schmaltz a whole lot more, and then you can go to sleep dreaming about costas mandylor swimming in a sea of tempered chocolate feeding you petit fours with minty fresh chocolate icing. yummo! (ps. now i have a hankering for petit fours. thanks a lot, hallmark!)i really wish the evil girl had been cast with rachel ray, and maybe that dishy food nerd alton brown as the announcer instead of the creepy dude with the van dyk beard. shudder! that would have made my night. but hey, check out "just desserts."

it is to typical of people complaining about something when they no nothing about it...so this is about a gay man falling for a straight women. first of all...this is a true story so you cant say its not believable second its written by a gay man so the whole thing about this being against the gays are just plain stupid. personally i think this was the best love story i've ever seen. and i am very pro gay. i think this shows that real love is about personality not just looks and sex. and it has nothing against anyone who is gay, straight or bi unlike so many other shows. maybe we in europe take to it more cus most tv here are a bit deeper and make you think more then american tv...plus we don't fear when it comes to showing certain things.if you want something funny with one of englands best (lesley sharp) and you want to see a decent believable love story without too much sap this is for you. i know i love it

it's very easy to figure out why the new professionals was a dud, at least in new zealand: it didn't just follow in the footsteps of the original, it followed bodyguards, which out-professionaled the show considerably with its boss-and-two-agents formula. cmdr mcintyre was a latter-day george cowley: tough on his team, but one who would defend them to the death against others. the shadow the show cast was huge.well, not as huge as it should have been in the uk. here, it was networked in prime-time. it was even marketed in the promos as, 'they are the professionals.' someone else obviously noticed the difference. we were fortunate enough not to have this show released in different regions at different time slots.it was the high production values that sealed the deal for me. as other reviewers have noted, it followed the great british tradition of the one-hour actioner, but blended in personal elements at the same time. there's a slight undercurrent of something developing between liz and ian, though that never distracted one from the real plot. most episodes were based around inflammatory diplomatic incidents, the sort of thing that helps spooks along from time to time.unlike many 2000s shows, the plot was not sacrificed at the expense of fancy-pants photography or over-stylish direction. directors like christopher young kept the pace up and did their job. they made use of good locations, making bodyguards slicker than if it had been shot on back roads and alleyways. it was contemporary, it would still stand up beautifully today, and it was one of the better examples of the british actioner in the 1990s, showing that the uk can still do them better than anyone else.maybe except for the germans and their cobra 11.

when i first saw this show advertised to be on australian tv back in the late 90's i ignored it thinking it was just capitalizing on the kevin costner movie 'bodyguard'. but then i caught an episode and i wish i had watched it from the start. the partnership between sean pertwee and louise lombard was so well acted and the structure of each episode was extremely entertaining. it wasn't an overblown tv show that you can tell spent most of its energy in making things explode so that they could put that clip in the commercial to lure audiences and then not deliver on any other level. the show delved into the lives of the two main characters and thats what made it interesting. the stories for each episode where also well written with interesting guest stars who were good actors. and of course there was a lot of action and intrigue which is always good. but what was great was that there was humour, and it flowed naturally from the characters, it didn't appear contrived. it was british but in a good way, and if this show was made in america it would no doubt be on dvd by now. i don't know why british tv production companies are not interested in releasing this show on dvd. it was a great show and deserves a dvd release.

without doubt a great all round show that if shown today would attract a huge following.bodyguards was only 6 episodes and a trailer,but deserved a few more series to really bring it up-to speed.with outstanding performances from the highly talented and versatile sean pertwee and the dynamic louise lombard,it really did put it up with the likes of the proffesionals,the sweeney and thief takers.the story lines are based on the diplomatic protection services and with great filming and story lines and scene locations,it stood out from some of the junk that gets churned by other tv production companies.i do not think that it has been shown on terrestrial tv either,such as sky or freeview,witch is a shame as if it were to be shown nowadays,i am sure it would get a large viewing audience.so i hope one day the guys at carlton tv decide to release it on dvd,cheers,nick.

my father took me to see this film when it was released in 1976. i was but a child and it scared the crap out of me. so much so that i had to leave the theatre during a particularly claustrophobic tunnel scene as it was too intense for me!!! i went home to the safety of my family. i saw the film all the way through as i got older and thoroughly enjoyed it. shame about the men in monster suits, though. if you overlook the cheapness of the production and delve deeper, you'll find an excellent performance by cushing, a stunning opening score, some nice photography and the ever reliable mr.douglas mcclure, my childhood hero!british police constables guarding the whitehouse at the end! titty bang bang cave woman! monsters with beaks! actors in monster suits gliding on wires! this has it all! superb.

due to the fact that in 1976 there were no cgi i felt that the movie was quite watchable. the studio productions were very good and very elaborate. the background effects were very believable and always appeared as if they were part of the whole set. the actors did ok considering the premise of the film being set in a type of jules vern atmosphere where imagination and possibilities of future exploration were at most improbabilities. had i watched this film in 1976 i probably would have been in awe of the ability of man to build a machine that could travel to the earths core. i still wonder to this day why we are not all flying around in our cars but i digress. mcclure and cushing have their funny moments, mostly from their facial expressions toward each other which of course makes the film somewhat campy which i loved. the 'monsters' left something to be desired but the story had a good premise although i feel as though some other sort of 'thing' could have been more believable under those circumstances. all in all quite watchable for its time and fun now.

this movie was the second movie i saw on the cinema as a child. it scared the living crap out of me. so much so that i asked my father if we could leave halfway through.nowadays, the only people leaving halfway through are the ones who have a good taste in movies.i, however, still have fond memories of this flawed masterpiece of awfulness. doug mcclure and peter cushing in the same movie! great! monsters made of polypropylene substitute. scary stuff. a rubber monster is, when you think about it, is even scarier than a real monster.the astonishing thing about this movie is how good the score is. truly rousing stuff.there's also plenty of prehistoric tit on show, too. nice.

shame on you if you give this film a low rating. how can you not like a film that has doug mcclure, peter cushing, silly rubber monsters, fights, (and for the guys, that woman that was the baddie's henchwoman in the spy who loved me and one of the seventies sinbad films, not wearing very much of whom my mother said "she wasn't picked for the colour of her eyes"), lava, silly wigs and a daft victorian drilling machine very much like the one used in the old thunderbirds series? whoever watched this film and slagged it off was watching it for the wrong reasons. it may be crap, but is definitely good crap. they don't make 'em like they used to, sigh......

context is everything when one goes to rate a movie. when rating this movie one has to consider the time in which it was made. we didn't really know what the inside of the earth was in those days so you can't rag on the movie too much for the plot (based on a much older book). for the era, this was top notch special effects and the production quality was great. i watched this movie in a masterfully restored hd master. for the time the makeup and effects almost make the guys in the rubber suits look plausible as a monster-thing. this is pure movie cheese complete with bad rubber suits, models, and creepy costumes. awesome. ps doug mcclure rocks!

the main criticism of at the earth's core is that it's cheap, the special effects are bad and so on and so forth. yes, some of the special effects are painfully bad but what a lot of folks overlook about it is that it's actually quite fun, which is very important in my book.in comparison, just look at the latest star wars films: they have the latest, greatest special effects created by the latest technological advances which are capable in creating stunning visual effects as far reaching as the human imagination can imagine and yet, with all the razzle dazzle, those films were as exciting as a funeral. as yoda would say, fun they're not! in other words, who cares if the fx aren't the greatest when the spirit of the film is fast-paced, humorous and clearly set on the side of action. i love everything about at the earth's core: the contrast between stodgy victorian england vs the wild other-worldly, colorful setting of pellucidar, the cast of characters, the concept of a lost underground world, the telepathic pterodactyls, the human slaves rebelling, jubal the ugly one (lol!), the inspired teaming of peter cushing (who's great!) and doug mcclure, the excellent music (it's really good), cinematography by the amazing alan hume and last but not least, caroline munro. she's effing sexy in this movie. one of the sexiest b-movie babes ever captured on screen.seriously, anyone who doesn't like this movie doesn't know what fun is. gimme at the earth's core over any turgid star wars prequels any time! at least it has caroline munro, which no cgi fx can ever recreate.

his john dark-kevin connor fantasy adventures were a mainstay of summer holiday movies in the days before star wars: they weren't masterpieces, they didn't boast state-of-the-art special effects, but they were exactly what an audience of kids wanted from a film back in the mid 70s.at the earth's core catches just the right tone for the appropriately named burroughs' pulp adventure about victorian inventor peter cushing and the inevitable doug mcclure ending up in the underground world of pelucidar and battling its evil telepathic fighting dinosaurs. this time the puppets are gone in favour of men in monster suits, which is a lot more fun if you're willing to suspend your disbelief, and if you're not there's always caroline munro's cleavage to look at. aside from what may well be peter cushing's worst performance, an irritating but dottier rehash of his movie dr who ("you can't mesmerise me, i'm british!"), it's easily the best of the john dark-kevin connor-doug mcclure fantasy adventures, surprisingly well directed and boasting an atmospheric use of colour. never especially good at exterior scenes, alan hume's photography gains immensely from the control a studio set gives him (the film was shot entirely on soundstages) to paint a luridly vivid world worthy of a pulp novel cover. not high art but definitely great saturday matinée fun.

this film screened at the american cinematheque's egyptian theatre in hollywood on april 7, 1999. it was described in the american cinematheque schedule as follows:"tomorrow is another day 1951, warners, 90 min. steve cochran's an ex-con who's never been with a woman. ruth roman is a dime-a-dance dame with no use for sappy men. a hotel room, a dirty cop, a gunshot - the perfect jump-off for a fugitives-on-the-run love story. this virtually unknown noir is felix feist's masterwork, packed with revelatory set-pieces. cochran was never more vulnerable, roman never sexier. imagine gun crazy scripted by steinbeck - it's that good."i just saw this film, and i agree with every word of the above description.

alfred hitchcock's "saboteur" (1942) (not to be confused with another hitchcock film, "sabotage" made in 1936 which has a completely different plot) is not the master of suspense greatest film. it dose not have the depth of "vertigo" (1958) nor the brooding atmosphere of "rebbeca" (1940) and it certainly dose not have the emotional impact and acting talent that can be found in "notorious" (1946), but what it dose have is thrills, adventure and a nail biting climax. the two leads, admittedly, are quite weak. it is easy to understand why hitchcock wanted gary cooper for the robert cummings role and barbara stanwyck for the role that was taken by priscilla lane. also, the patriotic speeches that cuumming says (that were written by dorothy parker) have dated badly, and the encounter with circus troupe is poorly done (the beard on the bearded lady is clearly false). however, the last half hour is edge-of-your-seat viewing, the climax atop the stature of liberty is very well done, and the film is a clear predecessor of "north by northwest" (1959). the two villains, otto kruger and norman lloyd are very good and the beginning fire at the aircraft factory is a superb sequence. this not the best film hitch made, but it is surly one of his most entertaining.

a man is wrongfully accused of killing his friend in an aircraft plant fire, and must travel cross-country to avoid the police and discover the true sinister nature of the situation at hand. a plot line that was later used to fuel hitchcock's classic north by northwest, saboteur benefits from some very good performances as well as some masterful suspense sequences from the master himself.for any hitchcock fan, the plot is a bit too familiar, but he was always able to infuse the story with its own memorable supporting characters and charades. here, the likable and charming robert cummings is the lead and soon finds himself visiting many strange and quirky characters, not withstanding a troupe of circus performers, a rich businessman with hidden motives, and a blind loner who shows him the best way to judge someone.in terms of sheer originality and quality, this does lack in some areas, particularly the motive of the antagonists. however, there is some nice chemistry between cummings and his lead lady, the much under-appreciated priscilla lane as well as a truly moving performance as the blind man by vaughn glaser. the best part is the final sequence, which perfectly mirrors what hitchcock would use later in north by northwest, only this time the climax is atop a statue in new york. certainly not his best, but the master of suspense gives us some great moments to wait for.

this is the second hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second hitchcock film i've seen in full, the first was rope, which i really enjoyed. with saboteur hitchcock was more room to roam free, whereas rope took place all in one room. i didn't enjoy this one as much as rope but that's not saying this is a bad film, it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more.it seems like a film hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones. as a thriller, i feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the states. the climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension. the sound design is almost non existent. you can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them, but the important things are missing, the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve, the need of music to amp of the tension, all missing. intentional no doubt, yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene. then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside.the film doesn't feel like it should either, they are almost globe trotting from place to place, yet it feels more confined. the script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving.the performances are there, but nothing amazing. everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page. the relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work. the one stand out is otto kruger, who has that rich, ego, evil persona down pat.in the end, i wanted more from this one. i understand it's one of hitchcock's least exciting films, but i did have a good time watching it. i can recommend it, just not enthusiastically.

bob cummings is excellent in this, as this technically brilliant hitchcock film really does not get the fame as some of his other films but is very watchable even today. priscilla lane proves in this one that she can hold her own with other blonde's that worked with hitchcock later. she just did a handful of films after this which makes her almost forgotten today.there are sequences in this that will remind the viewer of set ups in later films by the director. the acting is so well done and the story so well done that this film is still very entertaining today. every person in the cast performs well. there are several great backdrops in the black & white film.this was the first film at universal for hitchcock. long run between the feature films he did at universal, plus the television series, hitchcock would make as much box office for the studios as anyone who worked there. this fact gets lost in film history.norman lloyd is well cast as the real bad guy in this film. the story moves along really well including hitchcock's only filmed western sequence. this film is very good with lots of great work by everyone involved making it.

i am a massive hitchcock fan, ever since seeing "rear window" on television. "saboteur" is not hitchcock's best for me though, it is very good but not a masterpiece. it does have its faults, some parts are rather slow moving and as a consequence of it being written off in a hurry the script felt rather incomplete. but hitchcock's direction is superb, and the performances weren't that bad. while robert cummings and priscilla lane both do a good enough job, otto kruger and norman lloyd come very close to stealing the show. the story is good, about a wronged man on the run, very similar themes used in "39 steps" and "north by northwest", and cleverly provides some much needed escapism. the music score was absolutely outstanding; the music in the opening title sequence was phenomenal, almost like a distorted march, and i liked the digs at tchaikovsky's 1st piano concerto and beethoven's 5th symphony. the cinematography is also crisp and smooth, the scenery and landscapes almost dazzling and there are also a number of very effective scenes. namely the statue of liberty climax, but the circus troupe encounter and the radio music city hall shoot-out is also on the money. overall, not hitchcock's best, but definitely worth the look. 8/10 bethany cox

overall, this is entertaining and odd film. don't try to make sense of it. there are more holes in the story than a computer could keep up with, but robert cummings and a cast of minor characters are mostly fun to watch in this "fugitive"-like story.unlike the popular tv show and then 1993 movie, this fugitive isn't looking for a one-armed man, but a two-armed nazi saboteur by the the name of "frank fry." cummings ("barry kane") gets blamed when a defense plant blows up in los angeles and goes on the lam looking for the man who did it (fry) to clear his name.the first 40 minutes or so are very tense and interesting. then priscilla lane ("pat martin") enters the story, and it starts to bog down a bit with some sappy dialog. director alfred hitchcock often did that with his female characters, to the point i wonder if he had a clue how woman talked. lane's character here was a little lame.actually, the villains played by otto kruger ("charles tobin") and norman lloyd ("frank fry") were the best, in my opinion......just fascinating. kruger's acting and dialog was especially good.if you haven't seen this film but saw hitchcock's well-known "north by northwest," you'll chuckle at the ending and really enjoy it. instead of a climactic scene at mount rushmore, here we have a memorable last 10 minutes at the state of liberty. as usual, hitchcock camera angles are great and fun to view.

i really loved seeing this movie. i think it's a brilliant, underrated alfred hitchcock movie. everyone is familiar with the famous statue of liberty scene, but there's a really great movie before that. robert cummings is great in what i consider to be his greatest role, and the beautiful priscilla lane shows that she has a lot of talent too. but i think norman lloyd gives the best performance. his character, fry, is so evil and devious. even though he's not in it for very long, the movie wouldn't be the same without him."saboteur" is a great movie that every hitchcock fan should see. i give it a 10 out of 10!!

this movie is a masterpiece of brilliant acting and timely patriotic sense of pride in america. the nazi saboteurs of the 40's are replaced by the middle east terrorists of today. the intent is the same, to terrorize, disrupt lives, destroy property, and kill americans! we see a wrongly accused barry (bob cummings) on the lamm, trying to uncover the real nazi terrorists plot, meeting the beautiful pat (priscilla lane) and together, they travel to new york chasing the devious and evil saboteur fry, played expertly by norman lloyd. along the way, they encounter the also very sinister otto kruger playing the leader of the nazi saboteur ring but disguised as a distinguished model citizen, where barry seeking saboteur fry, takes him into his confidence, only to handed over to the local law enforcement. he escapes, meets a kindly blind gentleman and his niece, enter priscilla lane. from there, barry and pat travel to soda city cal., run into the west coast saboteur gang heading east. they trail ends up in the mansion of a unlikely new york socialite. the going gets tough when the bad guys kidnap pat from barry and he goes after her with reckless abandon. the movie climax is the famous statue of liberty scene which is excerpted in many compilations. this is a true, blue patriotic flag-waving performance at it's best and what is wrong with that! see this movie if you don't see another hitchcock film. you will be swept up in the patriotic furore and the love interest between cummings and lane will make you wish they had been paired in other movies. she is the beautiful, ideal girl next door, often underrated, her talent shows through in this film. see it and go bless america!

hitchcock once gave an interview where he said he like to direct screenplays that had an ordinary person minding their own business, who's accidentally caught up in an awful chain of events that they can't get out of until the dastardly plot that's behind their troubles is resolved. that way, the audience can feel more sympathy for the hero. we certainly do in this fine film. barry kane is only trying to help his fellow-man out by performing acts of kindness and consideration, like helping fry pick up the letters he dropped at the factory. barry even returns a lost $100 bill to fry later on...that was big money in 1943!! it's barry's acts of christian kindness that get him into trouble and soon, he's wrongly accused of sabotage and murder and will likely hang if he can't clear himself. similar to the 39 steps in plot, the hero travels cross-country where he discovers plans for further acts of terrorism by fascisistic cells, an arch-villain who nobody could believe to be a closet-nazi, and a beautiful blonde, patricia martin, who first suspects and hates then eventually falls in love with barry kane. hitch's trademark touches of humor are here, too. patricia is a billboard model who's various roadside ads are a help and comfort to barry as he hitches a ride with the bad guys, all the way from las vegas to nyc. we meet a trucker who's a one-man comedy act "someone convinced my wife it was stylish to eat three meals a day." field employees of the fascist spy ring grouse about being forgotten or ignored by the "suits" just as if they were working for some legit enterprise. during a chase scene into a cinema, audience members laugh at the action of a schlocky comedy/gangster flick as the saboteur cell shoots it out for real with the good guys and accidentially kills a guffawing movie-patron. awful for the dead old man, but funny! hitch liked to use famous monuments in his movies and this is the best instance, with the statue of liberty as backdrop and ironic icon! it works even better than the mt rushmore scene in nbnw.

i consider saboteur as hitchcock's first "american" film, because the story takes place completely in u.s.there are brilliant scenes in this film. statue of liberty scene, barry kane jumping into the water from the bridge, water fall scene are amazing. its not hitchcock's fault that he didn't get the actors he wanted. hitchcock originally wanted gary cooper for the leading roles in foreign correspondent and saboteur. but gary cooper wasn't interested in doing a thriller. another reason why hitchcock didn't get big stars was because he wasn't one of top directors. although rebecca was a huge success, still most of film's success went to producer david o. selznick. for example, david o. selznick got best picture oscar for rebecca. and hitchcock didn't get a best director oscar for rebecca. hitchcock started getting some attention after foreign correspondent (1940). but universal gave him a low-budget for saboteur (1942). hitchcock tried to get joel mccrea for this film, because he was willing to work with hitchcock again with a low salary. he enjoyed working with hitchcock in foreign correspondent (1940). but he was unavailable. so the role went to robert cummings. hitchcock called robert cummings "a competent performer." i thought he did his best. he was a less known actor who was willing to play a role when many big actors refused to play the leading male role.as for leading female role, hitchcock wanted margaret sullavan or barbara stanwyck for the leading role. they weren't interested either. so universal decided to give the role to priscilla lane. i read in a book that this was one of her favorite films.i also liked the scene at blind man's house. that is my favorite scene. if we listen closer to the dialogue in scenes that happen in uncle philip's house, then we will see how intense it is. uncle philip (blind man) was studying barry kane's character the moment he entered his house. the moment barry entered his house, he heard barry's handcuffs. through conversation, he realized that barry kane isn't a criminal at all. we also see his hearing ability through those scenes. for example, barry hears the sound of a car says "is that a car coming?" uncle philip says "2 cars i think." uncle philip was right. we see 2 cars in the next scene. priscilla lane did a fine job playing her role. she was no big star. but i thought her performance was really good. another brilliant scene in uncle philip's house is the scene where he asks priscilla lane (patricia martin) "are you frightened, pat? is that what makes you so cruel?" i thought otto krueger played the villain brilliantly. hitchcock wanted harry carey for the villain. but he refused. harry carey is famous for his role mr. president in "mr. smith goes to washington." i want to mention more about this film. but i think my post is getting too long.every hitchcock film is special in its own way. i am sure hitchcock fans will like this film. i rate 10 out of 10.

i thoroughly enjoyed this film, which in many ways, as hitchcock did on several occasions, was a first attempt at a plot which he re-shot later in his career. possibly the most amazing thing about it, however, is how faceless the lead characters are. after watching, one remembers murray alper as the jovial truck driver, vaughan glaser's touching turn as a blind "patriot", the unforgettable traveling freak show and of course otto kruger as the suave and sophisticated villain, all of whom completely overshadow bob cummings as the rather wooden fugitive (compare that bridge jump to harrison ford's similar stunt in andrew davis' "the fugitive") and priscilla lane whose change of heart and subsequent love towards cummings is never quite believable.the other major support player is, of course, hitchcock himself who bookends the film with 2 extraordinary stunts. many people criticise the older films for their lack of realistic special effects. my feelings are that with lack of technology, to even attempt and convey what the director wants to show is an amazing achievement.obviously this film carries an anti-fascist message, made at the time of the second world war, but being a hitchcock it is never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on the action. well worth checking out, especially for the support roles.

there are many familiar hitchcock elements (of previous and later films) and this time they mix to a jolly, but hardly suspenseful piece of entertainment. you can tell that dorothy parker had a hand in the script, the most memorable scenes are the dialogues of hero cummings with the blind man and his encounter with a rather bizarre group of circus people. the famous climax on the statue of liberty seems a bit heavy-handed - judged by today´s standards, but also compared to other hitch monument finals (e.g. blackmail, north by northwest).

cummings is falsely accused of sabotage and goes on the lam, looking for the real culprit. the familiar hitchcock theme of a man wrongly accused of a crime is nicely played out in this entertaining fare that has elements of "the thirty nine steps" and "north by northwest," although it is not as good as either of those classics. there are some impressive set pieces, including the finale on the statue of liberty. the plot is implausible and unconvincing and, after a terrific start, it seems to run out of steam. cummings is likable if somewhat stiff in the lead. lane is the blonde but not the cool variety of the director's later films. the supporting roles are generally well played.

ah, hitchcock! it's hard to find a bad hitchcock movie until he lost it after the birds (1963) and saboteur proves the point. having admired most of this director's work for many years, i had managed to skip this one, perhaps from lack of interest in priscilla lane and robert cummings as lead actors. i was of course familiar with the statue of liberty climax from having seen it repeatedly in film retrospectives but i wrongly assumed the story leading up to it might not hold my interest. was i wrong! the suspenseful plot gets cooking right off the bat through a chance encounter between the bad guy saboteur and the good guy wrongly accused protagonist and continues zooming along through a series of further chance encounters and narrow escapes. familiar hitchcockian elements are all there: the innocent person wrongly accused of a crime; people not being what they seem to be; dramatic or unlikely locations that intensify the suspenseful scene being played out within them (an airplane hangar, a ranch, a bridge from which the handcuffed hero hurls himself to escape the police, a sumptuous charity ball in a palatial mansion, an upper floor of a skyscraper, and finally the torch of the statue of liberty).throughout is humor provided by supporting players, generous dollops of early ww2- vintage social comment, moments of human warmth where suffering people find it within themselves to lend a hand to help a fellow human, getting nothing in return  in short, there was always a basic humanity at the core of hitchcock, however grisly the trappings - a sensational cast of supporting players, chiefly otto kruger as the slickest villain this side of george sanders (his broadway credits include the male lead in noel coward's private lives  and that says it all) and weaselly norman lloyd as the titular saboteur, not to mention alma kruger  no relation to otto  as a prominent society dowager involved in fifth column intrigue (her character foreshadows that of claude rains's mother in notorious). priscilla lane does a fine job with a difficult role. for most of her early scenes we can't tell whether she believes the hero to be innocent or guilty and she seems constantly to shift her opinion, not coming over to his side fully until late in the proceedings. one cannot ascertain whether her acting is at fault or whether we are meant to be kept in a state of uncertainty, but the plot developments are so swift, fun and clever that we really don't care what she thinks.then there are the peculiar hitchcock touches that have nothing to do with the plot. twice the lane character pauses to get change for a quarter  once to reimburse her kidnappers for an ice cream soda and again to make a call from a phone booth. why these scenes were inserted are anybody's guess, perhaps to make the film seem more realistic and thus heighten the believability and suspense? or perhaps to give the audience a moment to catch its breath? some of the characters are over the top  the garrulous truck driver, the impossibly kind and trusting blind man living alone in a spotlessly maintained forest cabin, the political-philosophy-spouting "human skeleton" and other members of the circus caravan who hide the protagonists from their pursuers.

screenwriters peter viertel, joan harrison, and (of all people) dorothy parker enable director alfred hitchcock to expound on what may have been his favorite movie theme: innocent man, wrongly fingered for crime, takes it on the lam. hitchcock, who some credit with originating the story, engineers a great deal of suspense in plot about a warehouse worker blamed for the explosion which killed his best friend; he sets out on journey to find the real culprit. plenty of excitement on a grand-scale, with usually-colorless actors (priscilla lane, norman lloyd, alan baxter) doing surprisingly fine work. even eternally-smug robert cummings gets into the proper spirit! *** from ****

an entertaining first draft for "north by northwest", "saboteur" has some wonderful hitchcockian moments (one of the best occurs at a table, when the hero is asked by a woman who hasn't yet seen that he's wearing handcuffs, to give her a plate; trying to do that, he also drops a knife to the floor, exposing himself even more!) but suffers from a poorly chosen lead (whether he's delivering patriotic speeches, romancing priscilla lane, making jokes or trying to look worried, robert cummings is wooden), and from a lack of really distinct villains (oh, there are villains, many of them, but hardly anyone has enough screen time). (***)

i really enjoy this film. it is a look back in time when this nation was truly at risk from nations who either attacked or delared war on us,i.e., the japanese and germans. robert cummings and pricilla lane were excellent in the lead roles. the supporting cast... otto kruger, alan baxter, clem bevins, and norman lloyd were also outstanding. the direction, pace, and finale held and continue to hold my interest. so much so, that i bought my own copy. thank goodness for turner classic movies, they show so many of the truly classic films, including this one.robert cummings was certainly no light weight as an actor and although i am a great fan of gary cooper and joel mccrea, two of my favorite actors, who were first offered the lead role, i don't see what they would have brought to the role that would have surpassed bob cummings' performance.this is a film that i enjoy watching repeatingly and urge others to view.

barry kane (robert cummings) is wrongfully accused on sabotaging a hanger making aircrafts for the war. he goes on the run, meets patricia martin (priscilla lane) along the way, and she joins him to find and bring the real criminals to justice.there are a lot of things wrong with this film. robert cummings was a good actor but he's totally miscast in this role; priscilla lane is pretty but was never a good actress; the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense (and rambles on longer than needed); it wears its patriotism a bit much (but this was made while wwii was in full swing) and there's no ending. it shouldn't work but it does.it's full of bizarre lines and characters that certainly hold your interest.for example: lane says to cummings (while they're falling in love), "i wish i could have met you a hundred years ago" (????!!!!); lane pays a villain for getting her lunch and cummings and lane join a circus troupe briefly while on the run. also hitchcock's direction was (as always) just great--he throws in some truly amazing shots and sequences--especially the statue of liberty climax. this is not one of hitchcock's classic movie but is still very good and worth catching.

you can't help but marvel at hitchcock's early work. "saboteur," for example, is so slick and quick that it's hard to believe he made this film over 60 years ago. there's some propaganda elements but they're woven into the mystery so well that the thing plays beautifully years later. you also get some previews of stuff that hitchcock would do later--like using a national landmark as a backdrop. this time it's the statue of liberty. in "north by northwest," of course, it's mt. rushmore. you'll also recognize things that pop up later in "rear window" and "vertigo" in "saboteur" but let's not give away the show. robert cummings is excellent as is the oh-so-charming otto kruger. look for hitchcock's mini-western in this one. it happens quickly so don't blink.

alfred hitchcock's saboteur is not one of his best-regarded films; made between two vastly more popular and critically praised pictures, suspicion and shadow of a doubt, it's generally regarded as a lesser effort. i agree that the later film is groundbreaking, drawing hitchcock wholly into the american mainstream for the first time, but saboteur is in its way at least as lively as suspicion; its chief flaw being its less than charismatic star players, bob cummings and priscilla lane.in saboteur we find hitchcock feeling his way around america, literally, as its lead character travels from california to new york in search of an arsonist for whose crime he was accused. cummings is very youthful here, and quite engaging. his boyishness (but not immaturity) perfectly suits the character he is portraying, and seems appropriate, as the director, though middle-aged, was in the process of reinventing himself, and an older, more established star might have thrown things off. priscilla lane's spunky heroine, which not a typical type for the director, was very much a common type in american films at the time; and she and cummings provide an openness and a youth the director needed both in his life and work at this time. i cannot imagine older, more solid types,--cooper and stanwyck for instance--doing any better, as they would have, between them, carried, well, too much baggage.as is the norm in hitchcock's films, nothing is as it appears. where saboteur differs from his better known films is that the audience is let in on the game early. though cummings is an accused arsonist, we know that he is innocent. the villains become apparent fairly soon; and the movie hinges more on its plot than its ironies. what pleasures there are are incidental, and here the master does not disappoint. there is an interesting, tod browningish interlude with some circus freaks, who help cummings elude capture. in another scene, reminiscent of james whale's bride of frankenstein, cummings spends some time in the cottage of a blind man, who, as it turns out, is lane's uncle. was the director perhaps studying key american films of the previous decade? whatever the case, these and other offbeat and discursive aspects of the movie give it a playfulness and variety, which, when one adds the factor of quite youthful leads, makes the picture seem like the work of a younger man, still learning his craft.the film's later scenes, in new york, are more suspenseful and typical of the director, as the picture gradually becomes more hitchockian as it moves along. in the end i find it a satisfying work; and as neither cummings nor lane has a dark side as an actor, neither does the movie have one. it is deliberately lightweight, and i suspect semi-experimental; an attempt by hitchcock to see if he could pull off, in an american setting, the sort of story he had done so well in england. he succeeded admirably. the next logical step: shadow of a doubt, a film in which the main character travels east to west, and with a wholly different set of values and plans. 

okay, so it starts very unimaginatively with a narration from the lead character (justine played by laura fraser - an amazing actress in her own right) but it goes on to become something miraculous. it has silly little things that you really shouldn't find funny but do every time. there is an especially memorable moment that sees your jaw dropping to the ground the first time you watch it when the male body of jake, containing justine's female mind, is trying to get used to her new anatomy. i wont spoil it for you, but the second time i watched it was with friends; seeing their faces was brilliant. it makes you cringe, but laugh at the same time. i am also a big fan of the music used. there is a beautiful small band that appears randomly on the street or on a pathway every now and then, but also some gorgeous, yet unknown (often the best), pop songs. it has the feeling of being written for an english cast by an american writer, which does annoy me only a couple of times. overall, this film is hilarious. i am a massive fan of laura fraser's now, after being given his film for my birthday, and expect that, even though some of the cast are little-known to most, you too will enjoy every bit of it.

this film, won't win any awards for greatness. but if you have an hour and a half free and fancy a bit of light hearted entertainment then you could do much worse than watch this...the cast are mostly young and pretty, the script has some genuinely funny moments and the soundtrack is pretty cool too. rupert penry-jones as jake seems to have the most fun, while laura fraser as justine is sweet, likable and funny.i rented it because i like the series 'spooks' that rpj is currently starring in. and here he's young and buff and the perfect eye candy for a girls night in.get some wine and some ice cream and have a chuckle.

i really can't see why people seem to dislike this film. i found it very entertaining (of course the fact that it stars the gorgeous laura fraser is a bonus!) when i first heard about it, i thought it would be along the lines of a role-reversed "weird science" and, to an extent, this is true, however there is a twist which i really didn't see coming. having seen the trailer on the dvd (which i hadn't seen before watching the film) i saw that the "twist" is actually shown in the trailer! very strange.as the film progresses the "weird science" comparison fits less and less, and i think this is the better of the two films. certainly there are some scenes which don't work wonderfully, but these are made up for by the enthusiasm of the young cast.in summary, i'd suggest that this is a fine example of a sci-fi chick flick, and i don't think i've seen many of them!

this is not a serious film, and does not pretend to be, but it is not as bad as some of its reviews, it's title, and the first ten minutes lead you to expect.the plot is very silly, but this adds to the light-hearted fun and enthusiasm which runs through the film. the characters are played sympathetically, and while they do engage in typical teenage angst, they generally avoid the sickly sentimentality usually to be found in this film genre.unusually set in london, sympathetic to geeks, this is well worth a watch if it happens to be on; if you want some tongue-in-cheek silliness, and don't mind suspending your disbelief.

when it comes to any movie that was made in or about the south,the characters are labeled racist or hillbillies or even worse that awful racist term "rednecks". this movie was a murder mystery, plain & simple. it was a great murder mystery & did demonstrate some of human feelings about each others race. the same type of observations made by black character actors toward whits in todays' movies. before watching this movie, one should get the "mississippi burning" chip off of ones' shoulder & enjoy the plot, wonderful acting, & reminiscent scenes of simpler times that while are gone, they will not be forgotten. mr.faulkner did his hometown of oxford,miss. justice by having this movie shot there. the producer noted while shooting the movie there, his stereotypical perception of whites were misconcieved & that he observed white & black townspeople & locals getting along with each other in the same way. so, sit back & enjoy one of mr faulkner's great classics & try to figure out who the killer really is...

had it not been for to kill a mockingbird, this movie would be much more famous. had it not been for gregory peck as addicus fitch, the acting here would be much more lauded. had it not been for william faulkner, perhaps to kill a mockingbird might never have been written in his shadow.i found this movie to be sadly familiar because it showed me that one of my favorite movies, to kill a mockingbird, may not have been as original as i'd always thought it was. perhaps it was inspired by this very similar movie. oh, the "whodunnit" is different, but the underlying story, a lone righteous "white" attorney against a white southern town defending a black man is all too familiar. and, written by a woman, mockingbird concentrates on rape, the ultimate betrayal to a woman while this movie concentrates on brother against brother hatred, the rape a man feels by fraternal betrayal.there's not the depth of mockingbird here. not the comfort that addicus brings with his presence. so you're just left with the sadness that, whether she intended to lift the plot from this movie or not, harper lee's mockingbird reflects. nothing changed in that 10 or so years since the time she may have read faulkner's book and saw his movie while in college in alabama and unconsciously or not took most of it as her own in later years. nothing changed in race relations and some may say nothing has changed even now, these many years later.it's all too sadly familiar, and one wishes there were an addicus of our day to make it all right. where mockingbird leaves you with hope of that, rocking in the arms of addicus and waiting for a morning of better times, this movie leaves you just sad that pride from black people might equal or better the pride of white people. but pride from either is no answer at all.rather, it's the answer of addicus we need, comfort that we are all flawed and that in our frailty we should have mercy, not pride, when facing each other in our differences.

it's too bad iameracing wants to deny the reality of faulkner's and clarence brown's purpose in the creating of the story and film of "intruder in the dust". i suppose the burden of a history of racism is difficult for any southerner to bear and i can understand that. but to say that this film was not specifically about racism is ridiculous and inaccurate. yes (to borrow your use of the upper case) iameracing, there are many many many places where blacks and white people in the south get along quite well. but to deny the way that black people were and sometimes still are forced to live, the conditions and injustices they have had to endure are not imaginary. sometimes black and white people got along because of genuine affection and understanding. sometimes it was only as long as blacks 'knew their place'. the point of making juano hernandez character (in film and print) a somewhat prickly type, not warm and fuzzy, was to underscore the fact that bigotry is wrong in and of itself and human rights are just that for everyone regardless of whether we like a particular individual or not. it would do iameracing good to stop denying the existence of racism and the great harm it has done to americans of all stripes. the fact is that black people (among others) did not, as a rule, not an exception, receive the benefits of the justice system as even-handedly as whites. segregation, discrimination and lynching are historical fact. people like iameracing might claim these things were not as widespread as some think and would probably love to exonerate their ancestors and heroes from any connection with such behavior. it would be a wonderful thing if iameracing's southern ancestors (if any)never participated in any of the horrible racist actions that mar this country's history and i hope they didn't. if that is so congratulations to them but that fact, if true, does not erase the fact that others did. and even if the horrible things that were done to blacks in the south (and other areas, let's not forget the draft riots of the civil war era)were only half as numerous, only a third, does that make them any less horrible? is the murder of ten children the hanging of ten men the sexual assault of ten women any less horrible than the same things happening to a hundred? iameracing asks us to get the "mississippi burning" chip off of our shoulders before we see "intruder in the dust", well i ask you, did the murders of the civil rights activists happen or not? why should that be forgotten? forgiven? maybe. but in order to prevent their recurrence they cannot be forgotten or revised into minor occurrences. the racism that is displayed in "intruder in the dust" is displayed there quite purposely. it is there to make a point. on a cinematically historical level it is also ridiculous for iameracing to discount the racial angle. any viewer of films that were filmed before the 1960's knows that black actors/characters/extras were usually deliberately cast. to judge from our movie history; wars were always fought by middle aged white men; there were no black people in the old west; it was possible to walk down a street in a major city and never encounter a black person; there were no black hospital orderlies,taxi drivers,clerks, salespeople etc. blacks were almost never cast with regard to a role unless race was a factor. if falukner (and brown) had wanted to tell a simple murder story he probably would not have made the hernandez character black. racism exists iameracing. probably for different reasons i am sure, we both wish that it didn't but it does. wanting things to be the way we would like them to be probably can't be helped but it still does not make them so.

a very potent drama of faulkner's small town south dealing with an innocent black man's murder of local ne'er do wll. striking cinematography and good narrative (via flashback) take us through the uneasy relationship between the suspect and the son of his lawyer. a still powerful story that predates the sidney poitier films of racial prejudice. porter hall has a great role as the murdered man's father. trivia: this was actually filmed in faulkner's home town of oxford, miss. with many of the residents used as extras.

i am not a faulkner fan (which is considered sacrilegious, especially since i grew up near the author's hometown); however, i think this is an excellent movie. on par with the quality of the movie "to kill a mocking bird". if you haven't seen it, buy it anyway. it's well worth having in your permanent collection. tcm recently played the movie as a part of the race on film series. i wish they'd play it more often. very moving.on a side note, the folks from oxford, mississippi, will also enjoy seeing the footage of the town square as it was back in the 1940's. the courthouse, city hall, etc.: they're all on screen. i never knew the movie was filmed there until i noticed the familiarity of the buildings. when i saw the arch in the front of city hall, i began to get suspicious. look closely at the pennants on chick's wall: you'll see two for ole miss !

hello there; i would just like to say how much i enjoyed your review and comments about that excellent film 'intruder in the dust'. i believe that the points you made were insightful, intelligent and totally valid. it's also a shame that this film is hardly ever shown on tv these days and that it isn't available on dvd region 2 - i live in england. once again, many thanks for your review. the actor juano hernandez was in another brilliant film, 'young man with a horn', which also starred kirk douglas and lauren bacall. that was a very evocative and stylish film with some superb music. i wish that someone with influence could release the entire back catalogues of films like 'johnny belinda', 'i remember mama', and 'the yearling' on dvd region 2, we love these movies in great britain. i'm not of pensionable age, i'm still reasonably young and my family and i love classic films!!films like these were so beautifully made and they bring back wonderful memories. anyway...! many thanks for your comments!

intruder in the dust (1949) dir: clarence brown production: mgmexcellent 'southern gothic' tale, adapted from the faulkner novel, about a black man, accused of the murder of a white man, who asks a young white boy he has befriended to help him prove his innocence. lucas beauchamp (juano hernandez) is something of an anomaly in this small town. he's a black man who owns the land he lives on and doesn't think much of the diseased social order that mostly keeps the peace here and in many similar small towns. so when lucas is found holding a gun over the dead body of vinson gowrie, shot in the back no less, young chick mallison (claude jarman) (who lucas once saved after chick fell through the ice while hunting on his land) fears that the town finally has the chance to "make lucas a n*****." arrested, and with a very real chance of being lynched before the night is through, lucas reaches out to chick for help, as the only person he knows "not cluttered with notions". chick asks his uncle john, a lawyer, to defend lucas and while the man is initially bothered by his own notions he agrees and they race against the gathering mob to save lucas' life.the film has an uncommon frankness for its time and is mostly free of moralizing. the lawyer character has a tendency to speak incredibly self-aware dialogue that sounds mostly like something from the printed page, but it has minimal impact on the tone. that's a credit to the rich characterization of everyone else. juano hernandez, who had mostly appeared in oscar micheaux films, is superb as the proud lucas. porter hall as the murdered man's father, in maybe the best role i've ever seen him in, and elizabeth patterson as a plucky old lady sympathetic to lucas' case, standout in support roles. the setting is perfectly realized. it is actually filmed in oxford, mississippi, faulkner's hometown. brown also uses the crowd in an effective way, it's always an anonymous mob against a single person (like lucas when he's arrested or john when he's going up to his office), that is very threatening. or the grotesquerie of the whole town gathering at the jailhouse to witness the lynching like it was a parade. of note is an absolutely riveting scene when chick and his friend aleck go evidence gathering in a cemetery. robert surtees (the bad and the beautiful, thirty seconds over tokyo, ben-hur) shot the picture. *** 1/2 out of 4

i've described this film as surprising... this is true in many respects. the subject material (black man wrongly accused), the characters (people you expect to be stereotypes often show uncharacteristic attitudes during the film), the production...all of these factors make for a refreshingly unusual film, especially for its time (1949). the only possible spoilers being the sometimes cheesy dialogue and occasional high moral stance.but, if you happen across it when you weren't planning to watch a film, you might find yourself like me - staying up into the middle of the night just to see what happens.

take a look at those faces alongside the entrance to the jail. they're not the faces of hollywood extras. somebody in production was really smart to take filming to oxford, mississippi, because you can't get that kind of authenticity from a studio backlot. scope out the narrow dusty roads, the frozen earth beneath, and the skeletal trees just barely hanging on. no wonder those faces look hard and unforgiving; they're just reflecting the soil from which they spring. old man lucas (hernandez) better fear for his life, but then he springs from that same hard earth.the movie works because it tells a good story that neither preaches nor sentimentalizes and even has some suspense. old man lucas is not very likable. he's a victim and we sympathize, but he's also haughty and unfriendly. wisely, the script refuses to sweeten him up. that way we're forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on even the less sympathetic. the script also wisely avoids dealing directly with racism since that tends to become preachy and less effective. instead, we're shown how easily prejudice can convict an innocent man and condemn him to a horrible death. so, it's through our common instinct to see justice done that the effects of racism are exposed, a much more effective pathway. it also makes the actions of the sheriff and the lawyer more understandable since they are otherwise part of the jim crow system.note how the movie doesn't attack segregation. it's doubtful that old man lucas would want to mix with whites anyway and there's no hint that even lawyer stevens (brian) wants to cross the color line except to see justice done. no, the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future as symbolized by the kid (jarman) whose head is not yet filled with "notions". he's not exactly friends with lucas, but he has glimpsed the common humanity of being befriended after falling into the frozen creek. the last line of dialogue also shows him siding with his uncle, the lawyer, instead of his more hidebound parents (the dinner table scene is important and easily overlooked). the lawyer might not join a future civil rights march, but the kid might. that's the movie's realistically hopeful side.there was a bunch of racially themed movies during this brief 3 year period, 1949-51, (the well, no way out, home of the brave, lost boundaries). even famously detached mgm got into the mix with this little gem. unfortunately, the mccarthy purges in hollywood put an end to "problem" films that might not serve cold war ends. even so, each of these is worth catching up with, not only because they're good movies, but because even with the passage of 60 years and jim crow, they're still relevant.

this film was set, filmed, and premiered in oxford, miss., the hometown of w. faulkner, the locale of the 1948 book. most of the extras were locals. i've been to oxford, and it has greatly changed. this film features will geer as the sheriff;he was later blacklisted. it was the writers and actors of social dramas such as this film, and grapes of wrath, that were targets of the huac a few years later. i don't recall if the actor playing the young mallison boy (claude jarman jr) did anything after the tv series centennial (1978), but he was terrific in this earlier film. and do not miss elizabeth patterson who later played in little women.

as a fan of wm. faulkner since college, i was especially pleased to see intruder in the dust and for other reasons. my grandfather, also named clarence brown as was the director, grew up in the oxford area having been born near there in 1888. we attended a week long family reunion at oxford in july, 1964 a mere 15 years after filming the movie. it still looked mostly like it does in the film but was going thru a period of civil rights upheaval then as the site of ole miss. my recollection is of its being a nice little college town that summer but i was just an 18 year old college sophomore and white. i was just then beginning to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice but still had a long way to go. anyhow, the movie is well worth watching but the filmmakers must have had to walk a tight rope to get it done there and i would love to know more about that story. now days, oxford is a larger, more modern college town with all the ills that go along with such things and i hope to return again to see how it must have changed socially in the last 40 plus years. juano hernandez should certainly have been nominated for an oscar that year but hollywood was still to bigoted itself to let that happen. other faulkner stories have been filmed so look for them and compare. one of the best was a pbs treatment of the barn burner from about 1985 or so starring tommy lee jones. it really captured the intensity of rural southern whites that faulkner wrote so incisively about so often.

it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time. the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism. plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job! juano hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south. the crowd could really care less about the details--they are just hell-bent on a hanging. and, despite his commitment to the law, the one lawyer in town who has agreed to defend him also assumes he is guilty and doesn't really want to know the truth--just delay the hanging until they could try and convict him and then have a legal hanging! fortunately, a young white man (claude jarmin) begins to wonder about juano's innocence and begins seeking out the truth. at this point, the best character in this wonderful drama is introduced--played by elizabeth patterson (the old lady who later played mrs. trumbull on i love lucy). she single-handedly steals the show as the white person with not only a conscience but the will and determination to stand up for the black man. at one wonderful point in the film, a mob is trying to push past her to get to the prisoner to kill him, but she stands very firm and forces them to back down. there is a lot more to this rather complicated but intelligently written story, but i'll leave it to you to see it for yourself. see it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.by the way, apparently 1949 was a great year for hollywood finally addressing race prejudice head on, as twentieth-century fox also released "pinky"--an equally effective and strong film about racism, interracial marriage and even rape! see both films if you can.

no movie could ever do justice to faulkner's command of the english language. but they did a pretty good job here. lucas beauchamp is exactly the way i pictured him in the book, as is chick. what the movie couldn't really go into was how beauchamp wasn't liked by the negro people either, because he was equally as stubborn. not that it is a bad thing, but from my take on the book that was his attitude toward the world (yet, i got the feeling it was white society's racism that started it and it spilled over into negro society, until that became his attitude toward everyone).the best part of the movie is that you get to see yoknapatawpha county (actually, oxford, mississippi) exactly as faulkner wrote about it (the film was made when faulkner was alive and writing). it doesn't look that much different today. because of this alone, the movie is worth a watch considering it is filmed in faulkner's backyard. a true must see for faulkner fans.

this is easily the best cinematic version of william faulkner's fiction that i've ever seen, and i've seen several of the most prominent ones. filmed in faulkner's hometown of oxford, mississippi, it really captures the feeling of jefferson and yoknapatawpha county. intruder in the dust is not one of faulkner's best novel, but, even if it is a cliché to say this, it would be the crown jewel in any one else's career. it beats harper lee's good but simplistic to kill a mockingbird fifty feet into the ground (i read that one in ninth grade, and that's exactly where it belongs). two of faulkner's most prominent characters play major parts in the film, gavin stevens and lucas beauchamp. stevens is probably the single most common character in all of faulkner's fiction. he's a lawyer and he works easily as a narrator, because, unlike many of his other characters, stevens is a man of logic, not emotion (at least when he's older). lucas beauchamp may be the most prominent of all of faulkner's black characters (he plays a major part in one of faulkner's out-and-out masterpieces, go down, moses); unlike all of the other black folks in yoknapatawpha, he refuses to bow down to any white man. he has pride, and many in the white population find that an execrable quality in a black man. one day, lucas is found standing over a dead white man with a recently-fired pistol in his possession. most of jefferson and the surrounding areas don't see the need for a trial, and everyone's pretty sure that beauchamp will be lynched before the evening's over, or at least the next day, as the murder and arrest occurred on a sunday. beauchamp, on the other hand, declares his innocence and tries to get stevens to help him. stevens refuses; the case seems open and shut. but his young nephew, chick mallison, because lucas had helped him in the past, is willing to help him now.as far as i know, no hollywood film of this period deals with racism as overtly as this one. hollywood films rarely persecute the black population, but instead prefer to relegate them to servant roles. if you're an african american actor, you might as well give up and accept that role as either the mammy, the maid, the servant, or the porter, because that's the only way you'll work. in intruder in the dust, there is to be found one of the most memorable non-porter roles a black actor ever had, lucas beauchamp. and beauchamp, as i described above, is no stereotypical character, and might have been hard for audiences to accept. even today, black characters are usually simple, magical, and kind. the recent arthouse hit far from heaven is a great example of that. beauchamp is kind of a jerk, and he's very stubborn. although he's perhaps a little less so here than he is in the novel, he's not any kind of stereotype. he's a complex human being. juano hernandez plays beauchamp extraordinarily well. i haven't seen the film in a while, but he also appears in robert aldrich's 1955 film, kiss me deadly, as well as the cinematic adaptation of faulkner's final novel, the reivers.all the actors are great in the film. i should also praise quickly claude jarman jr., who has the great role of chick mallison. the novel takes place from his point of view, and he is the conventional hero of the picture. jarman is quite an actor; he captures the character (who also appears elsewhere in faulkner's fiction, narrating, for example, events that happened a decade or more before he was born in the 1957 novel the town) perfectly. he would appear in another great role the next year in the underrated john ford film rio grande. the only other film of clarence brown's that i've seen is national velvet, quite a different picture than intruder in the dust. his job here is exceptional; i really have to credit him with capturing faulkner perfectly. other famous faulkner adaptations are too melodramatic (the long hot summer, filmed in 1958, which i really like despite that) or too cold (tomorrow, filmed in 1972, which i do not like; that coldness is a complete misunderstanding of faulkner). the only other one that really does well according to its source material is douglas sirk's great 1958 filming of pylon (really a different sort of faulkner novel altogether), tarnished angels. 10/10.

an unjustly neglected classic, "intruder in the dust" is one of the great films of the 1940's which has unfortunately slipped into obscurity. based on a story by william faulker, and shot in his hometown of oxford, mississippi, "intruder" tells the story of lucas beauchamp (played with great dignity by juano hernandez), a black man unjustly accused of the murder of a local white man, and a white boy (claude jarman, jr.) who uses this situation as an opportunity to pay a previous debt to beauchamp. terrific acting, especially by two great character actors, porter hall (as the dead man's father) and elizabeth patterson (best known as mrs. trumbull on "i love lucy") as an old woman willing to stand against the townspeople to see that right is done. this straightforward, tense and sincere study of racial bigotry deserves to be seen more.

this is a 1972 disney movie. for the time, i was eleven years old and i thoroughly enjoyed this movie. feeling nostalgic, i purchased the three series dvd's of the dexter riley movies and even now, at age 46, i still enjoyed them. it was all about fantasy, magic, and clean fun. and it still is! i wasn't sure which of the three movies came first then second and last. so now i have the official dates. on december 31, 1969 the computer wore tennis shoes--on july 12, 1972 now you see him now you don't--on february 6, 1975 the strongest man in the world. i still think the middle movie was the best. the special effects were amazing back in 1972 to us kids. i definitely recommend it to all ages.

it may not be a 10 out of 10 but for me the jokes didn't fail. i've seen it many times when i was younger and again on dvd i believe, and i laughed each time.the humor is simple and fun,this film was just one of many small flicks disney was throwing out at the time. i found the parts where the people out of the invisible loop saw people invisible. there expressions were priceless great film, if the opportunity to ever see this arises i recommend seeing it for a good oh fashion laugh. my favorite character in all the dexter series would most definitely have to be dean higgins, i love his voice and hearing him get upset especially seeing his expression at the end was just pure hysterical for me.

this is classic disney at its live action cartoon best! bumbling college student dexter riley (kurt russell) develops a mysterious liquid invisibility formula that actually makes objects disappear and helps him to save his cash strapped college. further experimentation reveals that it works amazingly well on humans too! riley's startling discovery takes some hilarious new twists when a gang of crooks headed by the notorious a.j. arno (cesar romero) steal the formula and attempt to use it for their less-than-legal activities. dazzling special effects and a fast-paced story make this lively film a textbook case of college comedy! i love this movie! this movie has always filled me with a sense of wonder and joy.a pleasant little comedy that the entire family can enjoy. not much violence or sex and absolutely no swearing, makes this a movie that parents can watch with their children.merely one in a series of kurt russell movies set at medvale college. a pleasant little series set in a wholesome america before terrorists, when people valued integrity more than cash! i highly recommend this movie!

dexter (kurt russell) returns from the computer wore tennis shoes for a new adventure that can stand alone. dexter, ever the college student prone to misadventure, has an idea for a formula to render things invisible. dean higgins (joe flynn) is less than impressed and sets his hopes for winning a lucrative science prize with the pupil studying bees. however, the bees sting the student and he turns out to be allergic. there goes that chance for a prize. but, wait, dexter does it! he actually concocts a liquid that makes him invisible. trouble is, a unscrupulous businessman (cesar romero) learns about it and decides he can use that formula, thank you, for something illegal. can he manage to steal the bottle out from under dexter's nose? this is a companion movie to the tcwt but one need not have seen the first film to enjoy this one. russell is a genial leading screw-up who comes through when it really counts. the rest of the cast is also a dream, with flynn, romero, jim bacchus and others showing why their comic abilities are still held in high regard today. the script is just innocent fun that is charming, with the special effects somewhat simple, by today's standards, but effective nonetheless. if you want to sit down and relive a bygone era or just want to share a quality, g-rated film with your family, this is a great choice. although it is over 30 years old, there is a great possibility that even now you will see your loved ones giggle away the blues with a showing of this fine flick.

okay, i'll admit right up front that the inki cartoons made by loony tunes are pretty offensive and i can understand why warner brothers has pulled them off the market. seen today, the huge-lipped and very stereotypical inki is not politically correct. however, the cartoons were well-made and it's a shame they aren't released with some sort of explanatory prologue (such as the one with leonard maltin they included with some recent politically incorrect donald duck cartoons that were recently released on dvd). in other words, throwing out the cartoons completely is to forget our history. plus, inki, little black sambo and other racist cartoons are out there--especially on the internet.this inki cartoon has our little hero out hunting. at first, he's chasing a cute little caterpillar but later accidentally happens upon a lion--a lion that is more than happy to make inki his dinner. however, through all this, a weird minah appears again and again...and eventually you'll see why this bird is so important to the story.cute, well made and clever. i like the inki cartoons. plus, i take pleasure in showing them to extremely thin-skinned liberal friends just to watch them have apoplectic fits or even heart attacks. loads of fun, folks!

if a joke doesn't offend anybody, it isn't funny.the inki cartoons are offensive, no doubt about it. so is rap music. get over it. i suspect that any sane black person will find the inki cartoons hilarious, and that the people who are offended by them white people who still think black's need their patronizing protection against racist humor.seriously, the inki cartoons are funny. it saddens me that, not because anybody is really offended, but because somebody might, just might, be offended, i can't buy inki cartoons or the african queen or song of the south on dvd.

despite looking dated, "inki and the minah bird" is, my opinion, an enjoyable and charming cartoon. the artwork isn't extraordinary, but good enough. this cartoon has no dialogs, just sounds and music, but this combination works out pretty well. the cartoon itself is good, funny, old fashioned, creative, entertaining and amusing.this cartoon also makes the difference because it focus in just 3 characters: inki (the little black girl), the minah bird (a very strange bird) and a hungry lion that wants to have both inki and minah for breakfast - so he chases them both during most of the cartoon.i actually find that lion very handsome, hilarious and cool. i really like that lion. that poor lion is so silly and loser that you have to feel sorry for him. for me, the real enemy is the minah bird, not the lion. at one point, the lion almost eats it - too bad he doesn't get to gulp it, because it deserved to be eaten.back to this animated short, there isn't a single dull or boring moment. at least for me. the only bit that i find stupid is the ending because the bird has a major fight with the lion, steals his teeth and puts them on itself. other than that, i have nothing major to criticize about this, aside the fact that the steak should've definitely have gone for the lion and not the bird.in my opinion, this is a very forgotten and underrated little jewel that should definitely get more credit.

this 60min film shows just how much fun filmmaking can be. it's all in good fun as it plays-out a no holds barred comedy assault on the star trek genre. in "hick trek - the moovie", a group of good 'ol boys are on a mission to stop a group of renegade cats out to destroy the entire redneck federation.can captain jerk stop the villainous fluffy with the power of the r.s.s. bovine and it's cow ray?? she may have nine lives, but he has ten bullets! this cult classic (previously only seen at scifi conventions) is a party favorite. lots of funny moments!

hey, its great not to have to wait for the next star-trek convention to see hick-trek! its a cheesy film by a bunch of treckies with no budget, but a good way to spend an hour. they got most of the special effects right, the dialog is classic trek and it just feels right for a trek-knockoff.

now this is classic. a friend of mine told me about this flick, saying that it's incredibly lame, stupid, retarded, and moronic. he also said that i'd love it. to my surprise, i found it available from netflix and rented it at once. i'm just shocked that i had never heard of it before. if i could give it an eleven, i would.

hick trek is clearly a film that is envious of even an el mariachi-level budget ($7,000). still, the creators are able to pull off decent effects at times (often due to great editing) such as the beamings, the situations aboard the cat ship, and slim t. jerk's unique way of communicating with his ship without use of a traditional communication device.the acting does have its rough spots but the portrayal of "horns" mcboy is excellent and fluffy is certainly not too hard on the eyes.i do wish that the film had been longer than its approximate hour - and that should be seen as a compliment. this movie is a success due to the sincerity and hard work of those involved.

it would be a shame if one has yet to watch speed racer, be it dubbed or subbed (i prefer the dubbed version (which is rare) because it was funny...in a good way). what's great about speed racer is that you're never too old to watch it. go red and yellow!! i first saw this when i was around seven and enjoyed hearing the catchy opening. it disappeared for some time then i saw it again a couple of months ago (i'm 19). imagine the feeling of nostalgia surging in, singing "here he comes, here comes speed racer! he's a demon on wheels~~~" over and over again. anyway, the concept of the mach 5 spawned so many 'ultra-multi-function-special-cars' but none were able to surpass its genius in construction. the other cars just seemed too much. and it wasn't just the races or battling different bosses that made it interesting for me. it was racer-x's mystery persona and how the world of speed racer pretty much 'happened' to revolve around it. they did some tweaking to some story lines from the manga, but it all turned out pretty well. though i can't remember if the show actually revealed how racer-x looked like, in the manga, they did.

sadly, every single person i ask about this series says they've never heard of it. i remember it fondly from my early childhood (i wasn't quite 10 when it came out).my favorite story was "a story short". something about the way the "stone soup" story was woven into a greater story gets me every time. and then the storyteller explains why he has no story to tell, and it becomes a story itself. i've always been a fan of jim henson, and this is just one reason why.i'm adding this dvd on the self with labrynth, the dark crystal, the neverending story, the princess bride, the last unicorn, willow and mirrormask. these are all dvds i share with my siblings who are 6, 5, and 4 yrs old.

jim henson always seemed to put out wonderful television shows. this was sadly one of the shortest lived. it was endearing to hear each tale with their delightful morals. each episode was a new story, with new characters. john hurt did a wonderful job playing the storyteller, and the sarcastic tone of brian henson as the dog was always enjoyable.the set designs and costumes were very well done. the muppet work, when required, is classic jim henson work. you know it is a muppet, but it's endearing appearance more than forgives. you find yourself enchanted and compelled. when each episode comes to an end, you realize that you were quite entertained. an entertained that is fulfilling, not the kind that wears off after a few moments. you sit back and think about each episode, realizing that each story is indeed timeless, and presents a strong tale of morality.i have yet to show this to my own children, but this is indeed a series that is more than family entertainment. i implore you to find it on dvd, and snatch it up. if you can't do that, then just find it some how.

i remember my dad hiring these episodes on video. my whole family loved them, and now that i have moved away from home and have my own life i am trying to share these fabulous jim henson creations with my husband and stepson but as i am starting to find out not everyone is a henson fan. which is a pity since it means they will just have to put up with me searching for this series. but even though they don't find these interesting, i would highly recommend anybody getting hold of the storyteller. you will be lost in a world of tales from a time when people could only talk about unexplained situations through stories and how people need to care if they were ever confronted with these situations.

each story has a lesson for young and old. but what more i have to say may spoil a future story. but, i believe what i have to say is for everyone; just for one particular episode: the soldier and death.okay... of all the stories the one that sticks out for me is "the soldier and death" because is was the point in my life i realized that life was terminal. i am not kidding. the airing was on my 8 1/2 birthday... and i will always remember it. i didn't remember its title until tonight, but i new the synopsis. (may 15th, 1988)it is always difficult to explain that death is a natural part in life. it is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact. i am living proof (currently 28 yrs old) that children can accept this fact and from time to time remind adults...i write this with tears in my eyes. heath ledger - a wonderful actor my own age - died today. it kinda reminded me of many lessons i have learned in my life. so i write this as a reminder to young and old... no one is immune to whatever is in store for us.i hate to say that death is going to happen, but this story was the first time i saw death as not a bad thing; but a part of life, was quite literally in this story. i can't help it. it was a life changing moment for me and will alway be.and for that...i love you jim henson (and i still remember much of your work in life up until the day you died, and your memorial muppet show) and thank you brian henson for keeping the workshop alive!!! honest, i do thank you, all of your co-workers, editors, and interns.the stage is just a stage/ and a show is just a show/ but imagination will create magic/ that forever the world will know.thank you!!!(and for all who doubt me... dance, magic dance)

its been years since i have seen these shows. i have been searching years for anyone else that has seen these or know anything about them. i thought i made them up. the one i remember most is the soldier and death. i'd ask movie fanatics if they had seen these, mentioning its a jim henson and people still didn't know. these are great fables. i was very young when i was these, not even 10 and it left a lasting impression on my life and beliefs. i would recommend anyone to watch these, just remember they are from the 80's so they don't look like the movies today. just give them a shot. jim henson was way ahead of his time and died to early.

despite its pedigree, the most interesting things about this series are not the animatronics or puppetry, which, while charming, are little more than sideshows, at least in the story i saw, a story short. in fact, loathe though i am to admit it, the programme's chief pleasure lies in that most ancient art, storytelling.john hurt, in rowley birken qc-mode, grotesque, medieval make-up, relates a story about story telling, seated by the fire, accompanied by a cynical dog. one winter's day, starving and poor, he spots a fellow beggar thrown out of the royal kitchen by the nasty cook. the story teller tricks this latter into giving them an excellent soup. furious, the cook pleads with the king for permission to boil the villain, but, pleased with the story teller's wit, the monarch offers him a reprieve - for 100 nights, he must tell the king a new story: if he fails to do so, he will hand him over to the cook.the story may be old, but it's told with great gusto. anthony minghella's script is excellently dramatic (as befits a playwright), witty, and with some disturbing concerns beneath the fun, such as fears for the self, or the culturally self-generating power of storytelling, linked to the continuation of ideological power. for a programme aimed at children, it is bracingly self-reflexive (with little nonsense about film being the new oral culture); despite the americanised style, there is a charming sense of medieval bustle, its grotesqueness and arbitrary terror, as well as its magic and power.

beautiful art direction, excellent editing and wonderful stories make this some of the best television ever produced. the fact that it was relatively short lived is sadly reflective on the state of television. i highly recommend snatching these up as they're released, you'll love them.

series as a whole - jim henson's best work. john hurt *is* the storyteller. often oscar-caliber screenplays, not surprising when you consider minghella doing the writing. oscar-caliber acting, always.sapsorrow - everybody loves 'the soldier and death,' but something about 'sapsorrow' pushes it an iota higher in my favor. in the first ballroom scene, the costumes, the music - perfection. hurt and the dog typically semi-interact with the story, but this time minghella pushes it up that extra notch in the 'ring' scene between hurt and sapsorrow. the chemistry between characters is especially well-developed, more so than usual in the series, in reference to the friendship between straggletag and the prince. seen it? see it again. pay more attention (to those of you who don't fanatically adore this 22-minute piece of cinematic perfection). never seen it? i am so, so sorry.luck child - not as sophisticated as sapsorrow, but very clever in its own right. this is a story about irony. irony upon irony, within irony... i love it. every character is acted to perfection, with the exception of the ferryman. he was doing drama; everyone else was doing romantic comedy. i forgive him. this is my favorite of the primarily comedic episodes, 'sapsorrow' and 'the soldier and death' being examples of more dramatic episodes.side note: greek myths. what it lack in minghella subtlety (different writer) it partially makes up for in boldness as it portrays the four chosen myths with more sympathy and respect and history than is usual. also check out the jim henson hour if you can get your hands on it. for storyteller adicts, it features the man himself introducing the myths, the lion from 'true bride,' and... no annoying opening theme! half storyteller, half pure, unadulterated muppet wit.

this is the best television series for children (and adults) ever. john hurt is a great actor, with many excellent performances over many years, but he was born to play the storyteller. the scripts for almost every episode are superb pieces of craftsmanship, and the productions run the gamut of the emotions, being alternately funny, sad, happy, exciting, and always hauntingly beautiful. it is hard to pick a best episode from so many excellent contenders, but "the soldier and death", with its timeless pathos, is unbeatable. it is a series to watch with your children, over and over again.

had no idea what i was going to experience viewing this old film from 1940. however, i always enjoy viewing laraine day, (katie lattimer) who plays the role as a younger sister to jean muir, (helen lattimer) and also their mother, billie burke, (mrs. julia lattimer). thought i was going to be bored with the story of two sister's and a mother who is overly protective of her daughters until they meet up with robert cummings, (ridley crane) who has the reputation of being a millionaire playboy who has plenty of gals and is a heavy drinker who parties all the time. one night, helen lattimer goes on a date with ridley and he proceeds to get bombed out of his mind and simply cannot drive his car. it is at this point in the film when this becomes a drama and changes the complete direction of this film which will definitely hold your attention right to the very end of the film.

apparently a b movie ...b must stand for better acting and a better message than we get in big budget "a" pictures today. modern-day movies aimed at young women, surely aren't designed to encourage depth of character over shallow self-serving behavior... or increase the self-esteem of young girls who don't conform to "feminine" standards. (after all, criticizing the fake and flashy, like this movie does, ain't gonna help sell more products that depend on girls *not* being satisfied with their natural attributes or inner beauty.) laraine day is lovable as a mechanically inclined tomboy who "bounds" into rooms and confesses to an inability to flirt. she bonds with robert cummings due to similar interests, a shared sense of humour, and her honesty, loyalty and good friendship, which he gradually comes to value over the superficial "charms" of her selfish glamour-girl sister (who only brings out his own selfish, reckless playboy tendencies).although laraine is outwardly beautiful as well, it's refreshing to see inner beauty valued more, and the depiction of true friendship leading to the most fulfilling romantic relationship. i wish young girls (and guys) were getting this kind of down-to-earth message today.maybe if hollywood returns to making "b" movies again, with modest budgets, and tries to be content with modest profits... what am i saying? sacrificing the blockbuster mentality to create something sincere on a smaller-scale, would be like expecting a guy to give up the shallow sexpot for a sweet girl who really cares about him. that's crazy talk.please, somebody invent a time machine already! i belong in 1940.i'd rate this movie higher, but the ending is a bit too abrupt, and perhaps lacked sufficient indication of robert cummings' change of heart. (i like the fact that b movies are short & snappy, not bloated & self-indulgent, but this one might've needed more than 70 minutes.) also found it somewhat unrealistic that a widow and young children would be so unaffected by a sudden death in their family...or be so forgiving of the one who caused it. i mean, i guess it's *nice*, but a little more grieving or bitterness would've been only natural. maybe a deliberate choice to make this family act lighthearted about their loss, to lessen the impact of the tragedy and make sure *we* forgive those involved in the death - since it's just a plot device anyway, not the real point of the film. still strange though.

robert cummings, laraine day and jean muir star in "and one was beautiful," a 1940 film also starring billie burke. at one hour and 15 minutes, this looks to have been a b movie. cummings is a playboy, ridley crane, whom many women desire, including two sisters, katherine and helen latimer (day and muir). katherine is the more earthbound of the two who likes to fix cars, and helen is the blonde social butterfly with the beautiful gowns. ridley arrives back in town, and, believing he's not going to be at a party, helen decides not to attend. since the party is given by a family friend, their mother (burke) sends katherine in a pinned up dress. ridley is there, and the two connect. but ridley is into more superficiality, and when he sees helen at a dinner party, the two pick up where they left off and go to a club. he becomes terribly drunk, and helen at first refuses to ride in his car because he won't let her drive. after walking awhile and breaking the heel of her shoe, she gets into ridley's car when he drives by. he passes out, and she takes over the wheel, accidentally hitting and killing a bicyclist.ridley can't remember anything, so helen lets him take the blame for the death. the heel of a woman's shoe is found in the car, and katherine sees her sister bury her shoes - plus, something in helen's manner makes her realize that helen isn't telling the truth. ridley is convicted and goes to prison, and helen marries a man she doesn't love and leaves for south america.this is a wonderful film, even though at the time, this wasn't an a-list cast. cummings is playing a part that robert taylor would have played (it's an mgm film) - he's handsome and very amiable, even if he doesn't have the dazzling looks of someone like taylor. laraine day is a favorite actress of mine, someone mgm loaned out constantly because they didn't know what to do with her. why, i wonder - a wonderful actress with a great face and voice, she livened up many a film. this one is no different. her katherine is determined, sympathetic and totally lovely. jean muir is a lousy actress.so who was the beautiful one? we all know even if mgm didn't.highly recommended little gem.

and she really was beautiful (laraine day, that is) - herself, her part, and her performance. an engaging story of selfish vs. selfless love, for the same man, wealthy heartthrob and dipsomaniac robert cummings. one of his bouts of inebriation leads to an incident that enrages the local community and tests the mettle of the two sisters (jean muir and laraine day) that are close to him (and to each other). their comfortable and somewhat superficial milieu is up-ended as the two girls confront the ensuing crisis and respond to its conflicting demands of prudence, integrity, loyalty, and love, with consequences that are profoundly different for each of them. with the old vanities and niceties abandoned, their real characters are revealed in enthralling contrast.a wonderful find on tcm!

this is probably one of my favorites so far, although i have the first one and have seen curse, legacy, and vs. demonic toys. the only one better than this one is pm vs. dt. curse is the worst one in the series, than the first one, and then its legacy. i recommend people to see this and vs. dt. those ones who say this stinks are so wrong, the story is well written and it is a sweet movie. this is a classic movie even younger kids can watch and not be as scared when watching the others. well this is my review, you can call me gipdac,( its easy to know where that came from: 101 dalmatians series, you can watch it on toon disney at 4:00 a.m.). oh and don't laugh, i'm a guy, you will see more of my reviews in good time. if you want to know why i watch it? i'm 12! word of advice: have a mental meal, arrrrroooooooooo! i also agree with you motter-1, but why people like the others is because they're more thrilling than horror, and because the puppets are made to look scarier. also, you can call me gipdac.

it is great to see a new batch of puppets creating havoc in this series. i found this chapter a lot of fun. in fact, it would probably be my second favorite in the series. this movie has very little violence and is only rated pg-13. this is notably different from the other r-rated puppet master movies which were loaded with gore and violent mayhem. the lack of violence does not diminish the fun though. this film also has notably better special effects than the last movie in this series. good.

this is the kind of movie that you rent when you are incredibly tired, or impaired in some other way... the acting in this movie is so bad it seems intentional, and to let you know how bad the special effects are, there is one scene when the puppets are coming alive where you can see most of a hand holding the puppet, moving it about. the movie looked as if it was filmed with a camcorder. when i saw this movie for the first time, a fistfight nearly erupted when my friends and i were calling each other names from this flick, that's how terrible it was. if you enjoy getting mad at movies, i recommend this to you, otherwise, flee as though your very life depended on it.

first off, i hate sci fi stuff, and although this movie got a little sci fi at times, that's allright, because at least it focused on andre toulon. in the last 3, andre seemed to have kind of been mentioned, but the stories never really focused on him, which made me mad. what also makes me mad is the amount of 0's it got on the voting chart. give it a rest people. if you saw this movie and liked it, please vote for it. please. what i loved about this movie is that it went back to where it all started. when andre first learned the secret to life. i would recommend renting this if you have seen a puppet master movie before and liked it. but not renting it if this is your first time viewing one from the pm collection, mainly because you might think all the puppet masters are as "dull" as this one.

six-shooter, tunnel sergeant, dr. death, pinhead, cyclops, and blade help the young andre toulon take out sutek's egyption henchman in the best sequel this series has seen.retro puppet master is atmospheric with many sets, quality acting and some fun puppet fx. what it lacks in gore, it makes up for with an interesting well-paced plot.best quote: dr. death: "don't you know, my friends? smell the sulfur, see the smoke..."this is easily the best dave decoteau film i've seen. the actors do a more-than-credible job: jack donner as "azfel" turns in an inspired performance, and the young toulon does well with the puppets. oh, and the ring-needle is cool.john massari's score is a nice symphonic take on the original puppet master tunes by richard band, keeping the movie playful and eerie. it's rare for a full moon score to actually add something to a film, and this one does.unfortunately, dave allen didn't seem to be affordable enough for band and co. in the late-90's and beyond, so all of the puppet action is done rod and string. there's no stop motion such as the famous and funny scene in the original where pinhead's looking for his pinhead. and, of course, as with all of the full moon fare of this time period, rpm was shot in and around castel studios in bucharest, so most of the bit parts were cast to romanians: hearing their "parisian" accents was a bit annoying.all in all, this is probably one of the top-10 full moon films. it's certainly the most inventive of the puppet master sequels.

i don't understand all these bad reviews. i believe this movie was one of the best in the puppet master series. being made on a low budget, one can comprehend why the special effects and acting were not spectacular, but they were not completely horrible.greg sestero brought a lot of charisma to the role of andre toulon. he has a lot of potential, and i hope to see more of him soon. and though the cinematography was not excellent, and there was minimal violence and gore, this film was a lot of fun. i am a big puppet master fan and have grown to expect blood and gore from the films of this series, but i can say that i was never bored through the entire course of watching retro puppet master. so, if you ever get an opportunity to see this movie, don't automatically regard it as unworthy of your time. give it a chance. you might like it.

i was a child when i saw this serial, a bit after seen buck rogers one, both characters performed by the same buster crabbe, and i must acknowledge that these films have always been part of the best entertainment i've ever had. the fight against emperor ming was one thing but i was more interested to know about the final fate of the love triangle of flash with dale and aura. barin came and persuaded aura to forget flash, very innocent termination of her obsession for good-looking flash. the serial has no offensive and really violent scenes and can be watched by all audiences. another thing is that i learned floating in water looking the way crabbe did it when fighting against shark men. the soundtrack was also nice although it was used previously in another film of boris karloff's frankenstein. it would be nice to have the dvd of this serial provided that it comes with subtitles in spanish (not yet available).

i loved "flash gordon" as a child and watching the series again on dvd brings back such fond memories. each 15-minute episode features the adventures of our hero flash, the lovely dale arden, and intrepid dr. zarkov on the planet mongo, with flash escaping death at every turn: the shark men nearly drown him, he faces the fire monster in the tunnel of terror, and he's in mortal peril in the static room! the characters are still fun: buster crabbe is every bit the blonde dreamboat hero and jean rogers is a delicate and beautiful dale arden. princess aura still plots to steal flash for herself, king vultan of the hawk men still has his booming laugh and angel wings, and ming the merciless, emperor of the universe, is still giving everyone the evil eye and the creeps.this serial probably wouldn't interest children today with its hokey effects - oh, that spaceship! - but it's a fun bit of nostalgia for those who liked it the first time around. the actors play it straight and don't play down to kids. i appreciate that young viewers were expected to read the chapter synopses which had pretty big words in them.i'm glad this came out on dvd. it's a lot of fun to revisit this classic sci-fi serial.

i originally seen the flash gordon serial on pbs,and thought it was fun and awesome,i overlooked the special effects of the rocket ships with sparklers,and the big dragon monster with lobster claws,who cares this is 1936 and it was a serial,so each week they would show a new chapter, buster crabbe played flash gordon 3 times,in all 3 serials.then in 1939 he played buck rogers,in 1933 he played tarzan the fearless.he was a very busy actor.beautiful jean rogers played sexy dale arden.frank shannon as professor zarkov,and charles middleton played the evil ming the merciless.he makes darth vader look like a boyscout.the serials were very close to the alex raymond comic strip.space travel was just a pipe dream at the time.not to mention ray guns and television.this one stands out as the best serial ever.the sequel flash gordon's trip to mars is 2 chapters longer,the next flash gordon conquers the universe is only 12 chapters.and then there's the natives of mongo..,hawk-men, lion-men,shark-men.the feature version leaves out the shark-men scenes. for the full effect you must see the complete serial.i heard george lucas was inspired by flash gordon when he did star wars.flash gordon was from universal studios.and the music on the soundtrack is from many universal movies like bride of frankenstein,werewolf of london,dracula's daughter,etc;even today flash gordon continues to delight people young and old.10 out of 10.

the brainchild of comic strip pioneer alex raymond, "flash gordon" was the grand daddy of all sci-fi epics. this serial is the first time flash was brought to celluloid life. despite it's low budget, this is a great space opera.the story begins with earth doomed to apparent destruction, when the planet mongo comes hurtling through space on a collision course. maverick scientist dr. zarkov is headed off for the approaching planet in a self-made rocket ship, convinced he can do something to stop the runaway celestial body. he gets some last minute recruits in the form of resourceful athlete flash gordon and beautiful dale arden. once they reach mongo, their problems really begin. they run afoul of dastardly emperor ming the merciless, conqueror of his world, who has some ambitious plans for earth.the rest of the serial revolves around flash's desperate attempts to save the earth; the assorted alien cultures he encounters; the allies he makes; space ships he flies; the battles he fights, and the monsters he slays.brilliantly conceived by raymond, "flash gordon" features classic archetypes from legendary myths and fables of antiquity. echos of famous tales, like the sagas of troy and camelot and sherwood forrest are seen here. you have the dashing, handsome hero, on a quest to save the kingdom (flash); the evil king (ming); the old wise man (zarkov); the lovely damsel in distress (dale); the seductive siren (aura); loyal allies (thun, barin, vultan); plus monsters, dragons and assorted beasties.flash is a modern robin hood, jason or beowulf. ming is prince john or aggamemnon. dale is helen of troy or gwenevere or maid marion. zarkov is merlin or odysseus. (or gandalf) thun/barin/vultan are the merry men or the knights of the round table.you get the idea.you can't help but notice how many ideas from "flash gordon" would later reappear in star wars. the cloud city; the ice world; the forest moon; the scrolling opening text (from the second serial); there are others, but you get the gist. the whole sci-fi genre owes a great debt to this timeless classic.buster crabb is the perfect action hero, and i personally think he's better at this sort of role than any of the current crop of action stars. he also played buck rogers and tarzan.charles middleton is the embodiment of diabolical nastiness as ming. sure, he seems a bit melodramatic today, but that was what audiences expected from their bad guys in the 30's. jean rogers is our hero's love interest dale arden, and i had such a crush on her when i first saw this as a boy. i can readily understand why flash always rushed to her rescue. she's the quintessential good girl, to counterpoint the seductive manipulations of aura, the quintessential bad girl.the supporting cast seemed perfectly chosen to emulated their comic strip counterparts, and despite the now-silly looking fxs, there was a lot of thrilling action in this groundbreaking serial.an all around fun romp and the beginning of the sci-fi genre in cinema.

in the 60's cleveland television audiences could watch a episode of "flash gordon" as part of the ghoulardi show (11:30pm friday). this was the best mockfest material any of us in junior high had ever seen. we would have regular "sleepovers" (although we did not call them that) just to get in on the fun of watching this stuff with a group of friends. then the next week we would quote our favorite cornball lines from the latest episode.watching it today provokes much the same reaction. but if you can stop laughing at the dialogue, the lame creatures, the silly costumes, and the horrible spaceships long enough, there are some good things i did not appreciate the first time through. the production designers built some excellent sets, both the rooms and the laboratory devices. charles middleton's "ming the merciless" character was the all-time best screen villain, certainly up to that time and arguable better than anyone since. jean rogers is staggeringly beautiful.then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

this took me back to my childhood in the 1950 's so corny but just fab no one ever could play flash gordon like larry buster crabbe, just great. i have two more series to view flash gordon's trip to mars and flash gordon conquers the universe cannot wait

'opera' (1987) director: dario argento (deep red, suspiria) screenplay: dario argento and franco ferrini (the church, sleepless, demons) photography: ronnie taylor (a chorus line, sleepless) music: claudio simonetti (phenomena, 'goblin')story: betty (cristina marsillach) is the lady macbeth understudy of a very stylized staging of verdi's macbeth opera. betty's time to shine comes when the diva star breaks her leg before opening night when she is hit by a car running away in a tantrum. the famous curse of macbeth takes a more sinister and calculating turn when right away the body count begins to rise. it seems betty gets her first fan via a stalker who ties her up and tapes needles to her eyes to force her to witness the grisly murders of the people around her. story: 3 of 5acting: acting in a lot of these italian films can sometimes be hard to judge. english, italian, french, german, spanish can sometimes all be in the same flick as they usually speak their native languages making dubbing rule of thumb and hard to judge. i usually cut them some slack in the area as a result. acting: 4 of 5 direction: giallo maestro argento enters again the genre helped pioneer. 'opera' shows him at the top of his game with an exquisite blend of gore, tension and beauty. direction: 4 of 5visual: this has to be one of argento's best looking films. gorgeously filmed by taylor, 'opera' features some stunning and inventive camera-work that keeps the film running fast and hard and keeps the eye-candy coming. the camera always seems to be in notion whether it is a wonderful shot of the camera going up a spiral staircase or a sequence towards the end of a bird's eye view of said bird circling the crowd at the opera house. visual: 5 of 5audio: frequent argento collaborator simonetti (through his various bands goblin, demonian and solo effort) compliments the screen action with zeal as his score touches from the classical (verdi) to metal musings (with a little help from brian and roger eno and bill wyman) and lends music muscle to the screen's bloody gristle. the sound design give you all that you need from stabbings to gunshots, fire to screams and masterfully remastered on the anchor bay disc in glorious 6.1 for every crunch and caw. audio: 5 of 5technical: the editing keeps the film flowing and moving wonderfully. combined with the camera-work, the editing help keeps the surreal dreamy imagery flowing. the exquisite opera house is one hell of a location and perfect for staging the horror version of macbeth. one can't end a review of an argento film without having to comment on the kills. argento dispatches characters with glee this time around with a brilliant stabbing sequence, crow eye-gouging and the film highlight of a gun blast through a keyhole into the eye and out the back of the head shot that once again sends argento's ex-wife daria nicolodi to the movie morgue. priceless! technical: 5 of 5wrap-up: a nearly flawless giallo that suffers from a slightly unnecessary epilogue in switzerland that delivers all the visual thrills that argento fans crave.overall: 4 of 5

dario argento is a filmmaker i'm slowly getting into, following the iconoclastic efforts of deep red and suspiria; he's not a filmmaker to always care directly about silly things like "plot". that might be his one minor (but, for me, apparent) liability: he won't let a little thing like common sense screw up his plan for his elaborate killing sequences, as his killer(s) can go through any kind of elaborate set-up of being invisible, until revealing past the point of the pov tracking shots of said psychopathic killer. but it's thrilling to see a filmmaker take chances like this anyway, of a pure italian aesthetic making its way into the soul of a hitchcockian warp (in fact, as a note of interest, if one has recently seen the scorsese short film where he took three pages of an un-filmed hitchcock film, which also took place in an opera, argento had it beat by almost twenty years, probably with no knowledge of the text). it's also unabashedly 80s (cd players and heavy metal and the hair, oh my!) and with an absurdity that makes it all the more palatable to swallow.the story is simple: an opera of macbeth is being produced, with high-stylized pyrotechnics and trained ravens. there's even a talented up-and-coming star replaced at the last minute, betty, played by marsillach. but a murder occurs during the premiere- interrupted not by that but by a falling light- and now the killer is after betty! she can't go to the police (how can she let out that the opera is really cursed?), but will that matter in the face of a killer who won't let up? one has probably seen premises like this played out in other argento films- girl being chased by a killer- but it's how argento, like de palma, constructs and executes his sequences, and adds a distinctive flavor of his own to add touches of bizarre humor (the breakout of the ravens to attack the killer, and the subsequent version of pointing out in the lineup), a kind of over-stylization ala leone (the bullet through the peephole through the door probably inspired a similar shot in kill bill 1), and even sado-masochistic inspiration with the pins taped to betty's eyes, more than once! argento puts his actress through the wringer, and she's all game for it, even when things seem to just go into 'what-the-hell' territory (i was throwing up my hands almost saying i give up when she is led down the secret passage by the little girl, as if suddenly we're in aliens now). and through such dark genre material argento keeps the violence thick and fresh, the suspense about as much as that with opera music coming right out of a speaker of a stereo system, and a cinematographer who may have had a few drinks (and rightfully so!) during some scenes the way they're shot and vibrate to a heart-beat. it should be considered trash, but it's elevated past any limitations of the genre by the ballsy attitude of the director, this in spite of a silly ending- sillier than anything that preceded what came before it (thanks little lizard)- and an attempt to break the macbeth curse, which, unfortunately, didn't seem to happen in real life on the set of opera. 8.5/10

i consider myself a casual fan of dario argento. for every really good flick by him (such as "deep red" and "tenebre"), there seems to be one that's equally uninspired (his output since "opera" has tended to disappoint). still, there's no denying that when he's at his best, there are few horror directors who can top him. i consider "opera" to be argento's finest work.this is definitely the film where all of his trademarks are present. there's no well-developed characters and the plot makes very little sense once you begin to scrutinize it. still, think of argento as an european equivalent of brian depalma - the style is all that matters here, so much it becomes the substance. typical to argento, there's some beautifully filmed murder sequences. those unfamiliar with the man's work may perceive that as a sadistic remark (and it may be, considering the often time misogyny of them), but its really true. argento stages murder with an intricacy to eye-popping visual detail. he truly makes graphic violence an art form. plus, his direction and the look of his films is impeccable.fortunately, "opera" is one of his most frightening products. argento is the only director whom i feel booming rock music works well for horror sequences (when others attempt to pull it off, it comes across as cheesy). the acting varies, with cristina marsillach playing a beautiful and reasonably sympathetic but never particularly animate young opera performer. the rest of the actors are workmanlike and get the job done, but again, with argento, the acting is never the point. its the beautiful colors, the terrifying violence, and the overall fever dream / nightmare atmosphere. (9/10)

one of his lesser known films, many horror fans have yet to catch this dario argento offering, which is unfortunate. it is underappreciated mostly because of the fact that really not enough people have seen it. the film boasts grade-a argento gore, with his customary close-ups set to savage rock scores. while it true that this script is not very complex, it is not nearly as bad as other entries in its genre, or his own personal resume for that matter.this movie symbolizes more of the 'dread' that he likes to portray in his films by his own admission. worth a good look on any night.

no matter how much it hurts me to say this,the movie is not as good as it could have been.maybe i was misled by the countless exaggerated reviews here on imdb,but i expected so much more...sure,the idea is a good one,the violent scenes and the camera-work are outstanding,the imagination of genius dario is breathtaking, but the movie is "soiled" by a couple of mistakes that i find unforgivable. first of all, am i one of the few people who feel that the heavy metal music played in the most intense scenes simply rips the atmosphere apart??? with a different kind of music (goblin????) during the "needle" scenes,it would have been soooo intense!... instead,the soundtrack destroys any chance for tension... secondly, the final killing scene and the last few moments of the movie are simply silly and uninspired. i don't want to say "amateurish", cause i love argento's movies.the ending left me feeling empty.talk about a final impression! this is hardly what happens in most of dario's films! though,admittedly,suspiria also suffers from a rushed finale (even if most of it is brilliant)....in short,watch this movie,try to make the most of its good points,but be prepared for some bad ones as well. this is not a perfect movie by any means.

betty is as an understudy in a production of verdi's macbeth who is asked to go on when the diva is hurt in a car accident. however, in the grand tradition of "the scottish play", the production seems cursed with problems, not least of which is some madman slicing up the crew. unfortunately for betty, the killer seems to have special plans for her ...this is one of several must-see argento mad-slasher flicks, in this instance primarily for the extraordinary photography by the great british cameraman ronnie taylor. i haven't measured it, but i reckon around two-thirds of the shots in this film involve either pans, dollies, tracking or cranes - the sheer amount of camera movement is just astonishing and makes the movie ten times more exciting than a standard thriller. the imagery is wild and dizzying - closeups of the heroine's eyes forced open with nails, a swooping glide around an opera house from a raven's point of view, shots of the killer's brain squirming, a bullet fired through a peephole, a swallowed chain dug out of a victim's trachea. conceptually it's just amazing and could only be realised by this director. the movie isn't without some shortcomings though; the cast are variable at best - marsillach and barberini are both a bit shaky (and his dubbing in the english version is appalling, even by italian standards), although argento regular nicolodi is fun and charleson gives a thoughtful performance in a role that is more than a little autobiographical (a horror director much maligned for his remoteness and reliance on technique). the material is a nice three-way mix of the phantom of the opera, shakespeare and slasher flick, scripted by argento and his usual collaborator, franco ferrini, with shifty suspects galore and the usual disdain for boring expository scenes to explain what's actually going on. full of all sorts of different music - brian eno, claudio simonetti, bill wyman, puccini, and of course, verdi. the scenes in the beautiful opera-house were shot at the teatro regio in parma. for some bizarre reason the uk print of this movie has the alternative title terror at the opera.

often considered argento's last "great" film, this entry into the giallo canon is unquestionably better than any argento film that has followed it (though i have yet to see "mother of tears"), but to call it his last "great" film might be stretching it a bit.the directorial and stylistic flourishes - the hallmark of all argento films - is indeed present, with some of his sequences of suspense ranking up with his best (the "peephole" sequence is especially memorable), and the cinematography by ronnie taylor is outstanding (the fluorescent lighting is beautiful).however, the narrative - which is hit and miss in all of argento's films - is missing here. there is indeed a potent sense of mystery and intrigue, but the plot resorts to what is essentially a string of murder sequences, with one following the another, leaving no real time to fully construct a right, focused mystery to be solved. all of this results in a climax that is... well... anti-climatic, as the film did not invest enough interest to make us truly care.regardless, this is recommended simply due to the masterful direction and beautiful imagery that argento evokes. i wouldn't' recommend this as a starting point for argento's films, however (for that, i would recommend either "deep red" or "suspiria"), but if you enjoyed those, or even any giallo, then this is a very good addition to your viewing repertoire.

horror-genius dario argento is one of my personal favorite directors, and his films "suspiria", "phenomena" and "profondo rosso" range high on my personal all-time favorite list. "opera" of 1987 is yet another tantalizing and brilliant film that no horror lover can afford to miss, and that will keep you on the edge of your chair from the beginning to the end. this stunning and ultra-violent giallo could well be described as the master's nastiest film, which is quite something considering that argento's films are not exactly known for the tameness of their violence. the violence is extreme and very stylized in a brilliant way that makes opera a film censor's nightmare.- warning! spoilers ahead! - just when betty (christina marsillach), a young opera singer, is becoming successful, a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath starts stalking her... the murders are truly brutal, and of particularly sadistic nature. the killer attaches needles to the tied up betty's eyelids, so she has to keep them open and watch while he brutally murders people close to her in abhorrent ways. when done with the butchering, the killer releases betty and leaves, just to come back for other friends of hers...as usual for argento's films, the violence is extremely graphic and very stylized. "opera" truly is a brutal film, and what a stylish and atmospheric film it is. this film is absolutely tantalizing and pure suspense from the beginning to the end. the performances are entirely very good, especially christina marsillach is brilliant in the lead. a stunning beauty and great actress alike, marsillach fits perfectly in her role of the talented singer, whose fear and horrid experiences are slowly making her crazy. other great performances include those of ian charleston as a horror film director who is directing an opera, and director argento's real-life girlfriend daria nicolodi, who has a role in many of his movies. the camera work is excellent as in all argento films and the huge opera house is an excellent setting that contributes a lot both to the film's beauty and its permanently creepy atmosphere. the score, which is partly classical music and partly heavy metal is great too, even though i slightly missed goblin's brilliant progressive rock soundtracks that are such a distinguishing element of most other argento movies. "opera" truly is a terrifying and absolutely breathtaking giallo experience. this is an absolute must-see for any horror lover, and i highly recommend it to any other film-fan who is not too sensitive when it comes to extreme violence. excellent and absolutely tantalizing!

beware the scottish play! in his riveting and harrowing opera, dario argento returns to classic form, regaining the composure he lost while filming convoluted and delirious psycho- shockers like tenebre and phenomena. indeed, predicated on a simple narrative that is offset by opulent set pieces, imaginatively brutal murder sequences, and refined photography, the film feels like the argento we once knew. opera's only real infraction is its lack of a score by goblin, who provided unusual, iconic, and timeless music for many of argento's greatest films (the opera selections used here are wonderful, however).the production is filled out by several competent actors. while she's no jessica harper, annabella sciorra lookalike cristina marsillach manages enough pluck and compassion to grasp the role of the tortured heroine. ian charleson is interesting as horror-film-helmer- turned-opera-director marco. and daria nicolodi is fantastic as always, even in her relatively brief role (watch the making of featurette on the dvd for a hilarious interview with nicolodi about her role -- clearly brash and resentful over the end of her relationship with argento!) fans of stage fright (another excellent 1987 giallo, directed by michele soavi, who served as the second unit director for opera) will barely recognize the final girl from that film, barbara cupisti, as a stage manager here (i think it's the glasses that do it).with me, it's often the little things that matter, and argento's fascination/obsession with solitary nightmarish images makes him my ideal filmmaker. opera is full of minor details that left me smirking. for instance, i love that we never see "the great" mara czekova's face. i also love the scene where the killer is scraping the tip of his/her deadly sharp dagger across a television screen showing betty's performance as lady macbeth. finally, i defy even the most grizzled slasher veterans not to cringe as the "pin grates" are placed over betty's eyes.in short, opera is a clean, tense, and taut thriller. with its solid performances, lucid focus, and literate cinematography, it begs to be in the same league as deep red and the bird with the crystal plumage. might opera be the last great giallo?

being both a dario argento fan and a phantom of the opera fan, i was dying to see his first take on the story, before the so-bad-it's-good "dario argento's phantom of the opera". the film is just terrific, even the plot, which here is one of argento's best at a coherent story. the way he turns a classic romance story into a creepy slasher is just terrific. the film has a very nightmarish feel, which helps on keeping you on the edge of your seat. the colors have never been better in an argento film since the jaw-dropping "suspiria". the murders are clever and gory, all done in argento's trademark style. the thing with the eyes in this film is just unsettling, and done some much better than in fulci's splatter. the acting is so-so, but once you seen the movie more times you understand the characters' motivations better, and you get used to it. my two biggest complains about it is the use of rock music. i think it was a clever idea to mix beautiful opera fragments with heavy-metal, but it's not executed very well here. the ending is very disappointing, which is the worst thing about the movie, seeming to echo argento's previous "phenomena", but done terribly, it just didn't need to end that way. the same thing happened in the director's cut of "the exorcist". i wished they kept the original ending. but still it's a fantastic motion picture and really a must-see, if only for daria nicolodi's memorable murder sequence.

an opera diva has an accident, which leaves the door open for her understudy to take over the role. betty (marsillach) is now the star of mac beth, but someone hiding in the trenches has an opera of his own planned out. he gets his kicks out of tying betty up, putting needles under her eyes (so she cant close them) and murdering members of the opera company before her very eyes."opera" is certainly one of argento's more ambitious films, like mixing it up with shakesphere's macbeth there is of course the fact that the opera performed in the film is giuseppe verdi's version of macbeth but also argento, just like shakespeare uses ravens as an omen of death and misfortune. and like the ravens circling the castle dunsinane, foreboding the demise of the scheming macbeth, the ravens in opera play a key part in the downfall of the killer. furthermore just like in the old play the murderer acts on the exhortation of his lover. but i don't want to go as far as saying opera is intended to be a remake of the either the phantom of the opera or macbeth, the similarities are far too subtle. it's just a typical argento masterstroke, and with it he gives this otherwise quite basic thriller a vivid hue of gothic mystique.although this movie does have it downsides like the heavl metal soundtrack just doesn't fit in with this movie and the final scenes in this movie are a bit strange.all in all "opera" is something of a flawed masterpiece but still good.

after the lead actress of the opera is killed in a car accident, her young understudy, betty, is brought to the forefront. that's very lucky for her, with one problem: she has an admirer that has decided he will kill all her friends and make her watch. what is his connection to the opera, and what is his fascination with betty? i love dario argento with every part of my body. and i'm not an orthodox fan, i think. many people, particularly critics, praise his earlier work ("suspiria" and "deep red") but really frown on later films, such as "sleepless", which i liked. my favorite, "phenomena", is usually vastly underrated. "opera" tends to fall somewhere in between. some consider it one of his last great films, others see it as part of his so-called decline. i loved it.the picture is crisp, the music is great (unlike other critics, i love the metal soundtrack), the female lead is someone i can feel for (not unlike jennifer connelly from "phenomena"). and the imagery... wonderful. great cinematography, and some amazing kill scenes. the concept of taping needles to a person's eyes so they cannot blink... brilliant. my assistant tina thinks this looked fake, but even if it does, the idea is more than enough to pay off. and some great effects, like a knife blade coming up inside a man's mouth? awesome.jim harper calls the film "stunning" and calls attention to the "innovative cinematography, well-constructed shots and exceptionally violent murders." i agree with this completely -- one shot follows the camera through winding tunnels, and there is a very interesting visual use of crows throughout the story. mike mayo likewise calls it "visually fascinating eye-candy" and lauds the "crisp editing and flowing camera-work". it's really a wonder that this is not one of argento's more highly-praised works.argento returned to the opera with "phantom of the opera", which was a bit of a failure despite the casting of his daughter asia and julian sands. even more interesting, this same year offered the release of michele soavi's "stagefright", which (like "opera") has a killer loose inside a theater killing off the people involved with the presentation. both are great films, with soavi's more on the slasher side. (soavi actually served as second unit director on "opera"... you can make your own conclusions.) my only complaint with this film is the length and pacing. while it is very beautifully shot and the kill scenes are glorious, they are not as frequent as they should be. the first one takes over a half hour, and then we get down times between them. the lead actress should be in constant terror, but she is given time between kills to calm down as if everything is normal again. not cool, dario. we need to keep the suspense low and the intensity high.

even if it's not labeled as a slasher flick, it has all the elements. the fact that slashers are well known for it's low budget, lame plot, cheesy effects, and everything you may add, it doesn't means that there can't be good slasher movies. "opera" fills the description. even though it's part of italian giallo; which is far from being a slasher sub-genre.dario argento proves that he deserves the label of one of the best directors in horror. "opera" is one of the most stylish horror movies from the past 30 years. though the movie takes place in a beautiful, shinning place; the situations and gore turns it to be one of the scariest places ever used in a horror movie. i think of "opera" as a stylish slasher although there's in depth plot and character development. the cheese factor often used in most slasher flicks is not present here but in exchange we got a suspenseful, visually stunning gore tale. the movie's plot is simple (as in every slasher). there's a psycho in the opera that is somewhat obsessed with the lead actress/singer and forces her to watch gruesome deaths. the death scenes are extremely gruesome and are the best thing about the movie. the infamous "peep-hole" death scene is the highlight of the movie in my opinion. it's a terrific death scene that none other than argento could release. the knife through the neck (and mouth) is another gruesome scene but less violent than the scissors death. the gore in "opera" will please the wicked and lovers of violence.what i didn't like about the movie is the lack of coherence or logic. i mean, after watching the first death, the lead female, calmed as if nothing happened gets a ride home and doesn't makes much of a big deal about what she saw. also, she's left alone in home and doesn't take security measures. still, the suspense in the movie makes you forget the lack of logic. argento knows how to create tension and how to scare the subconscious. for example, when betty's friend tells her that someone was watching her from outside she freaks out and sets suspense in case that something happens. the direction of the movie is great. for an italian giallo it's excellent. argento's creative pov shots are impressive. the ravens also added a creepy feeling to the movie. argento add his unique spice. "opera" is one of the most underrated but popular through the horror community for these reasons, in my opinion: -the peep-hole death scene (brilliant) -the ravens attack in the end -the opera setting -the knife through the neck and mouth -the heavy metal score combined with opera music (this music never freaked me out before) -the killer's ferocitythe only thing i don't like about "opera" is the heavy metal songs used in death scenes. it's ok to disturb the audience but i think that the opera music could've added a creepier feeling. still, the "shocking" use of heavy metal is a singular disturbing aspect in the movie.watch "opera" even if you don't like gore. there's a lot of suspense and tension that could scare the most skeptical person. this is no "suspiria" but it deserves to be among argento's finest.
