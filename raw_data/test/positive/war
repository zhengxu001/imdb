looks as if the robocop writer has been wholesale looting the vindicator. this is a very solid horror/action movie about a man set up in an accident to be used in cruel experiment. anyone who have seen robocop knows the story. watch out for pam grier as a bitchy and darn good looking assassin. this highly effective, violent and bloody horror movie may not be to everyones liking, but this canadian outing is well worth seeking out for anyone who is fan of the genre. 8/10

as a fan of robocop, i always loved this movie. i seen it when it first came out, and finally i bought it on dvd from brazil, it was never released in the us on dvd. i like the film, but like everything else in this world, everyone has their opinion, love it or hate it. no matter what a movie does, someone will always say "why didn't they do it another way?" in other words you cant please everyone. if you love robocop, you will love this film. to me, its so unique thats its not cheesy, or silly like a lot of lower budget movies. this film always kept me interested. i can see a few scenes that robocop borrowed from here, but tell me what movies don't do that? a lot of films use other ideas from other movies, and sometimes change them around. fun film!

scientist carl lehman (well played by david mcilwraith) gets blown up something terrible in a deliberate chemical explosion. he has his brain transplanted in the body of a nearly indestructible metal cyborg suit by his evil colleagues who are led by wicked obsessive fellow scientist alex whyte (a perfectly hateful portrayal by richard cox). lehman embarks on an all-out killing spree. it's up to nasty mercenary hunter (a wonderfully loathsome turn by the divine pam grier) to put a stop to him. director jean-claude lord, who previously helmed the under-appreciated slasher psycho thriller "visiting hours," stages the plentiful action scenes with considerable verve and maintains a zippy pace throughout, thus ensuring that this flick sizes up as an enjoyably trashy sci-fi/horror action outing. paunchy character thesp maury chaykin easily cops top acting honors as disgusting fat creep burt, who in the movie's single most tasteless sequence has a brutal fistfight with lehman's pregnant wife lauren (a winning performance by the lovely teri austin). stan winston's nifty make-up f/x and paul zaza's thrilling score further add to the overall sleazy fun.

this film is a study piece for my english class, but it's depth and meaning has amazed me. since we're looking closely into all the facts and characters in this film, its and interesting tale of love, hate, war, and prejudice. well recommended!story: a girl named well-off jewish patty bergen meets an escaped prisoner of war, she then hides him in her playhouse in her huge gardens, and as they get to know each other, they begin to see the others qualities, and they earn each others love. patty's father despises her and treats her like dirt. anton (the prisoner of war) almost blows his cover to protect her, but patty manages to stop him before he is seen by anyone.

this movie was one of the best i have ever seen. just the other day i was reminded of this movie by something on tv. it came back to me like a dam flooding over. i have never been more touched by a movie than by this one. after the movie was over i actually could not quit crying for about 2 hours. no movie has ever moved me that way before. i was 15 at the time of the movie and have not seen it since but am hoping i can find a copy to buy so that i can watch it whenever i want to. if someone suggests you see this movie with them, go....you will not be disappointed.peggy fries

i haven't seen this movie in 30 years so i don't know if i would like it as much as i did when i was 12. at the time, however, i loved this movie. this is a great "starter chick-flick" for young pre-teen girls. be careful of the ending, though. there are tears and harsh emotions.looking back at it from a 2008 perspective (with so much more knowledge of child psychology, politics and political correctness), i think it would be interesting to watch again. patty's uncaring, abusive father, indifferent mother and favored sister all contributed toward making her vulnerable and starving for companionship. patty was sad when anton left. she was heartbroken when he was killed. the rage that was directed toward her afterward was shocking. after all, she was only 12 years old.the thing that i most strongly retained is how this movie taught me even "enemy" soldiers are people too. not all german soldiers were hateful nazis. when i was older, i saw tv shows like hogan's heroes and the rat patrol which also made the point that the "regular" german soldiers were not the same as the gestapo."regular" soldiers were drafted. the gestapo were handpicked among volunteers for their special attitudes of hate. i believe that one of the privileges of being a nazi was that they had special assignments and, therefore, didn't go into battle. their specialties were interrogation and torture.later, during the cold war, i would think about russian soldiers and remember somgs. we were taught that the soviet union was "evil". but the reality was that russian soldiers weren't out to destroy america. they had a job. their government probably told them that our government was out to destroy their way of life. which, in a way, was true, since the us fought to end communism.the lesson is still applicable today. german soldiers were not the same as nazis just as muslims are not the same as al qaeda.

"summer of my german soldier" was one of the many tv movies that became a staple of the small screen in the 1970s (others were "brian's song", "sybil" and "someone's watching me!"). it portrays a jewish girl (kristy mcnichol) befriending a german pow (bruce davison) in wwii-era georgia. one of the things that the movie shows is that many of the german soldiers weren't really nazis, but were just drafted. watching the movie, i got a real sense of how things must have been in the south back then; i mean, can you imagine being a jewish person accused of supporting the enemy? so, i certainly recommend this movie. i believe that it's always important to show the things portrayed here. occasional overacting keeps the movie from being a full-scale masterpiece, but they usually do quite well. i hope that the movie eventually comes out on dvd. also starring esther rolle and michael constantine (the "my big fat greek wedding" patriarch).

a touching story told with tenderness: awkward young jewish girl in wwii america befriends an escaped german pow who is hiding out in her clubhouse. they discuss their lives and beliefs (he's anti-hitler), she sneaks him food, he becomes her only friend and ally. all this reminded me of the much-better theatrical film "whistle down the wind", where hayley mills befriends convict alan bates, but you certainly can't fault the direction here, which is smooth, or the performances, which are sterling. mature in her pre-teen years, kristy mcnichol carries most of the picture and never hits a false note. suddenly, when the prisoner is discovered (and kristy is found out as well), the movie gets very tough. her father, shocked and ashamed that his child would consort with "that nazi", lays into her with a quiet fury i have seldom seen before (he tells her "you are dead to me," which must be devastating for a little girl to hear). the final scenes don't cop out; there are no big reunions, no hand-holding climaxes. the girl has to face the world, and in doing so learns a bitter lesson about neighbors, friends, and family. a startling film.

after reading a biography on the last russian tzar (nicholas ii), and his failure to secure the army's support, i decided to give this film a try.i watched it with a completely open mind, not knowing anything about it (except its reputation).these are the things that impressed me the most.1) the shots of battleships, and the soldiers used as extras. more than once i stopped to think "if this was done in this time and place, 80% of this would have been computer-generated".2) the realism in it. from the maggot-infested meat to the shot of the sailor with his candle and the legend "killed for a bowl of soup", this movie makes no concessions to the pc cause (which, thankfully, hadn't been invented yet).3) the slow descent into madness of the odessa steps sequence. from the first shot, when the limbless man appears, you get the idea something might be wrong; since the overall shots are composed, though, you end up feeling comfortable in your surroundings. then an amputee appears, and people start falling in dramatic poses. still, the shots are composed... until the cossacks appear into scene, and the incredible shot juxtapositions appear. this scene is easily worth the price of admission.4) the fact that this movie is 100% unadulterated propaganda. then again, when rambo fought in afghanistan he also was having something to do with "propaganda"; only a different kind.overall: a film marred by a bit of a slow narrative. nevertheless, metropolis, the cabinet of dr. caligari and this movie are perfect examples of inventive, edgy movies that are still remembered for their merits today. they really make modern movies look boring and repetitive.

have wanted to see this for a while: i never thought i'd be watching it in a damp trafalgar square, london with 15,000 other people and all to a new score by the pet shop boys.quickly, that experience specifically. a new departure from psb, it seemed to suffer from the same problem the miniaturist hugo wolf had when he wrote his opera der corregidor: the long structure was a chain of short ones, i.e. songs. psb produced a more fluid, integrated score although it was quite static on its own terms. neither could they resist song: a setting of the subtitled text worked in this respect a free standing meditation on the action of the odessa steps massacre during the action of that sequence itself was, i'd go so far to say, counterproductive. overall it was very exciting though, which is surely what eisenstein was trying to achieve.it is a very exciting film with choppier editing taking the place of acceleration of tension or action. in fact the film, though beautifully shot and passionately acted (it has a silent film melodrama, but not in the excess of the hollywood comic style) breathes through its careful editing pacing specific shots with a sense of the rate at which the audience will take them in. and there's a huge range of perspective too; either he had a lot of cameras or the sequences on the harbor and steps took a great deal of time.super film, which can be assessed irrespective of sound, as that's how the finished product would have been conceived. 8/10

the famous closeup of their breakfast meat, crawling with maggots still is recorded by fire in my neurons or the wind filling the right places of the sails, the fog better than carpenter's the fog cos is the real terror bursting out from human history instead of pirates ghosts. but , i tell ya' something: not even the magnificent scene in homenage performed by brian di palma with the excellent music of ennio morricone in the untochables (filmed in slow motion)can equal the effect of the original masterpiece of the crowd climbing down the ladders. we see not merely the baby stroller but i remember the hand of a baby stepped by militar boot, someone with no feet escaping at the last minute, someone wearing glasses (then a cut edition) and then the same glasses broken by a bullet that passed through....mini stories in a single scene.

/*may contain spoilers, but of course it does not matter :) */battleship potemkin is one stunning spectacle of haunting images. the visual direction is (well, and has been) inspiring, the sheer scale of the film is impressive, and the technique is certainly pioneering. what is really amazing is, to my mind, the depth and effectiveness of a film, devoid of proper literary script, sound (save the soundtrack), decent image quality, the faux-profound (self-)referentialism of today, exceptional acting, pretense, etc. what you get is a purely visual experience to be remembered.btw, the previous poster noted: "eisenstien felt after a lot of suffering to give the heroes what they wanted. the problem is that you think eisenstein is building up to a big final fight and then he tricks you. it's a little cheap. i would've rather seen a huge final action scene."i must warn you, that the end is not cheap, and eisenstein wasn't being generous to the heroes. history, however, was. potemkin really did go through the squadron as it was shown in the film.finally, i'd strongly recommend seeing battleship potemkin to anyone more or less seriously interested in cinema. see it with a fellow movie buff, it kept me talking for hours. however, if you tend to consider films, generally accepted as "great" or "classic", to be "slow" or "boring", this film might not be for you yet. not much cheap entertainment here.for me though, it is a full 10/10.

this film is more than the story of danton. it was a joint polish french production filmed at the time of the beginning of the end of the soviet system. it probably helped spur the solidarity movement's union activity. it is more about poland in the 20th century than the french revolution. solidarity began the end of the system. this film itself is historical by it's very existence....the rest is history.robspiere, aka. totalitarian leaders. danton, aka. walensa. when one watches this film, one must remember the snowball which began in poland. actually, it could be useful for seeing the superpower struggle within the only superpower left.

unlike http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098238/ this movie provides no background information. we are shown a snapshot of the fall of danton, his mock process and execution but, unless one studied the revolution quite extensively, it is difficult to understand where characters come from ( fouquier-tinville, philippeau, desmoulins, robespierre... ) and thus to appreciate them for what they are: danton and joe blobb could be the same person to the viewer. for example robespierre & desmoulins were close friends since their youth, and this explains how robespierre acts. those who know the facts, though, will easily orient themselves and appreciate this good movie with actors delivering solid acting, no useless subplots and good reconstruction of the times. desmoulins and danton are the best characters, but all do a good job, even the 'demented' saint-just portrayed as sort of psychopath. 'terreur' was a period of massacres whose importance hasn't been fully documented and that -for the most part- were driven by ambition, greed and the settling of personal disputes, fed to ignorant sans-culottes as the next epochal step against tyranny.

i was very curious to see this wajda-depardieu outing, plus the time period is definitely fascinating. being a wajda fan, i was disappointed, and that may be an understatement. the film never really took cinematic flight -- there's no foundation for the animosity between danton and robespierre, etc.basically, the script was weak (adapted from "the danton affair"). and yet, the direction was masterful...it's wajda, afterall! also, there were some amazing actors but they never really grab the audience's attention like they should. depardieu comes off as a quasi-goofy, nonchalant danton...not exactly the image we have in mind. woijech pzsoniak is incredible, as usual, but again the script puts up limits even actors of great talent can't break down. andrzej seweryn and bogoslaw linda pop up ... as bourdon and saint-just...and if you're familiar with wajda, then you'd know them.overall, i was disappointed with this much-lauded film. great cast, great director, but no quality foundation. bad, undynamic script. we need to get in danton (walesa) and robespierre's (general j) mindsets... what are their motivations? eh...who knows? one likes women, the other powders himself? riiight. ok, so if you're looking for a great french revolution movie i highly recommend "la revolution francaise"...it's in two parts and oh-so-great! excellent performances, in-depth script, juicy tid bits...definitely a satisfying experience!! klaus-maria brandauer is a much better danton than depardieu...the wonderful andrzej seweryn apparently took some notes from "danton" and is brilliant as robespierre. see it! now! as for wajda fans -- you're better off with "man of iron/marble", "promised land", and the like. cheers!!

this is a great movie to look at, since it so nicely directed by andrzej wajda but at the same time i wished the movie would had some more depth in it, in terms of its story. it's an historically relevant movie about the last days of the french revolution but yet the movie forgets to focus on the character's motivations making the movie perhaps a tad bit too shallow to consider this a brilliant and relevant movie to what.somehow it doesn't make the movie any less great to watch though. it's made with passion and eye for detail. every aspect about the movie is good looking, such as its settings, costumes and camera-work.also the story still works out as powerful, though at the same time it could had been so much better and more powerful with a just bit more character development and insight historical information. guess if you're completely familiar with the french revolution and the stories of danton and robespierre in particular, this movie will be a perfect one for you to watch.it's somewhat typical for a french movie to tell a story slowly and subtle, without ever stepping too much in detail. often this works out charmingly but in this case the movie could had really done with a bit more depth. other than that, this movie is still one fine example of french cinema, despite the fact that it's being directed by a polish director and stars lots of polish actors in it as well.gérard depardieu is great in his role, though the movie also decides to concentrate a lot on many other different characters. the movie perhaps has a bit too many characters but each and every performance is a great one, so this doesn't really ever become a big complaint, other than that it slows done the story a bit at certain points.a great movie that could had been brilliant.8/10

the film tells upon the title role,danton(gerard depardieu),confronting against robespierre(wojciech pszoniak) during the french revolution.the film is based on real deeds,they are the following: danton(1759-1794) as lawyer participated in the overthrowing of the king louis xvi and the proclamation of the republic,being minister of justice in the convention(1792)and founder of cordeliers club.he proposed creation revolutionaries committees as the committee of public salvation which he presided but was substituted by robespierre,starting a period of revolutionary dictatorship known ¨the terror¨(1793). besides in the film appear other historic personages as camille desmoulins(patrice chereau,now a famed filmmaker)louis david,saint just(jacobino),tallien..the picture especially narrates the happenings surrounding the facing off of the principal figures,one-time partner revolution ,and posterior execution,although gives results a contemporary parable about the modern poland,thus danton is lech walesa and robespierre is wojciech jaruzelski who was the prime minister imposed the martial law in poland and with similar name than actor played robespierre . gerard depardieu is excellent in the title character and magnificently portrayed, also in secondaries roles are awesome actors as the recently deceased jacques villeret(dinner game,crimen in paradise)and angela winkler(the tin drum). the motion picture is well directed by andrzej wajda ,considered the best polish director.the flick will like to historical cinema buffs.

if there were two parts that the physically towering, ugly-charismatic actor gérard depardieu was born, as a frenchman, to play, it must surely have been cyrano de bergerac and the orator georges danton. here he dominates the film both through the breadth of his shoulders and the power of his voice; his charisma carries the part despite the fact that it is made clear that the character has as much blood on his hands as any of the rest of them. danton feasts while the people of paris starve... but he is the one man who can challenge the tyranny imposed by the dreaded committee of public safety in the name of 'freedom', and he is presented as the hero of the film -- despite the fact that the source play practically idolises his opponent robespierre!for those who know the characters from history, there is interest to be had in identifying the minor parts: the frog-faced tallien, couthon the cripple, fouquier-tinville the tribunal's prosecutor, the dashing fop st-just, the epic painter david. but the script cuts little slack in this respect; names are often late in coming if minor characters are identified at all, and there is no hollywood-style 'info-dump' to make sure that the audience can place events in their historical context. the film takes it for granted that you know what has gone before, and what will happen after -- sometimes it takes too much for granted, as when it relies on a close knowledge of dates to provide the sting to its tail in the fact that robespierre followed danton shortly to the scaffold.considered as a film, it's not entirely satisfactory in that it ebbs away towards the end. the structure of the story leads up to some great confrontation between the protagonists in the courtroom or some dramatic climax to the trial, which, thanks to history, never actually happens. things just fizzle out: there is no revolt, there is no overthrow of tyranny, there is no assumption of power by the victor, there is no triumph on either side. it may be historically accurate, but it's not entirely satisfying as the outcome of a screen scenario -- it seems an odd place to stop. as others have commented, it might have been more logical to take events up to the end of the terror and show in apposition the fall of robespierre.

this is one of the best movies on the french revolution ever produced. being a person well versed in the the period i was amazed at the level of detail. the costumes are spot on. even the detailed little day to day items such as ink wells, serving plates etc are all perfect. as an american living in france who has access to the sites in the movie through his membership in various historical associations such as the napoleonic alliance i can not over state how impressed i was with the visual accuracy of the film.the dialogue where known is virtual quotations and the where not recorded is in character. i was extremely pleased with this movie and am disappointed that it is not out on dvd yet. this is how historical drama should be done. must see....

danton was a hero and one of the founders of the french revolution of 1789. this movie is set five years later and the revolution has morphed into something ugly. while initially the revolution promised freedom, at this point the small committee running the country is extremely repressive and is a dictatorship. danton and his friends were angry at how the country wasn't better off in 1794 than it was before they got rid of their king, so they begin criticizing the government. the movie begins as the printer who makes critical pamphlets concerning the government is beaten and his business is destroyed. so much for "liberty, equality and fraternity"! so, as a result of being silenced this way, danton et al begin publicly criticizing the government. eventually, robespierre (the leader of the committee) and his cronies trump up charges, have a show trial and get rid of the dissent. some have mentioned that the polish director, wajda, also intended this to be a criticism of his own nation--which, at the time, was soviet-dominated and very repressive as well. this makes sense as you see the movie unfold--especially when the government destroys all dissent "in the name of the people".the acting is fine, the story compelling and i have no major criticism of the film. however, i really wish the ending had been handled differently. especially because other than history lovers and french people, most probably have no idea that this execution helped to end the government. after this purge of danton in april 1794, robespierre himself was executed in july 1794 because the country had just had enough--plus, those surviving frenchmen knew that they, too, would face the guillotine sooner or later if this sick system remained in place. some sort of an epilogue would have been nice--such as showing the soldiers coming for robespierre. he responded by trying to kill himself first, but he only succeeded in blowing off part of his face--still alive, he was guillotined shortly afterward. this would have been a dandy little epilogue and could have been done in about five minutes. however, not showing a connection between danton's death and the fall of the government is an odd thing to omit.

french cinema had always been very strong when comes the time to present historical subjects. 95 % of the time, they never make errors. this film is of one of the best of the genre, due to very very strong acting by depardieu and pszoniak. wajda work, as the director, is truly a wonder. everyone should see this great film.

during my teens or should i say prime time i was "eating up" all kinds of sf novels every day of the week. it was in the sixties and seventies when tv was not such a important leisure time killer like today, one night in the mid seventies i watched the movie on tv i think it was ard and i was stunned. i was impressed in a way that i can almost remember each scene even today.nowadays i observe my kids playing the sims or something like that and i think we are close to what that fassbender movie expressed. i also would highly appreciate if i could buy this movie on a dvd. but in vain i tried almost everything to get a hint where. the movie matrix cannot touch by far the quality and the state of art of this movie. and by the way by now we do not have a glue if we were a superior reality or just one of a couple simulation models. probably after our death we definitely will know...

when i saw this film the first time i was very impressed concerning the kind of atmosphere the director creates. it is also very interesting to see how they imagine the near future in the year 1974. if you see the film you will see a lot of sets and customs which are called freaky and modern again today.the topic of the film deals with the old question "what is real and what is illusion?". if you see "the matrix" you will find a lot of similarities. but the two films are not comparable at all because "welt am draht" is art and "the matrix" is entertainment. if prefer the first one.unfortunately i lost my video copy of it.

in these days of ultra-fast processors and the internet, coming up with a movie like "the matrix" may seem merely the next step from coining the term 'cyberspace', but do you remember what computers were like in 1974? right. to come up with the notion of virtual reality back then is truly an amazing feat of the imagination. fassbinder's movie, of course, has none of the massive gunslinging and pyrotechnics, and a lot of 'artsy' elements instead, but the atmosphere it creates is intense and poses the question how we can know what is real in a dark and gripping manner, making this a chiller and a thriller for the mind. it also takes it up a notch on more recent vr stories: if you get out of one cyberspace, can you be sure you didn't just emerge into another level of virtual reality?

i first heard of begotten when a girlfriend of mine picked it up in a "cult classics" section of my local video retailer. she knew i liked obscure artsy movies so i rented it and brought it home. it sat on my tv for a couple of days and then i put it in the vcr just before going to bed. i thought that maybe i'll see what it's like first then devote more time to it the next day. what followed was that it actually woke me up. i sat through the entire film and loved it. after i went through the closing credits i watched it again. only after you see the closing credits do you get an idea of who is who. after you know that you can watch it again with renewed appreciation. don't listen to the people that tear this movie apart. it's not for everyone. if you're someone that doesn't like reading subtitles than this movie isn't for you (not that there are subtitles, there's no dialog at all). if you're someone that actually owns rush hour 2 then this movie isn't for you.this movie is truly original and inspiring. it does what other movies have never done. it looks like nothing else and is bolder than just about everything out there - from 1989 to the current date. you can tell that everyone involved in the making of this movie truly love the art of what they do and understand what can be captured in cinema form.if you're looking to be "entertained" then the movie isn't for you. however, it is pure escapism in some extreme way and in film form. it's like someone attached wires to my head and taped one of my worst nightmares. but this nightmare makes sense if you really sit and watch the images, dissect the action of the actors, and don't sit there noodling your guitar passively but watch and not blink.people compare it to eraserhead but begotten is so much more. i'm not joking when i say it is my favorite movie. it's an important film, visually stimulating, mechanically inspiring, and hypnotic. one review i read about it is very true though, "no one will get through begotten without being marked."

the visual effectiveness of this film is unmatched by anything i've seen. and the work required to make achieve it must have been incredibly long and tedious (you don't just stick "kodak grainy film" in your camera to get this look). don't watch this film to be entertained, watch it to be visually stimulated, watch it to be challenged and provoked in your thoughts on film and any other topic that comes to mind, religion will likely be one thought.

don't watch this film while, or soon after, eating.having said that, begotten will stick with you for the rest of your life, like it or not. based on the nihilistic philosophy that life is nothing more than man spasming above ground (to paraphrase the title sequence/introduction), this will more than likely contain the most intense and grisly imagery you'll ever see in a film.there is no dialogue, only image after image describing the cycle of life. the film's combination of stark black and white photography compounded with some truly creepy background sounds work to drive home the maker's message.the movie begins with god (portrayed as a bandaged and obviously insane man) slicing open his torso with a straight razor and subsequently dying in his own filth. after his death, mother nature emerges from his corpse to impregnate herself with his blood and semen and gives birth to man, represented by a maggot of a human convulsing on the earth.the landscape is a barren waste, populated by hulking shrouded humanoids who eventually happen upon mother nature and man. after a slew of violent scenes depicting the rape of nature and destruction of man, these humanoids proceed to pound the remains of the corpses back into the ground, and the cycle of life begins anew.i actually rented this from blockbuster one night, based on the cover art and hype content, but this is definitely not a blockbuster-type film. don't expect narrative, dialogue or any pulled punches. this is intense imagery based on a dark subject.i give this movie some high marks for the filmwork and audio, but i don't think i'll be watching it too often, if again. i like my movies dark and unique, but this one is exponentially more than i expected.

i saw 'begotten' last night, and i'm of two minds on the film.on one hand, i appreciate it for being the total invert of a michael bay film. no dialogue, extremely stylized grainy b&w photography, some of the most genuinely horrific imagery ever set to film, and a very compelling use of sound (which nobody else seems to have really picked up on yet). it's a reflection on a theme, and it dares go where most filmmakers do not not only in terms of images, but of production and concept. it's a movie that most people don't understand, and if you read through these comments you'll find a lot of people whose lack of ability to figure this film out results in them shrieking about 'pretentiousness' with the fervor of a gibbon rattling the bars of its cage at feeding time. it genuinely shocked and disturbed me, and the last time a film managed to do that was a while ago.on the other, this is a thirty-minute short that sprawls out to over an hour and a half. i understand that there might be artistic merit in using repetition and monolithic pacing as a bludgeon, but in this case it just doesn't help everything hang together. imagine being approached by a ragged man on the street who grabys you by the shoulders and says something that completely confounds the core of your being... but then, instead of leaving your shattered and gibbering in his wake, he just keeps talking and talking and talking. by the end of the movie, i found myself glancing at my watch now and again. this is not entertainment, people. this is disentertainment. this is how you deprogram people who just watched "glitter." if you watch movies to be entertained, this will frustrate, confound, and possibly anger you. you don't approach 'begotten' like a chocolate cake you want to eat because it tastes good. you approach it like something on the menu you have never heard of before, something you see furtive glances of through the kitchen door, something that's dark and glistens and twitches on its platter; something you order not because it will taste good, but because you just have to know what it's like.

i was surfing through imdb one day, when i stumbled across "the curious adventures of mr. wonderbird." noticing how obscure it was, i decided to set off looking for it. thanks to digiview, it didn't take me long, so i bought it for a dollar, and when i got home, i watched it, although i must say, i was quite impressed.three of the paintings in a king's apartment, a shepherdess, a chimney sweep, and a self-portrait of the king (who is just as selfish and sadistic as the actual king himself) come to life one night while the king is sleeping. the shepherdess and the chimney sweep escape, while the painting of the king calls the police in order to capture the couple. fortunately for the couple, mr. wonderbird comes in to help them, often mocking the police and the king.the back of the dvd case describes this film as "a surreal visual delight and an underrated entry in the history of classic animation." i couldn't agree more with it, considering that much of the backgrounds look rather bizarre, and many of the characters are weird, which include the depressed citizens of an underground city and hungry lions that are calmed by the music of a blind man (who kind of looks like andy warhol), not to mention mr. wonderbird himself is somewhat eccentric. the film is very creative and mostly fun to watch, and its only flaw is that it can be slow moving. but overall, this film was very good, and it comes recommended by yours truly.grade: b+ (awesome)

i just picked this up in a decent if not outstanding dvd version for one dollar at wal mart.run out and buy it.i'm fairly sure that this version is the short, incomplete version released against the animator's wishes in the late fifties, but even so, at a buck it's an *incredible* bargain.this film was syndicated in small chunks as a serial to local tv stations in the early 60s for the kid's shows that almost every station ran on weekday afternoons in those days - "mr bill and bozo", "monty's gang" (channel 4, greenville sc) and "captain grady" (channel 13, asheville nc - which is where i saw it). it made such an impression on twelve-or-so-old me that i immediately recognised it when i spotted it in wal mart tonight and grabbed it.wonderful. you should get it.

"tesis", "open your eyes" and "the others" were proof of amenabar's talent and skill as a filmmaker, but (in my humble opinion) were also flawed films in their attempt to outsmart the audience, always offering one turn of the screw too many, favoring cheap thrills, twists and turns over depth and resonance. lucky for everyone amenabar chose a subject for his new film that would not allow a surprise ending, focusing on characters and the emotional ties that bind them. the result is a little miracle of a film, beautifully written, photographed, scored, acted and directed. everyone involved in this film delivers a carrer-high performance,behind and in front of the cameras, from the wonderful cast (bardem shines, but mabel rivera, celso bugallo, clara segura and lola dueñas give the film an amazing authenticity) to aguirresarobe's exquisite lensing. the film taps on many relevant issues and emotions effectively , it addresses heart and mind with equal power and delivers a final punch that stays with you long after the credits roll. this is a brilliantly executed film that not only will stand as a landmark in spanish cinema, but will surely become a pleasant surprise when it opens in the abroad (sony classics has paid a record 6 million dollars to distribute it) don't be surprised it it manages to get in the oscar race... there's no stopping amenabar...buen trabajo, alejandro!

this is probably the best movie filmed in at least the last five years. i've always believed that making people cry is far more difficult than making them laugh. if you want to see 400 adults crying out loud in the same room, go see this movie. it's breathtaking. javier bardem performs the role of his life. you will cry, you will laugh, you will smile... the most deserving fact is that in spain everybody knows about ramon sampedro. personally i knew the full story and even the end of it. so, the excellence of the movie is in the way that the story is told. and in this field, amenabar is a the master.this movie is a must.

when i first saw "before night falls", javier bardem had just been nominated for an academy award. i thought "he's got it!". he didn't. i watched "mar adentro" last night. please give it to him this time... this is an actor. convincing, touching, emotional, brilliant. see also "los lunes al sol" and you will understand what i am talking about. he is an absolute chameleon and i swear it's not only the result of make-up work. this movie is so beautiful, so well done, the characters are so real. congratulations to alejandro amenábar (how about a best director nomination?). i also have to mention the make-up artists. i can't think of another word but magnificent. i really hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves. as far as i am concerned, it already has...

" i have wrestled with death. it is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. it takes place in an impalpable grayness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around, without spectators, without clamor, without glory, without the great desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly atmosphere of tepid skepticism, without much belief in your own right, and still less in that of your adversary. if such is the form of ultimate wisdom, then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it to be." marlow in joseph conrad's "heart of darkness"it's difficult to make lyrical the subject of death in any work of art. yet movies have recently made bold attempts to humanize it to the extent that it is embraced as a part of the cycle of all living things, and it can be chosen rather than legislated. "chosen" is the operative word for alejandro amenabar's sea inside, based loosely on the true story of the galician sailor ramon sampedro. it is a drama about euthanasia without prejudice clothed in love, poetry, and friendship. if it sounds like barbarian invasions (2003), in which a cancerous professor says farewell to lifelong friends and loves before he takes his life, then you are right. in fact, sea is better because it spends more intimate time with the protagonist before he goes, a remarkable feat with not one of those moments in the least dull or uninteresting.javier bardem as ramon has expressive eyes and commanding voice for the romantic quadriplegic, a combination of tough realist and poetic sufferer. belen rueda plays the disabled lawyer julia, who becomes an imaginary lover for ramon, increasing in radiance as her life degenerates with disease. added to the already almost soap opera circumstance is lola duenas as rosa, a blue collar visitor who initially tries to dissuade ramon from seeking death but quickly falls in love with him. talk about romanticizing disabilitythis guy has unbelievable luck attracting substantial women, and he can't move a finger. but talk he can, proving the ultimate argument about what women want: love that speaks, not just makes.i will refrain from mentioning the major motion picture now up for an oscar that features euthanasia as its climax in order not to spoil the experience for first timers. sufficient it is just to say both films are successful in opening up both sides of a contentious subject without forcing a specific point of view. the religious right has a right to complain that the former film and barbarian invasions celebrate suicide; it has no right to accuse the beautifully balanced sea inside of the same."a life in this condition has no dignity," ramon says. the irony is he conducts himself with supreme dignity that makes anyone question his determination to end his life. "the sea inside" is a formidable entry in 2004's oscar nominations for best foreign language film.

i have seen 'the sea within' today and i loved it. the actors of the movie are wonderful (specially javier bardem, of course), but i thought that belén rueda would have a better role. lola dueñas, clara segura and, specially, mabel rivera perform excellent interpretations. and i cannot forget celso bugallo and joan dalmau (brother and father of the protagonist).there are two technical aspects i loved very much: aguirresarobe's photography and the score by amenábar himself. i liked the song, 'negra sombra' ('dark shadow'), by luz casal with music of carlos núñez.in short, i think that the spanish academy should choose 'the sea within' in order to compete in the oscar awards. i liked other spanish productions, such as almodóvar's 'bad education', but amenábar's film is much better than them. 'the sea within' deserves all the awards.

a friend of mine asked: "doesn't one have to be pro-euthanasia in order to like this movie? is it a mistake of the movie to infer most quadriplegics want to end their lives?" interesting questions.as far as i can see (correct me if i'm wrong), there is only one quadriplegic who wanted to end his life in the sea inside. think ramón sampedro addressed this in the movie as well. it is he who wants to die. it is he who is fighting for his right to decide his death. he is speaking for himself and not other quadriplegics. though his pioneering work, depending on one's perspective, may prove beneficial or damaging to quadriplegics down the road, his primary objective is a personal one. but one thing this movie does (my opinion anyway), is that it forces us the viewers to ask ourselves the inferring questions my friend so succinctly put forth.after my first viewing of the sea inside, i walked home in a conflicted blur. i struggled to reconcile with this exasperating notion; why would ramón want to die? given the love, care and sacrifices so unconditionally showered on ramón by the people surrounding him, why would he doggedly cling on to his hurtful decision? then, on my second viewing, a shared thought between ramón and the lawyer lady entered my consciousness. it threw up a telling observation: "...total dependency comes at the expense of intimacy." most human beings crave for such an intimacy. of course, how much we value such "needs", depends largely on the individual.as a person with a familial-biased sensibility, i empathised strongly with the caregivers in this movie. why can't javier consider the sacrifice and the love from his family and friends? is he blind to it all? i would think not. the miracle of the sea inside therefore, is its insightful depiction of a very humanistic tug of war. when we are faced with the guardianship of a sane but incapacitated loved one, whom has expressed a calm, conscious and rational intent to die, what then is the right thing to do? is caring for and keeping this loved one alive, against his or her will, a pious gesture? does it show up the worth of our love? or does it merely soothe our "selfish" fears of irreplaceable loss? with so much understanding accorded to caregivers, wouldn't their invalid charges, by submitting themselves to the total dependency of others for survival, also be an overlooked act of sacrifice? rhetorical or not, how much is "dignity" worth to an individual? is living (or dying) with dignity a privilege or a right? if we really care and love a person, should we also respect their eventual decisions in life (as in death)? a torrent of questions the movie might have asked, answers to which, i'm in no position to provide.in our eagerness to intellectually demarcate the merits of pro-life or pro-choice, we run the risk of ignoring a sea of grey that's engulfing the people most intimately affected, the caregivers and the ones they care for. the sea inside hence attempted to present the delicate yet complex relationship dynamics between them. intuitively, this film understands one thing; that the nature of "sacrifice" is never one-sided. in this tug of war, we should endeavour not to win arguments, but to intently observe and hopefully determine, who is the "stronger" party to make that sacrifice.the sea inside is a sobering film. it opened my eyes to things i don't wanna see. and for that, i am grateful.

it's a soap-opera drawing upon an applied ethics idea. a movie about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie. i didn't get any emotion from it, the ideas are not at all new, the tension lacks, it becomes tedious towards the second half but towards the end i think it becomes quite interesting in a burlesque way. i mean you have this middle-aged, paralyzed bald guy who gets more women than don juan. he doesn't seem to suffer as much as you would expect from someone completely paralyzed for over 28 years, he has no issues with god (and one would probably expect that too), the people around him seem to be the perfect slaves (i can't get out of my mind bergman's cries and whispers, similar to this one in many respects, which simply bursts with emotions, and not all of them humane) etc. this movie is the perfect recipe for housewives who look for some emotional thrill but don't expect to be blown away. the movie is worth seeing among all the cynicism we get today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical issue without any desire to arouse the viewer. amenabar doesn't rub your face in it and he doesn't take sides, he doesn't want to make us fanatics for a particular idea. still i have no clue as to why this movie was so highly regarded.

i suppose it's quite an achievement to be able to present to an audience a true tail about a frail man; a tail in which the protagonist will spend the majority of the film on his back, in a bed and totally unable to move. and yet the achievement is in the film's effectiveness as a dramatic piece; as a recollection of a true story and i guess as an argument as to why people should have the right to die if they so wish to. but the film isn't a political statement and perhaps thankfully it shies away from too many scenes of debate although it does include one for the sake of argument anyway. more-so, this is one of those foreign language films that presents its lead character as a cripple whom can do nothing but talk to the people around him and yet is able to come across as engaging and compelling anyway.so rather than be an out and out argument, the film is more a sweet yet timely dramatic piece about another person wanting something or in search of something; the only difference is that by attaining this 'goal', it would mean the termination of a someone's life and it would be achieved by not physically going anywhere. javier bardem plays real life galician ramón sampedro, an individual who at a much earlier age dived into a clearing of water that was too shallow for such activity. this rendered him bedridden for the rest of his life and his wish to die is the focus of chilean director alejandro amenábar's film. we've seen so many films in our lives in which characters have certain 'goals' or targets one must meet before the film is over to provide a satisfactory experience for the audience, but the change of pace in the sea inside is gentle; it does not involve young, energetic, attractive heroes going off to do battle in far off places but a real person after something that means so much to them.even if you do have a strong policy, either pro or anti-euthanasia, you may find yourself hoping ramón gets what he wants at the end of it all anyway. the film sets its tone very early on with ramón giving a speech on why he wants to die to watching family members, immediately introducing the situation and subject to the watching audience who may not know what the film is about. interestingly, some of the family members are 'anti' what he wishes which might place any audience member that feels strongly about the subject in their respective shoes. but the purpose of this set up is to tell the audience 'no, this isn't one man after something who incidentally has the whole of his family backing him to the end'. quite easily, the film could've gone down a route in which it is the sampedro family vs. everybody else but some are anti-ramón's idea; some are too young to acknowledge what's really going on and others are seemingly too distraught to even have an opinion other than they just want ramón to stick around a bit longer, they love him after all.the sea inside is a following of a story revolving around a victim of sorts. ramón is a quadriplegic and it is his perspective we see things from. this is something that may disjoint viewers or have the film come across as quite odd given we are being presented with a film from the point of view of a victim rather than an instigator or a lead character in a film that is always inducing the cause in the cause and effect drive. but this is no criticism and it's a credit to the director for delivering such an approach in the effective manner in which it is. the film asks questions; it offers a scenario to its audience. if you were in ramón's position: what would you do, or think about or dream of or talk about? consequently, dreams about lawyer juila (rueda) are not so much shot for the audience's pleasure as much as they are an ever so slight window into one man's escapist fantasies from his predicament.the study of julia intensifies somewhat later on when a she begins to share certain similarities with ramón and that is when she begins to have strokes that are a result of a disease of her own. this trait seems timely in the progression of their relationship and adds a further ingredient of connection on top of an already engaging friendship. this is because julia feels the physical pain and restriction, not in a sense that she isn't able to get up and walk, but i think she realises the value of life given how emotionally bad she felt beforehand. while the film is based on a true story and covers the subject of euthanasia, it feels like more of a down to earth drama about a man in a situation in which he is prepared to fight for what he wants but must do so verbally. it's refreshing to see films like the sea inside as it not only references history and gives us an insight into that but as a stand alone film, delivers on an emotional and engaging level.

'oldboy' director park chun-wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie history.trusting the latest hollywood fad, vampires these days are supposed to be rather nonviolent, asexual, love-lorn chevaliers instead of the evil rampantly sexual blood-sucking mind-manipulating man-beasts of yore. this is the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrills of the past... well, at least in the second half.'thirst' starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story. the vampire transformation of a priest is, over quite some time, sidelined by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story, which makes for some awkward viewing. but the last 40 minutes or so are surprisingly gory. well, maybe not so surprisingly if you know 'oldboy' and 'i'm a cyborg but that's ok', but i guess it's fair to say that 'thirst' beats park's earlier films in terms of in-your-face violence. all in all, be warned that this is neither art cinema nor a horror flick. it may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some. 'thirst' is original, entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than park chun-wook's earlier endeavors.

chan-wook park, you have to hand it to the guy. in my eyes, he's not only a brilliant director but a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often provides something refreshing yet still ultimately satisfying.thirst is, essentially, a vampire tale but one that plays fast and loose with some of the "rules" of the subgenre. kang-ho song plays father sang-hyeon, a man who unselfishly gives himself over to a research program and then unselfishly kind of catches the disease they are trying to cure, dies and comes back. all thanks to the blood he was transfused with. being the only one out of five hundred to survive, he becomes quite the celebrity to those who know him and all he wants is to get back to normal. normal, however, now involves being able to leap great distances without injury, wanting to drink blood and getting severely hot under the collar when rays of sun get on his skin. it's not long before he's living with a rather dysfunctional family unit who knew him in his childhood and while he hides his new, strange lifestyle he finds himself drawn into a complex love triangle, becoming more acceptable of darker thoughts and sliding down a slippery slope that could lead him from man to beast to monster.deftly blending a number of genres, park's movie felt much fresher and more original to me than let the right one in (to use a recent example) and genuinely impressed me with it's approach to material that could easily have felt as well-worn and rehashed as any number of other vampire movies we've seen over the years. it's a mixture of horror, melodrama and comedy while also pondering ideas such as strength of faith, the power over life and death, the downside of immortality, etc, etc.some people have complained that this genre-blending approach weakens the movie but i personally found that it was a lively, entertaining and always enjoyable movie helped by a great central performance from song as the tortured priest and fantastic turns from a supporting cast with no weak links. many characters get to move through a range of emotions and all do so with skill and believability, especially the young woman (played by ok-vin kim) who becomes the object of the priest's love, lust and affection.fans of asian cinema (and park in particular) and also fans of poe's "the tell-tale heart" (watch and learn) should lap this up, it's yet another classy movie from a man who seems to take everything in his stride and always manages to put out nothing less than solid entertainment.see this if you like: cronos, near dark, dellamorte dellamore aka cemetery man.

the great thing about thirst, chanwook park's latest film, is that it's the anti-twilight. some of you may take that as a minus, but in reality it's a big plus. park takes the method of vampirism seriously, and as well the torrid love story between sang-hyeon and tae-joo. we see the conflicts of both of the characters- sang-hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that, unbeknownst to him, turns him into a sickly but true-blue vampire, and tae-joo with her mother and "idiot" brother, the latter is killed by sang- as in a very strong melodrama. there's nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point, and the implications put forth from religion early on (sang, for example, is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism, even as he just can't be that and knows it) on top of those about good vs evil, push it up into another plane cinematically.that thirst also rises up to the awesome standard of artistry that park has displayed with oldboy, lady vengeance and the underrated i'm a cyborg but that's ok, should be taken as a given. thirst is a film with a juicy narrative and bizarre suburban characters, and is shot and edited with an eye for a mood that is part satiric, part romantic/erotic, part dramatic and lastly fantastical. and it doesn't always treat vampirsim as something of a simple horror movie set-up (though as a horror movie park has more than his share of scary scenes). it's more akin to the movie near dark which never mentioned the word vampire but let you know it was, and treated it with sincerity and a kind of lucid track of attention, and that the disease itself and its effect on a person's existence is perhaps scarier than the killings or bloodshed. once you see one vampire jump up really high or heal its wounds, you've seen em' all.thirst also has a wicked sense of humor, much like oldboy, only here with a bite (pun intended) meant to emphasize bizarre physical states of being. an example of this can be found with the priest's predilection of sucking off of blood from people in comas by taking their blood tube and suckling on it on the floor. or the manner in which tae-joo holds on to one scrap of humanity by keeping her mother alive, even as she's had something like a stroke and can only blink her eyes and tap one finger as a means of reacting to the blood-suckers who've brought pain and horror to her home. but these moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience. what makes thirst last in the mind is how elements come together, of drama and existential pains, of a bunuelian-surreal sense of catholicism (i especially loved the dynamic between sang-hyeon and the other priest who gives his arm up for blood-sucking but really wants to be a vampire too), and of the erotic: the scenes where the priest finally gives in to tae-joo are incredible in their pace and length of shots and how real it gets. not in a pornographic manner, but in the sense of these characters' release and escape, which doesn't last long over the scope of the story.if it's not as great as oldboy, it's not something to carp about. not all films chanwook park directs will reach the stature of his masterpiece (and, at the least, he'll always be known as the man who directed that movie). but thrist is an excellent addition to his oeuvre, and to the serious streak of vampire movies in general. the film-making is crisp and exciting and even dangerous (and what a white room of 'daylight' the characters live in!), the humor is dark and hilarious, the acting is intense and moody- especially from subtle strokes from song kang-ho and the quirky evil and surprising vulnerability from kim ok-vin, and the ending, when it does finally get there, is one of those truly superb vampire-movie endings you'll be talking about for years, in a good way. in a battle between thirst and twilight, thirst takes the knock-out in the first round. between let the right one in or near dark, it's tougher to call. 9.5/10

korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head, and the latest by the celebrated director chan-wook park is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire. add a temptress leading him astray and a cast of eccentrics and you have a wonderful recipe.directed in part in a style similar to the "sympathy" trilogy it's as sumptuous as it is dark. steering clear of cliché it does offer some new tricks in the overdone vampire genre. its an existential movie trying to capture the moral conundrum of how exactly a person has to choose to live with their conditions rather than revel in the blood lust. however, the film doesn't take itself too seriously and there is boundless humour throughout.our leads play their roles to perfection, playing with our emotions and revelling in the dark humour. there are moments of reflection on the whole moral conundrums involved in the film but its never preachy. some might find it overlong and it can lull at points but it's worth giving it a chance to the end.if you like left field films then there are fewer better than this one of late. dark and engrossing, it will pull in a crowd. one i'd recommend you give a try.

after watching oldboy i was a little disappointed by the rest of park's work, some of it is good but it never approaches the level of humour and originality that oldboy had. this one does, it is nothing like oldboy in plot or style but the same level of quality is there.the acting is good with kang-ho song, ok-bin kim and ha-kyun shin delivering excellent performances. kim in particular manages to swap from the creepy horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest misstep.the plot is strange with lots of twists and turns and takes a big swipe at the vampire clichés.the directing is spot on with tons of pace and humour throughout and some of the most memorable scenes i have ever seen. it does boast what is probably the weirdest love scene you will ever see.this is just a great film.

now that i have seen it, it was not what i was expecting, at least not until the very end. i read some of the other reviews before picking up a used copy of this from amazon and was glad i did. having been first introduced to park's work via oldboy, i was curious to how he'd treat the genre and was rather pleased at the clever manner in which he executed it. i think park has matured in terms of presentation because while oldboy and some of his other work has very nice and deliberate camera work, he has some nice innovations in bakjwi that i had not seen in other vamp movies. for example the scene where father hyeon is realizing the "beast" growing within him as he gives his shoes to the always barefoot tae-ju and he is able to see the blood pumping through tae-ju's skin and his eye's widen in blood-lust for it. that was a nice effect. i was also happy that park did not cg the crap out of the movie and the is in fact very little cg at all. i came away from bakjwi being totally set up to think one thing was going to happen and get taken for a ride in true park fashion. additionally, i liked that park played with a little symbolism and reversal whereas we don't usually get this is asia cinema. during the beginning of the movie we see the plot develop slowly and get to know the characters and you feel like an invisible observer to the thing that are transpiring. park treats you a little like ghost of christmas future coming to show you, albeit a bit boringly, what life is like outside your world. ah, but then we start to feel a little kinship with the befallen father and his burgeoning lust for tae-ju and conflict with duty as a priest. we almost start to root for them even until park not so nicely slaps us back into reality and we really see that in the end bakjwi is a movie about moral dilemma and right and wrong. it won't spoil it if i tell you to watch bakjwi from the mindset of a priest and i think you'll come away from it with what park wants you to come away with. don't expect oldboy and stylization because that's not what you'll get here. a very interesting take on the genre indeed. those who missed the many literary elements and religious allusions watched some other movie, not bakjwi. after bakjwi, watch let the right one in, it's also not what you'll expect either.

no pun intended. i'm not going to spoil anything about the story, but it's safe to assume that you already know, what kind of character the main actor portrays. and of course being a priest while being "naughty" exaggerates all that. plus this is the most erotic movie from park chan wook yet.if you have seen wook's previous works/movies you know he is very visual (in a good way) and it shows again here. while it strays away from the vengeance theme of his prior movies on the surface, it still has quite some heat hidden underneath. and when that boils, quite a few bad things start to happen. but through all that dark, there also moments of light (fun) to be had too. a very stylistic and though provoking movie, that lives outside the mainstream and does a very good job ...

the vampire "craze" has, in my opinion, actually proved its worthiness of such infamous categorization. there were many sub-genre films last year from a multitude of countries. i've reviewed many and have a few more to discuss. forgive my indulgence, but since i've recognized the trend as a phenomenon (which it is and, coincidentally, features my favorite horror staple). i'm going to now move outside of north america for a bit and introduce you to hopefully meaning films that you didn't see as of now.of the many effects of twilight is the creation of "guy" and "girl" vampire movies. i hate this sexist categorization, which has the effect of polarizing an entire generation of fans into "sides". i think men are prone to hate stephenie meyer's work (and its offspring) to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype which was always theirs is now liberated. women may be unlikely to enjoy future "neutral" pics since they grew up with ironclad expectations that were enforced four times. we need more directors to create vampire films which either gender is capable of enjoying (unequally) if vampires are going to survive the craze and remain relevant. cue: thirst this korean film was directed by park chan-wook of oldboy fame. there are two ways to dissect it. either it straddles between gender expectations and is universally marginally enjoyable, or it is a floundering mess that doesn't decide which target audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one. don't let me convince you that the film has no inclinations. its director is a man whose fame is story-driven action films. its protagonist is male and has a passive-aggressive interest in his lover (more on this later). still, his desire for a woman he has known both before and after mortal life is not contrived, and his attention is returned. there is a male slant to this picture, yet it is not so one-sided that women could not enjoy it. the same cannot be said of daybreakers or new moon.the plot follows an emile zola novel called thérèse raquin, which i have not read. according to wikipedia, the novel is about an affair that develops between a married woman and a single man. he kills her husband during a fishing trip and begins dating her. the two of them are incapable of having sex because they picture the dead man's body between them. they are thus driven to insanity, but care for the woman's ailing mother. at the novel's conclusion, they try to kill each other, discover each other's plans, and commit suicide.now, transcribe this nearly 150 year old french novel into modern south korea and you've got thirst. chan-wook doesn't embellish the story enough to elevate this to must-see. he often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration. i think the most memorable parts are when his scruples are unhinged by narrative. his use of the mother-in-law as the foil for their bad romance is just perfect. see it.the protagonist is originally a devout christian who becomes a vampire after a faulty blood transfusion following his volunteering for a new medicine. he thus becomes the god he once was smitten with. people flock to him and view him as a grand healer. ok. that's really cool and could have provided a great basis for his relationship. yet this idea is given little idea screen time as he changes into a realistic christ figure who tries to maintain his virtue even though his lifestyle demands that he relinquish it. instead of confronting the delusional people, he instead sips blood out of comatose hospital patients.let's continue with the christian allusion. the woman tricks the vampire man into killing her husband. her overprotective mother-in-law suffers a stroke and eventually warns friends of the family of her daughter-in-law's treachery (finger waggles). the man kills her but resurrects her. the two of them invite former friends over and the woman begins mercilessly harassing the humans. the man says enough is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her into waiting for sunrise with him. they both die, but he atones for her crimes (and his own but the film portrays her evil more prominently).the woman character is a caricature, and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior. she is a housewife with no education, while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive. vampirism magnifies their characteristics. she becomes a monster like one would expect of someone without knowledge. he becomes a demigod with a spirit. his life is how atheists view themselves and her life is how religious people view those without divine intervention.

writer-director dean bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest yet compelling road film. his dialogue was snappy, and his use of very short flashback sequences was especially effective in the film's narrative structure.at the heart of the film is the character of alice, who is running away from her new england past in a desperate effort to get to florida. along the way, she travels with a pair of eccentrics, bill and sandra, who incredibly make the attempt to groom alice as a prostitute earning money at truck stops.as a newcomer performing in her first screen role, emily grace as alice is sensational. there is not a false note in her character choices. but the film is worth watching above all for the wily yet sensitive character of sandra, as masterfully created by judith ivey. there is an especially sly subtext to virtually every moment in which ivey is on-camera. as a viewer, i found myself stopping the tape, hitting rewind, and reviewing her scenes in order to attempt to discern the psychological subtleties.the film raises the following question about the characters: are bill and sandra good samaritans, or are they an evil pair of dickensian predators preying upon the youthful alice? one of the strengths of the film is that it never quite fully answers that question. alice seems more self-confident than she started out as a result of her experiences with bill and sandra. but is she really a better person?part comedy, part road picture, and part coming-of-age drama, this carefully crafted film succeeds in involving us on many levels.

until i did a web search on "what alice found", i didn't realize that the name of the film is embedded in the title of one of lewis carroll's books. the book's complete title is "through the looking-glass (and what alice found there)".the alice of the film comes from a background quite different from that of lewis carroll's alice. her fresh and assertive character, however, is similar. the movie alice begins as a young woman in new hampshire who steals money from her ass-patting boss and takes off for miami, vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins. she encounters a middle-aged couple in a motor home (the husband's retired from the military) who rescue her from a strange man at a roadside stop and from her car's breakdown (perhaps caused by their mechanizations).as it turns out, the couple is heavily involved in truck stop prostitution and see sweet, young alice as a promising recruit. the wife (played by judith ivey in a performance worthy of some big award) buys alice sexy clothing and shows her how to apply hot makeup. initially, alice passively accepts her ministrations and, with the couple's instructions, does several tricks. the encounter shown in the most detail is quite different from most cinematic sex but may be typical of what most often happens in real life. the man is shy and deferential and apologizes for "finishing" too fast.what's wonderful about alice (and different from her prototypes from clarissa to sister carrie) is that she learns from her experiences and asserts herself. this is how things really are. prostitution is everywhere. people are neither all good or all bad. alice leaves the motor home with her well-earned money and a feeling of mutual respect.

"what alice found" was a pleasant discovery. as written and directed by a. dean bell, this is combination of a road movie with a cautionary tale, as well as a voyage of discovery.if you haven't seen the film, maybe you should stop reading here.alice is a case study of a young woman that wants to break away from the unhappy life she leads in a new england town. her pretext for leaving is going to join her best friend, who is away studying at a miami university. alice is the product of a single mother's home, one that is struggling to make ends meet, in sharp contrast with the life of ease her friend seems to inhabit. in flashbacks we get to see alice's life before going on the road.alice, like her namesake in "alice in wonderland", embarks in a trip to the unknown that life hasn't prepared her for. the highways of america are full of predators in search of the weak and innocent. alice meets with disaster when her car breaks down the road and a friendly southern couple come to her assistance when a strange man approaches in the darkness with the excuse he wants to help her. sandra and bill convince her to come along in their plush r.v. on her way down south.nothing has prepared alice for what this couple turns out to be. after all, in her sheltered life, she hasn't dealt with what sandra and bill, her new benefactors do during the overnight stays at the rest stops in the american highways. it comes as a shock to her the realization that the kind sandra is nothing but a prostitute that plies her trade among the truck driving populace one meets in those places.alice, brilliantly played by emily grace, is a study in how the young woman awakens to the new reality she can't escape. in fact, sandra makes it seem so easy that alice tries her luck at the oldest profession on earth in order to raise some badly needed money.judith ivey gives a tremendous performance as sandra. ms. ivey is perfect as the seemingly normal woman, one wouldn't suspect she is doing the nasty with clients she and bill find along the route they travel. ms. ivey is amazing when she reveals the truth about her life to an accusing alice. as the husband, bill raymond is good in his portrayal as the husband, that in reality is a procurer.under the excellent direction of mr. dean bell, the film is not afraid to go to places mainstream films dare not to go. congratulations to this director who has written a plausible story and has gathered the perfect cast to play it for our benefit.

just finished this impressively nutty affair and whilst i can't say as it was as good as i had hyped it up to be in my mind it was still an effective and at time pretty nasty piece of brain warped and misogyny fuelled j-trash. its story tells of a poor gal searching for her sister who winds up getting raped and drugged by yakuza scumbags, and the helpful lady doctor who sets out to avenge her, doing so in bizarrely gruesome fashion after a similar bout of rape and drugging. oh yeah and there's a bit of straightforward sex in there as well, sadly its all soft core, as per the japanese disapproval of below the belt nudity, but pixelation is minimal, in fact only really noticeable in a hilarious blow-job scene. although writer/director kazuo "gaira" komizu fails in creating an especially compelling tale this is at least pretty scuzzy stuff, diving early on into the well of filth with a pretty unsettling rape (made worse by the fact that the gal looks kinda young, though i'm pretty sure she was of age). also, for the most part this is pretty professional looking stuff, maybe not stylish but it has a certain flair and the content is handled reasonably well, with particular kudos for largely avoiding having to employ much pixellation. things are mostly sex/rape based for about two thirds of the sharp runtime and its pretty watchable if you groove to such fare, it gets a bit numbing after a while but the ladies are easy on the eye and it is reasonably harsh at times. the music, from yôichi takahashi is occasionally effective, though hardly a key part of the show it does in a few spots complement the action neatly, at any rate enough for me to notice it. more important are the effects, by nobuaki koga, which pack an impressively splattery punch when they appear, helped out by the lunatic nature of the climactic shenanigans. things even pull to a curiously affecting ending, sure it ain't a weepy or anything, but for a film so gutter level for most of its runtime it is relatively poignant. altogether this is a pretty entertaining diversion for mean spirited trash fans, especially those with a taste for japanese rapey adventures. i could really have done with a longer revenge section and more gore, also perhaps more of a point/brains, but hey, it kept me watching and it is pretty nicely stocked with memorably wtf moments. so if you dig this sort of degenerate junk, probably worth your while, just maybe don't expect the second coming.

if they gave out awards for the most depraved and messed-up movies in the world, japanese cinema would clean up: their exploitation cinema wipes the floor with most other contenders, the most extreme examples being absolutely jaw-dropping exercises in bad taste, nauseating gore, freakish weirdness, and misogynistic sex.guts of a beauty is a prime example of such whacked out filth, offering discerning viewers just over an hour of full-on debauchery and gratuitous violence topped off with some very insane j-splatter goodness.the film opens with a young woman named yoshimi, whose search for her missing sister has led her into the hands of some nasty yakuza, who proceed to rape her and shoot her full of strong dope called angel rain. after the gangsters have finished having their fun with the poor woman, she manages to escape and flees to a nearby hospital where sexy psychologist hiromi (megumi ozawa) attempts to help. however, the distraught and confused yoshimi ends up throwing herself off the hospital roof, turning into a water melon as she hits the ground (at least that what it looked like to me!).seeking to avenge yoshimi's death, hiromi lures higashi, a member of the yakuza, to her office, and, whilst jacking him off, hypnotises him into attacking his fellow gang members. after higashi goes slash happy with a knife in the yakuza hq, he is severely beaten and stabbed, forced to tell of his meeting with hiromi, and then hacked into itty bitty pieces.the psychologist is then captured by the gang, subjected to a spot of forced buggery (whilst simultaneously being forced to give head to a yakuza slut), and injected with angel rainafter which she promptly carks it. the gangsters then plonk her body in the boot of their car, along with the remains of higashi, ready for disposal.before they can ditch the corpses, however, the super dope has an unexpected effect on hiromi: she returns from the dead as a hermaphroditic monster with a toothy penis and a ravenous gash, and, hellbent on revenge, sets about killing the yakuza one-by-one; this leads to some memorable scenes of outrageously gory splatter, including a messy head squish, a man being suffocated by the monster's oozing vagina, and a woman being screwed to death by its giant, gnashing phallus.as you can most likely tell from the above synopsis, this is some crazy, screwed up stuff, and probably not to the taste of most sane people, but for those weirdos who have long tired of mainstream cinema and are already well versed in asian excess, guts of a beauty should prove to be delightfully diverting and deviant fun.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for imdb.

kazuo komizu strikes again with "entrails of a beautiful woman", the sequel to "entrails of a virgin". this time around the story is based around a psychologist (megumi ozawa) who decides to take on the yakuza to avenge the suicide of a doped-up and raped patient that winds up on her doorstep one day. when she gets over her head and the yakuza capture her, she learns their insidious plat of doping up girls and selling them into slavery. it apparently ends badly when she overdoses from the cocaine. but she soon melds with another body to be disposed of to becomedum, dum, dum  "super slime hermaphrodite zord"! this he, she = it makes mince meat out of the yakuza and saves the daynot really.well it is better than "entrails of a virgin", but not by much. most of the film (a whopping 67 minutes) consists of rape and sex with fogging and the usual ho-hum stuff. almost towards the end we finally get our gore groove on with a few cool sequence (like an alien-inspired penis-monster through the stomach scene and a gooey asphyxiation) but it still suffers from a hyper low budget feel that makes it fun but can't elevate it from z-grade soft horror-core fare.

guts of a beauty is a bit better than its predecessor guts of a virgin. although this film isn't really a sequel in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first installment, i did find beauty to be a little stronger and better put together all-the-way-around than virgin...but then again, that's not really saying much.beauty starts off as a pretty rough and straight-faced exploit film. a couple of yakuza cats are holding a young woman prisoner and begin gang raping her in pretty brutal fashion. as this nastiness is going on, the head guy tells the girl that they did the same to her sister and sold her into slavery in africa, and that they're gonna do the same to her. they then shoot her up with some drugs and rape her some more. she somehow gets away and ends up at a clinic where the nurse there listens to her sob story. the rapee ends up freaking out from the stress of her prior experience and commits suicide. the clinic worker, moved by the young lady's story, decides to take revenge on the gang by seducing one of the lower-level guys and trying to hypnotize him to make him kill the yakuza leaders. this whole plan backfires, so now ms. vigilante-clinic-worker gets exposed to much the same treatment that our original rapee got - only worse (some pretty rough butt-rape ensues along with the pre-requisite gang rape...). she too is drugged, but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly hapless victim ----- it turns her into a raging hermaphroditic blood demon!!! (no sh!t, that's what really happens!!!) this is when beauty really takes off with some pretty f!cking insane kill scenes - including a very classy chest-burst-rape that looks like a cross between alien and a bad porn, and my favorite - a head-engulfed-by-demon-vagina kill (complete with demon vagina-slime...)that has to be seen to be believed...definitely some promising stuff going on in guts of a beauty, but still very disjointed feeling. beauty almost feels like two different films being forced together in a non-compatible way. still, i have to give the film credit - the rape scenes are very rough and misogynistic, and the kill scenes are just totally off the wall. a solid 7/10 for another crazy j-horror "classic".

this movie, i would like to say, was completely great. i can see how many people would think that it's just a shocker film. this isn't completely untrue, but it's as much of shocker fiction as chuck palahniuk's books are. one of my favorite movies of all time, bijo no harawata is a certain type of crudely made movie that you can have just about any reaction to. it's scary, funny, silly, gross, full of off-the-top material and to some people, arousing. the fist time i saw this, it was with my friend, and his mother had brought it home for him to see it. he said it was just some screwed up japanese movie, but i saw so much more of it. it's badly made, yes, but it has a certain type of poignancy as to be beautiful, too. as the director says himself, this is a shocker movie made for a certain reason. its like atrophy. if you leave audiences soft, then the entire human race is going to be soft. i think this is a good philosophy, and i agree with it one-hundred percent. bijo no harawata is the type of movie that gang rapes the hell out of fitness, yogurt, and all of this new-wave stuff.

i know that guts of a beauty and guts of a virgin are crap films and are hated by many but i'm gonna put myself under the bus here and say i like 'em, especially guts of a beauty (aka entrails of a beautiful woman). watched it the other night with some folks at the pad and i was surprised how well it actually went over.entrails is the type of madcap cheapo horror softcore sleaze epic that you really just don't find too much of outside of asia (specifically japan in this case). it's basically a rape/revenge flick with a reincarnated monster instead of some silly shotgun murders or a motorboat-propelled noose or even a ticked off daddy with a chainsaw...that stuff's just silly. wouldn't you rather see a hermaphroditic monster with a hilarious little snake monster for a winky?perversion factor: this movie is high in graphic, sometimes wacky rape sequences, fake pop shots, and satisfying masturbation and monster sex sequences that you oughta like if you like corman nuggets like humanoids from the deep. i dunno, maybe that's a stretch but i personally didn't think entrails of a beautiful woman let me down as an avid fan of asian sleaze and bizarro b-pics.yeah, i know sometimes some of my recommendations are not always everyone's cuppa tea (even for those of you who like the same kind of garbage as i do) but i stand behind this one. 8/10.

"entrails of a beauty" features a gang of yakuza blokes gang-raping a woman and they drug her,and later on she dies and returns as this big slimy monster with a huge penis that has sharp teeth and also a big sloppy vagina.crazy film,but not very good.the gore doesn't come until the last 20 minutes and most of the film is a standard soft core sex with lots of rape.worth checking out,unfortunately heavily censored optically and nowhere near as much fun as "entrails of a virgin".

i recently saw episodes 1-4, and now i can't wait for 5 & 6 to be available! (i've heard they are coming soon.) commander's log seems destined to become a cult hit among the university crowd and all others with a taste for quirky comedy. it's obvious that the budget was small, but the care taken in crafting the script is quite evident. in fact, the simplicity of the show allowed me appreciate the writing and the acting more. bowlsby is a master of the put-down... i just wish i could remember all the best ones for later use on unsuspecting co-workers! let's just say that if you don't like commander's log, i'll personally see to it that your undies get extra starch!

i first heard about commander's log when i was on the concom for the local science fiction convention. craig bowlsby, linden banks, sophie banks, and brian oberquell came out to show the video and give a couple of panels on making tv on a shoestring budget. i have to say that i was very pleased when i finally had the chance to see the show. comparisons with red dwarf are inevitable, since the first seasons of red dwarf were also shot on a low budget (although commander's log has to set some kind of record for the least amount of money spent per minute of air time), and thus have to make up for the lack of "eye candy" with good writing and acting. linden banks, who plays chief petty officer blather, does a particularly good job of presenting an earnest but clueless persona.bowlsby's original idea was for the story to be told in two minute "interstitials", shown in between other shows over the course of an evening, although for some reason, space didn't get how cool an idea this would have been, and so the interstitials were all rolled up into a one-hour show, which space normally showed in two half-hour episodes. the existing dvd doesn't include episode 3 (which premiered at cascadia-con in seattle in 2005) or episode 4 (which was previewed at vcon in vancouver in 2006), but if you're in touch with your local fannish community, you may catch news of a showing somewhere near you.

after the death of all senior officers, commander craig-scott, of the laundry and morale corps, finds himself promoted to command of an intergalactic spaceship owned by starcups corporation. its chief mission is to search for inhabitable planets and, of course, long-term coffee markets.craig-scott and his second in command, chief blather, find themselves ill-prepared for command, except insofar as they are fully able to keep the crew's undies clean--which is not to diminish the importance of clean undies, especially when incompetent commanders cause those same undies to be, well, soiled on a regular basis.the episodes are presented as a series of short, 2-3 minutes reports by the commander to earth. the humor is a mix of wry deadpan and outrageous physical comedy. think yes minister meets red dwarf, but on a shoe-string budget. all the usual plot devices of sci-fi are here--aliens, nuclear weapons, computer malfunctions--but each is improved by the fresh lemony scent of high-grade laundry detergent.commander's log is definitely low-budget, but the somewhat cheesy effects and props fit the absurd premise of the show. remember those hilarious hockey helmets they wore on the old battlestar galactica? with the "jofa" brand-name still visible? okay, there's a lot of that in commander's log, but it's cute.commander's log ain't high-art, but that's not what it's trying to be. it's just a little bit of off-kilter fun. it does a good job of being that.

a kooky, but funny bit of diversion. you kind of have to see it from the beginning to follow what's happening, but each report to earth has it's own little joke. pretty good special effects for a very low budget sci-fi t.v. show. it's fun to watch. sort of in the vein of red dwarf, but even more low budget. for someone who's just coming in in the middle of one of the episodes, what you have to realize is that these guys are all incompetent, because they've been moved up the ladder of command, because the other officers died. also, the main guys are from the laundry corps, which is why they have laundry in everything. if you like red dwarf, you'll probably like this. slightly different t.v. concept, in that all you see is the commander's report each day.it would be better if this were explained more, not just in the very beginning of the first episode, but then it was pretty hard to figure out what had happened in red dwarf too, if you hadn't been told.

i was like watching it right and i was all like oh this is so totally awesome-full and then i was all like ya quite good indeed so i really enjoyed all the amazing dangers and all the british people and i think that the doctor is very a good doctor in his way of doing such wonderful doctor-y things and he was a very strange man and i was like maybe i won't like this guy because hes a new doctor and i like the old doctor thats not this guy but then i watched him and i was like oh this is awesome and i liked it so then i watched and enjoyed the great evil enemies and the great conquering of the evil guys and the happy doctor who is quite scary and happy looking

i write this after just seeing the latest episode broadcast in the uk, and to me it must be a tough job to keep up the standard. the last episode shown called "blink" has elements of gothic horror all to do with statues that aren't quite what they seem. the doctor and martha don't appear much, but that doesn't detract from a well crafted episode. the general standard has built to a high level and the last three episodes, the two parter with "the family" and the latest have to me been the best that the current team have ever done.it's not just david tennant holding it together, the whole supporting cast week in, week out are helping as well. for those awaiting series 3 abroad, the wait is is well worth it.

i'm a next generation person...i've never saw the original doctor who but i have heard about the series that sparked a great fan base in the past and still making its mark in the 21'st century; the new "doctor who" started in 2005 but for those that live here in the states like myself we pretty much see it as new episodes on sci-fi channel or bbc america; from season one we are introduce to a new player rose tyler (billie piper) and a pretty cool new doctor played by christopher eccelson (misspelled last name sorry). these two go on some many amazing and very extremely dangerous missions to save the world...every now and then they have companions from rose's ex-boyfriend mickey to the now ever present jack harkness (who can now be seen on the spin off "torchwood"). from season one to season two the pace is just about right...the stories can be from the outlandishly weird to the most action packed paced driven but either way its one rollercoster ride from the start of the theme song which is very catchy.in season two he becomes different and changes and now the new doctor (david tennant) continues the fight to save the world with rose and from this point there can be some that say some of the season wasn't as good but i have to disagree and it was sad to see rose and the doctor part ways but it leaves the opening "companion" role to martha (played by the very sexy freema agyeman) who helps continue the fight to save mankind...season three now is more on the action/adventure level and sometimes on the emotional but not as much as the first two seasons; here the relationship between the doctor and martha is fitting but the attractiveness can be rushed into at times and the obviousness comes into play that she's not rose tyler being that you experienced her company in the first two seasons and not in the third season it can be a bit awkward it was for me cause you get use to rose and her ways and now to see someone who at times don't really question the doctor on an emotional level but all the same makes the pace very exciting for viewers which keeps you at the edge of your seat.all in all this is one thrill ride of a television show i would give it more but there are some flaws to this show as well that i can't mention cause its sometimes hard to pick up but just one does which is the doctor and martha's relationship is rushed and not leveled on the get to know you base; i've seen good shows on british tv but this is by far one of the coolest sci-fi adventures for the old and new generation to experience but you don't have to take my world for it...step into the tardis and join the adventure.

unlike most people who've commented, i was born after the last sylvester mccoy episode and so couldn't have compared the two centuries of doctor who at first. i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series. i have, since then, seen old episodes of doctor who and some where great, but, like the doctor, the series needed to regenerate to continue. the 21st century doctor who's are great, i thought martha was great, almost a match for the doctor and if jack's appearance is anything to go by, she's going to be brilliant when she cameos in series 4 or 5.speaking of jack, the spin of, torchwood is also brilliant and you should watch both of these programmes (though this is definitely more suitable for kids). however, if you insist that this isn't the same and just isn't doctor who, please, just stay in your basement.10/10

as soon as the credits rolled on saturday night you could feel it in the air that the doctor was most definitely back!watching those iconic moments where christopher eccelston met billie piper was the beginning of a huge long adventure.with this new series it brings with it substences in which the previous version of the show lacked. for instence, the emotion between the doctor and his companion which they seemed to dismiss in the old series, as well as the doctor actually falling in love with a companion and receiving her love in return. yet as we know, the doctor shall forever remain lonely as the end of season 2 proved, he could not stay with a companion forever. watching those moments, your eyes filling with tears as the doctor says his final farewell to the only companion he has ever loved, were moments beautifully written and acted.this show however proved it can live on as the doctor meets many other companions along his lonely yet exciting journey through his never ending life.openeing new doors and secrets every episode it's a sure show for the family to enjoy...as christopher eccelston once described the show... "the journey of a lifetime."

honestly, i don't really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show. it embraces the elements of the original, while expanding on them. the storytelling has been updated and, while some of the episodes seem to be a bit "fast", that is a good thing.christopher eccleston is perfect in the role. easily as good as tom baker.rose is one of the best companions, on par with sarah jane smith or leela.i like the concept that the timelords have been destroyed - no more politicking with the doctor acting as president emeritus. and it adds something to the character to be the only one left.the sfx are outstanding - especially in comparison to the original.take it from me (and i was a huge dr who geek - i actually took notes while watching the show all the way from dr number 1 to dr number 8. i tossed the horrible movie out of cannon, personally) this is the best sci fi show on tv right now, possibly ever. watch it and buy the dvd.

okay, i grew up on who, but haven't loved a doctor since tom baker. christopher eccleston made me love who again and i'll be furious with him forever for leaving. the writing is grand, the acting superb, the directing (which was dreadful in the old days) is just fantastic. i was very skeptical about this programme, and watched it merely out of being forced, but am now a huge fan and love it (i have a ringtone of a dalek screaming "exterminate" then). a few of the things i love about the new programme -- 1) people actually notice when rose (billie piper) disappears off the planet. some of the old shows an assistant would drop off for a while, and then come home like nothing has happened, no one noticed. 2) chris eccleston's doc loves rose -- romantic or not will be debated, but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares about his companion. he'd destroy the world if he had to to save her, which the old show was lacking -- often a doctor wouldn't care if he never saw his assistants again. 3) they talk and think like real people -- when rose is shown something outlandish or new (such as aliens) she acts like a real person would -- gobsmacked. i never liked it when an assistant from the old show, who never saw anything alien, would just fit right in and adapt instantly. i want to see the surprise on rose's face when she sees a plastic dummy come to life. she gives that to me. the few things i don't like about this series: 1)nearly everything happens on earth (london or cardiff) and i was sort of hoping for a more off-world sort of show. 2) that eccleston left so quickly, he really made the show brilliant. but i can let those few things go -- i far more enjoy the series than i ever expected to, so i don't mind if they have stuff set on earth. just don't take this show seriously -- it's fun, it's smart, it's entertaining, but it's not a super-serious heavy duty show. it's pure fun, and pure british, and i can't get enough. watch it with an open mind, and just put your brain into neutral and enjoy!ps -- don't watch series 2 or later. series 1 was brilliant, the first few episodes of series 2 were good, but don't watch it once it gets to love and monsters. utter rubbish, completely destroys the show.

i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local pbs station played while growing up.(got introduced to the doctor by way of john pertwee)as well as "camera copies" of doctor who sent to america by uk fans to their us counterparts. i had a great time w/ the show, but it never seemed to take itself seriously - i mean as seriously as a sci-fi show about a time traveler could be. i went to the cons, did the costume bit (doctor#5,6 and tegan were my costume characters), loved it. then it all came to a sudden halt. program politics and lack of interest and funding turned doctor who into a 25year old antique that drifted into the ethos.when i heard that the sci-fi channel had picked up the new doctor, my first thought was, "cool, now my 11 year old son can see what i've been babbling on about all these years, and know what the heck a tardis is" (i have several phone boxes and tardises of various sizes around the house)i didn't expect the excellent quality of story, character development and f/x. i was to say the least - pleased. for the first time, i found a doctor that wasn't a curmudgeon, a clown, a fop, a trip-head, a pussy, or a jerk. christopher eccleston is by far the most believable doctor to date.now, now, calm down tom baker fans! don't get me wrong, i loved almost every doctor and his quirks, but christopher gave something to the doctor that he'd never had before - real word believability. i'm just sad that he decided against another season. i'll try out david tennant as i would any other doctor, but now the bar has risen...bad wolf rules!!!!!2008 update - i love david tennant! his "mod" persona is something that my generation remembers, my son's generation can deal with, and fashion gestapo can relax! he's a little more human than christopher, but not as humas as other former doctors. i miss rose, i dig martha, and what were they thinking with donna noble!?!? it's still the best ride on tv

as a child i was never in a situation where i could be introduced to dr who and though i had heard of the series in passing, i never really realized exactly what it was. it was, then, with some hesitation that i sat down to watch the ninth doctor and his antics having be told that he was something like arthur dent (from the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy) but cooler. i can't believe what i've been missing out on, seriously, why had no one told me about this before? my entire childhood was deprived of doctor who adventures; me being a tremendous fan of most sci-fi and fantasy adventures. honestly, i thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to any future episodes.i have to admit that at first i was not so sure that billie piper would be the best actress but i'm happy to say that she did very well, i thought, and added a very realistic touch to the series. i think, actually, that was one of my favourite aspects of the series; the contrast between great alien conflict scenes contrasted with the infuriating normality of the south london council estate life. i'm always interested in instances where people's ideas about the world are drastically challenged and how people can take any situation and edit it in their minds so that it may fit in with their mundane lives. i also loved christopher eccleston. i haven't seen many of his films and i've never seen another actor as dr who, but i thought his portrayal of the doctor was brilliant, immensely likable and yet dark enough to make you wonder. i find that many other characters with his sort of character history tend to be a bit two-dimensional; they have all the right emotions and actions, but they always seems slightly shallow. this doctor, on the other hand, earned my loyalty with his stratified personality. i agree with some of the other comments that a higher budget for the special effects, aliens and whatnot, might have been a bit more effective. but then again, this isn't about special effects (though they help) from what i've read and heard from long-time dr who fans; it's the spirit of the whole things that really counts. and i don't think they did a bad job with what they had. i quite liked all the aliens but my favourite had to be the daleks; if i ever knew anything about dr who before watching the series, it was that there were things in it that looked like upturned dustbins on wheels. previous to watching, i was quite sceptical about these pepper-pots threatening the existence of humanity but some of them were quite scary! which i loved,of course.overall, a good show. i look forward to future episodes with delight. the doctor has a new fan.

i get a kick out of the new who fans who call it, excellent,their entitled to that opinion but the new series isn't quite there yet, it's getting there. it's definitely good.first the good things. the special effects are obviously better nearly 20 yrs later since the last episode of doctor who "battlefield" was aired.one thing the bbc has always liked is doctor who (except when they tried to cancel in the 70's and 80's). however, the anticipation and the pressure was great but i think the new series has passed the test it's good, it's still not excellent because it does have it's flaws. some of the stories "dalek" were very poor. i assume it was written in a couple of minutes by some idiot who never bothered to remake the dalek character or never bothered to watch the old series."aliens in london" was by far probably the best episode so far, it started a new storyline about aliens which has lasted across several episodes including "boomtown".now the other bad things, the companion, rose, billie piper, isn't great. she's actually quite annoying but as is dr. who a young teeny bopper had to be eventually chosen and she got the part.christopher eccleston is pretty respectable, he's started to catch his niche. he tried to play the character, straight then funny always missing the right punchline but he's taken it much more serious and it shows.continuity wise there still some issues that didn't get resolved well, paul mcgann was still the doctor before this but he didn't get put back.aside from that though the series overall is pretty good, i haven't missed an episode and it never gets boring, so i recommend any doctor who fan to check it out and see the new doctor who series.

2005 will go down in 'dr.who' history as its most incredible year. everything seemed to click; a first-rate new doctor and companion, big audiences ( 10 million for the first episode and christmas special ), major awards, critical acclaim and those idiots who spent years giggling at the daleks' seeming inability to negotiate stairs were well and truly silenced. but then christopher eccleston dropped a bombshell, quitting after just one series. it looked like the honeymoon was over. luckily, the public appears to have embraced his successor, the excellent david tennant. on top of this the show boasts fine s.f.x., like the spaceship crashing into 'big ben' in 'aliens of london' and superb story lines such as 'tooth & claw', 'army of ghosts/doomsday'. the new 'dr.who' is basically the same as the old, only updated for the 21st century. some fans have accused russell t.davies of 'ruining' the show. they need to remember that there was no show for sixteen years until he came along.

the long kiss goodnight has just about everything action fans want: a witty screenplay by the guy who wrote lethal weapon, samuel l. jackson, and great action set pieces by renny harlin.seriously underrated. one of the best action movies ever.

this is movie is actually one of my all time favorites. i'm not a renny harlin fan because most of his movies suck, but tlkg hits its mark time after time. tlkg is about a woman named samantha cain (davis) who suffers from amnesia. she is married with a kid and as she qoutes "i'm a goddamn member of the pta." and then her world comes crumbling down as the pieces fall into place about her earlier identity. samuel jackson plays a con artist cop who does pi gigs, he is dragged along by her to solve her identity and to get paid some cash for his work. along the way we find out samantha is really charlie baltimore, a secret spy that was left for dead years earlier. the plot is great, making this story seem real and jackson does a great job as second fiddle to davis (whom always does a great acting job). the explosions are endless, the action is intertwined with memorable scene after memorable scene. pretty impressive visually though the kid got on my nerves at the end (watch out of the cars!) i'm tired of little kids screwing up a film to be saved but still, this movie is worth it as the kid adds to the film. again, this movie is really good, i never understood why it didn't make more at the box office but if it was a man starring in the movie i'm sure it would have grossed a hundred million. what is good is that over the years more people are discovering this movie and giving it good marks as the average of this film on this site has risen over the years. i hope it goes up further as this is one great action film. and i love action films

let me start by saying overall i enjoyed the long kiss goodnight. i would give it a 7/10. the good: 1. acting: samuel l jackson is entertaining in almost any role. in this movie he doesn't play his usual character, the type that is in control, instead geena davis is in control and sam is along for the ride. his timing on his lines are great and he is the high point of the movie. geena davis also gives a great preformance as samantha caine/charlie baltimore. she is a believable action hero and i don't think too many other actresses could pull off the preformance geena does. 2. the action: this is a very action packed movie. things are pretty much always crashing or blowing up or someone is chasing someone else. the special effects are pretty good especially for being almost 8 years old. i can see some green screen stuff but it doesn't detract too much from the acting.the bad: 1. why did it take half of the movie to set up the plot? this film needed to be edited in the script stage so that it didn't run as long as it did. maybe a drama or something can run this long but people really need to be into the movie the entire time to sustain it. i think that if you can stick out the first half you will be pleseantly suprized the second half. 2. geena davis is cold weather and a tank top but she never seems cold. 3. some things are unrealistic. sam jackson flies through a giant sign after he is blasted out of a room and then he lands in a tree and just gets up. when you see this part you will think it's a gag. overall fun movie 7/10

i thought this was a great action flick. a very good role for geena davis. she is a very versatile actress. one of my favs next to angelina jolie. i actually watched the long kiss goodnight right after seeing the new tomb raider movie. it got me thinking, charlie or lara? which one would win in a fight??? either way, both women are very strong, intelligent characters that are fun to watch. especially when they're kicking butt. i just hope to see geena in another film soon. seems like she's been out of the spotlight a bit too long. it would be especially nice to see her in another film with samuel l. jackson. now they make a great duo. watch this film if you haven't. you won't be disappointed.

a wonderful christmas story on the moving theme of "susie homemaker finds her inner amazon." no, i'm serious! geena davis's amnesia starts to improve when she is knocked on the head. from this familiar beginning, we move in an unexpected direction. good pace, good action, fun story, lots of explosions and mayhem.

i had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable tv and i can't understand why. geena outdoes arnold as an action hero in this film! geena is an ex-cia assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. she continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter. clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. it seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does. she hires samuel l. jackson, who is a former police officer. together they form a pair that is as entertaining as mel gibson & danny glover. when geena finally regains her memory she undergoes a transformation into the killing machine she once was with the song "she's not there" playing in the background. what follows is geena and samuel have to go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive. all through the rest of the film geena has to decide who she really is. the killing unfeeling machine? the mother/schoolteacher with the quiet family life? or a combination of both? especially, since the bad guys grab geena's daughter. great action scenes that rank up with any of the die hard movies!

stephen sondheim's sweeney todd: the demon barber of fleet street opened on broadway on 1 march 1979 with len cariou and angela lansbury in the leading roles. although it swept virtually every award imaginable, the box office fell short of expectations and the original production ended its run at 557 performances. fortunately, however, the play then went on tour--and along the way was captured on film. the result is a remarkable capture of the play featuring george hern, who replaced cariou, and lansbury in a close approximation of the original broadway staging.there is, however, a flaw. simply stated: stage plays do not film very well, for a performance that works well on the stage must fill the theatre and is therefore very, very large--and when placed on film such performances often seem slightly static, oppressively aggressive, or both. sweeney todd is no exception. seen on film, it has a "stand and sing" quality, and while both hern and lansbury seem to have modulated their performances for the sake of the camera such is not the case with betsy joslyn as joanna; her larger-than-life performance reads on film as unpleasantly frantic and her extremely operatic voice feels out of place when contrasted with the voices of the overall cast.taking this stage-play-on-film effect into consideration, however, this really is an exceptional performance of a unique and macabrely comic musical in the operetta style. lansbury is astonishing, a mixture of silliness, stupidity, and cunning malice, while hern truly owns the role of the psychotic barber whose clients "go to their graves impeccably shaved." the overall cast is quite fine and although the film does not let us see quite enough of the set, there is enough on display for it to be impressive. and the music! who can argue with what most consider sondheim's finest work? the story itself is extremely well-known, particularly in england. in 1846 thomas peckett prest cobbled together several urban myths for a short story he titled a string of pearls; within a year or so it was adapted to the stage as sweeney todd, the demon barber of fleet street--and, in an era that knew little of copyright law, variations of the play were soon playing all over england. each one, however, was more or less the same: sweeney todd, a barber, kills the men who come to him for a shave; mrs. lovett, his associate, bakes them up into pies and feeds them to an unsuspecting public. the sondheim version is specifically based on a 1973 version by christopher bond.the story is very grand guignol, with a lot of blood, bodies dropping down chutes, and grotesque humor; at the same time, however, the music, lyrics, and subplot of an innocent in the clutches of evil open out the subject to numerous lyric charms one would not expect. sondheim's lyrics are often ironic, but never more so than here; he intertwines a great deal of wicked satire re industry and capitalism along the way, and certainly one cannot fault the strange yet victorian-elegant of his complex music.like the "concert version" starring hern and patti lupone, this particular film also provides us with several selections that were cut from the 2007 tim burton film version, most particularly the opening "attend the tale of sweeney todd," which runs like a thread throughout the play. it is also, in my opinion, considerably more comic than the film, which tends to underplay comedy in favor of a still greater show of blood. whatever the case, if you are a fan of the story, this is the legendary broadway show on tour, and it is a knock-out. recommended.gft, amazon reviewer

everything is illuminated a young jewish american searches for the woman that helped his grandfather escape nazi persecution while embarking on a cross-european tour with some unlikely associates.liev schreiber makes his directorial debut with a playful angst usually associated with his acting ethos. when successful actors decide to sit in the director's chair, we usually get a biographical glimpse at the souls beneath the acting mask- check. we usually get a mishmash of genres- check. but what we normally do not get is an insightful original film which is credible, intelligent and moving.elijah wood plays jonathan, an inquisitive young boy who collects pieces of life as he goes. he is on a mission to find a woman in a photograph. the sepia picture bears his grandfather (an uncanny resemblance to him) and the woman. to aid his journey he enlists the help of travel guides that comprise of a hip-hop loving break-dancer, alex (eugene hutz), his apathetic and perma-vexed grandfather (boris leskin) and his dog- sammy davis junior jr! what ensues is essentially a comedy. there is an un-patronisingly simple introduction with voice-overs. alex's is especially funny as he educates his younger brother on the year 1969, proving how popular he is with the chicks and break-dancing thus setting him up as jonathan's antithesis.schreiber begins to break down the characters as they progress and the comedy acts as an intentional veil to what is a story about three people linked to the holocaust who do not really know themselves. all three hold the film with tenderness and authenticity something schreiber was unlikely to get wrong and as enchanting and fantastical as the film is, the horrors that are allowed to crack through, i.e. the past are presented in an almost palatable tone (incidental music, cinematography) which make them all the more unsettling.as the unlikely group finally find the town they seek they learn of the true atrocities that occurred and find out a lot about who they really are.elijah wood is as authentic as usual, bringing his usual innocence and strength to the screen. formally a resident good in lord of the rings and a resident evil in sin city he plays jonathan with aplomb as he is bombarded with culture shocks and a quest for truth. boris leskin as the grandfather also delivers his angst and frustration at the youths with great humour and conviction as his own past is unravelled. however, it is eugene hutz as alex that makes the show. the director using that old trade of translation misunderstandings to create and maintain a humour that is actually funny and not gimmicky.schreiber has delivered an enchanting debut that has both heart and soul. the continuous score and beautiful photography creates a fairy tale haze around a story about identity, truth and family. if there was a complaint, it would be the speed at which the film changes direction; though this could have been intentional it may not sit well with all. nevertheless this is a sterling effort that delivers great comedy and bonding between an unlikely group while dissecting another aspect of the horrors of world war 2 in a completely fresh fashion.-chi&ojo

i first saw this movie on an alaska airlines flight, and have since seen it twice more. it simply is -- and is simply -- one of the best films in years. i found myself having enjoyed it after my first viewing, but a little cloudy on what had happened. after seeing it again a few weeks later, things began to fall into place. it wasn't confusing, just deep. in fact, the depth of the movie may not be appreciated for a long time. for example, it occurred to me only after my third viewing that sammy davis jr jr (grandfather's dog) is more than just a pet -- perhaps she's the stand-in for his dead wife. witness how fiercely he protects her. there is symbolism galore, and none of it sappy or indulgent, just real. the adventure of their trip keeps the story-line in perpetual motion, and even when they arrive, you're not sure if it really was the destination. as the movie continues, so does the adventure and i got the sense the destination was merely a way-point. the sound-track is fun, the scenery compelling -- and both decidedly eastern-block. i could go on and on about the deeper meanings within the film, but i'm not entirely sure i've discovered all the nuances yet. besides, it's more fun to tease these out yourself. as much as any film can be, "everything is illuminated" has proved to be like a fine wine that sweetens with time. i highly recommend seeing it -- twice.

in america, the jewish jonathan safran foer (elijah wood) collects personal belongings of his family for recollection. a few moments before dying, his grandmother gives an old photograph of his grandfather with a woman called augustine in ukraine. jonathan contacts the odessa heritage tours, a family agency in ukraine, to guide him to the location where the picture had been taken to find augustine, and together with the interpreter alex (eugene hutz), his grandfather and a weird dog, they travel in an old car searching the missing past of jonathan's family."everything is illuminated" is a strange movie about a weird young man with the compulsive behavior of collecting souvenirs from his family to not forget them that seeks the past of his grandfather to understand how could be his life if his grandfather had not moved to usa. this bizarre vegetarian character meets a dysfunctional ukrainian family that owns an amateurish travel agency specialized in helping jews to find missing relatives, and together they have an almost surrealistic road-trip through the country of ukraine. the movie begins like a comedy, with a sarcastic black humor, and ends in a touching and tragic drama recommended for specific audiences. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "uma vida iluminada" ("an illuminated life")

spoilers a jewish frodo? yep, that'll be elijah wood again.ever since the concluding part of "lord of the rings", elijah wood as frodo has found it increasingly difficult to get away from that major role. playing a football hooligan, a psychopath and now a young jewish american, wood has tried any route he can to escape this typecasting. now, with "everything is illuminated" he might finally have achieved this. playing a role which isn't as radical as other efforts, he truly gets to the soul of his character. still, it isn't like wood does this alone. aided by a magnificent adaptation by first time directer liev schreiber and a wonderful performance by newcomer eugene hutz, wood has found a magnificent production to spread his wings. "everything is illuminated" is a magnificent, moving piece of cinema.jonathan safran foer (wood), a young american jew, sets out to the ukraine to find the mysterious girl who rescued his grandfather and helped him get to america. arriving in the country, jonathan meets the all talking, all dancing alex (hutz) and his racist grandfather (boris leskin). travelling across the country, the three slowly learn more and more about the history and relations that alex and jonathan never knew existed.it's a strange feeling when the film progresses into it's second chapter (it is actually divided into four overall). the first part, whilst occasionally a bit funny, is mostly serious and intense. so when we are given a brief history of alex and his family in the second part, to switch from serious to hilarious is a weird step. it doesn't quite work, but as the film progresses, it definitely learns it's lesson as this mix of humour and sadness merges finer as time passes.to the ultimate credit of everyone involved, as the story does continue, so do we begin to fall for the characters more and more. elijah wood is magnificent, boris leskin is so intense and strong that it raises questions why hollywood has never properly noticed him. most notable of all however is newcomer eugene hutz. playing an intensely troubled character, hutz is absolutely brilliant. he shows the split between his relatives and the real world with almost perfect skill, and when his character is communicating with wood, you genuinely connect with him on a deeper level. without hutz, the story is so strong that the film would still be magnificent, but with him, it hits the next level.as a debut work for actor turned director liev schreiber, the story is also a brilliant piece to start. a work of passion (schreiber's grandfather himself an immigrant to america), he manages to truly embrace the emotion of the content, and by presenting us with some truly beautiful scenery and some magnificent shots, he manages to really hit home. the final half hour in particular is so beautifully created, that it's a challenge for a tear not to form in any viewers eye. it is a moving story, and with schreiber's help, it becomes even more powerful.constructed with love from a passionate director, "everything is illuminated" is a beautiful piece. a road story with a difference, it is magnificently acted and wonderfully written. it's a film that everyone should see, and it is the perfect way for elijah wood to finally lay frodo to rest.

i really liked this movie ... but the ads i saw implied, and one published review actually said, that this movie "benefits from a light touch." that to me is very misleading.there is indeed plenty of humor: eccentric, un-subtle, sometimes somewhat twisted humor: the kind of humor i generally find very appealing indeed. but most of the humor is the kind that appears conscious at all times of things deeply serious, deeply sensitive, even deeply painful. the movie weaves together themes of past and present, perception and truth, memory and activity, life and death. the entire movie is suffused by the history of european anti-semiticism in general, and of the holocaust in particular.how can humor and horror be combined in the same movie? the review i saw suggested that the humor is absurdist. i don't think this is the case at all; at least not in the common sense. instead, i think this movie stands in the tradition of much jewish / yiddish literature and theatre. i don't claim to be any kind of expert in this area; but from what i've seen, humor is used, in this cultural context, both as a coping tool for the horribly tragic experiences of this people; and also humor is used as a means of "recovering the divine" for men and women who choose a path of faith rather than a path of either despair or absurdism. see "fiddler on the roof" for humor used in both ways in this rich tradition.elijah wood (jonathon) wood wears horn rimmed glasses that really make him look, well, strange: compare sin city when he wore the same kinds of glasses with chilling effect. in this movie, it's easy to see how the glasses become a metaphor for both his search and for his struggle between perception and truth. eugene hutz (young alex) and boris lesking (old alex) are both really just wonderful. jonathon and young alex are from the same generation, yet seem so very, very different; and then find that they are not so different after all. and the way in which the apparent narrative voice changes gradually from that of jonathon to that of young alex .. as a journey of intended discovery for jonathon becomes one of discovery for both young alex and old alex ... is to me so very moving.there are some wonderful scenes and panoramas from (i'm told) prague and environs, standing in for the ukraine of the story line. all feels very authentic and seems to give a wonderful sense of place; although i've never been myself to the ukraine and can hardly testify to this from first hand experience.all in all, if you're looking for light comedy, i would not recommend this movie at all. on the other hand, if you are interested in a wonderful, delightful, and deeply moving film, please, check out this wonderful movie.

2005 was one of the best year for movies. we had so many wonderful movies, like batman begins, sin city, corpse bride, a history of violence.....coming up we also got brokeback mountain, king kong....but if this year the only great movie that came out was everything is illuminated, then we wouldn't miss all this year has brought. the first movie as a director of the talented liev schreiber is a delightful, heart-warming, touching drama that also brings one of elijah wood's best roles. he is perfect as jonathan, a curious man that heads for ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather in world war ii. liev schreiber, who also writes the movie, conducts a masterpiece, with memorable scenes and (a lot of) funny quotes. this here is a genuine mixture of comedy with drama, bringing a movie that will be commented years from now. a serious oscar contender, everything is illuminated is a powerful, original, and, why not say, illuminated movie. but there's one thing you should remember while entering the movie: leave normal behind. this is special.------9/10

what an original piece of work. i've always enjoyed liev schreiber the "actor", but now one must appreciate the man on a multi-dimensional level . how did he get that field of sunflowers? was it computerize, it sure looked real. and how do you audition a dog knowing you are going to get that kind of performance? does the academy have a category for animals? i guess what i'm saying is that i really, really enjoyed this quirky, offbeat, little indie film. from the excellent cast (one would never know eugene hutz was not a pro actor) to the cinematographer (some beautiful shots) the music (bought the cd when exiting the theater) and of course the two "d's" (direction and the dog). all in all a "10"./

"everything is illuminated" is a simplified interpretation of something more than half of the jonathan safran foer novel. this version is more about changes in eastern europe from world war ii through post-cold war and how the younger generation relates to that history as a family memory. debut director/adapter liev schreiber retains some of the humor and language clashes of the novel, mostly through the marvelous eugene hutz as the u.s.-beguiled ukrainian tour guide. he is so eye-catching that the film becomes more his odyssey into his country and his family as he goes from his comfortable milieu in sophisticated odessa to the heart of a cynical, isolated land that has been ravaged by conquerors through the communists and now capitalists, with both jews and non-jews as detritus. as funny as his opening scenes are when he establishes his cheeky bravura, we later feel his fish-out-of-waterness in his own country when he tries to ask directions of local yokels. shreiber uses elijah wood, as the american tourist, as an up tight cog in a visual panoply, as his character is less verbal than as one of the narrators in the book. he and hutz play off each other well until the conclusion that becomes more sentimental in this streamlined plot. once the grandfather's story takes over in the last quarter of the film, marvelously and unpredictably enacted by boris leskin, the younger generation does not seem to undergo any catharsis, as they just tidy up the closure.schreiber does a wonderful job visualizing the human urge to document history. one of his consultants in the credits is professor yaffa eliach and her style of remembering pre-holocaust shtetl life through artifacts clearly inspired the look and it is very powerful and effective.the czech republic stands in for the ukraine and the production design staff were able to find memorable symbols of change in the cities, towns and countryside, as this is now primarily a road movie, and the long driving scenes do drag a bit. schreiber retains some of the symbolism from the book, particularly of the moon and river, but having cut out the portions of the book that explain those, they just look pretty or ominous for atmosphere and no longer represent time and fate. as w.c. fields would have predicted, the dog steals most of his scenes for easy laughs. in general, schreiber does go for more poignancy than the book. it is irresistibly touching, especially for those who haven't read the book, but less morally and emotionally messy.the film is enormously uplifted by its marvelous soundtrack, which ranges from songs and instrumentals from hutz's gypsy band to traditional tunes to contemporary tracks to paul cantelon's klezmer fusion score. this is not a holocaust film per se, being a kind of mirror image of "the train of life (train de vie)" as about memory of a time that is freighted with meaning now, but will resonate more with those who have an emotional connection to that history.

actor turned director liev schreiber (the sum of all fears) does an above average screen version of the novel, everything is illuminated, by author jonathan safran foer. this tale of journey and self discovery is highlighted by strong ensemble performances and sharp direction with a storyline that enriches and enlightens the soul.jonathan foer (elijah wood) is a young man who has seen his grandfather, safran, pass away. jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small objects and life's little memorabilia and sealing them in plastic ziplock bags to display them on his wall. safran gives jonathan an old picture showing a young safran standing next to a beautiful girl who saved his life many years ago. thus jonathan commences on a long journey to locate this mystery woman in the ukraine not knowing if she is still alive. he enlists the help of a brash, young tour guide named alex (eugene hutz) and his grandfather (boris leskin) to drive him to his goal. at first the trip hits dead ends and false leads, but as the group nears its target, the men find themselves amid the ruins of a dark chapter in history with the memories of war and the past ghosts of a nonexistent town. there, they find their own respective destinies and will be forever changed by what they learn.this film feels like it was directed by someone who knew how to get the most from his actors. at times, the film is spoken in russian and seems like a foreign film. the title itself is a play on self discovery. this is a thoughtful trek of one man into his past, and his past ironically involves his companions; jonathan's obsessive journey becomes an emotional journey for alex and his grandfather as well. it's a tale of bonding over the long haul and the guilt one must carry for a lifetime. by the end of the film, these characters have all experienced life altering events that will permanently intertwine their lives. it proves that memories can be powerful in traumatizing and also cleansing the soul. it's also about one's legacy and how others view an event or a person in the past. alex eventually sees his grandfather in a completely different light. even our perception of these individuals will have changed by film's end which is a tribute to a story that is well told.the story is deceptively simple. it functions as a road trip movie (like the straight story) combined with an interesting mystery story. it really involves a great many layers of emotions and subplots that range from the past to the present. the ending is a bit surreal with its déjà vu feeling.elijah wood (sin city, the eternal sunshine of the spotless mind)) has chosen a wide range of roles ever since his splash in the lord of the rings trilogy. here, he does a fine job with what is essentially a minimalist role with not much to show. eugene hutz and boris leskin fare better as alex and his grandfather respectively. even the grandfather's dog named sammy davis jr. jr. (that's right) is funny as a fiercely loyal companion.the spare music score by paul cantelon is a moody compliment to the thoughtful nature of the film. the editing is effective as imagery from past and present are linked and transitioned effortlessly. the cinematography by matthew libatique (gothika, requiem for a dream) is appropriately stark and lifeless with some impressive images of war and its aftermath.the coincidences that emerge during the last half of the film make for good drama but are a little too coincidental. we never fully understand the whole background story of alex's grandfather and what his motivations are. likewise, jonathan's blank stares and lack of apparent substance and depth do not give us much more than a sketch of a quirky man. at times, the film feels a little downbeat and depressing as more horrific revelations are exposed. but these are minor criticisms of what is a good, introspective story with good performances and interesting themes of remembrance and closure. that schreiber not only directed but adapted the screenplay to this worthwhile slice of history is a tribute to his talents and promising potential in the future.

if anyone has any doubts about the talent of liev schrieber, just a look at his new film, "everything is illuminated", which clearly shows a man that is not only one of america's finest actors, but a new director whose first effort is indeed an inspiration and a harbinger of what is to follow. mr. schreiber has adapted the novel by jonathan safran foer into a film that will live forever because of the way the director has adapted the material. the film clearly surpassed our expectations since we had no preconceived ideas.for those who haven't watched the film, perhaps you should stop reading here.jonathan is a collector. his love for his grandparents is boundless. he watches as his grandfather dies and as his grandmother is on what appears to be her death bed. on a clear moment, this dying woman gives jonathan a picture and an amber ornament for his collection. watching the photograph, taken a long time ago, a young couple are seen together. watching makes jonathan think it shows the grandfather and his girlfriend, taken on happier times. watching the snapshot seems to be the motivation for this intense young man to go looking for his ancestors' past in the ukraine.jonathan has made arrangements with a travel agency, heritage tours, of odessa for his trip to trochenbrod, the mythical place where his grandfather came from. the agency is handled by an older man, who claims to be blind, and his grandson, alex, a man who loves the pop american culture that has captured his imagination, as well as his contemporaries in the country. alex speaks a kind of english no one speaks and his conversation and translation, for jonathan's benefit are hilarious to our ear for the use of sometimes unheard english terms. the old man insists in taking his dog, sammy davis jr., against the wishes of jonathan, who doesn't want to sit next to the snarling and barking animal during the trip.as they embark in search of trochenbrod, it's clearly that his companions, especially the old man has no clue where he is going. at this point, the film becomes a road movie, as the three characters riding the back roads of the country become more acquainted with one another. as the trio arrive at the sunflower field with the house at the end, it indicates they have indeed come to the right place. some places are a clear reminder of the conflicts of the past.the older woman, living in the isolated place, is the missing link of the story. she is able to put things into the right perspective. but here is where the story changes its emphasis from jonathan, who clearly has come to the land of his ancestors, to the old man. we watch as this older man starts remembering things about himself. this, in turn, changes the dynamic of the film as we discover how connected jonathan and his guides have been all the time.some criticism in these pages have expressed opinions about the accuracy of the story, which after all, it's a work of fiction and liberties have been taken. it would have been impossible to make another film including so much that is contained in the book. the great way the film is divided into different chapters is a clever way to let the viewer know what's about to be seen.elijah wood, a magnificent film actor, does an excellent work by underplaying jonathan. mr. wood makes one of his best appearances in any film with his interpretation of the main character. the felicitous casting of eugene hutz as alex, the ukranian tour assistant and translator, seems to be an idea made in heaven. mr. hutz is about the best thing in the film. his arcane usage of english gives the film a funny angle that delights the viewer. boris leskin as alex's grandfather and driver of the tour car makes a valuable contribution to the film, as well as laryssa lauret, who is seen in the last part of the movie.the excellent cinematography of matthew libatique brings the splendor of the czech republic's countryside in all its magnificence. the musical score by paul cantelon is heard in the background adorning the film in ways that it adds a richness to the movie.above all, this is a triumph for liev schreiber, the first time director that will surely go far in whatever he decides to do next.

this is precious. everything is illuminated is sweetly and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue. oh, how i've been waiting for this to arrive in austin. while elijah wood is charming as ever as jonathan safran foer (the real-life author of the novel everything is illuminated), it's eugene hutz (playing jonathan's ukrainian tour-guide and translator, alex) who truly steals this film. alex is a hip-hop-lovin' ukrainian break-dancer who, along with his grandfather, helps jonathan find the woman who saved jonathan's grandfather's life during world war ii. the ukrainian countryside has never looked so breath taking. i'm thinking of packing it all up and moving to the former soviet state.the tone of the film, however, shifts when jonathan and alex do finally meet the woman they're looking for, and suddenly, this adorable comedy turns into a heart-breaking historical drama about a jewish village that was annihilated during the nazi occupation. everything is illuminated is about history, heritage, and the wisdom that can be gained from uncovering the past. it's perfect.

i just saw "everything is illuminated" at the telluride film festival. this is a truly remarkable film. very emotional, funny at times and heart-warming. bring your handkerchiefs! for those of you who enjoy a movie that brings tears to your eyes, i'm reminded of the endings of "babette's feast" and "the notebook." the stories were completely different but had that same emotional power to bring tears to my eyes, just as this film did.no spoilers here. the summary is, as imdb describes, a young man's journey to the ukraine to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew up.the dialog is in english and ukrainian (and russian too, i believe). this allows for some wonderfully linguistically-based moments as one character interprets, more or less faithfully, for the english speaker in the group, depending on the circumstances.the scenery is wonderful and the musical score is a treat with wonderful eastern european influences. be sure you stay through the credits for the final tune.this is lieve schreiber's directorial debut and is well done. i give this film a 9, one of the best films i've seen in a long time. i recommend it highly.

in everything is illuminated, elijah wood plays jonathan foer, a jewish american who is looking for the woman who saved his grandfather during wwii. in a sense, the woman that saved his entire family.this is a heart-felt tale about someone who is on a seemingly hopeless journey. a stranger in a strange land so to speak. jonathan is not entirely prepared for this adventure, he sticks out like a sore thumb in the ukraine (he would probably stick out like a sore thumb anywhere). but what he discovers is more, much more than he anticipated. this movie will make you laugh and will make you cry. elijah wood is really good in this film, based on the novel by jonathan safran foer.from someone i talked to, this movie is somewhat different from the book. a book i gather is really good. nevertheless, this is a good movie, it has something for everyone and i really enjoyed it. can someone say oscar?

i walked into the movie theater, with no expectations for the film i was about to witness, "everything is illuminated". i walked out with a joy i have barely come to feel with american films. the directorial debut of actor, leiv schreiber, the film follows a man on his journey through the past, accompanied by an eccentric group including a brake-dancing barely english-speaking punk from the eukraine, his grandfather who believes he is blind, and their crazy dog. the first half of the film is funny and smart with an extremely european flavor in the usage of small but wonderful characters, while the second half of the film descends into a somber story of discovery and the holocaust. this little movie brings out so many emotions, and so many colors, with such a wonderful conclusion and is more than just a story of illumination, but also of relationships and connections. the acting is incredibly powerful, the story mysterious and interesting, and the artistic appeal of the cinematography, to die for. with some brilliant and absolutely touching scenes "everything is illuminated" managed to capture my heart.

i saw this movie at the 2005 toronto international film festival.based on the novel by jonathan safran foer, everything is illuminated is the directorial debut of actor liev schreiber. schreiber also wrote the screenplay. in the movie, jonathan (elijah wood) obsessively collects items from his family, from toothbrushes to retainers to scraps of paper which he then seals in ziploc bags and pins to a wall in his house to record his family history. but the space for his grandfather is conspicuously bare. all jonathan really has of him is a piece of jewelry and an old photo of him with a woman who hid him from the nazis during the second world war. jonathan decides to undertake a quest to ukraine to find the woman, thank her, and learn more about his grandfather.his quest is aided there by a couple of characters who run a tourist company for jewish people, including a young man obsessed with western culture (eugene hutz), his grandfather (boris leskin), who thinks he is blind and who may have memories and demons of his own from the war, and his grandfather's temperamental seeing eye dog.the screenplay effectively combines both humour and drama as the three characters travel through the countryside looking for jonathan's grandfather's town, driving deeper and deeper into the memories of the past. the best performance probably comes from eugene hutz, playing alex jr., who starts the movie as a tracksuit-wearing, break dancing slacker just out to have fun but evolves into something more as not only jonathan, but all the characters gain their own illumination.liev schreiber, elijah wood, and eugene hutz attended the screening and did a very humorous q&a after the film: - schreiber was very close to his grandfather, who was a ukranian immigrant, and who died in 1993. this caused him to start to write to get his memories down on paper. meanwhile, he was asked to do a reading of foer's short story, the very rigid search, which was an excerpt from the still unpublished novel. schreiber was blown away by the quality of the writing, saying that foer had done in 15 pages what schreiber tried to do in 107. schreiber approached foer and they talked about their grandfathers, culture, movies, and the nature of short-term memory in america; in the end, foer agreed to let schreiber adapt the book.- schreiber's own project was intended to be a road movie, but the book has parallel narrative that is an imagined chronological history of the town of trochenbrod that spans 500 years; given his budget and limitations as a filmmaker, he said he'd leave that to milos forman and take the road trip instead. this imagined chronology was what moved him to make the movie in the first place, the idea that "a past lovingly imagined was as valuable as a past accurately recalled".- schreiber said the movie was a series of happy accidents. after searching unsuccessfully in ukraine for an actor, he was walking through the lower east side in new york, when he saw a poster of a woman centaur, topless from the waist up, with an insane cossack sitting astride her. under the poster said the name gogol bordello ukranian punk gypsy band.eugene hutz then took over the story. he had never pursued acting as music was his first passion. one day, a friend gave him the book, and he thought it was written in a manner similar to how he writes music; screw sentences/syntax, language is my own.later, they got a call from a production company, looking for eastern european music that was medieval but modern. hutz met with schreiber, and he soon found the movie was based on the book he just happened to be reading. not long after that came up, schreiber asked hutz what he thought about alex and whether he could do the character by any chance.- foer and schreiber talked about the film in the fall of 2001, shortly after the events of september 11. both were in europe at the time and they talked about the derogatory comments they were hearing about americans, which led schreiber to want to try to find an articulate american who would defy the stereotype that europeans have of americans. someone who was awkward, vulnerable, flawed, innocent, and looking for history beyond the borders of his own country. schreiber started thinking about who that was, and elijah came up.one of schreiber's inspirations as a filmmaker is emir kusturica (i think that's who he said, who also directed a segment in another festival movie, all the invisible children) who said "you don't look for the actors, you look for the people." schreiber said there is something about who elijah is that he has a generosity of spirit and a sincere goodness as a human being, that came across on film. schreiber said that the eyes are important when trying to articulate a character who is an observer, and that if "eyes are the doors to the soul, elijah's are garage doors." - elijah wood had fun with a question about the similarities between his character kevin in sin city and jonathan in this movie as both are sort of a blank slate on which emotions are projected. wood replied that jonathan may seem still and seemingly emotionless, but it is all about his observations, about his experiences with other characters and the environment he was in.- on the differences between directing and writing: schreiber said he likes writing a lot more and jokingly described directing as "hell". after his grandfather died, schreiber started to think about how to preserve some sense of history and himself; is he content driven or not, or just good at interpreting other people's work? he said he loved the exercise of figuring out what is emotional to you, important to you.

"japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own", while that may be true, it applies to all except for one thing, that being,.....major league baseball....but not to worry, "mr baseball" is there to try and change all that. but just who will change whom, is the part of the movie that really makes it rock! tom selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shines-on in his comedic roles. the storyline may be true to life, however the subplot is dead-on. the japanese people are a gentle, respectful people with ways and traditions very different than those of western society. all of these elements and obstacles combine to make for one truly enjoyable, funny film. it's definitely worth the watch!

you have to like baseball, and you have to at least sort of like tom selleck, but if you meet those criteria you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. selleck plays former major league star who finds himself traded (?) to japan as his career winds down. really well thought out and fascinating look at japanese customs and behavior. great supporting performances by selleck's manager ("japan's clint eastwood"), his girl friend takanashi, and his interpreter. the chemistry between selleck and takanashi works very very well, this is really a very nice romantic movie apart from the baseball. look for haysbert as fellow player well before he became a persistent shill for allstate. movie wraps up very nicely. easily in my top fifty all time movies and maybe my favorite one on baseball.

this film got less attention than "league of their own," possibly because it has only one "name" star. but whereas women's professional baseball had only an eight year, midwestern town existence, japanese baseball is a vastly bigger entity, both in financial underwriting and popular support. that alone would make it the better movie."mr. baseball" shows the facts of life of japan-ball: the regimented cheering, the deference to umpires, the pressure of corporate owners on managers, the extreme conservatism of play - and no hot dog players welcome.it also touches upon the isolation that any gai-jin - but especially an american jock, not the people most versed in foreign cultures - feels living in dai nippon. and the japanese, for their part, are not comfortable around foreigners and let it show in various ways ("the gai-jin strike zone," one american player complains, "bigger than a buick.")the script may not have won any awards, playing once again on the "redemption by improved play" theme, but i found it considerably more enjoyable to watch than the pokey "league." definitely recommended for those who want to see another angle on this great sport.

mr baseball was a fun video rental with my fiancé susan nauss. susan said that she had been looking forward to seeing the movie. ken takakura oda as a tough yet honorable manager makes sense. ken takakura has made so many wonderful asian movies, i correct the one reviewer and say takakura is still a cinematic presence with films like hotari. of course everyone likes tom selleck yet ken takakura is the better dramatic actor of the two. today someone accused me of being yakuza, well i say that my great uncle shadow president jack f kennedy myself and others are part of the legitimate human leadership in our universe and thanks to our cocreators humans are free people fighting all the parts of adversity that president kennedy talked about in his inaugural address. to be honest someone has kept food prices very low in canada on things like bread. in honor of our cocreators please stop eating amphibians reptiles and eggs. i hope that there will one day be a sequel to mr baseball with father ken takakura oda still as manager. thank you to imdb for supporting freedom of speech like the kind president george w bush and i support. support imdb.

i am very impressed by the reviews i've read of this film - generally well-read, thoughtful and informed - obviously by people who like and think hard about films. i couldn't add a thing to the excellent reviewing job that imdb members have already done. if i may, i'd like to correct a small but widespread misunderstanding that appears in many of the reviews: mr baseball was american and behaved in an ugly fashion but he was not an ugly american. the original ugly american was homer atkins, one of the heroes of the eponymous 1958 novel by burdick and lederer, and the exact opposite of mr baseball. homer was an archetypal american, and an archetypal engineer - he went to vietnam to work with people, he respected and liked the people he met, he used appropriate, sustainable technology in cooperation with his hosts, and he was liked and respected by them precisely because he exemplified democratic values and american virtues. his ugliness was purely facial, merely skin-deep; his personality and his humanity were deep and genuine.mr baseball exemplifies all the crass, ignorant, insecure boorishness that we europeans and americans so often inflict on other cultures; homer atkins, the ugly american, was the other side of our coin, representing our humanity and decency. i believe that the ugly americans still far outnumber the mr baseballs; they are still our last, best hope.

an egotistic major league baseball player is forced to continue his career in japan, he contends with a culture that is alien to him, an apparently humorless manager, an attractive japanese woman and his own professional and social insecurities. there is a certain subtle charm that flows through tom selleck's performances. there is humor, sometimes softly understated, as in this film, sometimes slapstick as in "folks!", but always there seems to be some higher purpose involved. throw in an individual full of self doubts who struggles to solve his personal difficulties while holding fast to "doing the right thing," and you end up with a film both funny as well as thought-provoking. the cast fits together like a championship team, and even if neither cast nor film win awards for their efforts, they will leave the viewers feeling good (and maybe that's the best results after all). you'll want to watch this film more than once, and each time, mr. baseball hits a home run.

i really enjoyed this movie... in my dvd collection of baseball movies... reminded me how great the sport truly is... whether it's here in america or japan.

i am an australian currently living in japan. i saw this movie on tv here and was very impressed by the accuracy and honesty in the portrayal of western and japanese ideologies colliding. whoever wrote the screenplay, and directed this film must have a good knowledge of what it's like to be a foreigner living in japan. the only part i thought was too hollywood-y was when tom selleck's character kisses the woman in the middle of her office and she lets him. public displays of affection are not really acceptable here. finally a movie that highlights the true 'gaijin' experience! 9/10

not too many people seem to know about this movie. which is too bad because i think it's pretty good. sure it is a bit cheesy at times and may have a predictable storyline. but the presentation of the movie is pretty well done. i think the casting is good with likeable actors/characters. tom selleck does a good job at playing a baseball player (go figure... not too much of a stretch i suppose) and ken takakura (from black rain) plays the chief (the coach of the japanese baseball team). there isn't too much to complain about. it's just a light, easy-going, happy comedy and i recommend it.

*minor spoilers* i just wanted to say that for anyone who likes entertaining baseball films, this is definitely in my top three. only little big league and major league can compete with this one in my mind. i would also like to commend the writers of this film for creating such enjoyable dialogue!! without being too specific, i would say that the lines are very fitting for each character. tom selleck seemed to have no problem creating a realistic character as a ballplayer. his animosity towards playing overseas in japan sets the tone for comical, yet meaningful interactions with his new team, the dragons. he must adjust to life in japan ("first you wash, then you bathe!") he eventually sees eye to eye with his coach and sets his goals to have that one final season of greatness, though in a much different environment than he ever imagined! so for any baseball fan, or anybody that wants to watch a good baseball movie, mr. baseball will not let you down!

this is an excellent, little known movie. tom selleck does an outstanding job of acting in this movie, with the japanese 'clint eastwood'. i'd love to see if this movie has come out on dvd yet, there are some spots that clearly have been cut. hiroku (tom's love interest) has clearly had some parts chopped. it would be interesting to see more of japan in the film. the baseball sequences are far and away the most realistic of any baseball movie, i'm quite sure most of the actors were current or former baseball players. i love loading the tape of this movie at least once a year. best scenes involve the lack of hat tipping after tom gets beaned in the big game, and an intensely sensual scene of tom having a hot bath with hiroku. dennis haysbert also does a great job, it's good to see he's finally getting some recognition, not just in baseball movies(he was also in major league).

this has always been a favorite movie of mine. i've owned a vhs copy, and a couple of months ago i found a dvd release which is also part of my video collection. i also happen to be a huge baseball fan, and as part of my off-season reading, i picked up a copy of robert whiting's excellent book "you gotta have wa", that profiles the ins and outs of japanese baseball, and the challenges that foreign players have encountered playing in japan. as i began to read yesterday, it made me think of this movie, because it appears the screenplay was based almost verbatim on this book. the parallels are uncanny. the jack elliot character closely resembles bob horner, an aging mlb slugger whose best days were behind him. horner's teammate leon lee is also depicted in the character max "hammer" dubois, a veteran in the japanese league who has made his peace with the frustrations of the japanese game, and helps keeps his teammate sane. the elliot character goes through the same sequence of encounters as horner, from big fanfare signing, early success that fuels an already ravenous sports media, and the ensuing slump that spurs frustration, alienation from teammates, fans and media, and the resulting disillusionment that prompts a desire to go back home to the us. the only difference is that the movie adds such hollywood touches as a love interest and a happy ending. speaking of love interests, i'm sure many viewers have come to this site (as i did) to look up the actress who played "hiroko" (the beautiful aya takanashi), and what other work she has done. it only lists this movie. it turns out, based on an article i read, that the brief love scene she has with tom selleck (a foreigner) in this movie (mild by our standards - basically they kiss while he's in the bath and she's wearing a towel) caused such an outrage on the part of the japanese public (males in particular) that she has never been offered another role of any kind, in movies or television - essentially blackballed by the japanese movie industry. it's a real shame, as she is(was) quite a talented actress in this movie. if you like this movie as much for the baseball elements and cultural differences as i did -- go find a copy of "you gotta have wa" by robert whiting. a good read and a great companion book to this movie.

many believe this movie is a baseball movie. such people are disappointed because it's about a baseball player, but the movie isn't about baseball.some think this movie is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because the relationship isn't really developed. this movie is not a romantic comedy.this movie is about culture. an arrogant american major leaguer and a stern traditional japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they can't, indeed, won't understand one another. it's after they manage to break through the cultural barrier that they have success. the ballplayer becomes more japanese in his team mentality and the manager more american in allowing individual achievement, and they meet in the middle.baseball and the romance is subordinate to this critique of the two cultures. many who have no understanding of the japanese mindset miss this and think it's a movie on baseball or romance and see the culture clash as mild comedy relief. it's not---the culture clash is the gravamen of the movie. based on my own experience and understanding of the japanese culture, i think this movie did quite well in that it didn't overly romanticize the japanese culture nor overdo it in its portrayal.overall, i believe this is an enjoyable and relaxing movie if one understands what it is really about.

redo the oscars from 1992, and this film might get nominated, or even win. it was so good at capturing its era and dual cultures that it belongs in american and japanese time capsules. if you wanted to know what living here or there was like back then, this film will show you. as an american, you'll feel like you tagged along for an extended japanese vacation, and by the end of the film, you'll be a die-hard dragons fan, as you accept the injection of japanese tradition and culture into their baseball, much as we have done with our culture in our own game.jack elliot (tom selleck) is a slumping, aging detroit tigers' slugger who is traded to the dragons, perennial runners-up to the dynastic yomuri giants, japan's answer to the yankees. the giants are admired for their success, yet that success also has everyone wanting to surpass them, something which is rarely done. the dragons' manager recruits jack as the final piece of the pennant-winning puzzle, and we're left with what could have been gung ho on a baseball field, but instead was much more.the casting was outstanding: selleck proved that with a good script and a character that suits him, he can carry a film as well as he did his television show, and the japanese cast was equally good, down to mr. takagi from die hard back as the image-conscious owner. the other actors, including the one who plays the love interest (also the manager's daughter), strong and independent yet simultaneously a believer in japanese traditions, beyond what was forced on her. she is a proper and supportive girlfriend for jack. even her father never tells her not to see him, almost sympathizing with jack for what he endures from her, and a bit relieved he at least knows the man she has chosen to love.the baseball scenes are great, bolstered immensely by a pre-fame dennis haysbert as another american ex-patriate and jack's western mentor. the usual fish-out-of-water elements are there, and you can almost feel yourself stumbling right along with jack to fit into a country that doesn't speak our language, and doesn't practice our ways, yet copies everything we do, including our national pastime. one of the funnier scenes occurs when jack, clutching a magazine, informs his manager that he has learned of the tradition in japan where you can get drunk and tell off your boss, and it can't be used against you, and exercises that right very humorously. the plots and subplots are tied up neatly at the end, but not too neatly, and nothing concludes unrealistically.to call this a comedy is misguided: it's a pure comedy-drama, or even a drama with good humor. the plot is too deep to dismiss it the way it was by critics as an actor out of his league trying to carry a lightweight film. the situations were amusing, but in their place against a far more serious, profound, and precisely detailed backdrop that results in one of the best films i've ever seen. the baseball cinematography rivals that of for love of the game, for realism.some say the film is about baseball, or about japan, but more than anything it seems to be about the workplace, and how people arrive at work from totally different origins, with different agendas, and somehow have to put their differences aside for the good of the company, or the team.a truly great film that never should have had to apologize for itself the way it did when it was in theaters.

the "hunting trilogy" of rabbit fire (1951), rabbit seasoning (1952), and duck! rabbit! duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the chuck jones-michael maltese collaboration. while they are seldom mentioned in lists of the "greatest" or "most important" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly the funniest cartoons i've ever seen. michael maltese never got the credit that directors like jones, freleng or avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make warner bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the funniest ever made.

once again elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. bugs of daffy. he's unsure of what season it is and bunny and duck arguing help matters not. though bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on daffy in increasingly subtle ways. and when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. though elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. elmer really is to blame for all this. if he weren't so dumb he'd know it really is duck season and just blast daffy. but poor old daff can't believe the utter preposterousness of the situation. his cruel plans of misdirection have been foiled by elmer's dumbness. daffy is so shocked that he even goes home with elmer to be blasted in his living room.poor daff. he rules!

great party movie, following the adventures of bill & tom, two high school buddies at opposite ends of the spectrum. bill (eric stolz) prefers to live life straight-laced, while his friend tom (chris penn) takes nothing seriously except partying all the time. when bill moves out of his mother's house to live on his own he faces many issues, from his girlfriend, to his brother, to his landlord. meanwhile, his friend tom moves in to keep the rent down but proceeds to turn bill's life upside down. this movie is non-stop comedy from start to finish and is a personal favorite of mine. soundtrack features guitar virtioso edward van halen throughout the movie, also features cameos by rockers lee ving and ron wood. 70s pornstar legend kitten navidad also makes an appearance! classic 80s movie is worth multiple looks. now all that needs to be done is a much anticipated dvd release! if you enjoyed this movie, take a look at "the last american virgin" which is similar to "wild life". i rate both highly.

while i hold its predecessor, "fast times at ridgemont high," as a standard to which other teen comedies should be compared, "the wild life" is one of the better lesser known films from that time-and a worthy sequel, if you can call it that. i believe its tagline reads, "from the makers of ftarh, something even faster." this definitely holds true. though it may lack the depth of the former which tackles issues like first dates, teen sex, and abortions, "the wild life" is, nonetheless, a great flick. it's pure chaotic fun, especially due to chris penn's over-the-top character, thomas drake. if spicolli was high on coke instead of weed, he would be drake. eric stoltz, in his first major role, is great as the straight-laced bill conrad. the two characters work well off one another. think a younger, hipper odd couple, complete with 80's gloss. outside of them there are so many other great things about this film worth mentioning. lea thompsom has never looked cuter, especially during the scenes of her working at the donut shop. jenny wright is just delectable and fun to watch. rick moranis plays a great nerd/perv who is dying to get in her pants. thomas drake's wrestler buddies are hysterical, especially benny, the little puerto rican guy, who says some pretty memorable lines. one in particular that he yells out during a night out at a strip club had me on the floor the first time i saw it. that's saying something! finally, the movie ends with one of the best 80's party scenes on film, ever. look out for special appearances by ron wood of the rolling stones, leo penn (sean and chris penn's dad), and a random michael jackson look-alike at the party. throw in a score by none other than the man himself, eddie van halen, and you can't go wrong. for van hagar fans, keep your ears open for riffs that would be found on such albums as 5150, ou812, and for unlawful carnal knowledge.if anything disrupts the flow of the movie it is a small subplot involving randy quaid as a burned out vietnam vet. it just seems out of place and unnecessary. other than that, it's near perfect. if your a fan of mindless but fun 80's movies and have not yet seen this one, you're in for something special. rent it now!!! p.s.-the credits say cameron crowe has a cameo as one of the cops in the film. does he have his back turned during his scene because i have yet to find him. someone please help me.

there are a lot of people that put down on these type 80's movies but those people may not have been coming of age during this time. i was just starting college when this movie was released so i could really appreciate it at the time and my friends and i still, to this day, will occasionally joke about certain lines in the movie. as much as i liked sean penn's character jeff spicoli in "fast times", i actually enjoy chris penn's character "tommy" more because he is the lead character with more of a actual speaking roll opposed to just a series of one liners such as with spicoli. chris penn should probably pop this film in his vcr and use it for motivation to lose some weight. yes, the subplot with the randy quaid, vietnam vet character does seem a little out of place, but he does a convincing job in the role. if there is anyone out there that hasn't seen this movie but liked the other similar type movies such as "fast times", etc. i highly recommend it.

straight up, i love this film. i love everything about it. it has a great soundtrack, it has a lot of recognizable faces and it is funny as hell. there are so many plots in this film and every one of them is funny in one way or another.where as spicolli lit up the screen two years back, drake is almost as memorable of a character. all he wants to do is have fun. he moves out of the house without his parent's consent, he skips work whenever he feels like it, he is obsessed with sex, he loves his drugs and booze and he tries to be a good friend. it is his lacksidaisical attitude that makes him such a joy to watch. and he comes out with some great lines. and there are so many tiny observations that you don't see coming but they make you laugh at the sheer velocity when it hits you. one particular moment is when tommy and bill are talking about bill's ex girlfriend dating someone else now. at the end of the conversation, tommy takes his huge beer bottle and just throws it over his shoulder, casually. he then says good night and the scene ends. it is a perfect scene. tommy's world is his own. he really lives to party and have fun. when the conversation is over, his time is over and he doesn't care who he offends in the process. he has an innocence about him. "it's casual" is his favourite saying.another such classic scene is reggie handing bill a donut. he says something to him that me and my friends will never forget because we rewound the film ten times and watched that part over and over again and hurt ourselves laughing. it has to be seen to be appreciated.wild life is a throw back to when teen comedies were funny, raunchy, had a good ear, entertained us and just wanted us to get lost in their world for 90 minutes. wild life does all those things perfectly. if this is a film that you haven't seen, give it a chance. it is a classic.also check out the army store guy that jim has problems with. he is a very familiar face now and it is his first role on the big screen.

no one can argue with it. this is and will be the best movie ever, as it is the perfect definition of what any movie should be : a collective hypnosis beyond times. no movie can give you more perfectly this impression that you carried it inside you, even before you saw it for the first time.there are images that stay forever...

this was such a great film. it was done with such beautiful design, such symmetry. i love the way the classical music tied in with the classical art of earth, space and beyond. it was such a fluent, and thought provoking masterpiece. i loved the way the monoliths never changed, although primate, earth and space did. i loved how it was a question of "do you need me/us now"? the movie expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, finesse, gentleness, courage and innocence. what more could you ask for from a mere movie? perhaps a complement movie. any appreciator of 2001: a space odyssey will find the movie 2010 is 2001's complement movie. 2010 is more story orientated than 2001.

...and normally i don't like surprises!! watch this movie by chance in a motel in south africa second week of a three month motorbiking holiday in za. apart from being well shot and acted it helped me in understanding the countries problems tremendously. just watched the " million dollar baby" and had to look up hillary swank since the name sounded somewhat familiar and her acting was superb. didn't realise she was the solicitor in the "red dust". well now i'm not to worried that she will disappear as so many other sidekicks of clint before... now i am being asked to write ten whole lines of comment which is rather ridiculous for i have written what i wanted to write. ok, here it goes: i think if you are from a western country, especially europe, watching will help you to understand a little better why what is happening is happening down there! so this hopefully will fill ten lines.

where this movies differs from traditional hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. in europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or with each other at the end of the conflict. in the us, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the us citizen never had to live with its enemy. this explains in my view the often simplistic nature of hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife. but in this movie, the director and screenplay did not fall into this cliché. it turns out everyone in the story has some right and some wrong. it's a great story of morality, hidden truth and compromise.

what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony live and let liveif anyone knows the quote please let me know thank youthis film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.

possible spoilersno one is likely to pick up a dvd of red dust without knowing that it is about south africa's truth and reconciliation commission. hilary swank stars as a south african exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing alex mpondo (chiwetel ejiofer), a member of the south african parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, pete muller (ian roberts), who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the truth and reconciliation commission. they could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a south african accent; ms. swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably american accent. nevertheless she is the only well-known actor in the movie, and it would probably not have been made without her or someone equally well known. she does a passable job. however, ejiofer and muller (pronounced in the german way with an umlat over the "u") are outstanding as is jamie barlett as the chief of police, responsible for murdering mpondo's comrade and fellow prisoner. the torture scenes are shown in brief flashes but they are vivid and believable. what is not believable is the truth and reconciliation process -- except that it actually happened. "red dust" should be seen for that reason alone because it was and is unbelievable that the anc prisoners could actually forgive the torturers, and this is as close as we are likely to get to seeing the process in action.

i haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that i couldn't take my eyes off the screen. i was busting for the loo; and i didn't even want to pause it because i was drawn right in. emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. it gives you an amazing insight to south africa; their struggles and their lives. the acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; i was captivated. i don't want to even try and explain the story; it's way too complex and i wouldn't do it justice. please see this; you'll understand why when you do. cheers, hol

i was unsure of this movie before renting and did so on the assurance that hilary swank has always given excellent performances in her movies. she seems to rely on restraint to gain the emotional impact that she does. and she didn't prove me wrong in this movie.however the movie also had fantastic performances from all other members of the cast both speaking and non-speaking. i have to single out jamie bartlett and chiwetel ejiofor - the two main protagonists - for their outstanding acting abilities and portrayal of true human feelings and failings. the whole movie ran almost like a documentary.i must applaud tom hooper as the director and avril beukes as the editor for keeping a multiple layered story being revealed smoothly whilst keeping dialogue and action moving along in an understandable fashion. the opening sequence of the south african landscape was striking and i had to push the pause button to savour the photography.why can't a movie like this ever get nominated for an international award. it seems to me to hit the high-rating button on all counts. it was not just a film it was a true experience of life in a country coming out of apartheid. a life of poverty was all around but it celebrated the dignity of the human spirit.

not knowing a great deal about the truth and reconciliation commission, i can only look at this as a piece of entertainment. i started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from bbc2 earlier this year) but once i'd started i had to watch to the end.the down-side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama - never my favourite genre - but it's stunningly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well acted. like a good novel, i couldn't put it down. all the way through, i wished i was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice. what happened to its release in theatres? i'm an admirer of chiwetel ejiofor since i saw him in dirty pretty things, and hilary swank looks terrific in this - very female and sexy for a change (possibly out of place, but she adds to the visual attractiveness of the film).this picture deserves a wider audience than it seems to be getting.

i saw this film at the 2005 palm springs international film festival. i went in with the assumption that if it stars chiwetel ejiofor and hilary swank it had to be at least decent. well, after a kind of a slow start, i was far from disappointed. in fact, i was quite pleased with the final product.i must admit the afrikaaner and xhosa(?) accented english of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing "waking ned devine", "trainspotting" or any other film with heavy-accented actors i adjusted after about 15 minutes. and i was trying to figure out why hilary swank was supposed to be south african and sounded like she was trying to put on an accent but sounded very american... as if she was making a weak attempt at putting on the accent. but later in the film as more is revealed about her character and how she moved to the us as a teen you begin to understand how she might have lost some or most of her accent. so it began to make sense that only certain words might have a afrikaaner lilt to them.i know it's a little weak for one to use film as education but one of the great things about this film is that it was interesting to see a dramatization of a truth and reconciliation trial. i'd heard about the t and r process in south africa after the fall of apartheid but i didn't really know how it worked.the final verdict is that although some of the scenes felt a little contrived, this was overall a very strong film. the closing sequence where the "truth" comes out was the strong finish every film hopes for. a definite must see for anyone who cares about what happens outside their borders.

the truth and reconciliation process in south africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa. i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process. almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. we all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. what's happening in south africa should guide us all. i found it credible, moving and at times upsetting. there were no outstanding acting performances but this added to the strength of the narrative. once again the bbc has been instrumental in taking a complex topic and turning out a top class movie.

archbishop desmond tutu, who is seldom a favorite of mine, said that everyone should see this film as it is something that can help heal the world....it is one of the most poignant movies i have seen and delivers on tutu's comments.... i have read many comments and while they range from good to average to comments on the choice of actors... the fact is that it deals with one of the most extra-ordinary events in our world. the truth and reconciliation commission.... for the first time a country has opted to air it's horrific history, to find a way forward and to create a way for people to heal...while the movie starts out with the white policeman being offered a chance to absolve himself for brutal crimes and the black guy is trying to ensure that he does not get away with it, it delves into the humanity of the people and the enormous need for healing that we all need....definitely a thumbs up..... to everyone involved.... once again, i am proud to be a south african.....an interesting comment can be found here: http://www.biz-community.com/article/196/97/5223.html

an interesting comedy, taking place on a train from stockholm to berlin, december 1945. one can't help to feel sorry for the poor writer/critic who quits his job and jumps on the train to berlin. his ambition is to make a difference, and to participate in building the new unified europe after the war has ended.i like the black and white format of the movie, as well as the closed scenery of a train in motion.robert gustafsson makes a classic "gustafsson-role" in this movie. if you're a fan of him, this movie is for you!the philosopher wittgenstein, through his saying "one can never assume that anything is what it seems to be", is referenced several times in the movie.

...and this movie easily exceeded my expectations. the fact that it is written and directed by peter dalle led me to believe it was in style with other films i'm used to (and bored with) seeing him in. anyway, i grudgingly went along to see this flick and that i'm glad for. this stuff has humour and depth. 9 out of 10. see it!

this solid black and white slapstick comedy with a dark (but hopelessly contrived) plot is a true crowd pleaser that will have you howling with laughter (as well as rolling your eyes with disbelief).it's the old psychopath on a train story but that is of no big importance as the thriller portion of the film almost seems to be merely a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian robert gustafsson. his hapless, nearly incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and schadenfreude in a fashion that almost rivals chevy chase.the thing about the film that appealed to me the most, however, is that wedged between the improbable and the hilarious are the accurately portrayed everyday joys and nuisances of train travel. they add a most welcome sense of realism and recognition.this thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of its "suspense" from hitchcock and should, in my opinion, only be watched for its comedy value (which is high indeed). besides gustafsson, lars amble's solid performance as a delightfully cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission alone.heartily recommend.

this is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie. it follows all the rules. short scenes, to the point, cheap to shoot, guerilla-film-making, no sets (just disused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. also, even the black&white film-stock was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect, but it worked.reno was amazing as the brute. everyone's acting was brilliant. the plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you. a tight, well-crafted, cost-effective budget movie.released in 1983, this would've been made just before the art of big-budget action spectaculars became refined by the hollywood movie-making engine, and movie-making was more exclusive and therefore more difficult and more in need of the right people in the right places than today's internet-enabled world, so luc besson would've had to do quite a bit of negotiating and promise-keeping to achieve this result, which makes the end-product all the more remarkable.but, then again, the french movie-industry has always maintained an excellent reputation (yes, i know luc besson is belgian, but the movie is a french production) and has been the source of many hollywood remakes.if i have one criticism, it's that the cover-picture on the dvd (and possibly the original sales poster) bears no resemblance to the movie whatsoever and appears to be a rather bizarre image rather than representative of any of the movie's themes - at first glance, it appears to be a man in post-apocalyptic armour on a swing, but on second inspection reveals a man in armour with a lance on an office chair with his legs on a desk in a reclined, self-confident posture. this never happens in the movie once.it's black-and-white film-stock, zero dialogue, physical acting, tight scenes and brilliant actors makes this movie one worth adding to your private movie collection. a superb movie.

although compared with "mad max", this film is in a league of its own. set in post apocalyptic paris, this film is about man's struggle for survival, he has lost his ability to speak, and there is a remarkable shortage of women. congratulations luc besson!

belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment. the most noticed element of the film is its silence; no one speaks. i don't think besson, despite what is evident in most of his later work, meant it as any kind of cool gimmick. i think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion, no matter how slight. though i wasn't glued to the screen, upon reflection i see that it's a very touching and sensitive perspective on human nature. its vehicle is the stylized sci-fi movie. part of its reflection on the nature of the human world is that each of its humans is not necessarily played as a perfect human being: the hero, a lone drifter in the desolate new world, is taken in by an older recluse, who refuses to keep his part of an exchange of food between him and a husky, brutish character played by jean reno, and so reno tries everything he can, predominantly using brute force, to get what he wants. so, the antagonist is right, though not a good person, and the protagonist and his sympathetic foil are both wrong, though they are both good people.it's shot in a clear and crisp black and white, edited and captured in a low-key yet spry and small-scale approach, and its actors are very real. how can they not be? they, like their characters are left with the bare necessities of communication. this is one of the few truly good films that luc besson has written. his earlier work is almost always better than the fluff he churns out now.

if you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it. but if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while, until you get the details, then you will love it. now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way. basically the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his (or their) way for survival. in this fight they lost the ability to speak... i don't want to write more to not spoil the movie for you, but trust me if you like sf-authors like lem or capec or even some from orson scott card you will love this movie.

i am a long time fan of luc besson's work, and for about as long as i've known his name, i've also looked for this movie. i tried looking for this movie all over california for over four years. this past summer i took a trip to europe, one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie. long story short, i bought it and watched it in france! i was blown away, it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen luc besson's first work. absolutely amazing character development, very thought provoking, great acting and the ultimate concept movie. if you are a concept movie fan this is one of the most original and classic. i feel as though it is a rare treat to see a movie like this one, its risky, its unorthodox, and ultimately its just downright unique. if you are a luc besson fan, its indeed a must see, however, whether your a besson fan or not, its definitely an important work, overall a great contribution to the immortal art of cinema.

a poetic examination of the human condition performed without dialogue. the anti-hero, the man builds a contraption to escape a band of marauders, out of the wastland of what was once a civilization, to the ruins of the city to scavenge for his survival. there he crosses pathes with the brute, brilliantly played by jean reno, of "the professional" and "mission: impossible" fame. the man is rescued by a crazy old genius who lives in a fortress of his own design. by using their wits, the man and the old genius are able to keep the brute and his ilk at bay, but they realise it is only a matter of time before their defenses are compromised, so they make a break for it. this is a strongly understated tale of the desparate struggle for life, with excellent action scenes and clever humor. of all of the movies of its kind, like "road warrior", "omega man", and even "ultimate warrior" (featuring yul brenner as a buff knife-fighter), "le dernier combat" is the most artfully crafted. copies of the video are hard-to-find, i would give my left eye ball for one. if your local art house ever has a revival of this film, i heartily recommend that you break any engagement to able to be able to see it big.

i don't believe it... luc besson is not only a genius now...he has always been one... this film is for everyone who likes real good deep films...just perfect!

luc besson's first work is also his first foray in science fiction, a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with "the fifth element" (1997). even if this film was strongly influenced by hollywood cinema, it is still highly enjoyable. back in 1983, "le dernier combat" reveals besson's own approach of science fiction. he takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work. shot in widescreen and black and white, a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men can't talk any more. some barbarian hordes were formed. in parallel, a man (pierre jolivet) lives on his own and arrives in an unrecognizable paris where he is received by a doctor (jean bouise).there are no words in besson's work. the characters' actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures. although the starting point and the backdrop are unnerving, the film has never the look of a despondent one. it seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster. the film opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll. later, the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. it's all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times. following this reasoning, one could argue that the bearded giant (jean reno) embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being. ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film.the pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isn't really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope. personally, the film could have gained with no music at all, except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder. luc besson was to make better and still entrancing films like this one, he also boosted pierre jolivet's career as a director who will leave a patchy work behind him in the future: "force majeure" (1989), "simple mortel" (1991), "ma petite entreprise" (1999) or "filles uniques" (2003).

well, i guess i was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. this movie wasn't it. it plodded along at a pretty slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but there wasn't really anything in it that i was terribly interested in--there's an intriguing and mysterious feud between jean reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, whom i didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time. he wanders around alone for the most part, he doesn't meet anyone; i imagine the director was trying to depict the loneliness of the human condition in this post-apocalyptic world or something, which is all good, but i still wish he'd trimmed it down from 40 minutes to 15, because it can get incredibly boring.but after those 40 minutes, things start to get very interesting. i guess i won't really say more than that because i don't want to spoil anything. so if you've seen the first 15-30 minutes of this movie and are thinking about turning it off (like i was), just stick with it--it gets a lot better.one of the most interesting things i found about this movie was the fact that it had no dialogue whatsoever, which really made me have to think about what was happening, how characters were feeling and what their motivations were, why things were how they were in this post-apocalyptic world, all of which gives the story a lot of room for audience interpretation. and it's amazing how much more satisfying a movie is when the actors aren't telling you exactly what's going on.

it's hard to use words for this movie, since it contains none itself.but the images it conveys, both powerful and sweeping, are ones which remind us why we watch movies. and you might be saying "well, leonard maltin doesn't like it, it can't be that good.." but you're wrong. see this movie. french cinematic brilliance en ensemble.

i still can't describe what to feel when i received this by the fnac site. such a rare movie, so little spoken and known, is difficult to find, even to fans, but the contrast betwen past and present is devastating: now i hold a dvd of the movie, with the finest quality possible. as i did in atlantis, the other rare besson movie i bought by the internet, i saw this one at home, with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off, and marveled at the experience. i didn't know what to expect. wickedly, i always searched some kind of disappointment when i saw a film by luc besson i never had seen before. but it never came. this movie was no exception. from the start, i understood that the person who makes a film like this as a first feature is destined to be big in the future. and so it happened. this won several prizes (including the highest prize in a film festival of my country, which makes me proud) and it shows that this movie is preparating many bigger things. this may be the most original after-the-war movie i have ever seen, beating mad max in originality and artistic feel. there is not a problem with this movie: its cinematography is genius, as well the perfomances of the actors. i am also proud to say that finally i saw all the movies of my favorite director, and have a copy of almost all of them (joan of arc is still waiting for me to buy the dvd). this movie is most of all a work of style and dedication, which makes clear why luc besson is a director of my choice: good taste, beautiful framing, excellent use of music (i also marveled at eric serra's first feature-length score) and the promise of great achievements. gaumont did well to bet in its boy-genius, the man who would later change the face of france's and europe's relation between movies and their public. let's hope besson starts working in a new directorial project. i will be the first to cheer it. until then, i recommend this movie to anyone who need to learn a lesson of how good movies are made with little money. i loved the atmosphere of the movie, which, by its black and white cinematography, suggests us an even more depressed view of the world after the holocaust. this movie works by the sheer magic of movies: showing in pictures what we can't explain by words. and i'm with all the people who wrote comments to this movie and liked it: good choice! a great hug to everyone who sees this and feels that a little of their lives were changed.

i thought besson's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them; capture true human emotions. the main character's struggles, triumphs, set backs, hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all. the film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamour afforded to most hollywood productions but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical sci-fi labeling and become a true drama. however calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot. true this type of movie has been done been before but i think this one captures the joys and sorrows of that type of world possibly better than any other one does.

great movie. post-apocalyptic films kick ass. this one is no exception. kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue (mainly through some good character development). the fight between reno and the hero was tight. i also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval-like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and guzzaline. the connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey, that is, i had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence. in sum, kick ass character progression, design, story without the cushion of dialogue, and most importantly, the always appreciated desolate scenery of a post-apocalyptic wasteland.

i saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline. i go to the movies as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a "story". i found this to be a good movie, not great, but good. it was worth my money and my tears :)diane lane was wonderful as always, richard gere isn't an over-actor. he held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect. he brings his own style to the movie.i think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told. it was messy and they had other priorities, but they wanted to be together and wanted to wait for each other.i'd definitely recommend it!

wtf!! do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending?? the notebook was good...but sheesh, enough with the depressing endings already. i'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. understandable...but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days. don't we already know what really happens in real life? can't we - for one moment (an hour and a half) live vicariously through a movie that ends on a happy note - that gives us hope for our own futures??? yeah - wah. i know. but for real, i think we need to preface movies that end like this one with a warning. "beware: no happy ending."

i am a guy, so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that richard gear likes to be in tear jerker movies. i would rather watch action/adventure/sci fi. i was right, the movie is definitely a tear jerker. diane tended to over act a few times, as did richard, but they brought it around and made it work. the daughter was a suppressed teen with huge attitude, so you started out hating her. the movie is way too predictable, but for entertainment purposes, it was a masterpiece. go rent it, see if you don't shed a tear.lol if you like the notebook, you will love this one. the beach scenes were immaculately shot. even though the hurricane scenes were a little off sequence, it was still a bit panicy to watch them react to it.

hey look, you don't watch this movie to change your life! but if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for richard gere; this movie is right up your street. diane lane and richard gere have on screen chemistry going way back. 'nights in rodanthe' is not a oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully shot love story between middle aged good looking people (they don't make your stomach turn and even when gere is 'on top' he does not look too jowly) then this is the movie for you. i loved the theme of the story and it was quite relevant in many ways. of course the whole thing was presented in a superficial way, glossed over and not really dealt with.....i mean i would have liked to know more about the father/son relationship between gere and james franco, but the story was really about the idea that a great love can change you for the better; whether it is a lover, a child, a friend etc. the theme of the film is about love and its mysterious ways. i was kind of surprised that james franco took such a small part in this film but he is always good even for a few minutes screen time. i really liked this film because it was moving and sweet.

being a middle aged mom myself, i very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us. diane lane beautifully portrays adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through, wanting to do what is right for her children, but still have a happy life herself. i am not a big richard gere fan, but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk, but learns something about himself.criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies. when nicole kidman and hugh jackman fall in love riding across australia, with barely a conversation between them, its considered high romance. we get so much more here with rodanthe. she redeems him. he sets her free. its beautiful. the intimacy they create by sharing their deepest insecurity, fans into a flame of passion. how long it takes is irrelevant. perhaps the movie was a bit too subtle in the point that it was the letters they shared over the following year that deepened their relationship- again another real-life time-honored way to get to know a person.as much as i enjoyed the plot and themes, the dialogue was not consistent in quality. some lines rang so true, and other lines were embarrassingly trite and flat. i also enjoyed the relationships with adrienne's teenage daughter and her best friend, reminding us that there are many types of love, not just romantic love.this is not a lighthearted romantic comedy, more a romantic drama. it does have a very relaxed pace that some might consider too slow. the beach house is a work of art- fabulous. look for the driftwood bench on the porch in the first pan-over the house- very beautiful. i also enjoyed the music and scenery, which combined to create the effect of the location as being the third main character. it was this place away from their regular lives that allowed them to see themselves and each other in a different light.if you are old enough to appreciate these themes and are in the mood for a good cry- get out the kleenex and enjoy this movie.

despite the fact that there were aspects of this film that i felt were not developed enough, i enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. richard gere and diane lane are great in their lead roles. the basic premise of the film is that both were in the wake of broken marriages when they meet. both, also, are searching for healing. unexpectedly, they find that they can help heal each other. there were aspects of the film that i wished i'd seen play out more-- where simple flashes merely suggested themes that my mind had to fill in the blanks on, such as the apology to the bereaved widower, and how adrienne goes from feeling guilty about having slept with paul to feeling okay with it soon after. an opportunity for a tremendous love scene was lost when it was merely suggested they were going to make love with the hurricane coming. but in the end, the film left me feeling deeply appreciative of the relationship that my wife and i share. and there were moments that moved me to the verge of tears. so, i have to say it is well worth viewing.

i think this show was right on the money for me. i watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place. the chemistry between richard gere and diane lane was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)! i loved how diane lane's daughter acted in the show too. she displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life. i loved this show from start to end. definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!

eichard gere & diane lane back again in another romantic love story. they are an excellent team,but somehow this film will not be among there best, the director george wolfe using a screenplay by ann peacock & john romanao, for nicholas sparks novel, does a capable job. this is yet another tale of 2 strangers meeting & falling in love,then they go on there way,then when they are about to meet again & start a life together.spoiler but not really. tragedy happens, one of them dies.how many times have we seen this already.those who never saw tearjerkers like this will hopefully like it more than i did. this story has about every cliché there is.the only reason this has the ratings i will give it. is because of the fine acting & excellent production . the cast besides our 2 stars, includes christopher meloni, viola davis & scott glenn. they all give real good performances & do the very best with the material they were giventhere is a good but not over done storm sequence, the sex scenes are well done, no nudity & next to no foul language,ratings: *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) imdb 7 out of 10)

that's right, we've got a 2008 film using themes of "brief encounter," and "the bridges of madison county." it's basically the story of lost loves, redemption and a triumph of the human spirit.the performances by richard gere and especially diane lane are very good. gere gives the kind of restrained performance here as a doctor who is searching for meaning, after a patient dies on the operating table. lane is the mother of a rebellious daughter and a nice young son, who has split from her wandering husband and has also sustained the loss of her father in the same year.scott glenn steals the show in a one scene meeting with gere. he is the heartbroken husband and he recounts his love to his departed wife, it will bring tears to your eyes.fresh from her triumph as an acquiescing mother in "doubt," viola davis appears as an understanding friend in the film and literally hangs her hair down in a rather benign performance.

discovering something, the journey is so much more fun, so much more surreal and so much more emotionally galvanizing than when you finally arrive at the destination. falling in love is perhaps one of the most opulent feelings in the world. you feel energized, invigorated and alive. you simply want to be around that person every second of the day and the very sound of their voice gets you excited and sometimes aroused. love, and all the physical and emotional side effects that comes with it, is pure bliss. where it goes from here is anyone's guess, but when you first begin your journey together, nothing can compare to it.diane lane and richard gere play adrienne willis and dr. paul flanner, two emotionally scarred middle aged individuals. in this film, they are about to embark on that mystical journey together, where love, and the discovery of the emotions along the way, will help save them.lane is dealing with the typical jerk of an ex-husband who still loves her, but in her eyes, only because the woman he cheated with no longer wants him. as hurt as she was by him, as much as she really dislikes him, there is a part of her that is actually considering taking him back. why you might ask? because in life, and love, sometimes comfort supersedes intelligence. yes, this man cheated on her but she has kids with him, she built a life with him and there is obviously still a connection with him.richard gere plays a recently divorced husband and estranged father. he also just lost a patient as she reacted negatively to the anesthetic. he is now being sued by her family and he is guilt ridden but hardened about the issue. this is what brings him to rodanthe in the first place. although his lawyer told him not to, he felt compelled to visit the woman's husband in rodanthe. he stays at the inn that adrienne is taking care of. soon, they find comfort in each other's arms and discover that they too can have a second chance in life.by now this sounds like a simple idea for a film, and although it might be something you've seen or read about before, gere and lane simply own the film. diane lane lights the screen up with her smile. her eyes twinkle in the dark and the life she brings to the character is one worth watching. gere's character is a little different. he is more hardened and bitter. it takes adrienne's pain and her passion to bring him out of his shell. he blames quietly himself for his strained relationship with his son and her secretly blames himself for the death of the patient. on the outside he tells anyone who will listen that it is not his fault, and that she was a 1 in 50,000 casualty. but deep down, it eats away at him. they find each other at a time when both need someone to listen.gere and lane have been in film together before but this is the first time they play lovers. they were married in unfaithful but here they play lovers finding each other when the people in their lives have abandoned them. they have a spark and a real chemistry. i would love to see more films with them together. in fact, i'd love to see more films with diane lane but that's a story for another time.nights in rodanthe is a very passionate and romantic film about two lost souls who save each other. they both become better people, they both become stronger people. i enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to anyone, not just couples. this is a film about redemption, absolution, and second chances.it will also ask you to bring some hankies.8/10

nights in rodanthe brings back to the screen two talented actors in diane lane and richard gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present. the chemistry between lane and gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. the locations, beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real, is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care. james franco in another micro role is just the right casting, and the elegance of lane in combination with the beach house, is a true fall 2008 film to remember forever, as was the notebook.

ever since they first came to the outer banks and filmed the movie (i have lived here my whole life), i have waited for this movie to come out. and i mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me, it was worth it.the movie is different from the book but in my eyes, it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. in both i cried, there were moments that tore me up. i laughed and i smiled just as much. it's a great movie with a great story line.it's about never giving up on finding that one, the one that will change you forever. the one that will shape your soul and awaken you to a whole new view of life.i have to say that it is possible to meet someone and have them change your life forever, which is what gere's character did to lane's. i met the love of my life and at once was completely captivated that i never forgot him or how smitten i was with him until i 'met' him again a year later. for me i could relate to this movie with my whole heart. i think that if you listen and watch the movie with your heart and your hopes you'll see what i'm talking about. it's never too late to find your true love, great work ms. lane and mr. gere!

i remember seeing this film when i was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it. i found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. one in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. they also bound him and shaved his private parts. this was all because he was unpopular. why was he unpopular? because he was bad at games. i have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular. to me, he is the type of person who would always be picked on because that's how children operate. popular children are popular because they are in some way 'cool'. popularity is a hard thing to define. so, even at the end when he is successful in his career it makes no difference & he is still left feeling tormented. i found the ending quite distressing as there was no resolution.

thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow imdb member i've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years, and i can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its kick. i can't believe that channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. it focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other. as events from both the past and present unfold the tension gradually thickens, not dissimilar to shane meadows' excellent revenge-chiller dead man's shoes. the acting, writing and direction are very bold for 1983 and still pack a wallop today in spite of the upper crust accents of the central characters. yes, it might be set in public school but it's worlds apart from anything put out by merchant ivory; i got a state education and can still draw countless parables from the story. this is a film that you'll remember for a long time if you see it - except you probably won't, because channel 4 (or filmfour) have chosen to bury it. on their own official website they describe it as "an inexplicably overlooked gem from the early days of channel 4" - overlooked by who? this was one of the very first channel 4 films (which would later go on to become filmfour thanks to the success of films like trainspotting), so somewhere someone must still have the master print. in these days where you can get extended collector's issue dvds of more or less anything it's a bit moody that they can't give a film this good the promotion it deserves. so, if one of the channel 4 production flunkies is reading this, stop making programmes that showcase people humiliating themselves in the hope of securing a tabloid deal, chase up this film and sort out a nice special anniversary edition disc or something, please!

i've only seen this film once when it was shown on tv but i can still remember it 15 years later so that must say something about it. i thought it was an intelligent look into schooling, friendship, bullying and the influence it can have leading into adult life.the title really refers to how being good or bad at sports can either make you the lowest of the low or you will be tolerated by the cliques within school and even later on into adulthood if you're good at it- this is set in a private school in england but it could be anywhere.the main character is bad at games, seeks revenge in later life which all culminates in a climactic confrontation on a cricket pitch. i must admit i was gutted by the ending - it was powerful and saddening.

for a long time, i, a fan of "the monkees" tv series, refused to watch "head" because it was not about the tv show characters, who were warm and wonderful. "head", instead, was said to be a cynical, dark movie. finally, curiosity caused me to cave in. i didn't, of course, find a new episode to the tv show, but a fascinating movie that appeals to my dark side.i have always been fascinated by dreams, and "head" was very much like watching someone else's dream, with incomplete hints of stories, and a small detail at the end of one scene causing the film to segue off in a new direction, very much in a dreamlike stream of consciousness manner. the unfinished stories really make my imagination run wild, time and time again!the film also features very striking, beautiful cinematography, the epitome being the black-on-white, white-on-black look of "daddy's song". the music is haunting, especially the lush arrangement of "the porpoise song". ("the porpoise song" is the favorite song of my dark side, while my bright side prefers "zip-a-dee-doo-dah".)in the end, i think the tv series could have used some of "head"'s drama, intrigue, and intensity. but "head" could have used some of the tv show's warmth, humor, and friendship.

that this film flopped at the box office, and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today, is a great pity - yet somehow rather appropriate. the commercial suicide the monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on-screen. to destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome american alternative to the beatles is courageous to the point of rashness, as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (in the movie, literally) in their own artificiality. the monkees' television series was not that conventional, but head is utterly plotless...although in the end there is actually some kind of circular logic to it all. unrestrained by a genuine storyline, the surreal sequence of events is by turns hilarious and rather disturbing. the greatest irony is that the monkees effectively signed their death warrant as a commercial force at a time when they were reaching their artistic peak. their exploration into psychedelia reached its zenith with the soundtrack to head (all the songs are memorably woven into the film), which is one of the landmarks albums of the 'sixties. the monkees began to disintegrate after the box office failure of this movie, but head serves as a noble legacy.

try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you'll be hard-pressed. head is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentaion. in less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time-capsule of an era, but also a full-length experimental feature that defies time,space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties could.head is a reflection of those films. no matter how one feels about the monkees, this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium. had it not been for the film's unorthodox ad campaign (and the fact that by the time it came out the monkees so oversaturated the media that the public had become weary of them and every critic was ready to pounce on them) this could have had a much greater impact. studying how the film was edited is much more important and exciting than what's actually in the film -and yet there are some great things in it (great songs, great cinematography, etc.) . should be seen after midnight for maximum effect because of it's overall dreamlike feel. 1968 was a time of social unrest and a call for change (thus the film's working title "changes") and head perfectly mirrors that time.

this film starts as it ends and ends as it starts. what is in the middle is a collection of comedy, philosophy, music, observations, commentaries, mini stories, colour and lots more. it looks at the world and our lives and tells the monkees story from the view of the group members themselves. it also looks at television and film and makes a visual commentary. it shocks also, with scenes of war and shows how we are just pawns in a big game. it says all this and much more, but if you don't look at it objectively you won't see much more than scenes strung together to join up the music. it's the sort of film that can never get boring because it's so cleverly done.

when i first saw this movie,i also expected "our boys" to be cute,and more like an extended version of the tv show. i didn't "get it" back then. but,years later,at a party years later,at a 70s' type par-tay,where certain substances had been smoked,inhaled,and with plenty of tequila,"head" was on late at night.we watched it,and finally realized what "head" was all about. it spoofed their own show,as shown in one song that called themselves,"a manufactured image". as davy jones wrote in his autobio,"they made a monkey out of me",he openly admits that everyone in the film,had been up all night smoking weed.they made fun of themselves,society,everything! great film! tho,as a 52 yr old granny,i no longer "induldge", i still watch this film when i want a good lol!!!

this film, like much of their music, is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer. it is terrific and, in many ways, ahead of its time.the images are funny, disturbing, and at the very least, engaging. the music is amazing. this is not the "candy pop" sound they are unfortunately associated with. this is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt.head, alone, should put the monkees into the rock and roll hall of fame. can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there?

i just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense. it was never supposed to make sense. (duh! the writers were completely wasted on frodis at the time.) it was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does both wonderfully.the monkees are good actors. they wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors. mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy, davy is a broadway veteran, and peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life. don't tell me they can't act, because they most definitely can.they can also write. sure, jack & bob get the sole credits, but in reality, they got a big helping hand on that script from the monkees, who were also in that smoke-filled room.(it is absolutely impossible to spoil this film) head is very highly symbolic. among the more memorable elements is the black box, which was actually based on 2 things: the monkee image that the boys were bound to, and the real black box on the screen gems lot where the band was kept between takes. there's so much more symbolism in the movie that i'll just let you watch it and figure it out.the music is awesome. "circle sky" is one of papa nez's best tunes ever, and "porpoise song" & "as we go along" will have you enthralled. if you'd rather be weirded out, then "ditty diego", "can you dig it?", and "long title" should be satisfactory, great songs that they are. and then there's "daddy's song", without a doubt a homage to davy's broadway days, and the editing/color scheming for that sequence is superb. (at least for '68.)oh, for those of you who won't watch a 'pg' film, you're missing out. especially since head was originally rated r in 1968. the rating was lowered about twenty years later!now where was i? ah, yes: "we were speaking of beliefs. beliefs and conditioning...."

i was truly and wonderfully surprised at "o' brother, where art thou?" the video store was out of all the movies i was planning on renting, so then i came across this. i came home and as i watched i became engrossed and found myself laughing out loud. the coen's have made a magnificiant film again. but i think the first time you watch this movie, you get to know the characters. the second time, now that you know them, you laugh sooo hard it could hurt you. i strongly would reccomend anyone seeing this because if you are not, you are truly missing a film gem for the ages. 10/10

i originally saw this several years ago while i was sitting on the couch and got stuck watching it on hbo. with the remote out of my reach i decided to go with it and was awaiting a miserable movie that i had been avoiding for a year. so it started off and i wasn't very optimistic about it, but after about ten minutes i found myself laughing. the complete opposite as i was expecting. the comedy was smart, the acting pretty good considering, the cast worked very well together, and the story (though slightly awkward and fake) was actually quite entertaining.three convict brothers manage to escape their sentence and eventually go in search of their fortune. the movie is set in the 1930's. so along the way, they encounter a number of funny and interesting charatcers. all have a different story or achievement they are striving for. really the majority of the movie may seem random. some may say it was pointless and boring, but if you look for the smart comedy (and occasionally stupid) that is integrated into the movie, i'm sure you'll enjoy this one.i liked the performances given by george clooney, john turturro, and tim blake nelson. all of them did very well in their roles, an they worked great together. but to finish this off, "o brother, where art thou?" is a smart, funny, and a movie adventure that i wouldn't let pass up.

i thought this movie was great! i saw this when it came out in the theaters so i do not remember all the details. i remember it being based on homer's tale on odysseus. names places and events are changed but you can still see the resemblance to the tale. i found it funny how they would get themselves into trouble and how they would get themselves out of it. i really enjoyed this version of modernized old tales much better than the romeo and juliet with clair danes.i will agree that in some parts of the tale it does get a little to silly at times but all in all it is a great adventure with some big name actors.

about the discussion on the south, the rednecks and the hillbillies... well, i am from the south: argentina, near the south pole to be exact. is this southern enough? seriously, some stories are universal. we have never been to greece, nor lived the classic period of homer, but he speaks to us today. so does shakespeare and dante. and stories from far unknown places also reach us, when told with sensibility, intelligence, humor, just like "o brother". besides, we all (the rest of the world) have our own hillbillies too! and our own depression era (ever heard of argentina during year 2001?), our politicians and racism, our gentle souls just like delmar and tommy... i simply loved this movie, folks. despite the subtitles, despite being on the other side of the world. (and please forgive my errors in english, i tried my best)ps: i believe nobody quoted this favorite phrase: when delmar asks george nelson what does he do for a living, while handling him the machine gun...

the first time i saw this movie, it didn't seem to go anywhere. when i watched it a second time though, it made a lot more sense. give it a chance, watch it more than once, there are a lot of key elements that shape the story that could be missed the first and even second time watching it. the cohen brothers brilliantly weave actual happenings of the early 20th century into this story to make a believable setting and storyline. the combination of clooney's leading role blends well with turturro and nelson's supporting acts. john goodman's appearance in the movie is hilarious. the soundtrack is great as well. this movie has become a household favorite for my family. 10/10, for sure.

this film makes clooney. all his films combined before this have all been based on the same character. this film he transcends his previous body of work and proves his capability as a top notch actor. the soundtrack defeats most one-handedly. the brothers have truly made a classic. one to own and watch repeatedly.

my husband received dvd of obwat for christmas and it was the best gift we received! we watch it every time we need to laugh and so far we have viewed it 12 times!the scenery in this movie is beautiful and the music is outstanding!we also purchased the soundtrack and we play it in our vehicles and at home when ever we need a pick me up and that too is daily!if anyone needs a suggestion for a good gift for movie lovers this movie is it!the characters are hilarious , charming , and their facial expressions are too funny to describe!i have always been a fan of george clooney but now i am also a fan of tim blake nelson(delmar ) and john turturro (pete)and am now looking for them in other movies! you gotta see this movie!!!

the coen brothers have done it again. three depression era convicts(george clooney, john turturro and tim blake nelson)escape a mississippi chain gang and head off in search of buried treasure that will fund their new lives. along the way, they sing on the radio and become much sought after stars as well as escapees. great laughs and a soundtrack that is a lesson/introduction to bluegrass music.clooney is outstanding as the fast talking, quick witted ulysses everett mcgill. holly hunter plays his estranged wife. turturro and nelson are flawless stumblebums. also in the cast are john goodman and charles durning.dan tyminksi provides the singing voice for george clooney on "i am a man of constant sorrow", the soggy bottom boys song that serves as a template for the bluegrass laden soundtrack that also features alison krauss, ralph stanley, the whites, john hartford, the cox family and gillian welch. toe tapping, knee slapping fun for the whole family. you'll be surprised with how relaxed and funny this movie is.

i was into the movie right away. i've seen the other coen movies, with the exception of raising arizona, and i've noticed that each of their movies has a color. fargo is gray/white, lebowski is bright orange, and this movie is a pleasant yellow.the bright pleasant qualities of this movie start right away. soon the look is accompanied by the great, great music. it's the old folk sound, the kind of music that was written during a time when music was enjoyed as a part of day to day life. enjoyed by everyone, chain-gangs, church choirs, and even prison escapees.now, about the prison escapees. i don't know what crime their characters could have possibly committed, as they are a very very friendly group of guys. clooney is fantastic, completely nailing his role.go see this as soon as possible. i believe that it can be enjoyed by anyone at some level. for some reason, the theater i was in was full of old ladies and old men, and they loved it.you'll love it too, i promise. i was compelled to get my hands on the soundtrack right away.

this was the best film i saw in the year 2000. the cohen brothers have never let me down before, and they certainly didn't this time either.it's one of those rare movies these days - it's witty, intelligent and vastly entertaining. i left the cinema with a warmth in my heart. of course, there's lot of cohen stuff in there - odd characters and peculiar gadgets, well-developed plot and magic camerawork. but no cohen film is resembling any other cohen film, if you overlook the general quality of them, of course.the big surprise for me was that clooney is so good. but the true master performance in this movie comes from tim blake-nelson. but the rest of the cast is superb too.a film that is lightweight comedy with a musical touch that evolve it's story round rednecks and old time country music - dripping with wit and intelligence. thats a very unlikely combination. but it's exactly what this picture is.

having seen most of the coen brothers previous films i expected something different and slighty off centre. obwat is certainly those things, but it also has a heart as big as..well..as big as mississippi. it is one of the most plainly enjoyable movies to have come out in recent times, intelligent, well-crafted, clever and superbly acted.characters are delivered in their myriad shades by a group of marvellous actors. george clooney winning me over completely with his clark gable-ish looks and character. having only ever seen him in three kings and his thin red line cameo, i am now a fan. more comedy please george.john tuturro and tim blake nelson ably assist, especially nelson. if ever "the simpsons" is made into a movie then he must be a natural to play cletus the slack-jawed yokel. i don't think there is a performance that falls short of excellent from the entire cast. my special favorite is stephen root as the blind radio station man.great old-timey music, a jiggy type dance by clooney that i am trying to learn, and a feel of depression era southern us enhanced by sepia-like photography make this the best movie i've see so far this century. the only drawback to the film is that it has almost sent me broke buying the soundtrack, the dvd and a dvd player to play it on....it's that good!

i have walked out of a coen movie before and not quite known how to feel. the two best examples of that are the big lebowski and fargo. lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that i had to like it. on the other hand, there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bowling balls that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film. still, i liked the film and now own a copy of it. fargo made me howl with hysterics, sometimes i wasn't sure why i was laughing so hard that it made me cry, but nonetheless i was. there were many seemingly strange characters in fargo, but upon further investigation, they were really just real people talking about real situations. that is why the man with the shovel ( or was it a broom ) was so side-splittingly funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night. and that is also why the theater erupted in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in. (i own a copy of this film too) the coen's have a way of masking their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall. but if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany, you will always find that in some strange way, they all ring true. that is what is quite exceptional about o brother where art thou? this is a film that is out there. i mean it is not even in the same ballpark as a traditional film. i reviewed the film shaft this past summer and in it i said that shaft was an okay film that i have seen a thousand times before. but you can not say that about a coen brother's film and you most certainly can not say that about this one.this film has everything in it from a jail break, crooked southern politicians, muses, references to what i can only assume are historical figures, riverside baptisms, bank robberies, violence towards animals, singing flocks of religious fanatics, kkk, lynch mobs and so on. there are obviously many references to homer's odyssey in here as well, but i wouldn't know that because i have never read homer's odyssey or even knew one thing about it. every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and almost spoof-like quality towards it makes the film that much better. well coming from a guy who doesn't know anything about it, i can tell you that it is still an entertaining film. there were times when again, as is usual for a coen film, i wasn't sure why i was entertained or laughing, but i was.this is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that clooney says he has hidden to his two other cell mates. he has to take them along because they were also chained to him when they had their chance to escape.i like all the principal actors in the film and many of them are coen cronies. it was nice to see goodman again. it was nice to see hunter and especially turturro who seems to have a place in every coen film. it's too bad they didn't find a place for steve buscemi but that is a different story all together. but back to clooney. the man just has charisma. he is a one hell of an actor as well and here he is not quite as zany as the others but even he has his own idiosyncrasies. his work here is quite awesome and i really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any range of character.now after heaping all this praise on the film, let me just say this as well. i didn't really enjoy the film at first. i found it to be quite tedious and a little boring. there were too many ideas in here and not enough care went into harnessing them for all what they were worth. but then the film began to grow on me. it took a while but it did grow on me. i don't think this is their best film, but it is still a good one and i am giving it a 8.5. but the reason that i do recommend this film is for one reason only.every day you can go look into the paper and look at the films that are playing and say to yourself, seen it, seen it, oh, seen it last year, that is the same as this film and that is the same as that film. most films have been recycled in some form or another. not the coen's films. they have not been recycled and if they have i don't know about it. that is reason enough to see something that they put out. originality counts for a lot in my books. the coens are original and they are good. and that is not common in todays cinema. enjoy them while they are allowed to make films. because you don't get vision like this in many films, so when you do, enjoy it!

not being a fan of the coen brothers or george clooney, anyone can see the skepticism i took into the theater. once again, someone in hollywood dares to create something different. this time it was those zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) coens doing "their thing" to one of the great works in literary history. who would've ever thought homer had this in mind? i don't know where this film is going to fit in the history books of hollywood, but it will be in both mine and many others dvd or vhs library. it is one of those films that you can watch over and over. the story is brilliantly written. clean and entertaining, with a couple of gumpesque brushes with fame, great performances by clooney, turturro, nelson, and a brief but hilarious holly hunter. being born in mississippi and raised in other parts of the south, i wish more people would poke a little fun at us like this. they even invoke a soundtrack fitting for the rural south. you are not doing anything better this weekend, go see this movie!

the coen brothers have truly outdone themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped convicts. though it is based on "the odyssey," the ancient work of homer, you do not have to have read "the odyssey" to be able to follow the story. the brothers coen have woven a tapestry of celluloid and aural delights! the soundtrack is intrinsic to the film, indeed it is as though the soundtrack is the product and the film is wrapping paper. each character is wonderfully exploited and harkens back to the days of old when films were rich with character actors whose very appearance in the film adds richness, texture and authenticity. george clooney is magnificent as the grease haired everett ulysses mcgill, a honest con on the run whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comical and endearing. o brother, where art thou is easily the best coen film to date as well as clooney's best effort. clooney is good enough to warrant a best actor nomination as is tim blake nelson's portrayal of the dimwitted friend delmar, while the film itself is deserving of a best film nod.

thank goodness for the coen brothers. their success has brought them bigger budgets,but hasn't rid them of their creativity. i had planned on seeing another movie, but it was sold out so i went to this one instead. by the time it began, i had forgotten what movie i was there to see. i was surprised in more ways than one. this movie is hilarious, but they don't make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs. the writing is brilliant, and delivered with great skill by george clooney (after this, nobody can say he's just a pretty face) and the rest of the cast. it can be appreciated on many levels, whether you remember the odyssey or not. i can't remember the last time i saw a movie that was this clever. i've seen others i would describe as beautiful, intriguing, funny and charming, all of which also describe "oh brother," but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end. you can feel that their journey is building up to something, but you can't tell what. and the coen brothers do not fail us, the end is certainly not disappointing. it's surprising, and ties up all the loose ends neatly, without wearing the story out.

the knowledge is a typical british comedy for the period. to someone who is not familiar of the process of becoming a london cabby the film is bound to seem very average with a few laughs from a few old faces.the knowledge however comes into its own for knowledge boys like myself or their wife's who know what these poor individuals are going through. and find yourself comparing incidents of your own to that of the characters.

as someone who used to spend hours driving around the backstreets of north london in an attempt to avoid the horrific congestion, this film immediately appealed. throw in my interest in what london was like back in the late 70s and you have the basic premise for my version of tv heaven! on paper the film ticked all the right boxes, and having just watched "the knowledge" the actual movie itself certainly lived up to, if not exceeded, my high expectations.visually, i was surprised how different london looked back then (i lived in islington in the 90s, long after gentrification had transformed the area). it truly came across as grimy, tatty and down-at-heel. london may still have bad housing estates, but the general feel of the place is much cleaner, brighter and pleasant nowadays (based on what this movie shows rather than my own memories).as for the story and the acting, well top marks obviously go to nigel hawthorne as the vampire. absolutely brilliant! he acts deliberately unpredictably, alternating between total straight-faced severity and surreal mindgames in order to unnerve the knowledge boys as he puts them through test after test.all in all this was an excellent, thoroughly enjoyable trip back into a very specific time and place that i find endlessly fascinating. but even if you're not especially interested in london circa 1979, you'll still enjoy following the witty dialogue and likable characters of "the knowledge".

i first saw "the knowledge" during a thames television marathon on one of the local independent stations in los angeles back when it was new. i enjoyed it very much along with danger uxb.that a movie i saw once over twenty year ago should stick so well in my memory is a testament to it's originality and the quality of the performances by the cast.i looked for a dvd copy here in the u.s.a. and found none. i finally gambled and bought a uk dvd off ebay and was delighted to find that it has no region code. so those of us that would like to see this little gem can get a copy.

i must have seen this on the television when it was first broadcast some decades ago. i thought it was brilliant then, and as i remember so much of it now i may have been right. while i have lived in and around london i cannot call myself a londoner and do not know it at all well - who does other than taxi drivers? once the viewer understands the premise; that here is a group of men trying to learn the seemingly unlearn-able and rise to the status of demigods, then the rest is sheer joy. the characters are well contrasted, their family relationships are equally diverse, and so differently affected by the events of the film. don't think this is a documentary - it is pure drama, and the knowledge is one of the characters. i have never seen anything like this film, before or since. watch it!

just to correct something in a previous review here, i don't believe this film is only for people who know london, it's a case of a very specific situation being used to make universal comments. jack rosenthal says in an introduction to the published script that it was meant to be about characters who, by going though this gruelling knowledge test, gain some measure of self-knowledge.i think it's one of the most perfectly-written dramas i've seen: technically it's supremely adept at conveying quite complex details but it's also joyous in how it involves you. at the start you know no more about this london knowledge test than the main characters but you get scooped up right along with them until it's vitally important to you. you become tremendously proud of those characters who succeed, and you are crushed for those who don't. especially one whose downfall, without giving anything anyway, will make your hands fly to your face.also just as a point of fact, nigel hawthorne's character, mr burgess, is called the vampire, not dracula. you don't need to know this, i'm not saying it's crucial, but it's a measure of the drama: once you've seen this, you will want everyone to and you will evangelise about its every detail.i hope you get to see it.william

i was delighted to see this gem of a film available on dvd. despite being a 'tv movie' and shot on 16mm, it provided a wonderful insight into the different types of people who wanted to become a 'london cabbie', along with their foibles and family commitments. even the most hapless of candidates, 'titanic' with his uncommunicative wife, it was possible to see how jack rosenthal was able to craft an often funny and sometimes tragic snippet of london life into an entertaining 90 minutes.originally premiered as a vehicle for mick ford (pun intended), the quality of the acting from an ensemble cast including michael elphic, nigel hawthorne, jonathan lynn, lesley joseph and maureen lipman (mrs rosenthal) meant mick may have had top billing, but he had to work hard in the face of such competing talents.even 15 years after its 1991 release, it is still as fresh as ever!

"flesh" is hard to describe with a solid summary because, well, there basically isn't a plot. the film pretty much just shows the day in the life of a hustler named joe (joe dallesandro, who is in the underrated louis malle picture "black moon") as he makes his rounds, sleeping and modeling around to cash in the bucks to pay for his wife's lover's abortion.not much, and since the film is quite a lengthy eighty-nine minutes, you would think that "flesh" would be a slow-moving and boring hour and a half. you think wrong. the film is made up of improv, no screenplay and the angles of the film are pretty on-the-spot as well, yet there is some kind of truth beneath every frame that gives the film its dementedly entertaining vibrancy. everything makes sense and serves purpose in what happens to joe in this one day. he meets a regular john that is obviously lying when saying he wants to see joe again, a photographer who talks so much that it bores joe to tears, two drag queens who read out of tabloid magazines as joe receives head from a mousy-voiced addict who mumbles on later about how she wants to get a breast lift, an old friend of joe who reads male-on-male rape stories to him, and then a final scene with his wife and her lover that eerily echoes the scene at the start of the film (one of the best openings to a film i have seen in quite some time)  and tells completely what the film is overall philosophically about.it's astounding how the film's messages and styles feel almost timeless, even though it's set in 1960s new york city, in real time, in real place, and is filmed like an obvious independent flick from that era. it's certainly not a film that could be made today, which adds on to its delicious mystique.fueled by unexpected jump cuts; and absent of a score to advance its images  "flesh" is about as raw, gritty as a film about male prostitution in the 60s can get.

a heap of human flesh lies asleep on a red pillow. this is the hunk of naked meat that is "little joe", a new york hustler who lives with his bisexual wife and baby child. the film follows a day in his life, after he's woken from sleep by his wife demanding that he go out and do the traditional male thing - be a breadwinner. but the use she wants to put the bread to is to pay for her new girlfriend's abortion. we certainly aren't in the traditional family unit here...after playing with his child, joe hits the streets to cruise for johns. the clients come thick and fast: the ordinary gay man who wants to meet him again because they "work well together", the old english classical scholar who pays $100 to see joe pose like an ancient greek athlete; the female topless dancer who blows joe then boasts about being raped; the ageing gym bunny who doesn't think that what he and joe do together is queer. after a hard day's work, joe returns home exhausted, only to be put down by his wife and the girlfriend. he goes back to sleep as they harp and undermine him.flesh is fascinating as it takes what is a traditional classical mainstream structure - it has an inciting incident (the money for the abortion) and set-up, a confrontation and a resolution (albeit a very downbeat one), even a protagonist with a strongly motivated goal, and then proceeds to concentrate on the details of the day to day routine of these people who are perfectly ordinary to themselves but extraordinary to most "mainstream" people. it all seems very authentic and natural - it's hard to see the acting, the actors are so fully being their roles - but yet the whole thing is a piece of cunning artifice - a beautifully drawn portrait or an intricately carved statue. director morrissey carefully plants every incident, every encounter around his theme of human flesh become packaged commodity but with such cunning slight of hand that you almost don't notice him doing it. the wife "packages" joe's sexual organ, the old englishmen laments a long gone order of classical beauty which created art and poetry from human fleshly beauty, the transvestite friends of the stripper package themselves as women whilst reading a hollywood magazine in which "real" women are packaged as products; the gym bunny buys joe's friendship and affection, thinks artificial porn is real and can't tell, as we can't, that joe is performing his friendship and intimacy for the cash. the film itself presents itself as the ne plus ultra of cinematic realism but what we might as well be dealing with here is fine art or an early example of concept art.the genius - a word not lightly used - of morrissey was to find a way of taking warhol's arty pretensions to film-making, which were interesting sure but boring as hell, and making them into saleable products which remain amongst the most intriguing works of cinema art ever made - commercial cans labelled "flesh" and "trash" and "heat" with a product label - "andy warhol" - which sells an idea about the product as much as the product itself. yet just as you reel from morrissey's cynicism, you are spellbound by his ability to still maintain the highest of standards and depth of meaning. the constant what seem like camera flashes continually draw attention to the filmic nature of what one is witnessing, yet you get drawn into the illusion all the same - flesh is surely one of the most extraordinary pieces of cinema magic to ever spellbind an audience.

it was high time a movie about the situation in a largely ignored asian country like myanmar had to be made and beyond rangoon is hollywood's answer. initially i thought hollywood would dramatize the events of the 8888 uprising and add in the traditionally hollywood spice of titanic-type love between the lead heroine and the burmese male lead who happens to be an old man. thankfully, nothing of that sort was in place - which may also explain why the film was not financially successful.anyway, the film was honest-to-god and i was glad at the accuracy of events portrayed. apart from the fact that filming was done outside of myanmar in malaysia & thailand and that i missed the exotic burmese locales, i could not find much fault in the film.you cannot blame the film for the desperation of the people and the resulting overwhelming actions. it is after all, real events of a civil war. the music by hans zimmer is definitely the usp of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection to it.i was only a year old in rangoon (now yangon) during this tumultuous time. when i heard a movie was made on my real-life experience which i was too young to absorb, i had to get the dvd and needless to say, i could hardly have any complaints about it as it is an eye-opening wonder for me.

"beyond rangoon" is simply marvelous. from the traumatic opening to the uplifting ending, you will be amazed at how well put together this film is. patricia arquette amazingly portrays laura bowman, who we meet as a shut-down and quit despondent young doctor, unable to deal with her grief over the loss of her husband and son. throughout the course of the film, as she is trapped in burma, witnesses the democratic uprise and massacres in the capital city of rangoon, flees for her life, and saves her tour-guide's (u aung ko's) life, she is regaining her will to live. this may seen contrived or heavy handed: it is not. john boorman, a master at spiritual and emotional conflict, paints the film with broad strokes, and often uses symbolism to capture laura's emotional state, and physical predicament. patricia arquette, as usual, gives a wonderfully convincingly and believable performance as the emotionally wounded laura. what arquette does amazingly, in any role that she plays, is give us a window into her character's heart without words. every time she is given a close up in the film, the audience is given insight into her character. she does not need to speak to convey emotions, or be over the top. some critics were harsh on arquette's performance in the film when it opened on august 25, 1995, deeming that she was "flat" or "dull" in the role. i found her characterization dead-on, staying well away from the melodramatics that typically are part of an actor's performance when having a personally tragedy take place. she is on shock and is reserved about her feelings: that is just as normal as screaming lashing out at those around you. i am hoping that warner brothers releases this title on dvd very soon. with arquette's hugely successful nbc drama" medium" bringing her to household name status, not to mention an emmy win and now 2007 nomination, it would be in the studio's best interest to do so. hopefully there will be extras, with the alternate ending. do not by pass by this film. it is one that you will certainly not forget after seeing.

beyond rangoon is one of the most emotional and intense films ever made. superbly directed by john boorman, and intensly acted by patricia arquette, this film can easily be called one of the best films of the 90's. the story and vivid characters just grab the audience from the very opening, and never lets go. after seeing the film, the viewer will never be able to forget "beyond rangoon". the film made little money at the box office, and is little known, but should be high profile. watching it, you can tell that it was meant to be seen by a large audience. it is a very important and moving film, and should be seen by everyone.

this film should be seen by as many people as possible as it concentrates on the human rights problems in burma. when i first watched this film in the mid 1990's it totally changed my life. i knew very little about aung san suu kyi or her democracy movement. it effected me so i wanted to understand more about the situation. any film that has the power to make you want to learn more has done its job properly. patricia arquette is superb as the american lady who due to personal tragedy has become reckless with her own life decisions and gets caught up in the ensuing conflict. it is a powerful film about a subject matter which deserves more publicity. as the film itself says the 1988 massacre of pro democracy activists was not televised and therefore largely went unnoticed to the world. i implore everyone reading these comments to take the time to find out more about the current plight of the burmese people.it is about time this film was released on dvd. can anything be done?

while the movie has its flaws, it brings to light some of the problems that come with living in a country that has no democracy. it makes you empathize with the people under such a government and makes you want to learn more about their lives, their struggles and a potential leader aung san suu kyi. it makes one wonder why our government will interfere places we are not wanted yet ignore those who ask our help.

this movie was working toward two goals: to make a political point and to tell a scary adventure story. it's often difficult to do make a political point and still tell a good story (consider the highly political but rarely-entertaining final season of ellen). beyond rangoon finds a good balance between politics and storytelling.i already knew that aung san suu kyi had won the 1991 nobel peace prize, and knew something about the oppressive political situation in burma, so the political message of the movie was mostly a dramatization of what i already knew. but i thought the movie did a good job of telling about aung san suu kyi and the mostly-faceless dictators who have for years tried to silence her. the device of presenting an unfamiliar setting through the eyes of a character that viewers can identify with is fairly common, but it's quite well done in this movie.of course, the real measure of the movie was its entertainment value. arquette was excellent as a young woman whose sister took her to a distant, unfamiliar place to shake her out of her depression over the violent deaths of her husband and son. she is convincingly detached and depressed. her grieving condition gives her a clear reason for her distracted wanderings into the thick of a dangerous situation she does not understand, something she'd otherwise be much too intelligent to stumble into.once the dangers become so obvious that she can see through them even through the cloud of grief, she's trapped, with no easy escape. that sets her on a path of adventure where she needs her intelligence to survive. the writers deserve much credit for making her intelligent and resourceful enough to deal with numerous dangerous situations, while still finding a plausible reason for her to be foolish enough to get into trouble in the first place. the directing is strong also, keeping up the tension throughout the race to escape the forces of the dictatorship.this movie had additional impact on me and my wife because of other events of the same time period. we were preparing for a trip to india, and heard news reports of western tourists who had been taken hostage by a terrorist group in india. avoiding isolated terrorists in a peaceful democratic country is quite a different matter from escaping an oppressive dictatorship. but the movie and the news shared the element of avoiding danger in an unfamiliar country. that common characteristic gave the movie meaning beyond the strength of its own skillful storytelling. the movie illustrates the international tourist's worst nightmare.

i really enjoyed this movie. i have a real sense of justice and 'an eye for an eye', and this movie delivers that in spades. glenn ford is offered a very low price for his ranch by the big rancher in the valley; then one of his ranch hands is beaten and shot 'to help him make up his mind about selling'. when the ranch hand dies, and the sheriff refuses to do anything, ford seems at first reluctant to do anything, cautioning his men to not take things into their own hands. but, that's just what he is about to do. i knew this movie was about to catch fire when he went into the saloon and faced the guy (richard jaeckel, one of my very favorite bad-guy character actors) who had killed his ranch hand; after a gentle exchange of dialog with him, glenn ford slaps his face and shoots him dead. kind of a neat added bit of justice, he kills this guy with the gun that had belonged to his murdered cowhand. in short order we're treated to ford letting his ranch be burned, so his men are justified in ambushing the crew from the other ranch; then ford and his men stampede all the horses and cattle of the big bad guy's ranch; then they show up and burn the outbuildings and the big fancy house to the ground. talk about getting even big-time. lots of action in this movie. there's more to the story than this, but i'll just recommend you watch the movie. glenn ford was someone who showed time and again what can happen when you misjudge someone, and i really enjoyed watching him get justice the old fashioned way.

john parrish is an ex union officer who plans to sell his ranch and land to the wilkison's over at anchor. the trouble is that the price being offered is way to low and when they start to bully parrish and his workers, he has a change of heart, particularly when things take a brutal turn for the worse.originally after watching this one i had a sense of frustration, chiefly because of the cast that was involved. when you got edward g. robinson, glenn ford and barbara stanwyck in the same movie, you hope that they get a story and script from which to excel. sadly they don't get chance to produce a western classic worthy of multiple revisits, or is that my over expectation is doing it a disservice?. well i slept on it and decided to ponder further about the picture. i think yes it's fair to say that the actors in question deserved a better story from which to work from, it is, when all is said and done, a plot that has been milked for all it's worth, and then some. but the violent men is still a very rewarding film regardless of the missed opportunities evident with the production.glenn ford as parrish is as cool as an eskimo's nose throughout, and it's always great to see babs stanwyck playing a bitch because she's good at it. while eddie g, when one gets used to him being in a western, is fine in what is an under written part. robinson, who stepped in at the last minute when first choice as lee wilkison, broderick crawford got injured, is the one who is short changed the most by the makers, even supporting characters such as the devilish wade matlock {a grinning delight from the reliable richard jaeckel} and judith wilkison {a radiant dianne foster} get something to leave an impression with. but for what it is, robinson's crutch toting "bad" guy is at the least memorable for all the right reasons.not shy on action and gun play, it's with the twists and almost shakespearean tragedies that rudolph maté's film rises above the mundane, with all of it gorgeously framed by burnett guffey's stunning cinematography. lone pine in alabama has been used on many a western picture {see seven men from now for another glorious use of it}, but here guffey really excels and manages to dazzle the eyes at every turn. the violent men isn't a great western picture, and perhaps a better director than maté could have really given donald hamilton's {the big country} novel an adaptation to be proud of. but for every niggle and irk i personally had with it, i found two more reasons to actually really like it, so that it be, it's recommended, for sure. 7/10

stanwyck at her villainous best, robinson her equal - as ruthless land barons in this fairly ordinary western.some good action scenes, strong use of location, colour and cinemascope. but why the obvious use of stock footage in the stampede scene?ford is dependable as always and foster is strong as robinson's daughter, but it is the baddies' film. and it's not just stanwyck and robinson - brian keith makes a surprisingly dashing villain as stanwyck's lover, and richard jaeckel is unforgettable as a cold-hearted killer.see it for the camp value.

extremely entertaining mid-1950's western that packs a whole lot into just a 96-minute running time. most viewers will quickly get drawn into this story and will find the experience quite enjoyable. more than just a b-western but not really an epic, the budget was modest and the cast affordable despite several big names. glenn ford was the only box office draw at the time. edward g. robinson and barbara stanwyck were past their primes and looking for work, stanwyck was 10 years away from a new popularity in "the big valley". brian keith and dianne foster were just starting out.ford plays john parrish, a small rancher who decides to sell out when the sympathetic sheriff is murdered by the big rancher's (robinson) hired gunman. parrish is a former confederate officer who only moved out west for health reasons. robinson plays lee wilkison, who already owns most of the valley and intends to acquire the rest, making good on a promise to his wife martha (stanwyck). lee was crippled in a land war he fought 12 years earlier; his brother cole (keith) has come up from texas to help him run the huge spread. lee has been turning a blind eye to obvious hookups between stanwyck and keith but sensitive daughter judith (foster) is understandably upset by what is going on in their home. john parrish has promised his fiancée caroline (may winn) that he will move back east. caroline, who is modeled on grace kelly's "high noon" character, breaks off the engagement at the first sign of trouble and simply disappears from the film. this leaves the way open for a john and judith romance to develop. the violence starts early and continues throughout the film, with parrish able to apply military tactics against an enemy who underestimates his ability and determination. he has a very original confrontation with the main gunfighter about midway into the film. ford plays one of his standard characters; the modest guy who disarms everyone with a self- deprecating manner, who is slow to take offense but brutal when finally provoked (very much like his role in "the sheepman"). robinson is likewise excellent as a man who maintains his personal integrity even though physically just a shadow of his former self. and he gets enough lines and screen time to adequately develop his character. stanwyck has the most difficult role and she is simply not convincing as the classic two-faced woman, a seemingly loyal wife who is scheming to replace her husband with his brother. in part this is because she is not allocated enough time to do anything more than superficially convey either side of the character. that said, a talented actress could have done a much better job even with these limitations.dianne foster is a pleasant surprise. she should remind viewers a lot of carroll baker, both physically and in acting style. although required to play judith according to 1950's convention (she is allowed to be tough but then required to break into hysterics after each major confrontation), foster shows a nice range. she conveys a growing attraction for parrish but does it so subtly that it is only in retrospect that the various clues click into place. the real problem with "the violent men" is that it tries to be both an action western and a character study morality play. because so much has to happen on the screen much of the action is rushed and many of the characters get only a cursory treatment. this is neither fatal flaw nor a reason to avoid the film, but it could have been significantly better with another 20 minutes of running time or the absence of unnecessary characters like caroline.then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

the violent men is pretty good western that certainly benefits from its excellent cast.edward g. robinson is the big rancher trying to squeeze out the smaller ranchers one of whom is glenn ford. ford is ready to sell to appease his fiance (may wynn) until robinson's ambitious brother (brian keith) murders one of ford's hands. then you know what happens next.barbara stanwyck is along as robinson's scheming wife the kind of role in which she specialized. dianne foster plays their daughter who comes to admire ford.the violent men is nothing more than a "b" plot with an "a" movie cast but it is very well done.

a western through and through. as the title character portrayed by glenn ford says, "no, i don't want to fight, but i will if it's forced on me." this movie is about being intelligent, strong, and fighting for one's beliefs. with courage, never stop striving for what you feel is right. great action and mostly quick paced. good to see brian keith in this role and edward g. robinson as an older western man. glenn ford lives up to his western image. thoroughly enjoyable film includes strategic non-military warfare. of course it's violent, like the title states, but not too graphic like in the computer-generated era films. it's mostly about strong personality clashes.

this film is a powerful commentary on family life in north america today. the story is so well constructed, it almost feels like its happening across the street, right now! if you are connected with your family and community in any way, this film will grab you and transport you to the travis' home and not allow you to leave until the credits are done.our imaginary heroes, through a myriad of innocent circumstances, often unwittingly, lead us down a path of sorrow, confusion and isolation. the travis family, after a terrible tragedy, invite each of us; father, mother, brother and sister, into their respective lives to share their experience in a dynamic set of circumstances that just doesn't quit. we see all of the above and eventually the joy, in powerful performances by the major players and the rest of the cast, making this film a movie-goers absolute treasure.in a film so well done as this, it is usually difficult to to find something special, but sigourney weaver's portrayal of sandy travis was outstanding. i would be surprised if others didn't recognize it as such.clearly a 10. well done!

this film is chock-full of little surprises, many of them funny. the fact that it's written and directed by a 24-year old blows my mind. some of the scenes where the high school kids are using ecstasy made me very uncomfortable because i have a kid that age and i could picture her using it. as parent of a teen, i found the depictions of the parent-child interactions to be dead-on accurate.i enjoyed the film's many little jokes, and i enjoyed the fact that not everything made perfect sense and not all the issues were resolved by the end. to paraphrase mark twain, truth is stranger than fiction, because fiction is required to stick to that which is possible, while truth is not.this is a film which plays with the viewer, allowing us believe that people are what other people think they are, only to allow us later to realize that the folks we assumed were right were completely ignorant of the real situation. one of the film's strongest scenes, a scene about which we feel very relieved and sympathetic about what the character is doing, turns out to be based on a completely wrong assumption, and the character, while admirable, is totally wrong. it's very subtly done, i think. very realistic.i liked the score a lot -- i thought it really aided the film, really helped set the mood -- the film has a couple of screwball moments, and the background music helps establish that.the valedictorian speech is a hoot and a half -- got a big laugh! the movie is really in my head right now -- saw it this morning. will try to see it again, time allowing. tens are hard to come by, but a solid nine in my book.

saw this film when it was an entry in santa fe film festival. heavy film! depiction of a completely dysfunctional family taken to another level of the extreme, might have left me depressed to the extreme, had it not been for very funny sight gags and dialogue along the way which lightened the film's overall tone. the relatively "uplifting" ending gave hope for those affected by the initial tragedy. still, i did not walk out of the theatre ready to go to a fun party. the film stayed with me for several days.brought back memories of "ordinary people", but with humor mixed in with the tragedy. i thought the acting was excellent, especially by sigourney weaver and emile hirsh. how each character dealt with the tragedy was at times sad, self-defeating, but also at times hilarious. clever dialogue, and situations.

it's a shame that by garnering a restricted rating, perhaps the audience that would find this film the most useful won't likely see it.imaginary heroes follows the life of a teenager after his brothers' suicide. not, of course, the most original story in the world, however it does spend a great deal of time humanizing their parents, the 'imaginary heroes' that failed in their sons' eyes.for teenagers, who tend to put responsibility for their failures on their parents but yet refuse to accept any real responsibility on their own, the movie sends a powerful message, that in the end we all have our own troubles we need to deal with, and that we all make our own paths.but, unlike other movies that tend to urge youth independence, this one resolves the issues between parents and child, and they become a stronger unit for it. that the eldest child committed suicide is regrettable, but not overlooked later in the film, and the responsibility by all parties for the tragedy is thoroughly explained.although the subject matter has been covered before, it hasn't been covered quite this way -- the film pulls very little punches. now, why this earned it an r rating is confusing -- you're unlikely to get across to a teenager in this era without being realistic, but yet providing realism restricts that very audience.were my junior high-school class have been shown this film, two suicides may have been prevented. in this case, the censors seem to have exercised extremely poor judgment.8/10

this short was nominated for an academy award, losing to anna and bella. not since doctor strangelove has nuclear war been so hilarious! condie takes a situation and turns it on its ear and then gives it a spin for good measure. visual gags abound in condie's work and i always see something i missed before every time i watch this. on the world's greatest animation, well worth seeing for thisand many other shorts. recommended.

man am i stoked i can leave feedback for this 10 minutes romp. i love it.after not seeing it in years, i happened upon it the other day and watched it over and over.'stop shaking your eyes' and 'shake a rock and roll band' and 'stop sawing the table' are freaking classic lines.the art is delightfully raw. the dialog sparse and wonderful. just find it and love it. cannot recommend this enough.thank you high school art teacher mrs. kogan for showing us this over and over. thank you nfb for letting it be made. thank you mts for showing it (for free at the moment at least).i want a big snit t-shirt now. i'd love an animation cell, but at 440.00 a pop, that won't happen.find this flick, and watch it.

just went on youtube and finally watched this oscar-nominated animated short directed by richard condie. i had previously watched his funny getting started there. in this one, a couple are playing scrabble. the wife keeps shaking her eyes while her husband has nothing but e's on his side. the wife leaves for a while to vacuum her bed and bathtub(!) before catching her husband looking at her side. briefly before this, the husband catches a tv show called "sawing for teens" with the stars sawing something and the husband getting his own saw. that program gets interrupted by a special report of a nuclear war happening (the newsman is a skeleton here) as everyone panics outside though the husband fell asleep during this time and thinks a parade is going on as he and his wife continue arguing about the game...there's plenty of other bizarre things going on before the touching ending comes on. quite hilarious and well worth seeing for any animation buff out there. can't wait to see any more animated shorts from mr. condie...

this hugely entertaining short is considered one of the best shorts ever, and i certainly won't argue with that. even in a country where top-notch animated shorts are created with regularity, this film still manages to stand out. if you ever get the chance to view this film, please do so. it's only ten minutes long, and yet it contains a man who is obsessed with saws, a woman who vacuums the bathtub, and a nuclear war. what more could you want in a film?

this is a very strange little short film that initially didn't impress me. from a purely aesthetic point of view, the animation here certainly ain't pretty--though after a while you notice that the simple and silly drawings do possess a certain odd charm. that's probably because with the script as screwy as this one, the animation works.the film shows an older couple sitting at the table playing scrabble. at the same time they are fixated on this game or other bizarre pursuits (such as the husband's compulsion to saw things--even the chair and table)! and all of this stuff occurs as the television warns of pending atomic annihilation--armageddon is definitely here! naturally, the neighbors are screaming and running amok--during which time the couple obliviously continues with this idiotic game. heck, even their cat knows the end is coming as the couple begin bickering about who may or may not have cheated--leading to a very surreal ending indeed!! the film deserves kudos for both being unique as well as very funny. while it did not win the oscar, it was nominated for best animated short--which it richly deserved.

i have only seen this once--in 1986, at an "artsy" theater in minneapolis...but i remember it like i saw it a thousand times this morning. hilarious ("sawing for teens", playing scrabble with all "e" tiles), beautifully animated (taking off her eyes, shaking them back into position, then putting them back on), and poignant (the end of the world, the pettiness of a snit)...required viewing for the human race. calling this simply a cartoon is like calling the great gatsby nifty typing.

...the world may never know. (the film that did take the "best animated short" oscar that year, "anna and bella", is very good, but it's no "big snit". both are available on expanded entertainment's "world's greatest animation" compilation, in case you'd like to compare.)"snit" and its director, richard condie, have attracted so much attention that there's little for me to add. i'd like to note, however, that the film contains one of my very favorite single "shots" in an animated short, the one where the man opens the door to let the cat out. i don't want to give away the actual events depicted here, but the first time i saw the shot i was whipsawed from one mood to another, then seconds later to still another. that shot has never failed to affect me that way since. for this shot, and for the way condie builds up to that set of moments, "the big snit" deserves the tag of "masterpiece".

richard condie's utter maddness insanity cartoon 'the big snit', is a trip through qwerkyness, madness, hillarity, enjoyable backgrounds, melting characters, and a conclusion that nearly brings me to happy tears everytime i see it.this short i have seen over and over and over and i never tire of it (luckily having it on tape from a broadcast on tv)!! it never stops to make me burst out in laughter uncontrollably, and then reach down into the depths of my spirit, highlighting the greatness of the human condition. cause when someone says, 'come on, let's finish the game' everything is alright in the world and the troubles that we face everyday we suddenly realise are all petty fleeting things not to fight or worry about anymore. this film at first seems just like a simple exercise in cartoon slapstick humour, but it is far more than that. this film hits a greater sense of spiritual meaning with mankind in the wake when everything seems to be so bad and trivial. it is flawless... in every way. and damn funny too ;)rating 10 out of 10.

richard condie is a canadian marvel, and one that should be shared with the world. be it for gut-busting early work such as "getting started" and the oscar-nominated "snit" through "the apprentice" and the digitally made "la salla", condie is a treasured local hero. but no singular piece of work puts a stamp on his career quite like "the big snit". and did i mention it was nominated for an academy award? darn tootin'."the big snit", although clearly a dated message-bearer from the 1980s (the short revolves around cold war-esquire nuclear annihilation, but don't worry  it's hilarious as hell), carries with it a larger meaning, as is most of condie's work in an understated sort of way. while the planet scurries for cover from armageddon, a couple bickers over each others' annoying habits (in true condie fashion, he hacksaws the furniture while she shakes her eyes  literally). and don't forget to watch it again and again, 'cuz there's always something to look at. condie loads this fella up with countless visual gags and memorable catch-phrases.i strongly encourage this incredible piece of animation be tracked down. in canada it's usually spotted in a national film board video that includes other stellar shorts (including fellow winnipegger cordell barker's equally funny "the cat came back"). americans will just have to dig a little deeper, but keep at it  the reward is worth the toil.

this film is all about humans. this film stayed as my all time favorite short cartoon for years.isn't it the simplest things that make life so much more interesting?! we humans are so soft, compassionate, funny, caring to each other one moment -- we invent the most beautiful and amazing machines to kill as many people as possible with the least effort the next. in our short lives, we destroy our world, each other and often, our own lives, than spend the rest of our lives trying to fix what we've destroyed. sometimes, there is nothing left to fix!this film can entertain, educate and even help us realize what is wrong in our lives! life is short and can be even shorter! the ending is way too optimistic i am afraid.i love richard condie's mind and what he makes happen with it! enjoyh.k.

'the big snit' came into my life complete by accident and has left an indelible mark on my soul. a scar of love, destruction and pointlessness that will forever be a part of my life. this is tale of beautiful futility. we are helpless without each other. we are helpless against governmental wrong-doings. we are helpless as to the choices we all try to make when in love. deaf to the mutterings and goings on of an world outside the window. blind to an inevitable apocalypse. dumb of the hatred and greedy opinions of an over-indulgent society. this is a tale of personal commitment and triumphant love defeating the ideologies of war. their petty bickering is a sublime observation of human nature and of how love comes with it's pains and darkness everyone has some irritating aspect to their personality and this is observed by the makers in the most simplistic and fantastic way. we travel only a short distance with the two main characters but are left wanting to complete our own journeys with a some of their simple,loving, honest philosophy in tow. i am so very glad that i exist in this 'our time'. another 20 years either side of my birth date, and i would not have seen and felt.... ....the big snit. william white. sheffield.

this is a masterpiece. 'the big snit' is a crazy, weird, hilarious and eventually touching look at an old married couple and their quiet life, who argue over sawing and scrabble while a nuclear war rages on outside. everything in this great animated short stands out as memorable: the eye shaking of the wife, the vacuuming binge, the husband's saw fetish (keep an eye on those backgrounds!), the very verbal cat, the demented game show, the "informative" news anchor, the "beautiful" accordion serenade and the moving and memorable ending. i am so glad i found 'the big snit', which is hands down one of the greatest works of film ever produced.

if you are going to see this movie, by all means don't go into this movie with the expectation of this movie will be absolutely hilarious because you will be let down. yeah sure its funny at times but i would consider it a political thriller masqueraded as a comedy. the performances are very good especially by jeff goldblum as the head of the election company. even though he has limited screen time he makes a lasting impression. of course robin williams is excellent.laura linney is very good too what a surprise. she is one of the finest actresses in hollywood and one scene in particular shows this. this film makes you think. what if a comedian ran for president and actually won? would the country be better off or would the country shatter into a million pieces?

robin williams is a national treasure, specially when he cuts loose and puts aside his maudlin approach to drama. he manages to liven up the usual restrained pacing of barry levinson, and there are moments in this film when he truly shines.as the funny elected american president in "man of the year" williams recaptures the hilarity and outrageousness that used to be associated with him. what makes him so appealing is his humanity and likability. here is a man who can lash at his audience but truly loves them, too. his humour is like barbed wire, and yet it is cathartic. it is what makes him very appealing to the people in the film and in real life.laura linney is once again portraying an intelligent woman in distress. she is a fabulous and very talented performer, but i think she has boxed into a stereotype and unfortunately, it would have been more interesting to have a less recognizable performer in this case. walken pretty much walks through his thankless role, and the climatic scene in the snl skit barely floats above water.go in for a few hilarious moments, and those are priceless. enjoy williams and forget some of the deep moments that slow down this otherwise entertaining movie.

this was an interesting movie...half-comedy, half-political thriller. it had a lot of good elements, although it was a little predictable. robin williams stars as tom dobbs, a popular comedian with a hit show in which he gives political commentary. think daily show with john stuart. during the taping of one of his shows, a female in the audience tells him he should run for president. that, followed by a few jokes taken seriously, were all that was needed to get the ball rolling and start dobbs' political career. he runs independently, and opposes democrats and republicans equally. he is straightforward and honest, and becomes increasingly popular--but maybe not popular enough to actually win. he's clearly the underdog in this election. meanwhile, a corrupt software company has created a program to make voting much quicker and easier for the common people--but there is a glitch. the glitch is discovered by a young lady named elanor (linnley) who is appeased by the software developer with a lie that he fixed the glitch before the upcoming election. election day comes around, and lo and behold dobbs is declared the winner. (big surprise!) elanor knows that he is not really the president--he didn't win legitimately--she decides to tell the president...but complications arise. her company went as far as poisoning her in order to silence her. in addition to that, she quickly takes a liking to dobbs. the plot takes a few twists and turns, before reaching it's slightly predictable conclusion. but, it never got boring. robin was great as usual, and christopher walken often stole the show as dobbs' manager-turned-political-adviser and best friend. it's an entertaining film, and it has a good message. i recommend it if you're in the mood for dark satire, or something that makes you think. overall i give it a 7/10.

this movie reminds me of great movies that temporarily wake me up with the realization that the emperor is indeed naked. our election process is unclothed and dismal. my awareness is heightened and i want to see the world change. after a short while i am lulled back to my little complacency and "bubble life." in the best sense of film this work will ferment into an edible stew for me and like in "network" i want to be convicted to say'i'm as mad as hell, and i'm not going to take this anymore!' but to whom? my vigorous youthful idealism has been slowly reduced to concerned parent with quiet convictions or rather "beliefs." "man of the year" reveals how much i yearn for honest and sometimes humorous takes on our current political situation. dobbs' line " i did inhale because i thought 'what the hell,it's lit, it's in my hand, i'll inhale it.'" was refreshing or would've been when clinton was president. why can't politicians be honest and set that tone for debates? we people must realize how much veneer is being put forth as real? i am sick of this election process already,anyone else? let take off the veils and set an agenda for our elected officials and take them to task (not re-elect) when they continue with evasion and non-representation of citizenry. this movie can inspire us to increase our expectations of politicians that spew rhetoric. great film!

i went to see this thinking it would be a great comedy and a comeback for robin williams, but when i saw it i realized i had bee lied to by advertisers as this is more drama than comedy, although it has a few really good laughs in it. it felt like i was watching two movies. one was a funny romp with robin williams that should have been the whole basin for the movie anyway, but you also get a techno thriller movie with political angst in the middle. i really don't know how to classify this film. but i can tell you it was good and i did laugh, not as much as i had hoped, but at least williams is back in the right direction. see this but know before going it is not all comedy and is a little intense.

not every line in a comedy is funny. this movie takes a serious subject, the disenfranchisement of voters and holds it up to the light while telling jokes about it. it's the movie the daily show would have made if they wanted to turn it into a movie. i found robin williams to be much funnier in this movie than he was in rv. and while my wife and i share a few opposing political views, we were both doubled over in laughter for several parts of this movie. the script writers here could give fox news some lessons in fair and balanced. lewis black was okay for his part, but never really seemed to be able to bring out his particular brand of comedy for his role. christopher walken was also good, playing his fairly common subdued supporting role, pushing a story along.

robin williams shows his stand-up talents and boosts up his status as a comedian in this movie of "what's wrong-in american politics and how can hollywood try to make an influence without boring people". of course hollywood uses movies with hidden or not-so-hidden agendas. i think this movie is for people who likes stand-up and political discussion. and the trailers of this movie were for everybody just to make sure as many people as possible will see this. everybody knows hollywood is more liberal/democrat than the bush&co so they have to make these movies every now and then...but this one was perhaps too obvious, at least i thought so, for making any real change.still, great stand-up and fresh political issues and talks...i enjoyed it and thanks to imdb.com ratings i was positively surprised when i walked out from the movie theater, and yes, i laughed many times. sometimes you just have to let it go and forget all the seriousness....see this movie if you like good and clever stand-up or politics and you will not be offended by the several references of how things are not good right now. rent it if that doesn't match you.

this film is a great comedy drama. christopher walken is tremendous in his supporting role as manager, and his commentary will keep you laughing. robin williams plays a great role as a quick wit "jon stewart" and will amuse you if you are fans of comedy central. the show is good, because if the viewer has half-a-brain, they will see it as a very needed sub-cultural attack on the policies of the current republican government and a criticism on the american democratic process..., not to mention the means by which most politicians get elected.i was amused at the sub-plots and found the film to be very fast paced and entertaining, without any of the usual "oh-brother's" i would agree the film is less comedy than marketed, however, without question better than 90% of the garbage in theatres at present. just my thoughts...don

actually i'll admit i'm a political junkie, so this resonated with me, but the erratic nature of ms. green (yes i know what they did to her), but the ending was such a copout and totally inconsistent with the film itself.why can't barry l and crew just left us wondering what he was going to do? let us debate it.instead they have this "oh i'm not worthy" bullshit ending and it just shows that when the chips were down it's better to leave the table instead of doubling down. stop the disney ending and putting a bow on it. life isn't easy, they should have had the courage to give the main character some backbone.we had to listen to the rhetoric the entire movie... and then it turned sniveling and the stupid, inane behavior by ms. green (when the crap was out of her system) just made for a ridiculous near end of the movie that was icing on the cake.

this film was really different from what i had imagined but exceeded my expectations nevertheless. this film has the exactly right mixture of comedy, drama, political criticism and satire (not necessarily in that order). without being patronizing or wisenheimer it reveals the open and subtle problems of our capitalist democratic high technology society. it makes you laugh instantly and remain in thought afterwards. for those of you who liked "wag the dog" and wished to have humane and manlike politicians this film should definitely be the choice!"politicians are a lot like diapers: they should be changed frequently and for the same reasons."

over the years, i've come to be a fan of director/writer barry levinson and he didn't let me down with this very funny look at politics. popular tv comedian tom dobbs(robin williams)has enlightened the nation with his scathing jokes about the state of the country and elected politicians responsible. night after night, he has his fans rolling in the isles; then the question is proposed that dobbs run for president himself. his manager jack menken(christopher walken)says go for it. dobb's flippant truisms flames a grass-root movement that puts him on the ballot. comedian to president-elect. meanwhile, a young woman(laura linney)finds a flaw in the computer system that will count the ballots coast to coast. my favorite sequence is linney's meltdown in the coffee shop.williams is absolutely hysterical with his rapid quips. others of note in the cast: jeff goldblum, lewis black and rick roberts.

the movie is more of a mockumentary of corruption in the whole american system. the correlations of those who vote who do not matter is so proved in the machines that end of voting a comedian to the oval office. politicians are such a joke that we almost need a comic to represent us as we have been laughed at for years around the world. bushism's have become a way of life for americans and will be the only thing left after he leaves office none to soon. oddly the only person of honesty is someone not even elected to the position and tells the truth in the end. the story is very subtle and if you go to it for laughs, it ain't happening. leaves a lot for thought. overall i enjoyed it.

robin williams is a genius. one of the best comedians in the world. he really shows off in this one, cracking jokes left and right as the talk show comedian tom dobbs. from the previous this looked like it would be a side-splitting laugh fest. and it was funny. but there were a lot of serious parts in the movie that i was not expecting. i would describe it as a drama/comedy. but it's still worth the money to see, and i still found it to be almost everything that i expected. robin williams is at his best, along with the famous christopher walken. they play a very good team in this movie and i was actually shocked to see how well the two were able to work together. i recommend it to anyone who is looking for a light-hearted movie.

lauren himmel's debut movie is well directed with a nice polished feel to it. there's a strong storyline going on with a meaningful point to it all even if at the end nothing is resolved hence the name treading water. the storyline revolves around a lesbian couple and their battle with ones mother for acceptance. 7.5/10

the pickle was the most underrated film of the decade. despite my best efforts at home, it is still seen as a bad movie. i say to hell with everyone on this. every one doesn't understand that it is in part a comedy with a dramatic twist at the end. danny aiello plays a burnt out director with perfection and conveys a sad depressed man. the scene when he is trying to record a last message is quite good. the interludes of stones movie are absolutely funny. "this is harry stone and today i become a man!" in all a fine and sadly misunderstood movie. plus a great cameo by little richard. hilarious! i hope that more people see this movie because 202 people is not enough for a consensus.-silence dogood

this is a great off-the-wall romantic comedy about love, work, pandering to the public taste, and midlife crises. the main character is a talented movie director who decides to make a silly pg-13 movie to get himself out of hock with the irs. it has an excellent cast, a wide range of humor (from deadpan to slapstick), and fine writing. it's also a wry send-up of the movie industry. the metacommentary includes several excellent cuts between reality and the movie that's being made, and in some places the film departs from strict realism. the result is a multi-dimensional masterpiece of wry midlife humor.

fires on the plain directed by kon ichikawa and written by shohei ooka and natto wada is a world war two movie which is finally not showing the allies fighting the axis powers, but the japanese fighting and struggling for their lives on the philippines. the main characters name is tamura , played by eiji funakoshi, and he is a soldier leaving his regiment because of him being sick. all he has on him is a hand grenade, his gun and some potatoes. like this, he is trying to make his way to the hospital in order to get a doctor and a cure for his disease. but since the hospital turned him away and gets destroyed, he begins a long walk. throughout the whole movie, tamura remains a bit cowardish, but very civil, when the other soldiers become more like animals by using their basic instincts for survival tamura is still remaining human and would not degrade. a scene which has influenced me a lot to think positively and different about this war movie is, when tamura comes into a phillipino village which is completely deserted. there, he fights a dog and finds a lot of corpses of japanese soldiers stacked up in front of a church. this makes tamura think and even more scared than he already is. that shows that the soldier is not a brave killing machine, but a servant to higher beings and human most importantly. after he turns away from the corpses, two phillipinos (a couple or brother and sister : very close relationship) return to the village in order to get their stash of salt back. the main character of the movie wants to be friendly at first, although he walked up to them with his gun, but shoots the woman once she starts screaming. her brother/boyfriend/husband then runs away in fear and after a moment tamura follows him and shoots wildly at the fleeing filipino. he does not hit him. after tamura picks up the bag of salt , something very precious , he drops his gun into a river. this gesture is very important in order to understand kon ichikawa's/shohei ooka's profiling of tamura and the war. comparing this movie to other world war 2 movies, it is not typical at all. of course all movies have suffering heroes, but their heroes are more heroic than tamura. he expresses everything that is human: he is getting manipulated , he is weak , he gets scared , he has hope. this is typical for japanese world war two movies and for japanese society. since world war two is not a discussed theme in japanese society, japanese are likely to put japanese in the second world war in the role of the victim. this victimisation is also very visual in this movie. one of the examples is tamura, another one the piled up bodies of japanese soldiers in front of the church and another important one is, when the japanese soldiers are trying to cross a street and the americans are already waiting there for them and shooting all of the japanese soldiers which have worse equipment and are fed worse and have no health equipment or anything alike. in my personal conclusion i have to say that it is worth seeing this film in order to finally see a movie from the other side than usual. it also has no nationalistic propaganda which could've been easily built in. once you have watched the movie fully, you will be able to see the horrors of the second world war to its total extent.

the title is a reference to the destruction of the remnants of a harvest, like rice husks, by farmers who burn them creating fires on the plains. this is a bleak tale of the destruction of the japanese soldier.the story is set in the closing days of the philippines campaign as a soldier with tb who returns from a hospital because since he can walk, they have no room for him. his superior officers don't want him around since he's really too sick to work or fight. abused by his officer he's sent back to the hospital with orders to either be admitted or kill himself. they still won't take him and he's soon left to wander across the war ravaged landscape trying to find help or a place to stay or even just food. its a bleak journey with no hope in sight and only death and man's inhumanity to man at every turn.billed as a harrowing journey into the dark heart of man and war this is also a very funny movie. this isn't to say its not horrifying, it is at times, but its also darkly comic. how could it not be? here is a film where madness and insanity run rampant, people are constantly trying to hustle tobacco leaves for food, trying to get even a slightly better pair of shoes, trying to remain a japanese soldier in the face of absurdity by marching constantly but never getting anywhere and you can't help but laugh. to be sure things go darker as it becomes clear that cannibalism maybe, literally and figuratively, the only way to survive, but at the same time there is something uncomfortably funny about the human comedy.hailed as a great anti-war film its stark photographic style makes clear the insanity of war even as it dazzles our eye with its beauty. here we see landscapes full of bodies that include the soldier and the civilian. set amid fields forests and trees that would otherwise be, and to some extent still are, quite beautiful. its a jarring sensation.what intriguing is that i read that this is based on a novel about the redemptive power of christianity. the director removed all over the religious references to hope and salvation and instead used it as to show that life stinks, war stinks worse and that there is, ultimately no hope.intellectually i admire the film, emotionally i don't. part of it is a strident downbeat score which, for me over accentuates what we are seeing on the screen. its almost gilding the lily since the imagery is so strong it doesn't really need to have the music force you into feeling one way or another.is it a great film, thats for you to decide. for certain its unlike any other war film, bloody, horrific and real in ways that big budgeted films claim to be but never are. this is not for those adverse to blood and gore since its here in spades.definitely worth a look.

i got this movie out a week after the death of ichikawa kon - i suppose if there is one way to mark the passing of a great director, its to raise a glass of wine to him while watching one of his greatest movies. ichikawa had one of the finest careers in japanese film, but as he never had a distinctive style or theme he often seems to be overlooked compared to his near contemporaries such as ozu and kurosawa (he was a little younger than them, but not by much). he is one of those directors who defies auteur theories - its likely that his wife (who wrote the screenplay for this and many other of his movies) was as much responsible for the quality of the movies as he was. but at his best, he was as good as any japanese film maker at the time. in particular, he had great technical skills, allowing him to tell complex stories in an accessible manner. but in terms of theme, this movie could hardly be simpler - war is hell. no really, its seriously hell.fire on the plain doesn't follow the normal war genre rules. there is no real beginning - we start as the wretched tamura, who is a regular private (although it is implied he is more thoughtful and educated than most of the others - at one stage it is shown he understands english, but he clams up when the others ask him how he knows it) is ordered to hospital, as his unit is already in an appalling state. the soldiers are defeated and starving to death. they are no longer an army, just a rag bag group of refugees - hunted by the locals, and pretty much ignored by the americans, who have bigger fish to fry. hunger and despair is driving the soldiers to the edge and beyond of madness.in typical ichikawa style, its not all just grim - its oddly funny in parts (a very black humour of course).the high points of this movie to me are the outstanding performances from the leads and the vivid photography. the characters, in all their humanity, but also their complete loss of humanity, are all too believable. this is that rare film - one which will refuse to erase itself from your head, even if you want to forget it.

pat o'brien had his best role ever as notre dame football coach knute rockne. from humble beginnings, rockne entered notre dame as a student circa 1910. he is into chemistry but becomes a marvelous football player and hero.upon graduation, he teaches chemistry at the school but he has got the football fever that tugs at him, this forces him to give up chemistry to pursue his dream of coaching the game. in a way, too bad, the school probably lost a great chemistry teacher-certainly far better and nicer than the one i had in high school. (erasmus hall in brooklyn to be exact.)he motivates his students. he will not tolerate academic underachievement. he is a coach for all seasons.o'brien captures that common kind touch. one of his students, george gipp, is memorably played in a fine brief supporting performance by ronald reagan.the years pass and the achievements run high-but knute remains the same kind coach who testifies before congress when football is called into question.donald crisp is outstanding as a notre dame priest who knew that rockne was destined to coach football. albert basserman is adequate, but his jewish accent in the portrayal of a priest is awkward at best. basserman was nominated that year in the supporting category for "foreign correspondent."rockne's tragic death, in a plane crash, robbed the world of many more years of a totally professionally wonderful human-being. the film is great.

you don't have to be a notre dame football fan to enjoy this, because i am not....but, as a football fan in general, this was fun to watch. it almost makes me a fighting irish devotee. if you can't get caught up in the emotion in this film, gridiron fan or not, you better check your pulse because this is an emotional film with some very touching scenes.as a sports fan, i loved watching the classic footage of early college games. they had some pretty wild plays back then with a lot of laterals. they interspersed that footage with pat o'brien shown as head coach knute rockne on the sidelines and some of the players, such as george gipp (ronald reagan). reagan gets pretty good billing in this film but his part really isn't that large. o'brien is the only actor with a large role in here. the rest - all playing nice characters - include gale page as rockne's wife "bonnie;" donald crisp, as the notre dame's "father john callahan;" albert bassermann as chemistry professor "father nieuwland" and reagan, as gipp, perhaps notre dame's most talented and famous player ever.what this film does nicely is balance the personal story with the football. neither angle is overdone. the characters in here all people you can root for, as there are no villains. on my last look, it was interesting to discover johnny sheffield - tarzan's son - playing rockne at the age of seven and to see george reeves, tv's superman, as one of the players. there have been very few football movies made in hollywood, for some reason, and precious few good ones. this is one of them.

this is a classic street punk & rock movie. if you remember those times out on the city streets 14 years old two in the morning and nothing better to do than skate from friends house to friends house and sparking it. this movie brings back old memeries.

i watched the movie about 13 yrs ago while living in airlie beach qld australia. i had found it in the shelves of a little shop in the back that most don't bother to browse.to my pleasure i found it and watched it with the intention of one day owning it and being in my collection. i still do not have it but will one day.i like the concept with the poetry and the fantasy. the semi deserted street scenes with a busy teaming city in the far background added to the visual effect.i have numerous times mentioned this movie to people that enjoy this genre, with nothing but praise. it has stuck in my mind and will for a long time to come.i fully recommend this film, but only to those that are into this type.this comment and the one from la,ca can assist you when choosing to watch this film. the comments may be negative but i found them positive if you look past the derogatory connotation.

the beat was an exciting movie about a couple of young punks trying to survive in 1980's new york. this involves fighting with the other street gang that they directly share a high school class with, trying to stay in school, as well as going to local shows that involve bands that look like the dead kennedy's and have the name skulls for their band name. rex (played by david jacobson) plays an autistic kid who starts to get a long with all of these kinds, and starts to show them that poetry is really beautiful, and if applied to what these kids do in life can really make things work out for the better! billy kane (played by william mcnamara) and kate kane (played by kara glover) are brother and sister. although they roll with this crowd of thugs, these kids are not the same type of people as this group. they care for rex and they care for others, and really show an enlightened side of themselves. while his sister sleeps with the head of the gang, she is also falling in love with rex, trying to show him that she is not a slut. but in the end, the teachers at the school finally get to him and want to put him in a mental institution, he finally feels it is time to end his life, while animals of sound played without him. but they like to think that he is not dead, he is just living his life to the fullest, riding sharks and being happy living in the ocean. this movie, was one of those movies where i was glad that i watched it. while it was extremely entertaining, it also had a big message to it. something a long the lines that these kids had no direction, no future, no figure heads to look up to, but because a troubled kid came along they all realized that there was way more important things to life then fighting the local black kids, or being destructive to everything. rex showed them the beauty in angry music. rex showed them the beauty in rats, disease and murder. rex showed they the beauty in almost everything, while some of those things have no beauty involved, they still were able to see that when used in poems, these poems speak to people. rex played an important part in this move, who changed everyones heart from depression, to see that there is hope for them, and thats why he started to show them; the beat.

i think it's the sort of film you either love or hate and i'm really not the type to go in for arty movies. my mother rented "mullhuland dr" the other night and i nearly ran from the room, ha. but i love this film.we recorded "the beat" one night when we had just let the tape run and got a great film that way by accident. saved that tape and watched it a lot. i eventually got the vhs to add to my collection. i've watched it many times and at one point copied down the poems. i even tried to preform one scene for my high school drama class. she had said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut out the bad words. she refused to let me do it. if it could upset my drama teacher that much it has to be good :) honest she never treated me the same after that.i liked the acting it came off very true and honest. it wasn't clean and polished but it was better than that. it was true to life, how anyone would truly behave and display emotions not how hollywood does. it was great acting especially by the one playing rex.the story was original. not only do the characters get drawn into his world but you do too. not your typical person meets inner city kids and saves them through knowledge film at all. simply caring and friendship make things a bit better.the only thing is that even in the 80's there was more gun violence and less simple stuff like rock throwing but that little bit of innocence didn't hurt this film.i think it's a must see. you will either love or hate it but either way it makes an impact and that makes a good film that you will remember and talk about later.

my first review at imdb, after a few years of using this site constantly...anyways, saw this on the tube the other night, loved it. it's in the mindset of a dangerous minds or a substitute, but much better. was sure for a moment that rex was speedy levitch, in waking life, but after checking, it doesn't seem so.i can see why many have problems with this plot and its poetry, but i also think these people are close-minded. admittedly the ending wasn't quite what i was hoping for, but overall it was so unique and well-acted, i can't complain. i wouldn't call this cheesy, as one reviewer did, it pulled off the scene better than most films of the 80's did. and they refrained from playing any really dateable 80's music.can't remember everything that made me smile when i saw this, but basically it realistically showed very creative individuals surrounded by mediocrity, and whether i share rex's beliefs or not, i love original attempts to describe the meaning of life. and his mutant theory is, to my knowledge, original. he rambled a lot as well, but they showed how confused he was at times, and why he might have some psychological issues. and then in his moments of clarity he was a philosopher extraordinaire, a person who noticed the little details in life and tried to give expression to them.also i was very impressed with john savage as the teacher. usually actors fail at that role. he pulled it off brilliantly.if you enjoyed waking life, i say watch this movie if you get a chance.9.5/10pk

"... the beat is too strong ... we're deaf mutants now--like them", rex voorhas orminei am surprised that this movie has been uniformly bashed. let me be the first to actually discuss the virtues of "the beat" and why you must see this film now.make no mistake, this movie is cheesy and "bad" in the conventional sense: the story is preposterous, the poetry is silly, and the acting is inconsistent.but these are the film's charms--all of these ingredients form the recipe for one of the most underappreciated cheezy films of the 80's.if the reference to "deaf mutants" didn't pique your interest, then perhaps this will: what kind of name is "rex voorhas ormine", anyway? it is such an unusual name (for north american audiences) that i said to myself, "even the names of the characters in this friggin' movie are firggin' silly."well, "the beat" is so fabulously cheezy that the "meaning" and "symbolism" behind "rex voorhas ormine" is revealed not-too-subtly by bart waxman (the misguided guidance counselor you love to hate). i won't spoil the revelation behind rex's name, but please don't get too excited, o.k.?overall, the acting is inconsistent (john savage--who plays the "concerned teacher" mr. ellsworth is pretty good, as is the fellow playing bart waxman, but the rest of the cast are unconvincing). that said, the acting does not detract from the film. why? there is a sincerity in each of the actors' performances that makes the characters they play endearing. so although the performances may suck, you are still left with the impression that the actors are really trying to do their best. as a result, the actors' sincerity succeeds where their acting fails (which is quite often).the homage to "beat poetry" in this film is bad, bad, bad. but this is a good, good, good thing when it comes to entertainment. would you actually enjoy "better quality" or "more respectable" poetry--especially in a film like this?folks, that would be boring (think about the droll they made us read in high school--sanitized to avoid "corrupting the youth", politically conservative and devoid of any critical analysis, etc.) even if you don't like poetry or "arty" movies (with all of the "intellectual" posturing that implies), you most certainly can (and should) appreciate ludicrous poetry in a wannabe art film!!!! how could you not enjoy the following?"do you remember the roar of the dinosaur? a woman's scotty craps on the floor bad scotty bad, oh the woman's so sad she washes her hands and then waits by the door today, yeah--today!"yes, that is an example of some of the remarkable poetry liberally sprinkled throughout "the beat." but what about the story, you ask?well, the story is preposterous. but then again, that is the beauty of this film. apart from some cliches, stereotypes, and predictable plot points, there are enough genuinely unique elements to the plot/story to keep things interesting. who is rex? where did he come from? what the heck is he talking about? deaf mutants? illiterate angels? do billy and kate really understand what rex is saying? is the audience supposed to understand rex and his poetry posse? (i've seen the movie several times and i still haven't figured everything out.)will bad poetry and high school talent shows really end gang violence?i guarantee that you have never seen anything quite like "the beat"--a perfect combination of brilliantly bad poetry, mediocre-yet-sincere acting, and a "mythopoetics conquers gang violence" storyline that has yet to be rivalled by any film ever made.bonus for fans of classic nyc hardcore: the cro-mags make a rare film appearance as the "iron skulls" and it's a hoot to see them perform several songs. i wish they included more concert footage, but maybe that will be an "extra" included on the "collector's edition" dvd i fantasize about.

of all the major 30s star actresses, miriam hopkins has been the most bizarrely overlooked and underrated. her string of excellent 30s and 40s films is quite impressive but she is often referred to as stagy or brittle. yet she had a great sense of humor and was memorable in several comedies, including this film, old acquaintance (with bette davis), and the smiling lieutenant (with maurice chevalier and claudette colbert). hopkins was famous for her dislike of hollywood, and the results has been a bad rep--undeserved.in wise girl she play an heiress trying to rescue the children of her dead sister from their guardian--the sister's brother-in-law (ray milland). the film offers several hilarious scene such as hopkins taking a bath is a storeroom, hopkins joining milland and guinn williams in a greenwich village restaurant for $3 apiece to act as "bohemians," and hopkins going ringside during one of williams' fights. milland is also excellent and very funny.hopkins and milland make a great couple. the film also boasts solid support from williams, walter abel, henry stephenson, james finlayson, margaret dumont, grace hayle, leonid kinskey, and inez palange. the two girls are ok.but hopkins, drunk on a "slice of wine" and wearing a pinned-together dress that is twice her size is hilarious as she blows at stray hairs while smoking.... a scream.

society heiress susan fletcher (hopkins) and her wealthy father simon fletcher (henry stephenson) are vexed that their young nieces joan (betty philson) and katie (marianna strelby) are living a bohemian lifestyle in greenwich village with their artist uncle john (milland) after the death of their parents (susan's sister and john's brother). simon has given up trying to convince john to allow he and susan to take care of the children and have resorted to using private detectives to catch him in either unbecoming behavior or unemployed and therefore unable to care for the children properly. susan finally decides to take matters into her own hands and goes to greenwich village herself, posing as an actress, to try to gain information and/or persuade him to see reason. what she discovers however, is that she not only likes the free and artistic lifestyle john and his friends are living and that the girls are being brought up well, but that she is quickly falling in love with john. inevitably, her true identity is discovered and she is faced with the task of convincing everyone on both sides of the custody debate who should belong with whom.i really enjoyed this film, and found that its very short running time (70 minutes) was the perfect length to spin this simple but endearing story. miriam hopkins, one of the great 1930's-1940's actresses is delightful in this film. her energy, style and wholesome beauty really lend themselves to creating an endearing character, even though you know that she's pulling a fast one on the people she quickly befriends. this is the earliest film i've seen ray milland in, and he was actually young and non-patrician looking. (and apparently three years younger than his co-star) his energy and carefree manner in "wise girl" were a refreshing change to the demeanor he affects in his usual, darker, films. honestly, though i am usually not remotely a fan of child actors, i really enjoyed the two young girls who played susan's nieces. they were endearingly precocious, and were really the jewels of the film. unfortunately, i can't dig up any other films that either of them were subsequently in after this one, which is a shame since both exhibited a large amount of natural talent."wise girl" was a film that was made three years after the hollywood code was instated, and to some extent, this was abundantly clear by the quick, happy ending, and the pie in the sky loftiness and ease with which the characters lived. the alleged bohemian co-op was in fact a gorgeous cul-de-sac where the artists lived for free or for trade, and everything is tied up very nicely throughout. fortunately, this was a light enough film and the characters were charming enough to make allowances for its fluffiness and short-comings and i was able to just take "wise girl" for what it was; a good old-fashioned love story that was as entertaining as it was endearing. unfortunately, films of the romantic comedy/drama genre today are considerably less intelligent and entertaining, or i wouldn't find myself continuously returning to the classics. 7/10

sometimes it's hard to define what separates a successful, delightful comedy from one that falls flat. in this case, the contrived plot about a spoiled rich girl who schemes to take her nieces away from the greenwich village 'bohemian' who is raising them, only to fall for him herself, is not promising. and nothing in director leigh jason's filmography suggests that he was an overlooked major talent. and yet he must have been responsible for creating a relaxed, happy atmosphere on the set that was faithfully recorded on film.he also had the good sense to cast this movie properly. the one small flaw is miriam hopkins in a part that ginger rogers would have been perfect for. hopkins is efficient but brittle, lacking the warmth and sexiness rogers would have had. she is further hampered by a pair of bizarrely long and sooty false eyelashes that are sometimes a distraction. but a very young and very handsome ray milland couldn't be better in an exuberant, uninhibited comic performance of great charm.and better than that, particularly for new york city residents, is the hollywood depiction of greenwich village in 1937. though completely synthetic and idealized, it remains recognizable to a contemporary viewer. art director van nest polglase created an amiable jumble of mews apartments and ramshackle shared backyards that is the perfect backdrop for this picture's collection of artists, strivers, smart-alecks and wannabes. best in the supporting cast is guinn williams, bringing sweetness and light to his role as a prizefighter-sculptor-dressmaker, suggesting the self-invention and fluidity (sexual and otherwise) of life in the village. even more refreshing are betty philson and marianna strelby playing the little girls. plain, intelligent and full of humor, these girls seem like real human beings and are nothing like the professional child actors of the time.of special interest are a couple of memorable comic set-pieces: ray milland's vacuum cleaner demonstration to a woman with a howling baby is played with more spontaneity than one expects (the baby and his contortions are marvelous 'found' moments) and a phony domestic 'play' in a department store window that degenerates into a free-for-all is also fun. the movie slides slowly downhill with a straight-faced custody trial and then never quite gets back on track when the action moves to long island, but this movie is still worth a look.

i bought this a while back, during a massive martial arts movie phase. although this certainly ain't the best, i do love this kind of film making, and there was a lot to keep me entertained in this one. leung kar yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars, i always appreciate the fact that, whilst he lacked formal martial arts training, he usually gave a more than capable fighting performance. he also has a good beard. this movie has him in a good, heroic role and although he doesn't kick as much ass as in some of his other movies, he still acquits himself well. early appearances from cherie chung and chow yun fat are also nice too see, especially for the fact that chow yun fat takes on the bad guys without his trademark gun play. he may not be a great fighter but he does ok. eddy ko is as great a bad guy as ever, he performs the same villainry as in many of his other films and does it great, as per usual. the fellow who plays bu is good too, i don't recall his name, but he's in magnificent butcher too. although the fighting isn't as good as other movies of the era, the postman fights back makes up for it with a lot of imagination, quality cinematography and a nicely quirky ambiance. there are some very nifty scenes, good characters and a good eclectic mixture of hong kong talents all coming together to decent effect. all in all, i would recommend this to kung fu and general hong kong action fans. it may not be a stylised classic like the shaw brothers films, or as crowd pleasing as jackie chan or bruce lee, but it is rock solid entertainment.

i am a huge fan of the $5.50 dvd bin at my local walmart. hopefully you have one at your local branch. you can find a bunch of campy flicks, a bunch of trash, and the occasional surprise. this movie is one of the surprises. my friend recently bought this one, and in thinking it would be another cheesy kung-fu laugh riot, i was genuinely surprised at how good it was. i watch a lot of movies, and as a result, i can almost always call how a movie will turn out; and if there's a plot twist, what it will be. not this movie! the directing is brilliant, the plot is awesome, and the fighting is unbelievably inventive. if you see this one sitting around somewhere at a dirt-cheap price, get it! if you see it at full price, i would still recommend it.

freely, from one scene to another, from one story to another, just like when walking, from a shadowy path to an open place, like the wind in the leaves, from a tree to another, how many different sounds ? just like when traveling, people meet and tell their stories and then part forever, who knows ? and just like when walking through these places full of the lost expectations from another time, the human 'thickness' of the world takes the breath away.i saw this movie with friends of mine, not all of them liked it, maybe were they too used to scenario-based and ready-made stories, i don't know. so this movie is for the silly ones who love looking at the sun sparkling on the sea, walking without any hurry in the hills or through the little villages, listening to the growing grass, which tells the stories of those underneath, six feet under, in the warm wind of summer.

in august days/dies d'agost marc recha has given us a sun-saturated catalan documentary-style road movie that's mostly a meandering improvised meditation on brotherhood and reclaiming the dead. the beautiful sometimes large-scale, richly atmospheric 35 mm. landscape images, nice soundtrack and catalan-language narration are enchanting as a mood piece, if one is content with a trajectory that hasn't much momentum and doesn't lead anywhere in particular. filmmaker marc recha and his non-identical twin david are the stars and the narrative is voiced by their younger sister. marc had been researching the life of ramon barnils (1940-2001), a socialist editor who had been a family friend. he felt he was saturated with information and had to take a break. the break turned into making this film, which seeks to capture the mood of the interviews with barnils' associates, thoughts about the spanish civil war, the drought season they were experiencing, the rugged landscape, the recha brothers' affection for each other, swims and suntanned nudity and whatever characters or stories they ran into as they camped out of their van. this leads to pursuit of a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers. in the end david has to go back to barcelona to be with his daughter and marc has to return to his project, and there it ends. i found it fascinating to listen to an extended narration in the catalan language with its blend of spanish and french-sounding words (perhaps linked with provençal?). this isn't a major film but it commands attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its clean visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing around with genres and blending autobiography with fiction and documentary in a fresh and thought-provoking way.an official selection of the 2006 new york film festival at lincoln center.

this is the fourth full-length feature film by marc recha. by the third 'les mans buides' -empty hands- i promised myself not to cut my veins anymore. but this time round the plot is completely different -a kind of homage to ramon barnils (sabadell 1940 - reus 2001) a catalan journalist-. the visuals in the trailer are stunning -a gleaming river bathed in sunlight- and the promise that marc himself would be in front of the camera with his twin brother -none of both professional actors- convinced me at last, six weeks after its release. abandon yourself in this very unusual road/river film. learn almost nothing about ramon barnils but his most poignant legacy: his constant fight against amnesia of what we catalans chose to forget. 'la batalla de l'ebre' -look for battle of the ebro at the wikipedia- was lost not once but twice because after 40 years of silence and 25 years of half-hearted democracy nobody has done much to remember the legitimate side of the spanish civil war and those who fought it. this film is about the lonely people roaming the same places with very little conscience of what took place there 70 years ago. this film is about the landscape.

thank goodness not all dutch people are that ruthless. i think jason is being judged like that by most people, simply because he has a famous father. maybe he's not as great as some of those actors, but he's definitely not as bad as suggested. i watched the movie some years ago, and i actually loved it. i knew jason from other movies and of course robin of sherwood. but i must say i really liked his acting from this movie on. it was really good!during the movie, i actually forgot he was the son of. sean.. who?and if you're a shakespeare lover, i can recommend this movie. i'm sure you'll enjoy it!

what do you mean son of actor, not an actor. you don't become an actor just because your daddy is a superstar---it doesn't work that way, not in uk at any rate.macbeth (this version) is a low budget scottish movie. you can't compare this to the polanski version because polanski has all the budgets in the world. jason acted throughout school, but his big break came in 1985, when he landed the role of robin hood in britain's "robin of sherwood" television series. he has appeared in many films since then, including "shanghai noon" and "lord of the rings 2″. jason has since moved behind the camera, forming the production company, unconditional entertainment. he recently wrapped filming on his latest movie, which stars cuba gooding, jr. and ray winstone. and all this has nothing to do with being the son of sean connery. if you think jason said to sean, "daddy, i wanna be in macbeth movie that they are going to film," and sean said, "sure, son, whatever you say," and made a phone call and got his son the role, you are mistaken. in fact, jason connery is being cut out of his father's will. seeing as how his father is sean connery, that's a big chunk of change jason will be losing out on. the reasoning behind the decision is apparently sean's strong feelings that his only son should learn to provide for himself. the relationship has become fairly strained, with jason even threatening to change his name. ------------------------------------ of being the son of sean connery,"i realize that i'm always going to be compared to my father. there are innuendos all the time. should i spend my whole life justifying myself?" ------------------------------------so stop being a jackass and accuse him of not being able to act just because he is son of sean connery (big deal!).watch jason in bullet to beijing and you'll form a different opinion about his acting ability.

every review i have read so far seems to have missed a crucial point. shakespeare wrote for the accent and the pronunciation just as he did for northerners in other plays. the scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of the language and affects profoundly what is said and the way it is taken. so, listen again and note the difference. the play is well done and the rhythm of the words are so much better than that provided by people using received, polite, well- enunciated english. i am reminded of the time a teacher in a school in leicester, unknowingly, asked me, age 14, to read a piece of walter scott which was written in the tone of the border. i come from the border and when i read it as it should be read it made all the difference.

excellent performance. there still are good actors around! also great directing and photography. very true to shakespear, and a 'must' for all shakespear fans. macbeth (jason connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)he gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting. helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil. if you love death and decay, and shakespears lyrics... this is the one.

what about dj cash money??? this film fails in part by not covering the mid to late 80s. there was only a small mention of dj cheese in 86.also, it's grandmixer "dst", not "dxt"!!!!!

...scratch it. just as african's created rhythms with the jawbone of an ass and virgin islanders welded oil drums into ear pleasing steel bands, so did urban dj's itch to scratch in the pursuit of new methods of creative expression. "scratch" is a wholly unnarrated documentary which will take you to the heart of the hip-hop/rap movement and explore the genesis of turntablism, the art of scratching vinyl, and the ultimate dj/mc contempo entertainment expression. the film reveals some surprisingly intelligent and articulate "scratchers" with startlingly unique abilities in concert and competition where the beat meets the street. good stuff for anyone interested in grass roots or ghetto gutter movements in sound art. (b)

just saw this film at resfest and was floored. i've never been a huge fan of scratching, but this film had me hooked from the getgo. it's listed as a documentary, but never really felt like one. (can't remember the last time i had so much fun watching a documentary). it has a style and an energy that is refreshing, insightful, and never too preachy. the production values were up there too. (shot on film with cool cuts and an amazing soundtrack). overall a smart, entertaining, and enlightening piece.

wow - most of the audience just seemed to shake their heads through much of this documentary at the sheer wizardry displayed on screen.the shift from the early days as a new-york based black-american phenomenon to current days as a racially diverse subculture (and largely west coast-based) is profiled well.the humble turntable is not given the respect of any traditional musical instrument, but it can be so much more versatile and technically complex. these djs take the required skills for any musical instrument - dexterity, rhythm and timing, among others - and apply them to a new technology with several more variables.dj qbert's comment that he pictures what "music" must sound like on advanced planets and then works it out, seemingly silly at first, makes more and more sense as you watch these guys go and spit out a multitude of sounds that no single traditional instrument could ever create!some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain 'stars' and squanders an opportunity to profile the wider hip-hop culture. one film at a time people!

this film is essentially for those who have had little or no introduction to hip-hop, specifically turntableism, as was the case with the director before he started this film. it was cool to have it focus on the bay more than expected, because ny is always getting all the credit, but comin from the bay the q-bert worship is a little out of control. this film didn't introduce anything new to me, but it did change my opinion in that going into it i was sketchy about the prospect of giving the tables the distinction of being a bona fide instrument. this film ought to convince anyone that it's right up there with the viola and clavichord.

wonderfully funny, awe-inspiring feature on the pioneers of turntablism. dj shadow and q-bert are amazing in this terrific documentary. check out just about every major dj crediting their getting in to scratch thanks to herbie hancock's post-bop classic 'rockit', and archival footage of some of the most complex and mind-blowing turntable routines of all time.

scratch is a documentary about djs and their art of scratching. from that one line description of the film you would have no idea how entertaining and educational this little film is. it is a joyous and vibrant celebration of a cool subculture which is little known. it's filled with great underground hip hop music and you get to see some top djs (e.g. dj q-bert, dj shadow, and mix master mike from the beastie boys) showing off their stuff. going into the film i wasn't sure that "scratching" can really be called an art form, or that the turntable can be viewed as an instrument in its own right. scratch completely changed my mind on these points. what these guys do with their turntables is truly amazing--it is definitely some kind of art--and the turntable, if you know how to use it, can be transformed into an instrument that you can "play," as much as a drum or a guitar. and you even get a lesson on the basics of scratching from dj q-bert (e.g. how to use the fader to get different sound effects). all these djs in their own way were inspired to take up the art of scratching after watching herbie hancock perform his song "rock it" (you remember that song, don't you?) live at the grammys. what got their attention was not hancock himself but his dj and his scratching. not only is scratch about scratching, but it does some "scratching" of its own thanks to the creative way in which this documentary is shot and edited. there are moments where clips are quickly "rewound" and then "forwarded" several times, which mirrors (in the film medium) what happens when a dj quickly moves the record on his turntable back and forth while using his fader (that "wicka-wicka-wicka" sound). whether you're a fan of hip hop or not, you can count on scratch to give you a very enjoyable night at the movies. after seeing it, i had an itch to go buy a turntable of my own. and i mean this as a compliment.

being a huge fan of hip-hop and turntablism to begin with, i always knew i would like this film. however, i wasn't prepared for just how good the documentary actually is. it covers almost all the important aspects of the only element of hip-hop which has been there from the very start. the "story" begins in the early 70's, and follows the evolution of turntablism as an art from up until early 2000 (turntablism aficionados will point this out as significant).the editing is nigh on perfect throughout the film. aside from the excellent visual "scratch" techniques which they used, the rapid cutting between interviews and the stock footage is excellent, giving the film pace when it is needed. the sound editing is also very good, with some nice sweeping sounds being used to help with transitions.the absence of a narrator was also welcome. we aren't taken by the hand through the story, and as a result the audience is able to make their own assumptions easier. each dj adds another side to the story, and it is so interesting to hear about the unknown stars of hip-hop, especially those who were there when hip-hop was being shunned left, right and centre by the music business.although there are many excellent things about this film, i do have a few gripes. the biggest of these is the absence of several notable djs, such as ca$hmoney and jazzy jeff, and also djs from outside america, such as scratch perverts and dj noise. however, if you watch the commentary on the dvd (something which i highly recommend), producer and director go in to great depth about how they regret not being able to feature them. the deleted scenes contain many interviews with ca$hmoney, jazzy jeff and the scratch perverts.this is definitely the best documentary i've seen on hip-hop culture and music. it does stop short of showing the true potential of turntablism; for that i highly recommend checking out the dmc and itf videos. however, that is a minor quibble. i highly recommend this movie, not least for the phat soundtrack, with excellent music throughout. (9/10)

the omission of jazzy jeff, the creator of the chirp and transformer scratch, raised a few eyebrows, but it's good to see he made it to the extras of the dvd after all. with scratch, doug pray, who previously chronicled the grunge phenomenon of the '90s in hype (1996), made an excellent documentary about the world of the hip-hop dj and the evolution of turntablism. his latest documentary, infamy (2005), explores contemporary american graffiti culture. after a couple of viewings four years ago, my dvd had been gathering dust ever since, but recently i watched it again and besides the subject material, i was surprised how well-shot and edited this documentary actually is. an immensely enjoyable soundtrack as well and not just talking heads, but lots of music, old school footage, parties, break dancing, you name it. one of the best things about the film, is that it mainly examines where the art of turntablism is today (in 2001 that is), without disregarding the pioneers of course. good stuff.camera obscura --- 8/10

i saw the original rough screen showing 4 times at gencon a couple years ago. i was delighted to have done so, my daughter is in the movie.i stood in the back of the room with her watching the much younger fans sit on the edge of there seats, dead quiet no wanting to miss a line. the standing ovation afterward's was like watching the fans when the usa hockey team beat the russians at the olympic games in montreal.i love excellent comedy and sight gags. taxi, barney miller, cheers, frasier and married with chilren are my all time favorite comedy shows. lesser shows i will not even watch.this movie will do for gamers what animal house did for college frat days, what dodge ball did for weird sports. forget the lack of a mega budget backing the production. this is pure art, it's that good.i could not be happier for the entire cast and production company.

best fan boy movie i've ever watched save "free enterprise."in some ways it reminded me of an early kevin smith film.if you do any kind of role playing, this movie will likely have you laughing often at its insatiable fun. don't expect a big budget here, the acting is also questionable at times, but it really adds to the fun of the atmosphere they create. the script is truly humorous with a lot of witty moments worth experiencing.the bard that always gets killed had me rolling. the sexually confused player also had me smiling a bit too. but in the end... it was just a great movie showcasing some better moments in the lives of a few geeks having a great time with role playing.if you are bored, and ever got into role playing, this will do nicely for a distraction. a real unexpected treat.

there are few films that have had me waiting and waiting for release more than this one. this is the latest film from the dead gentlemen group responsible for the original gamers film and the demon hunters films. this group has not been terribly active over the last few years but this film is a definite reason to try and keep things up in following their progress.this film follows a group of gamers who are trying to finish a campaign run by a gm frustrated by his group's disregard for his story. with the help of some new blood they attempt the campaign again with hopes of finishing this time.this movie is a breath of fresh air in the movie community and a great improvement over the original. the movie shows respect for the game much like the original movie did but on top of that this movie shows a dramatic improvement on special effects launching it above the simplicity of college films. the acting is fairly decent and the jokes are quite funny.unfortunately many of the jokes are in jokes so if you are not a gamer you may not find the film as funny as others. so this is why i give the movie an 8 instead of the 9 that i initially thought of. any case if you are a gamer or know about gaming check this one out you will enjoy it.

i was laughing so hard most of the time i had people glaring at me because they couldn't hear over my laughter. i literally fell out of my seat at a specific point.i'm a bartender and bouncer for a living in the real world (note my use of the term real world, sadly it always has to come first), and whenever i tell someone i play rpg's, it's usually followed by one of two questions: 1. what, like d&d? i played that back in junior high.2. really? i've been looking or a group forever! have room for another? very rarely do people not know what d&d and gaming are.that having been said almost every person who watches this movie can get something out of it. even if you aren't a gamer, chances are there is something in your life you "geek out" about that can be made fun of in a light hearted way, and that alone means you can relate to the hijinx in this flick. it's just light hearted happiness in an hour and a half.

this film is so wonderful it captures the gaming life. i laughed so hard while watching this. the movie is about a gaming group that have a hard time with a campaign that their dungeon master came up with. the movie switches from the real world and the gaming world as they play the campaign it shows them in the gaming world as their character, and then switches back to the real world when they are not playing. the campaign is the basis for a module that the dungeon master, lodge, is writing. the problem is lodge can't finish his module because the characters can't finish the campaign. they are more for killing and looting instead of role playing. lodge wants them to role play through the campaign something they have never done before. they decide to bring in some extra help so they bring a,wait for it, girl in to play. lodge also makes a npc, a non player character, a paladin,who can not witness or do wrong, to play. the film is how they do all this and more i don't want to spoil any of the film so i won't say any more. this movie may not be a big budget film the acting may not be oscar worthy but if you are into gaming or into dungeons and dragons then definitely watch it. they had a lot of fun making this film and it shows i am not going to bash on it for any movie problems such as continuity or any thing it was a low budget film that is just fun. there is some slap stick comedy which i enjoy and some damn good writing in my opinion. so if you want a fun film try it .

this groundbreaking film is truly a work of art. i went into the screening at the convention in indiana with very low expectations, having already viewed 2 other film with "gamer" in the title (both of which were so bad that by the end of the second one i had plucked out one of my own eyes with my drinking straw and a twisted paper clip i found between the seat cushions). but from the opening credits "dorkness" had me. the temperate northwest setting made a beautiful backdrop for the drama surrounding the frustrated game master, lodge(powerfully portrayed by nathan rice) and his misfit band of friends who set aside the real-life dramas they face everyday to face fantastical dramas in the setting lodge provides for them. after the first scene(set in the fantasy world they inhabit) they are violently thrust back into the world they so desperately try to escape. this drew so many comparisons to my own life that i was moved to tears. rice's acting is of such amazing caliber that i truly believed within the first 20 minutes of the film that he really was a twenty-something male suffering from frustration, male pattern baldness and an annoying group of "friends" that can't seem to grasp concepts like right and wrong. lodge's friends are of some note here: leo, the oldest and heaviest of the trio seems to be the only other character with a job, aside from lodge. yet he seems to gravitate socially towards gary, the youngest of the group. this seems only slightly odd at first until you realize that gary is, in fact, a sexually confused sociopath with very few prospects outside his "fantasy" world. this dichotomy serves, not to confuse, but to inform and uplift the audience about the importance of diversity in our society. my only complaint about this is that the actors who portray leo (scott c. brown) and gary (christian doyle) seem to play the characters for laughs at times, as though they were informed they were acting in a comedy instead of a hard-hitting action/drama. speaking of action, brian lewis makes his film debut as cass, the third and most influential member of lodge's motley crew. the tension is always high when he is on screen, both when he is arguing passionately about his beliefs to lodge or when displaying his fantastic martial arts skills as "silence" his fantasy character. or even when he turns around suddenly to face the audience and you reflexively duck in the audience so as not to get smacked by his fantastic chin. lewis lights up the screen no matter what he's doing and i hope to see more of him in the future. once the action begins in this movie, it just doesn't quit. the drama and the action blend so seamlessly at times that you can's tell whether your in the middle of a frenetic action sequence or a touching dramatic moment. truly a thrill ride of epic proportions, i would recommend "the gamers: dorkness rising" as required viewing for anyone who loves film. it was almost worth losing an eye over.~chip deedlenick

better than the original, "the gamers: dorkness rising" manages to pull off a funny comedy with good acting, fine special effects, and comedy that transcends the "gamer" knowledge-base and do so on a low budget. i've seen many low-budget films that have been terrible and almost none that have been as good as their high-budget counterparts. this film blows most mainstream movies away! parts are a bit weak (the bit with the pirates and ninjas -while funny- goes on a bit long without explanation and takes you out of the movie for a bit) but, overall, this is a very strong film.i'm very happy to say that i bought this film as soon as i saw it and brought it home.any chance we can look forward to another feature gamers movie from these guys? :)

just got back from the european premiere of the gamers: dorkness rising.all i can say is that if you are a gamer (crpg, rpg or larp), then this movie is for you. and if you're not a gamer? well, it's still a great deal of fun.the acting is certainly not oscar-worthy, but in the whole element of the movie it adds to the charm. the humour is everywhere, along with some very nice touches (the tribute to gary gygax is especially well done, if you can spot it). the cast are very down to earth in their appearance, befitting the fact that they are ordinary people enjoying an ordinary hobby.the quality of the movie's sound and vision are adequate, but again, it all just adds to the atmosphere that helps to define this movie as being the dungeons and dragons movie, written and performed by gamers for gamers.not afraid to use terminology specific to one system, they still manage to allow product placement to be a part of the movie, but in a very understandable and utterly fair manner. it also touches on some of the perceived prejudices that some gamers can have about other gamers and deals with that quite well.all in all the movie is very much driven by an well-thought-out equal balance of character, plot and entertainment (the bard is amazingly good value-for-money).in the end it does make scoring this movie quite hard, so i have given it 2 scores.score (for non-rp'ers): 7/10 (a few moments could go way over your head, but the main sections of the movie just work so hard and achieve so much more.)score (for rp'ers): 10/10 (everything fits together, in the perfect quantities, and with the perfect charm and sentiment)

dead gentlemen productions has put together a film with amazing production values considering their budget. anyone that has ever played any role-playing game, particularly any fantasy rpg (they play dungeons and dragons in the movie) will love this movie. brilliant performances all around--especially with regards to the dual nature of the principles, playing their players and their characters. anyone who has ever filmed or acted in a student film will appreciate the amount of work and love they put into this project. this movie (and its prequel) is to fantasy movies and role-playing games what blazing saddles is to westerns--parody of the highest order. i only have a couple minor complaints about the movie itself, none of which will prevent me from buying the dvd as soon as it's available (only 6 more weeks--i'm counting the days): 1. when lodge is talking to joanna about joining the gaming group, he hands her a copy of the dungeons and dragons players handbook and says "this will tell you everything you need to know." the camera hovers too long on a shot of the book, and the moment really seemed like a commercial.2. the jokes are hilarious, but they seem unevenly spread throughout the movie. the last third of the movie, after the almost continuous barrage of visual and verbal humor preceding it, slows down a bit, as if the narrative was catching up with the jokes. odd, but blazing saddles always struck me that way as well. . . and i love that movie, too.one of the narrative strengths of the story is the unresolved nature of the romantic subplot. will joanna become the gm's girlfriend? will she go back to cass? or will the three maintain a platonic friendship, deepened by the camaraderie of role-playing? (yes that sounds sappy, but there are a couple of saccharine moments, particularly when cass and lodge "make up" at the end.) but the movie spans one week: in terms of human relationships, those questions could not be answered in a week. the fact that the characters' relationships are left undefined strikes me as better than the more classical choices you see in most movies, like the girl gets her prince and they move into the castle, or the prince sinks into the north atlantic after three trite, tedious, and predictable hours. the writers really seem to have a grasp of the psychology of the characters, and you can see the characters (both the gamers and the player's characters) change over the course of the movie, but not suddenly, and not unbelievably. i would love to hear more wisdom from brother silence. "the man who stands out in darkness is. . . fluorescent."

i saw this at the screening at gencon in indy. i had some time to kill and decided to check it out. it played to about 1000 people in a packed standing-room-only ballroom.wow, what a ride! the script was tight. the action tense. the pacing perfect. the character exposition excellent. one thing i really appreciated was that you knew going in that this wasn't a big budget film. yet it soon became obvious that the creators pushed their sets and effects as far as they could despite their limitations. and it was more than enough. it's true that this film was targeted at a certain audience - gamers/tabletop players - the creators make no effort to hide that. but other filmmakers could learn a lot from them. for in going for the jugular in scene after scene and not worrying about if mom who happens to be watching will "get it", they got the biggest laughs time and time again. but there's enough universality there that mom will be laughing too, even if she's not in on every joke. i think too many times i see films that try so hard to lower the bar to the lowest common denominator so that they will appeal to the most people, but the movie just ends up suffering for it.but not this flick. indeed, this film was so solid that it had the audience wrapped around it's finger from the opening credits. and, while the viewers around me *really* wanted to like the film, they weren't pushovers - gamers can be among the most critical niche out there. i'm so glad i got to see this in a big crowd. at least 10 times the audience was having such a good time that they erupted into applause at a joke or scene during the film. how often does that happen at screenings? it should be no surprise that there was a huge standing ovation when the closing credits rolled.for my own part, i can't wait for this to be released. after it ended, one of the producers said they were shooting for a simultaneous tv/dvd release. that date cannot come soon enough.

i'm new to gaming, but i would have started much sooner if this film had been around! i caught it at gen con last year (a trip made only as a favor to my husband) and loved it! even to a non-gamer like i was at the time, it's funny and accessible--so much so that i finally relented and started sitting in on my husband's gaming group.i don't want to give away any plot details, but if you're a gamer, you need to see this film--and if you're not, you're going to have a great time despite yourself. there are certainly "in" jokes, but the vast majority of the film is accessible to anyone.my only complaints: wish it were longer and wish it were available on dvd. soon, perhaps?...

i am definitely not a gamer, but a couple people in my family and my boyfriend are. so, a little reluctantly i decided to find out what the big deal was with "fantasy stuff". i saw dorkness rising and thought it was hilarious! it's slapstick, but not disrespectful to those that enjoy role playing games. also, and most importantly, people who've never gamed before can enjoy it and not feel left out or lost trying to understand the plot. the acting was great and the field shots/set were believable. this makes me want to see other movies by this production company. i can't wait to see what the future holds for this group! three cheers - well done!!

i had heard about "gaming" and "dungeons and dragons" before, but i had know idea it could be like what i saw in the "gamers: dorkness rising." these guys are so funny and fun to watch. especially the guy who plays the "bard" or "minstrel" or whatever, he has a gift for physical comedy and timing. there is so much background humor and energy in some of the scenes that make you really think that at least some of it was improvised there on set. the special effects needed to be worked on a bit, but i saw it at a convention last year and thats one of the things they said they were going to redo and make better, so it's probably wicked now!

i will like to order this movie for the women in treatment. i feel that this is a great movie for them to watch. i can't fine it no were i have been on ebay and all the other website to order this movie. now i am asking you for help to fine out where i can oder this movie at or what to do to get one. i will love to show this movie. yes i was like this movie and a lot of peoples here in treatment in to see how people can change there life around and move on. i think markie post played that move very well she is a great actor i love her movies. and if you have any other movie about addiction i will like to order them of the treatment center of women and men so that can look at other people go through what they go through in life.

based on a true story . . .the premise of this film is to illustrate that through fairly normal events its possible for an outwardly 'decent' mother to get drawn into heroin addiction.***semi spoiler*** some of the scenes are fairly inaccurate - whilst others almost make you want to get the 'fix' yourself.computer technician/graphic artist woman with good relationship with her young teen kid spirals into addiction after work colleague, who is a 'chipper' (-someone who can take + enjoy it now and again - ) then spirals into an addiction that leads her eventually to scoring off 'street' dealers after losing contact with her steady dealer.the scenes that show her coming down and getting 'sick' are often very real - especially the first real 'night sweat' prior to all these events she began a relationship with a guy who just happened to have lost his wife to the bottle, and insists he has an inner radar not to get hooked on such women. some radar! however after after some late turn ups and weird behaviour, the boyfriend challenges her as to 'what is going on' his radar begins to get more with it and demands that she empty out her bag; she hits the roof and storms out.because of the excellent and open relationship she had developed prior to this tragedy, he is the first to 'find' some real evidence in her bag; he then looks around the hose for her 'stash' - apparently his sensibility is from school lessons on drug taking - and when he discovers a large stash in the bathroom he flushes it! not a happy woman when she takes her next bath and its 'disappeared'.the kid keeps one back and places it on the meal table - she then goes into further denial - admits it and says its no worse than dope.thge kid does all the right things and calls her friends and generally puts her in a position where she has to come 'clean' - if you'll pardon the pun.the movie takes the viewer through some pretty arduous situations where danger is not far away.eventaully she gets help from a professional organisation and does cold turkey - you'll have to watch the film to see what happens next . . . .

i loved this film! markie post is really great in it. i saw it on lifetime, and it's in the same entertaining class as films like: 'the betty broderick story', 'locked up: a mother's rage', etc.... {which, by the way, are also very good, entertaining films!} it's an over the top drama, about a single mother who tries to break away from her middle-class, predictable personality. this movie is just pure entertainment! it doesn't have to be a realistic look at heroin addiction. but, it does show how any "regular" middle class person can (& they do!) get addicted to heroin. junkies aren't just homeless uneducated people on the street. {by the way, if you do watch it, check out how the kid bosses his mother around! spoiled!} 8 out of 10 stars.

i have seen "chasing the dragon" several times and have enjoyed it each time. the acting was superb. this movie really makes you realize how one bad choice at a weak moment can change your life.

this is more than a sat. afternoon special. exremely well written if very low key there is a lot here if you look for it. catch the cat companion/scout for instance. it not only could have been a comic book it should have been a comic book. the comic industry (as well as the film's publicists) missed the boat on this. one of the least know really great films. a great script by john sayles is a strong point but the acting is good as well. probably the best "super hero" film i've ever seen. short on special effects but long on believability. this one's a keeper. i have never seen a dvd of this film but i used to own a vhs version. good hunting

so it might not be entirely historically accurate. and there is little or no real character development. but for jake (son of ridley) scott's first attempt, it's well worth the ticket price.captain james macleane (jonny lee miller looking as good as ever) may be a gentleman, but he hasn't got the money or the clothes to prove it. plunkett (robert carlyle with all his clothes on) is an apothecary-turned-outlaw. the circumstances of their strange meeting involve a dead body, a ruby, and eventually a partnership as the gentlemen highwaymen. as the tag line says, "they rob the rich... and that's it." there isn't really much background, or even in-depth development, but the object seems to be to relieve the aristocracy of enough money and jewels to pay for the two highwaymen's passage to america. one small problem: macleane falls in love. with the chief justice's ward, rebecca (liv tyler). who happens to also have caught the eye of the thief taker general.the plot is original enough, the casting is excellent (especially alan cumming as the drag-queenish lord rochester, carlyle and miller--also together in "trainspotting," they haven't lost their dynamic), the costuming is fantastic, the makeup is outrageous, and the music is hard-edged techno with a strangely classical undertone. jake scott has an eye for light and shadow, a good sense of balance between spectacle and plot, and he isn't squeamish about showing the more unpleasant side of 17th century london. and lucky for us, he likes close-ups of faces, especially eyes. jonny lee miller's eyes. and liv tyler's, too, but hey, who is this movie about? rebecca? no. plunkett and macleane. but there's more to this movie than just pretty faces. at the risk of sounding cliche, it's a fast, furious, and sometimes frustrating ride with the most noble highwaymen since robin hood. decadent, sleazy, and violent, scott's debut film makes for an entertaining evening at the movies.as macleane says, "i was terrific, and it was a bloody good laugh!"

plunkett and macleane is an entertaining, fast-paced and refreshing film. refreshing because, unlike most other period films, it does not strive to give the audience a history lesson or preach pompously - indeed, historical accuracy is all but ignored. this film does not take itself too seriously, and seeks to entertain rather than enlighten. plunkett and macleane is set in the 18th century, yet director jake scott offers a thoroughly 90s take. there's action, sex and swearing aplenty, and in the inevitable ball scene the aristocracy dance to disco beats. jonny lee miller and robert carlyle are brilliant as always, and the rest of the cast, especially alan cumming as a flirtatious fop, are also highly entertaining. the film is visually spectacular in places, and is a mixture of comedy, action and drama, with a love interest provided by liv tyler with a shaky english accent. in short, if you're looking for an entertaining couple of hours, this is the film for you. it won't make you think, but it could well put a smile on your face.

robert carlyle excels again. the period was captured well and the soundtrack, although hearing modern techno in this period piece was a little disconcerting at first, proved to be very well chosen.well worth a watch.

this movie is great. stylish, fun, good acting. i'd seen it described variously as 'lock, stock and two smoking muskets' and 'reservoir fops', both of which are excellent descriptions. the plot is simple, but it does not detract from the enjoyment. carlyle is a brilliant ruffian and miller is an excellent drunken gentleman. the sets and costumes are stunning, and the music and camerawork are refleshingly unusual for a 'costume drama'. sense and sensibility it definitely is not!!!!! my recommendation? go see it, sit back with a huge tub of popcorn and have a damn good time.

this has to be my favourite film. the script is sharp and played to the limit by an excellent miller and fantastic carlisle! sharp wit, excellent narrative and no hollywood polishing; a totally immersible film which has you gunning for the bad guys! stott excels again as the detestable chance, while liv tyler truly beats her other, lighter performances as the excitement-hungry rebecca! the soundtrack may not be known to you by name, but anyone who has ever seen top gear, watched the football or seen any tv action sequence is probably familiar with it, particularly due to craig armstrong's, 'escape' which must allow him never to work again! the soundtrack on first play may seem out of place in a costume drama/action/comedy, but one re-watching shows it is perfectly at home in giving the the script it's drama.my one gripe about this film is that it isn't shown enough on tv! where is it? truly excellent, sharp and classy - you'll not regret watching it - again and again! (exits to switch on dvd player!)

i adore this film. the chemistry between the two leads miller and carlisle is amazing, they spark so well off of each other, creating an unlikely comedy duo. alan cumming is hilarious, his enthusiasm for the role is clearly evident as he camps it up. the acting is superb and it is a genuinely amusing and touching film. not the greatest film ever made, i'll admit, but it is a huge amount of fun, and i would recommend to those who enjoy other gritty brit flicks. includes some of the best british actors, including michael gambon so you can't go far wrong. look out for cameos from david walliams and matt lucas of little britain and rock: profile fame.

when i went to the video rental store, back in the days when dvd was yet next to unknown to me, i had seen all the movies at the store that i was interested in. or so i thought! the man behind the counter told me he had something for me that i definitely would like. he gave me "plunkett and macleane". at first, i doubted it to be any good, but i trusted his advise and... man, i sure am happy i did take this jewel along! this is one of the best adventure movies in years, if you ask me! of course, with robert carlyle as a major part, how bad can a movie get? surely, liv tyler does once more what she's good at and nothing much more: being pretty. but still, you can very clearly sense that the cast apparently had a lot of fun, making this movie.

plunkett & macleane falls into my favourite genre of film (historical action adventure with comedy) which is probably why i rate it so highly.the action centres around a highwayman (plunkett) and a layabout 'gentleman' who gets entangled with him and his schemes (macleane). this leads to all sorts of escapades and adventures which are all tinged with comedy. there is also, of course, a love interest.the rest of the cast is made up of a number of vibrant, larger than life characters who add to the atmosphere of the film and show the excesses of the wealthy at this time.this is an enjoyable film with a fairly simple but worthwhile plot that provides plenty of entertainment.

i tend to like historical (period) films and get new ideas for costumes for my historical group, and a friend recommended this one to me. i like johnny lee miller as an actor so i figured it was worth it, and i was definitely rewarded!! his portrayal as a member of the english noble class was by far more accurate than i've seen in the past. the comedy aspect of it left my sides hurting, the costumes weren't awful, and historically, i didn't wince too much. i also noticed the fact that england didn't have a proper sewage system until much later, but anyone who dose not go deep into the minutae of england's past won't notice nor care. absolutely worth seeing. i highly recommend this movie.

i don't want to write too much about the film but basically it's an action/comedy with a little bit of romance thrown in about two men who come together in unlikely circumstances and become highway men together. fantastic performance by robert carlysle and everybody else involved. a brilliant 'baddy' who really makes you hate him. some great comical lines - actually laugh out loud, amazing action and a great plot. choice of music and ambiance all fantastic, basically brilliantly directed and brilliants written. i recommend this film to anyone who likes a good british movie or a good bit of action, i don't know why the film never took off, i thought it got no where near as much recognition as it deserved. if for nothing else, watch this film for one of the greatest finale's of all time. not to give anything away, but this one really get's the heart beating!

this movie was over-shadowed by 'the jackal' (bruce willis, richard gere) which was released the same year. having seen both films, i can honestly say this is the superior film.granted, the production value of 'the jackal' was very good, it probably had a substantially bigger budget. however, 'the assignment' is well written and has a fascinating story. aiden quinn is flawless in dual roles. aiden quinn and director christian duguay did a great job of establishing a deep and multi-layered relationship between the title character and his family. i particularly liked the ending.i was reminded of the jack ryan character in the tom clancy movies. both are naval officers thrown into unbelievably dangerous roles as they covertly work on behalf of national security. and yet, both harrison ford and aidan quinn reveal their respective characters as heros who manage to be both virile and gentle. they have a genuine tenderness and vulnerability in their relationships with their families. what i don't understand is how the opinions of all who have posted on this movie (myself included) can be so much more positive than the luke-warm reception the film has received. this is a movie that has enough complexity and subtlety that it remains compelling after multiple viewings. if you are a fan of espionage-genre films, i recommend 'the assignment' enthusiastically.

this movie is about carlos "the jackal" (quinn), an international terrorist who, by cia agent henry fields's (sutherland) description, appears to maim women and children for the heck of it. at least that's what he says to guilt us naval officer annibal ramirez (quinn again) into taking on the assignment of posing as carlos and setting him up as a traitor in the eyes of the kgb. ramirez is apparently physically identical to carlos but mentally he is his antithesis. he is borne of order and carlos is borne of chaos.the movie isn't all shoot-gun-jump-around action, and that's a good thing. in its first half, ramirez undergoes training to act and think like carlos, and that's actually where the movie achieves its distinction from other run-of-the-mill action flicks. an israeli agent (kingsley), joins fields in training ramirez, and together they appear to take on the roles of parents in the birthing of ramirez's new character. ramirez is taught to dislike the things carlos dislikes, to act on the split second like carlos would, and even to make love like carlos (courtesy of an ex-girlfriend of carlos's). naturally all that he is taught would be put to good use in the later half of the movie. it's a little contrived but quinn gives a riveting performance as a carlos-wannabe.another thing i liked about this movie was that it didn't utilize the much overdone plot point in evil twin movies - you know, the one in which the evil twin insinuates himself into the good twin's family. ramirez's family does come into the picture, but instead they highlight how his new character wrecks havoc on his family life.good chuckle humor is injected into this movie, often coming the acerbic duo of sutherland and kingsley. an exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke involving ramirez's first name (annibal, annabelle, get it?). also overdone was the constant harping by the duo about how powerful and cunning and intelligent carlos is. in my opinion, during the final showdown, the payoff wasn't able to match the build-up.on the whole, the movie was enjoyable. i'm not a big action flick fan but this movie was more intelligent and engrossing than the average action movie and it maintained my attention throughout.my rating: 9/10

once i knew that donald sutherland, (jack shaw/henry fields) was appearing in this film it instantly told me this was going to be a good picture to view. most of sutherland's pictures are full of action and suspense and he can play a rather cruel character and can also be quite charming and kind. in this picture, jack shaw did his very best to be a good guy and a bad guy while he was training a naval office to become a spy who had to change his entire identity and become a different person over night. there is plenty of car chase scenes and plenty of stunt men situations which i would not want to perform. this naval officer lived in a quite community with his wife and was a father, but you would never realize that fact until the film reveals his horrible background secrets which he had to keep from his family and friends. good spy film and great acting by all the actors.

i'm a huge fan of the spy genre and this is one of the best of these films. the assignment is based on a true story, which has been somewhat embellished for the big screen, and it really takes you on a fun ride. the film has a great cast, starring aidan quinn, donald sutherland and ben kingsley.naval officer quinn is a reluctantly recruited by sutherland after a chance meeting with kingsley who believes quinn to be the famous terrorist carlos the jackal. because quinn so closely resembles carlos, sutherland stops at nothing to recruit him because sutherland is obsessed with the terrorist's capture or death.the training sequences are awesome. quinn is really put to the test by kingsley and sutherland, having to withstand attacks from remote controlled snowmobiles, from eating the same food each day, to being drugged with a hallucinogen. he even has to learn how to make love to a woman the way carlos would.the film has some great action scenes with quinn eluding allies because they believe he is carlos and in his final mission when he is to kill the jackal. throughout the film, quinn must struggle with the new personality he has attained versus his own. will he remain as ruthless and free as carlos or will he once again return to his life of a good husband and father? if you like the spy genre, this is a must see. the action is used only to propel the story of this thriller forward; no gratuitous explosions or fight scenes. rating 10 of 10 stars.

throughout the world the unmistakable imprint of the american c.i.a. can be found in many a muddled mess they have left behind. in the beginning, their objectives were simple: spy, remove enemy agents, steal classified information and destabilize unfavorable governments. years have elapse and although their mission remains similar, their clandestine black operations now include domestic spying, discrediting u.s. citizens and infiltrating american organizations who criticize the u.s. government. this movie however, centers on the c.i.a.'s world manhunt for the infamous 'carlos, the jackel.' the film is called " the assignment " and tells the story lt. cmdr. annibal ramirez, (aidan quinn) a u.s. naval officer who bears a striking resemblance to the mastermind of so many terrorist bombings. recruited by jack shaw (donald sutherland) of the c.i.a. and amos (ben kingsley), a special agent from the israeli mosad, ramirez is secretly trained to look, pose, infiltrate the elusive organization and to thereafter discredit the real jackel working for the russians. this film is explosively exciting, and packed with wild chases, killings and inter-country mayhem. quinn is wonderful and surprisingly artistic playing both sides of the war. easily one of his best efforts. ****

2002's the bourne identity is one of my all-time favorite movies. however, many fans of the book have complained that the movie had very little to do with the book's plot.the assignment is the real deal. it's odd that no-one on the "bourne identity" threads has mentioned this movie at all. (well, i jst did.)besides the excellent plot, i personally found this movie to be as good as any espionage movie i've ever seen, with the possible exception of the bourneidentity itself.the action is all completely realistic. i especially liked the protagonists' training regimen, which was very inventive.the feel is dark and gritty. there are a few surprising plot twists. the acting is excellent. if you like this genre, i cannot recommend this movie highly enough.

if you liked the richard chamberlain version of the bourne identity then you will like this too...aiden quinn does this one brilliantly, you can't help but wonder if he is really out there...i reckon he and the other main cast members probably had nightmares for weeks after doing this movie as it's so intense. when i first saw it i was just flicking channels on the remote late one evening..& i got hooked within minutes. look up www.answers.com for ilich ramírez sánchez who is the character that "carlos the jackal" is based on for both... i remember reading about ilich ramírez sánchez's arrest in the paper in 1997. it was front page for weeks, through the trial after his arrest.

i loved this film. it was so intelligent but it also had some great action sequences, without basing the movie solely around them. quinn, sutherland and kingsley all put in fantastic performances and there are enough twists to keep anyone interested. the ending was great as well.

this is probably one of the best thrillers i have ever seen. it has action, but not this bullet-flying, good guys - bad guys, van damme - stallone action, but quick, realistic and nervous action, it has a plot, cause till the very end of the movie you don't know how this is gonna end, it has characters, aidan quinn, donald sutherland and ben kingsley are just perfect, and it has suspense, this movie just won't let you go away before you've seen the end of it.though there are only a few characters, i didn't find it difficult to keep my attention the the story, and as for the story, it's basic (not too tom clancy-difficult, but simple and raw) and realistic.if you're in for a movie with a good story, some action and great acting, watch this and i promise, you won't go away till you've seen the end of it. the very end of it.

i will not comment on the story as such. i agree with most peoples comments that this is a good all round action movie with a well told story and good acting.this film deserves 100% for cinematography for its opening sequence. the opening shot is stunning and i have not yet figured out how they did it. the movie is worth watching for that shot alone! a pity therefore that the dvd that is currently out is just the movie and no information is given as to the making of the film. let's hope somebody comes up with the special edition.and the even better thing is that the opening sequence also becomes the ending leaving you totally guessing! great stuff. a must have for a collector of classic film moments.

i found this movie to be quite enjoyable and fairly entertaining. good characters,good actors and enough suspense to keep your interest throughout. the plot twists might have been a bit much but overall a decent thriller. if you liked this film i would recommend the spanish prisoner, the house of games and no way out.

this is one of the best thrillers i've seen. it's intelligently made and brilliantly filmed, and is one of the few thrillers that creates complex, interesting characters and makes the movie about them, not the action. i would recommend it to just about anyone, especially people who like movies with both style and substance.

christian duguay directed this tidy little espionage thriller early in his career. it plays on tv pretty regularly, albeit with some terrific scenes of violence and sex unfortunately trimmed. i finally got around to seeing the theatrical version on a $3 tape from the local video store. naval officer aidan quinn is recruited to impersonate the notorious carlos the jackal, and gets a little too caught up in the role. donald sutherland ben kingsley play quinn's superiors, with sutherland a true zealot and kingsley as the more level-headed one. the first half of this fun flick shows quinn being trained and indoctrinated. the second half has him out in the field, making love to the jackal's woman and shooting it out with sundry enemies. the idea is to make the jackal look like a turncoat to the russians, and let them take care of the world's most notorious assassin. things don't exactly play out as planned. at times, i almost expected the cast to break out laughing at some of the corny dialogue, but they all play it very straight. in the end, this is one terrific little thriller that deserves your attention. the jackal's former mistress teaching the highly proper and very married quinn to rough her up, lick blood from her face, and then go down on her, alone is worth the price of admission.

it worked! director christian duguay created a very clever action/spy thriller. the actors donald sutherland and especially aidan quinn gave a top performance. what a pity that we couldn´t see aidan quinn in others movies like this one till now. he was simply the best in the role as ramirez/carlos for what he should have earned the oscar. the picture was very nice. the scenes are fast paced from beginning to the end and the story doesn´t let you a chance to get bored. the movie is too underrated and i recommend it to anyone otherwise you will miss something great. believe me you will not be disappointed. that´s why i give it 9/10.

the stunts sequences (as well as the special effects) are brilliant, in this movie. michael scherer must be one of canadas best stunt co-ordinators of all time. the explosion in the café, is a wonderful combination of stunts, special effects and visual effects. the director had an idea, that the crew managed to create on film.besides that; donald sutherland makes one of his best performances in this film.......

this is certainly a quality movie with a classy cast. as far as movies about carlos the jackal go, this one beats bruce willis' feeble efforts in 'the jackal' to a bloody pulp, then spits on them. i am a bit surprised that this movie hasn't attracted more votes, something of a 'sleeper' obviously. a pity because this film is definitely worth a watch. it is clever and never dull. see it, 7/10

slick, tidy, and well-made old school version of how a great international thriller should be made. determined to nail a feared global terrorist who is known as "carlos the jackal", jack shaw (donald sutherland, "without limits", "space cowboys"), a cia operative and his israeli counterpart, amos (ben kingsley, "gandhi", "sexy beast") get a noble naval officer, annibal ramirez (aidan quinn, "music of the heart"), to become carlos and use him in a daring plot to get the kgb to kill the real carlos, because he took an offer from the cia. sutherland and kingsley are both good here, but the movie really belongs to quinn here, who embodies himself here (in a dual role). director christian duguay and cinematographer david franco provide another great asset of the film here with hitchcockian-like suspense and great sights of the world.

from the beginning of the film i found myself laughing trying to keep quiet so i did not wake anyone in the house, this didn't continue so much throughout the rest of the film, i didn't find everything completely "laugh out loud" funny, but still i found certain things quite funny. at the beginning i had to hold in laughter when he drops the very crafty looking hand grenade down his sleeve. then there are scenes where you will just smile, like when the barber falls through a roof into someones apartment, i can see that being quite funny but in todays days and time that has been done quite a lot it didn't feel original, though at the time, i'm sure it was. i loved hynkels (hitlers) bursts of raging german with the nice subtle english translation.the final scene is wildly discussed because, well it's absolutely true, and so very intelligently constructed. though the film is sixty eight years old the final scene is still relevant today, if this doesn't show how great a writer chaplin is, then i don't know what will. the acting in this scene in particular was quite good, the barber transcended the message perfectly and makes you realise the serious nature of the film, at the same time enjoying the humorous side.another element about this film is the fact that this was such a brave film, that almost feels ahead of it's time. of course, chaplin did not know what was going to happen after 1940, he was not aware of the holocaust (obviously), he's also gone on record as to saying if he had of known he would not of made this film. the fact this film is so anti-hitler is interesting, it's more interesting that it wasn't anti-germany which would be very easy to have done back in those times, chaplin could of easily made this a propaganda film, but instead did something more, he made an honest film.i recommend anyone remotely interested in this film to see it, as well those who has studied or is studying hitler and wwii to watch this film. it's entertaining to say the least, it doesn't have an annoying out-dated feel that some films of the time did. unlike most "comedies" this film actually has a message it tries to bring to you, watch this film, you will be better off for having seen it.

with the nazi rise to power in eastern europe in the late 1930's, charles chaplin turned his attention to creating a reaction to it. the catalyst may well have been a propaganda publication referring to chaplin as a jewish sympathizer. in the great dictator, chaplin created a dead-on parody of hitler that is as funny as it is frightening at times. the film traces hitler's experiences in the german army from world war i up to the present day. simultaneously, chaplin plays a jewish barber who dresses like the tramp who comes out of a hospital after a long long time, only to discover how different the world is under nazi rule.paulette goddard, chaplin's wife at the time, plays a young jewish girl whose family is oppressed in a jewish ghetto. jack oakie has a great, oscar-nominated supporting role as a mussolini look-alike (benzini napaloni) who gives chaplin's hitler character, adenoid hynkel, a lot of fits. henry daniell is his usual staid self as garbitsch, chief adviser to adenoid hynkel. chaplin wrote and directed the film and received oscar nominations for his screenplay and his acting. the film was also nominated for best picture.chaplin made the film under tremendous pressure for some obvious reasons and some not so well known. he financed the entire film himself at great risk because of the subject matter, and there were no other major films made regarding nazi germany up to that time. the film spent about twenty-one months in production with chaplin even rebuilding a set and re-shooting a scene to get things right. by the time of the film's release in october of 1940, the war in europe was well under way with hitler conquering one country after another, so the film became much more topical at its release than when production first began.there isn't much plot in looking at the film in retrospect; the film seems more like a series of comedy sketches and/or mishaps strung together to get to a purpose independent of the film itself. several examples of this occur in the last third of the film with the meeting between hynkel and napaloni. the scene is very very funny, but it leads no where in terms of the plot. likewise, the escape of both the barber and schultz simply leads to the mistaken identity of the barber for hynkel in order to give chaplin (through the barber character) an opportunity to pontificate to the audience at the end of the film. on the other hand, what better way to make a point about the misplaced narcissism of aryan superiority than to have a jewish barber mistaken for hynkel? still, the film contains many high comic moments, such as the rally speech, the new war developments (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), the dancing globe scene, the coin in the pudding scene, and the entire scenario between hynkel and napaloni (including the barber chair scene) to highly recommend the film. one can also not forget the risks chaplin took in making his first talking film, an anti-nazi film, and financing the film himself. ***1/2 of 4 stars.

"the great dictator" is, arguably, one of charlie chaplin's most widely-known films. it is notorious for it's blatant satire of adolf hitler and nazism. until watching it, i only knew of it's fame. now i know how much the film deserves it.the film basically shows the exploits of the somewhat clumsy, ambitious, short-fused and impressive dictator of tomania, adenoid hynkel; and with him, his near and dear staff: field-marshall herring and herr garbitsch. also, it entails the exploits of an amnesiac, emotional and often clumsy jewish barber, a veteran of the first world war.stopping with the plot, i would like to say that this film has various qualities that make it both unique and wonderful. while the comedy is decidedly both verbal and slapstick and incidental, the entirety of the film shows how serious it takes nazism or aggressive nationalism as a theme with various interludes. chaplin's impeccable acting skills range far and wide in the film, he keeps revving it up and up until he simply explodes. paulette goddard's position as an ambitious jewish would-be revolter and henry daniell's delivery of a nasal, calm-as-death-serious-as-a-heart-attack lines makes for wonderful viewing.further, one aspect of the film is what makes it so special: it pulls no punches. it isn't "covert", it has no business being covert. it is an "overt", blatant, in-your-face, obvious lampooning of both hitler and nazism.to sum up briefly, watch it. just watch it, you'll see it.

this ingenious and innovate comedy packs many moments priceless and great sense of pace, though overlong. chaplin's satire with several classics scenes , he has dual role as a jewish barber and dictator hynkel, an offensive portrayal of hitler . then the barber is mistaken for the hitlerian tyrant and happen bemusing events. funny and extraordinaries acting of all casting, as the co-stars jack oakie as napolini(mussolini-alike), henry daniel as gasbstich(himmler-alike) and billy gilbert as herring( goering). chaplin's first spoken film is brilliantly photographed by karl struss.this splendid film contains numerous amusing scenes, the funniest are the following : 1) the one when during the wwi the barber-soldier along with a co-pilot are flying in a turned plane without aware 2)dictator adenoid hynkel doing overacting speeches including a twisted microphone 3)hynkel playing with an enormous balloon of the world 4)the jew-barber shaving a man fitting to hungarian dance number 5 of brahms 5) when hynkel and napolini each try to keep his body higher than other in a barber's chair; among them.hitler banned movie exhibition to the germans due to its satire of him, and put him in his death list after his proposed conquest of america.the movie is co-starred by paulette goddard, third of his four wives , they were married in 1936, although no announcement of the marriage was made later, one time finished the great dictator.the picture was released in 1940, when chaplin had survived a moral scandal by a paternity suit but a brush with the house of un-american activities was the signal for the usa to refuse him re-entry from britain and he fled to switzerland.

i once caught about a 20 minute portion of this movie on turner classic movies about 6 months back. i thought every minute of what i was watching was gold, and, because it was somewhere in the film's middle and i didn't want to spoil the whole thing if i were to watch it from the start, i decided that i would rent it immediately. well, the video store which i frequent did not have a copy, so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it. i had previous to that experience only seen some chaplin shorts, funny but not greatly artful, but after i saw the snippet of the great dictator, i checked out three of his other films, city lights, the gold rush, and modern times (city lights was great, i found the gold rush a little overrated, but still worthwhile, and i found modern times to be one of the funniest films i've ever seen (second funniest, behind keaton's sherlock jr., more exactly).finally, the whole of the great dictator. well, to be honest, it had its moments, both of comedy and of drama. but these moments don't always mix well. chaplin's comedy worked well when mixed with melodrama (city lights is the best example of this), but it didn't always work with social commentary. plus, the fact that there was dialogue lessened the impressiveness of chaplin's talent. don't get me wrong, i liked the movie as a whole, but i thought it of little consequence. i would have given it a solid 7/10 on the ratings scale...if not for the ending. the final speech that the jewish barber gives is enormously powerful. yes, it is adressed to the tempora et mores of 1940, but his message is perfectly applicable to the world today. the speech brought me to tears, and i consider it one of the best endings i've ever seen. final score: 8/10.

before i saw this film i didn't really expect to much from it, although my friend advised otherwise. due to this request from my friend i decided i was really going to watch this film. the minute i sat down to view the film i was absolutely blown away. from the credits i was falling of my seat; i just couldn't contain myself. the film is about hitler in all the glory of comedy. hynkel is the absolute double for the jewish barber, who comes back from fighting in the war. due to the heroics of the barber, he manages to save one of the germans and by doing that gets a member of the enemy on board, which helps in the struggle which the jews had. but things went wrong and stolz was arrested, but only then to escape to the confines of the jewish surburb, 'the ghetto'. due to this escape, the german army began searching which meant that the barber and stolz got arrested but again they escaped, only to be mistaken for hynkel and consequently takes his poistion. *****the speech that chaplin makes at the end is fantastic, it complies the morals which society could only dream about. in the speech it contradicts the whole meaning of the film because of the seriouness and sincerenity which it entailed, and it definately works, because i did walk out feeling guilty about how we live our lives, looking at the smallest thing such as being ignorant to someone to the biggest, most prominent things such as war.

here we have the inimitable charlie chaplin forsaking his slapstick past to tackle the serious subject of anti-semitism, and intolerance in general. he portrays two characters - the sweet, innocent jewish barber - a war veteran, and the raving and ruthless dictator, adenoid hynkel. the jewish ghetto in this country is not safe for long, due to the whims of hynkel and his armed thugs, who routinely rough up its residents, or leave them alone, dependent upon his mood that day or week. the barber is among them, but is befriended by his former commanding officer, schultz (reginald gardner), who seems to keep things quiet for a while, until hynkel condemns him to a concentration camp. he seeks refuge with the jews in the ghetto, most specifically the barber, and the feisty young woman, hannah (paulette goddard). the premise will be - who will be the one among these jews to put their lives on the line to get rid of hynkel and his cronies? we needn't guess too hard to know the answer; the barber is a dead ringer for the dictator, and he is outfitted in his image, accompanied by schultz, also in full military gear. hannah escapes with several of her ghetto friends to the country of osterlich, where mr jaeckel's (maurice moscovich) cousin has a farm, and they can live peaceably for a while. at this point, hynkel himself has been arrested by his armed forces, thinking him to be the notorious barber. the latter, meanwhile, has been escorted with schultz to a podium, to make a speech announcing the conquest of osterlich. the ensuing ten minutes is pure chaplin himself, speaking from his heart of tolerance, love and freedom, and denigrating greed and hatred. albeit chaplin started production on the film in 1937, it can be forgiven some naivete. he was allegedly unaware of the gravity of this persecution and hatred, and said had he known the full extent, he would never have made the film, because he most likely believed it would have trivialized the situation. he has a marvelous supporting cast: reginald gardner, henry daniell as garbitsch, his aide-de-camp, the always wonderful billy gilbert as the bumbling herring, paulette goddard, jack oakie as the dictator napaloni, his rival for conquest, veteran european actors david gorcey (leo's father), maurice moscovich, among others. the scene he choreographed with globe, with just a musical accompaniment is sheer, luminous inspiration, and luminous, as well, is paulette goddard at the film's end, smiling through her tears. i have seen this film before, but there is always something new in it for me. last evening, when it finished, i sat there in tears. i defy anyone not to be moved by it.

i was surprised and impressed to find out this movie was released in 1940, before the united states entered world war ii. on the surface, satirizing something as solemn and horrible as nazi germany could be misconstrued as rash. but chaplin's brilliance isn't limited to making a joke out of everything. in fact, the seriousness of his message wouldn't have been nearly as valid if not for the excellent use of humor in this movie along with the moments of stark drama blended in. drama alone wouldn't have had the bite and resonance that this film did. laughing at someone (adenoid hynkel) can be the best way to attack them, while laughing with someone (the jewish barber) can be the best way to love them. in the jewish barber's final speech, i forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago. they are words that have meaning now, and in any time of war. for this reason i believe the film did far greater good than harm, as it still has the same profound effect today.

..this movie has been done when hitler ( and mussolini who is as well in the movie) was at the top and many politics and even the roman church used to close eyes about brutality and evil of nazism. especially in usa there were many people who had not understood what was really going on in germany and europe ( charles lindenbergh for example ).it would be as today a big actor would made a parody of berlusconi or chirac. chaplin maybe made a lot of mistakes in his life, but this is really a masterpiece of humanity and imho a great demonstration he was a courageous man. the movie is funny and deep, the final speech has a terrible strength and is still updated. i think this movie is one of the best ever done.

hynkel, dictator of tomania, is a spoiled child who becomes angry when he cannot gets what he really wants... and what he simply wants is nothing less than the world...in one of the extraordinary scenes of chaplin art, hynkel performs a ballet with the 'world' which bursts when he thinks he has it in his grasp...chaplin also has some biting words on war and war films... in a scene at the beginning of the movie, which takes place during world war i, the tomanian messenger crashes the plane and thinks... he is about to die... in a state of delirium, he begins to say ridiculous words... the empty double-talk continue ascending into a brilliant take off on all the heroic death scenes of war films...in another scene when he becomes a fugitive in the jewish ghetto and assumes command of the resistance fomenting rebellion among the old men, he plans to kill the dictator... one of the group must kill the ruthless conqueror of austerlich... whoever is chosen will naturally die, but his heroic death will be rewarded and his name will shine like a star in tomanian history...the sequence in which he and four other characters eat cream cakes containing coins to determine which shall sacrifice his life to murder the dictator is a bitter hilarity filled with great fear...for all its disappointing shortcomings, "the great dictator" is still a significant movie for the ironic tones of the film adding something that neither chaplin nor anymore else could have given it: the irony of history... the necessity to murder hynkel presages the assassination attempt against hitler by his generals... the force of the original satire is only surpassed by history's imitation of art...with a splendid sequence like the duck-shooting accident which leads to the dictator being mistaken for the humbly jewish barber and vice versa, "the great dictator" is chaplin's first talking movie... this time 'charles' and not 'charlie,' wanting to say more through his movie and not through an amusing comedy, the last in which he uses his celebrated 'tramp character.'

the great dictator is a beyond-excellent film. charlie chaplin succeeds in being both extremely funny and witty and yet at the same time provides a strong statement in his satire against fascism. the anti-nazi speech by chaplin at the end, with its values, is one of filmdom's great moments. throughout this movie, i sensed there was some higher form of intelligence, beyond genuinely intelligent filmmaking, at work.

this film entered production before ww2 began, but was not released until it was well under way. with significant fascist-sympathy in the us, and chaplin himself being suspected as a communist sympathiser, the great dictator was a very courageous endeavour. such risks in film-making - thinly veiled political statements - would be almost inconceivable today. imagine the fallout if someone were to make an equally satirical film today which criticised the usa's foreign policy?this film is hilarious, poignant and tragic. the tragedy is that chaplin makes a plea for the madness to end, but it is already to late - for him and for us. a must see if you have any interest whatsoever in history, film-making, politics or sattire as an art-form.

absolutely fantastic! whatever i say wouldn't do this underrated movie the justice it deserves. watch it now! fantastic!

i loved that the mood was light and airy. i loved that the lead character wanted guarantees about his future, and that his roommate sets him "straight" of all people. i loved that they tackled the dynamics of how the members in the men's group dealt with each other, considering this was directed by a lesbian,the whole theme of masculinity was put out there, ridiculed, dissected and questioned. what makes a man? what makes one straight, gay, or bisexual? you aren't really sure if our lead character has decided on who he really wants; he's living in the moment and thrown caution to the wind. these, and other reasons, make me love this film.

i loved this movie! it was adorably touching and funny. finally, here's a story about a group of people who meet some challenges, flounder a bit, and then decide to just be themselves and end up happy for; when was the last time you saw that in a film? dealing with the fluidity of life, love, and sexuality, the characters are faced with real problems (albeit in often ridiculous situations like the men's group camping trip, and the explicit realatory liaisons) and manage to learn and grow without the movie getting preachy, darkly desperate, or too unrealistic. you'll love and care about the characters who, far from being hollow stereotypes, portray real people with just a touch of the truth behind their would-be labels.a good romcom for a saturday afternoon, and the only movie i've ever seen where sexual fluidity ends happily, and no one is forced to be anything they don't want to be. far better than kissing jessica stein, a good choice if your tired of watching gay movies that have some painful lesson and bitter lesson. or, maybe you just like a good british romp? james purefoy looks dashing as always, and tom hollander is deliciously funny. so go forth, watch, enjoy; you won't regret it!

never have i seen a movie like this; didn't plan on seeing it but it was worth the turn of the tv channel. i am mostly a scifi movie watcher,but i would be more than happy to add this one to my collection. it starts out as a one sided film with a simple love triangle, then became something a little different(can't tell more then that. but it does involve two guys and one girl. juts not the way you would expect). also, this movie starred hugo weaving from the "matrix" and "the lord of the rings" in a role i would not have expected...very funny guy. this movie is playing on here tv, but if you do not have satellite, it is worth a rent. so give it a try; you won't be disappointed.

i saw this film at the boston internation festival of women's cinema last night, and was saddened to hear ms. troche tell us (in her q&a after the screening) that she doesn't expect to see too much us distribution, due to her insistence on including all of the so-called "gay content". it was a fantastically entertaining comedy, and it just seems to me that american audiences might enjoy it in much the same way they enjoyed "the full monty", so it's really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a few shots of two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream theaters. wonderful cast, fabulous script, and of course, rose troche's direction make this one of the funniest films i've seen.

quite a ways away from "go fish". both were good films but troche had a bigger budget and cast to work with here. this film was very entertaining and easy to like. the acting was good lots of slow burn sexual tension.

bedrooms and hallways is the kind of film that makes you realize that the drama of life is hidden in the details. and that drama can be great fun too! even though your own love life and your own friends may not be as unique as the characters in this movie, every one is bound to recognize themselves and others in the colorful protagonists of this film. and that's the great strength of bedrooms and hallways, that the irony of life is that the most confusing things that happen to you can be the most interesting/hilarious/funny/sexy/...things too! hope you'll enjoy the film as much as i have!

it was a fun film to look at. though the chance this happened in your street is small, there are still a lot off recognizable situations that will ring a bell. the simplicity of the film and the humour do work. i must admit that you don't have to see it in a theater; it will do very well on a small tv-set. tip: see it with some close friends.

after a long wait, "bedrooms and hallways" made it to perth cinemas - not a commercial one mind you - and i thought it was fun, honest and took a swipe at those 'tribal scream' groups running around trying to find meaning in rocks and 'what's behind my eyes'. it is playing to full houses over here because it tells a story, has terrific acting and says something about the human condition.

i enjoyed this film immensely, due to pungent scenes (humorous as well as ironic, some even "tragical"), believable performances, witty dialogue and a heartfelt rendering of what it´s like or rather c a n be like to be hetero- and/or homosexual & on the lookout for fulfilment of your desires. i´m aware of the paradox here: homo- a n d hetereosexual.... this is something the film tackles on end, but never uses for caricature. if you´re as open-minded as the people seem to have been who made that film, in the end it won´t matter to you if those who lie in each others arms are of the same sex or not."mr. smith" from the matrix gives an admirable turn as a gay houses-salesman with "strange" appetites here, but that´s not the only thing to marvel at. enjoy.....

by the acting in this movie, it is sometimes hard not to imagine that the cast are who they portray themselves to be. unbridled passion and acting at times make this a very enjoyable and engaging movie. wouldn't even have known about it except for hbo late night. and the biggest reason i like uk films much better than american ones are that the actors aren't afraid to act out what is needed.

bedrooms and hallways gives its audience a look into the mind of a man who thinks he's found himself, only to find out that he's not so sure he found the right guy. if you think that all gay comedies are the same, check this one out. although the movie ends without much resolution, the hilarious one-liners, peculiar situations, and quirky characters are sure to satisfy.

this movie was a pleasant surprise because i didn't expect much. i didn't know that some of the actors have since become bigger stars in major pix. while moving on to the matrix is not a plus in my book (hated it), i'm sure it's a career plus for hugo. james purefoy is great in this and jennifer ehle sweet and wonderful. it seemed sometimes like a carnaby street romp 30 years later but i enjoyed the thrift shop janis joplin clothes mixed up with the modern mindsets of sexual and gender blur. the real estate agent who has an erotic relationship with his listings is loads of fun. the iron john mens' group meetings are a bit dated but i still loved them. it's a social satire sex comedy in the best way and reminds me a bit of the old "carry on" movies. the british know how to do sex comedy and it's an old tradition, unlike the united states which is too prudish to really understand that sex is funny.

i seriously enjoyed watching this movie for the first time some years ago and whenever it gets aired again somewhere (which luckily happens from time to time in european cable television) i experience the same thing, i'm moved, entertained and end up wishing there were more movies like this one.it all deals with leo (kevin mckidd) and his group of friends living in urban london, leo as a gay guy who follows a friend to a hilarious new age men's group and falls for straight guy brendon, played by dashing james purefoy, who turns out not so straight after all. thrown in as side characters are the equally great tom hollander and hugo weaving whose side story alone is worth watching the movie, simon callow as the leader of the men's group, turning in a great as ever performance. but it's really hard to pick some folks out here, because every character, the female ones like jennifer ehle's, julie graham's and harriet walter's as well, are exquisitely acted. maybe even kevin mckidd looks a little pale compared to his co-actors but it benefits his somewhat subdued character.the idea behind this movie is a simple one: there is never only black and white, classifications are difficult and may not always stand the test of time.leo identifies as gay but ends up falling for a woman as well who turns out to be his teenage sweetheart and brendon's long time girlfriend. brendon starts out straight but gets to learn that gay may be more than just an option for him and being bisexual might not be that bad after all. darren and jeremy (hollander and weaving) are gay and loving it and even the straight folks in the movie, like angie, leo's female roommate, get their fair share of love and funny moments up until the end of the movie. the comedy bits(especially tom hollander who's just hilarious) are funny and on point and the emotions are believable, as confusing as they may appear at times reading this summary.what i like about this movie is its genuinely positive notion. whether you're gay, straight, bisexual or simply not sure, this movie leaves you feeling that it's just okay not to be sure and that "not being sure" might be something worth living out as well! sexuality is portrayed fluid in this movie and none of the main characters seem to have a real problem with it, apart from all the gay/straight camp fights that you sometimes get fed with in other gay themed movies. i can only wholeheartedly agree with the subtext of the movie, that what you feel certain of one day, when you think you identify as gay, straight, whatever, can look very different on another. i have never seen (what to call it?) bisexuality or maybe just the absence of the segregating need for sexual classification being portrayed in such a heartwarming and true to life manner. this movie dares going where few movies go, gay or straight movies, by not playing on labels and stereotypical assumption of sex and relying on that. it goes further and assumes that there may be a life to sex after well-known classifications and i think the times are more than ready for that and other movies exploring postmodern themes like this one! and for all others who don't care about that, heck, it's just a funny comedy worth watching on a rainy saturday evening with some popcorn on your hands. give it a try!loved it!

an inspired choice of director for this latest brit-flick, rose troche, who burst on the scene with the budget-free tale of ny dykes, _go fish_ brings a gently jaundiced view to this tale of a londoner choosing the slightly inappropriate milieu of a male bonding society to declare his lust for a fellow seeker of masculine truths. the highlight for me is a scene where the society try to revert to being primitive hunter-gatherers but end up ordering a take-away. the film as a whole is wonderfully acted and troche, who'd never be accepted by some of the lesbians she portrayed in her previous film, relishes the bigger budget by indulging in some wonderfully lingering pan shots that contrast with _go fish_'s grainy hyperkinesis. a really enjoyable film

bedrooms and hallways was one of the funniest films of the 1999 melbourne film festival. from the uk, it is about a young crowd of flatmates and their various relationship dilemmas. much of the humour is centred around a new-agey men's self-help group where they pass around various implements like the 'rock of truth'. they also go on a 'hunter gatherer' weekend with hilarious results. trust me, you'll laugh your teeth out.

the english are a little too evil, the scots are a bit tooheroic. the dialogue is overly dramatic at times, and thetransitions between scenes could be smoother.still, "the bruce" has the feel of authentic, if unpolished,history ... even if it does play loosely with some importantfacts.sandy welch is no gibson or branagh, but he makes a stalwartbruce. and brian blessed chews the scenery in delightfulvillainy as edward i.while lacking the budget needed to make the final battle trulyimpressive, they still marshalled an impressive crowd for theenglish and scottish armies. it is, according to filmmakers, the"largest filmed reconstruction of medieval battle ever staged inthe british isles."allowing for a few failings and shortcomings, the film stilldoes a convincing portrayal.

i suspect there's some revisionist history going on here,but one definitely comes away with the feeling that patrice lumumba was a trouble-maker who incited his people to violence from the moment the congo declared independence.his inability to control his people and his decision to bring in soviet help to get his military back in line was obviously what got the united states involved and led to his assassination.however,by replacing him with mobutu,the united states didn't solve anything.they made the situation just as bad.well-acted with excellent cinematography and a rousing score.definitely worth seeing.

being belgian myself, i take interest in the history of congo. it has been our only colony for many years (rwanda was a belgian protectorate, but not a colony), and it is part of our country's history. nowadays it seems to be very popular to say that all that the belgians did to congo was wrong, especially in the 19th century. i'm not saying that bad things didn't happen. of course they did, but back then this wasn't abnormal. do you really think the french or the brits were that much nicer in their colonies? no, they weren't. it was 'normal' at the time for our king leopold ii to use congo as a way to gain personal wealth. it was his private property (it didn't belong to the state then) and he tried to make the most out of it. of course gruesome things like hands being chopped off happened and yes to todays standards that's inadmissible, but in those days it was common practice. and it has to be said, all this didn't happen anymore during the last decades... i know several people who have lived an worked in congo for many years before the declaration of congolese independence. it's true that they had several black servants, but they are very nice people and i really can't imagine they ever treated them bad. for as far as i know they have always treated them with a lot of respect (however, i'm not saying all belgians did). in fact if they weren't that old now (almost all about 80 years old now) they would love to return to congo.the good thing about this movie is that it gives an historically accurate vision on what happened during the last years of belgian governance and the first years of congolese independence. the story isn't as black and white (perhaps not the best words in this context, but how else to explain what i mean) as i feared it would be. it doesn't say that all the belgians did was wrong and all the congolese did was good. it shows perfectly how the congolese, in their rush of getting independent from the belgians, didn't mind to accept help from the russians as well as the americans, who both had more eye for the raw materials like copper, diamonds, bauxite, rubber,... and getting the congolese in their political 'camp' and weren't all that interested in their independence. it does not only give a good idea of how lumumba became more powerful, but also how mobutu played a double role. it shows the belgian reaction on some of our compatriots being violated, threatened and even murdered (my father was one of the paratroopers who were send to congo to rescue the belgians). it gives a good idea of the political problems lumumba encountered as the province katanga didn't want to be part of the congolese republic, the role that the belgians had in the murder on lumumba ... it all gets it's part in this movie.the story seems to be very accurate and the characters really look and act like the real ones. this movie has been able to give a very good idea of what life in congo in the late fifties and early sixties was like and should be seen by everybody who is interested in the history of the country. but it should also be shown in history classes, especially in belgium, because it's a part of our history that should never be forgotten. i give it a 7.5/10, perhaps even an 8/10.

charlie's wilson's war demonstrates with deft veracity just how futile wars can be, especially to the very people who spend countless hours and finances to fund them. virtuoso performances and remarkably memorable characters teamed with a riotously sarcastic script catapult the film, helmed by the continuously unpredictable mike nichols, to the top of the year's best. politics has never been so much fun.charlie wilson (tom hanks) is a texas congressman who is credited with almost single-handedly winning the cold war. hanging around plenty of drugs, women and scotch, he also takes an unexpected interest in the events in afghanistan and the terrors of the soviet union in the 1980s. enlisting the help of gust avrakotos (philip seymour hoffman) a renegade cia covert mission expert and joanne (julia roberts), a wealthy socialite, he raises money to provide afghanistan with the rocket launchers and antitank weaponry they need to cause serious damage to russian military. eventually by the end of the 80s the cold war would come to an end, and the funds would immediately be cut, thereby removing all help for the fledgling country to rebuild and recoup.the acting is exquisite, although it's to be expected from the more than accomplished cast. a large part of that however, should be attributed to the script, which allows each character to be undeniably well-developed and memorable. and a hearty helping of that credit goes to the novel of the same name, which is hilariously honest. tom hanks delivers yet another unequaled performance as charlie wilson, the man who did so much for so many and yet still remains relatively unknown. philip seymour hoffman plays gust, a character that is vividly boffo in both his physicality and his wry cynicism; the inimitable hoffman once again shows superb range in the characters he portrays. julia roberts is perhaps the only weak link of the film, with her generic snobbish character and not-subtle-enough accent. and then there's wilson's "jailbait" squad of young secretaries that scamper about to keep him happy. led by the always delightful amy adams, each supporting role has its mirthful moments.defeating the soviet union was not an easy task, especially considering the many conflicting goals between the various political leaders. "why is congress saying one thing and doing nothing?" queries a disgruntled politician. "tradition mostly", returns wilson. everyone appears to want the cold war to end, yet a blind eye is being turned to the atrocities taking place in afghanistan. it takes a trip to the war-torn refugee camps in pakistan to motivate wilson, as well as with his main financial source doc long (ned beatty). wilson uses strategic ties with committees to raise funding of weaponry in afghanistan from $5 million to $10 million with a simple command, but the president of pakistan scoffs at the idea of winning a war for such a trivial amount. by the end of the wilson campaign, $1 billion is sent to the mujahedin to shoot down russian helicopters - the first step toward victory, as wilson predicted. beyond the scope of the film, the unresolved turmoil in afghanistan led to further, less ignorable problems, which wilson presumably foresaw.during the course of charlie wilson's war, the main characters travel from the united states to pakistan to afghanistan to jerusalem to egypt, but wherever they go, sarcasm always follows. there's a surprising amount of comedy in the film, considering the political undertones are generally serious. hoffman provides jokes with almost every exchange of dialogue, as does hanks, with his naturally witty woman-chasing ideals. a scene early on featuring gust being continually ushered in out of wilson's office as he tries to straighten out a legal issue with his posse of gorgeous gals ("you can teach 'em to type, but you can't teach 'em to grow tits") reminds me of a slapstick routine from the marx brothers.with the press focusing on the drug allegations against wilson, instead of the important issues of the cold war, and the conflicting desire of officials to budget their help, it's clear that by the end of the film, the politicians are still oblivious to what's really necessary. and since the screenplay is so quick-witted and astute, some audience members may not be able to keep up with all of the dialogue-intensive events. but, as demonstrated by the politicians who are ignorant as to the difference between pakistan and afghanistan, it's essentially another argument to support charlie wilson's point.- mike massie

probably the best comedy in a long time. keeps you laughing nonstop! the acting is good and there are a lot of hilarious cameos such as ben stiller as the guitar store guy. the plot wasn't as good as i had hoped but the comedy makes up for that. i can only hope for a sequel cause it seems like they can still do so much more. even though it was 1 hour and 40 minutes long i still wanted more at the end :) also there is a scene after the credits which is actually one of my favorite parts of the movie!! i suggest this to anyone who loves a good comedy and definitely suggest it to fans of the d or jack black. you should buy the album also, the songs are so damn catchy and hilarious, the music on it is top notch as well.

calling all d-sciples! grab your friends, hit the theater and see the hell out of this movie. from the opening sequence until after the credits you'll be laughing your self breathless. this movie is a wild ride through the history of the d, and not just some bull-crap list of the things they've done, but a chronicling of their rise to power. i am a huge fan of rage kage(kyle gass) and jables(jack black), so naturally i loved the movie. it helps to know about the show they had, and their first cd, but it's just as funny if you don't. from the hilarious and vulgar lyrics, the rocking rhythms, the massive amount of pot smoking, and the cameos, down to the outright insanity that is the story line, this is a movie for d-sciples and newbies alike. many of their songs are referenced, such as two kings, tribute, and kielbasa to their many audio tracks like cock push-ups, every fan in the audience will be saying i remember that as well as new comers saying "that's f'ing hilarious!." i highly recommend this movie to any body that's ever rocked out. this movie is certainly in high competition for being the next "this is spinal tap." one of the best ever.

this film rocks...so hard...the cameos...the drug references...the sharing...the love...the rocking!!! when jack and kyle first met in tim robbins' "actors' gang" theater company years ago, who knew that such a legacy of awesome music and hilariousness would ensue?? all that door to door rocking paid off...although anyone who enjoys classic rock will get a major kick out of this film, i would definitely recommend renting the original 6 hbo episodes at your local video store before going to see the film in the cinema. they're on the tenacious d masterworks dvd, which is available for rent at pretty much every video store. there are some inside jokes in the film that refer to these earlier episodes that will add something more enjoyable to the overall viewing experience...

when i first heard that jack black and kyle gass would make a movie about their band i was freaking out! i love their music and i hoped that this movie would be really funny! now that i have watched it i can't really say that these hopes weren't satisfied but i think i expected more. the movie is full of tenacious d's great music and i really loved listening to all of it. there are a lot of great jokes and i just love the story, at least the first bit. i don't like the way the movie ends. the ending is very abrupt and in my opinion they could have extended that a bit more.overall i think it is a good movie to watch! everyone who likes rock music should watch it! it'll give you a good laugh!

i am a huge tenacious d fan, and i think this is not the funniest movie in the world, but the most entertaining. it's not laugh-a-minute but that's not what the d intended it to be. i went into the movie seeing all the hbo shows, memorized both albums, and that made it even more enjoyable. plenty of inside jokes from past tenacious d albums, and hbo shows. since i knew the new album already, i knew 40 minutes of the movie because it is a musical comedy. i would say it has the best first 5 minutes of any movie and the best last 5 minutes of any movie. hands down.see this movie now!

tenacious d: in the pick of destiny tells the fictional tale of the formation of the band tenacious d and their quest to find the pick of destiny, a guitar pick with supernatural powers made from the tooth of satan himself (played by dave grohl). jb (jack black) and kg (kyle gass), joined together by fate, must travel to the rock n' roll museum and steal the pick of destiny to become the greatest band on earth. the movie is hilarious and delivers non-stop laughs. jack black and kyle gass work perfectly together, having been real life friends and co-workers for over 20 years. the film is in part, a musical. all (or most) of the music was written and performed by the d. all of the songs are new material and many of them are classic. the soundtrack is definitely worth checking out. this film will be mostly appreciated by fans of tenacious d, but if you are not a fan of the d, i still think you will enjoy the movie. if you are a fan of the d, then you must see this movie. the acting isn't as bad as you may think, and the laughs and crudeness never stop coming. i highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to get their socks rocked off and laugh as hard as they have laughed in a long time. look out for cameos by dave grohl, ronnie james dio, meatloaf, ben stiller, amy poehler, tim robbins, john c. reilly, and neil hamburger. also, stay tuned for an extra scene after the credits.
