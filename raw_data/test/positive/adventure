i am a huge fan of harald zwart, and i just knew that i had to see this movie, even though i can't say i'm a soccer fan. but watching this just filled my heart with joy, and i had a great time in the movies watching it.bjørn fast nagell does a tremendous job directing this movie, and even though you notice the main characters are new at acting, they grow with the movie and makes it what it is. even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie, there is surprisingly little soccer in it. the whole idea is to show the six guys making up the word n o r w a y on their trip to the world cup in soccer playing in germany this year. if you're only gonna see one norwegian movie this year, this is the one..

this was one of the few norwegian movies i actually looked forward too see. it started of as a few commercials with a motley bunch at football matches. then they made a movie out of it. the leads are not pros (and you can see that) but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me away.norway is known for making crappy movies (no offense)but i had a good feeling about this one. even thou i'm not interested in football i wanted 2 see it. the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep piling up. there are loads of cameos from norwegian celebrities and players. the characters are well portrayed and you feel for them. if you're ever gonna see a norwegian movie. let it be this one!!!!

i hate football!! i hate football fans! i hate cars! but this film was the funniest thing i have seen in quite some time. i was given the great opportunity to see this film at the weekend, and all i have to say is i laughed till i cried, and when is it going to be available in the uk and denmark. girls, this is one football film you will need to see, its hilarious!the fact that this film started out as some crazy commercial for a telephone company is just amazing, the guys may not be well known actors, but this is good down to earth real humour, with real people, and i for one applaud them for taking this to the screen.well done!

hehehe. this was one of the best funny road movies ever! i laughed so i fell out of the chair. with many norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves. harald zwart is the producer, known for films like agent cody banks and of course one night at mccool's.it is about norwegian crazy fans, going to the world cup in soccer in germany 2006. and all sort of crazy fun that comes with it. it was hilarious. i couldn't stop laughing. i haven't had so much fun in ages. rumors say it will come a number two, but i do not know. it will be hard beating this one. recommended to everyone! it is a must see film. i was suppose to see it at the cinema, but i had work at the times it where shown. and been trying to rent it for a month, but all the time rented out. got it today on dvd. well worth it.

i've been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early 80's. i say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft-core fluff, a genre i'm not particularly interested in. the dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical (making sense, no doubt, only to it's franco-italian producers)and the plot completely extraneous. what it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood. the scenery (the beautiful philippines), soft-focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today. it is truly one of my great "guilty pleasures". i was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than i think is healthy. a worthwhile moodpiece.

despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by franco micalizzi, this film doesn't quite reach the level of joe d'amato's similar efforts while staying just about as trashy. the author of the original book "emmanuelle: the joys of a woman", emmanuelle arsan, directed and had a smallish role in this film, which mostly pornographically showcases a very young annie belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations. her boyfriend, played by zombie's al cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married! orso maria guerrini drops by as a professor who is oh so usually married simultaneously to two women, one of whom is played by arsan herself. despite beginning promisingly and having a few hilarious lines of dialog like "can you see me with the naked eye?" ... "i can see you better naked!", the film shambles along plotlessly up until the less-than-spectacular finale. much like d'amato's emanuelle and the last cannibals, the main characters are all in search of some lost tribe, but don't get your hopes up, there's no violence at all in this film, and not much sex either for that matter. just a lot of nudity and silly dialog. i couldn't help but find some appreciation for this little film, if only for the completely cornball logic the film goes by.

gorgeous annie belle in her prime stars in this adventure/sex movie. she wears her hair in a buzz cut that is bleached platinum. she and her boyfriend are visiting some tropical asian paradise. they have decided to keep an "open" sexual relationship, which is played out on their journey to find a secret society/tribe where the people live one year and then are reborn in some kind of ceremony. the scenery is gorgeous, deep vast green gorges and jungles are explored. the imagery is very similar to that of the movie "black emanuelle". it is rich and colorful. recommended!

i finally saw laure and i have to say that i equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it. what's great about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. the story is non-existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter. the pace in languid and the settings are exotic. the film has a lot going for it. unfortunately, it also has a few things going against it. the first thing is that the gorgeous annie belle and the handsome al cliver have no chemistry whatsoever. because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability. according to imdb, al and annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie. they sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen.the other problem with laure is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous. there's one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest i've ever seen in any soft porn flick: our young blonde couple are picked-up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross-dresser! the pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend (!) and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter, in mid-air. and al cliver is filming all of this with his 16mm camera! i kid you not. ridiculous. we later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola. while the footage rolls, al and annie start making out. this scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much. watching the footage of the cross-dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud. is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way? the last thing i want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag, certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman, while piloting a helicopter, no less. al and annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene. i just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn't so silly.speaking of drag, another dull plot point in laure which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great orso maria guerrini and his two wives. a married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting. the two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex. in fact, orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film, even when he's with annie belle. this is another minor complaint about laure: there's nudity but it's not as much as other films of the same era. it just needed more skin to punch it up.except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments, laure is actually very watchable. i love these kind of softcore films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere, not the crude stuff we see today.p.s.: make sure to watch emanuelle in egypt, which stars annie & al but also another famous screen couple, laura gemser and gabriele tinti. the music in that movie is also great.

distributor: goodtimes home video plot: a pretty high school student is marked for unrelenting terror in this suspense filled made for tv movie. gail osborne is new in town. she makes friends, has a boyfriend and everything seems to be going her way. that is until she gets an ominous and frightening phone call while babysitting. after more and more phone calls, she is raped. throughout most of the movie, she tries to find proof that the person did rape her.audio/video: this 1987 vhs edition from goodtimes stinks. there are constant lines at the bottom and top of the screen.extras: no extras from goodtimes home video.final thoughts: this suspense filled made for tv movie was made in 1978, so don't expect many deaths (there are none). if you can find this movie with the worldvision home video logo on the front, then buy it. but the goodtimes version is pretty crappy. this can be a little boring, but if you are patient, the ending is pretty good.

there is a lot to like in this film, despite its humble trappings of a preachy pc tale about rape and the perp always faring better than the victim. the movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes. (i, for one, was sure it was the teacher. in fact, that would have been more probable plot-wise because the idea of the best-friend's boy-friend kind of came out of nowhere. i guess the point of that is that "rape is omnipresent. you never know who it is going to be".) ms. beller is luminous as always (yet see kb discussion board for my qualification of this statement). like all preachy films the plot lasts 15 minutes past the climax so you might want to quit watching at that point. unless you are really curious to find out what happens to phillip. blythe danner, as the mom, is in the role she was born to play: the fretting, over-protective mom. some good 70s scenes for 70s fans. (the dark bar that the father goes to in order to drink away his pain is all dark-stained beams, barrels, oak and cork). a must for beller fans and highly recommended for fans of 70s high school melodrama or 70s kitsch in general.

"are you in the house alone?" belongs to the pre-cable tv days when the networks were eager to offer an alternative to popular tv shows. it is well-made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations. kathleen beller plays a high school student who gets a series of threatening letters. everyone seems to think that it is nothing more than a prank but beller is really scared. tony bill and blythe danner play beller's parents, ellen travolta (john's sister) is the high school principal and dennis quaid has one of his earliest roles as a cocky rich kid. it's a competent chiller with a still relevant social message. beller is lovely - if you are 30 or older, you will remember that she was very popular among youngsters. blythe danner, who i usually don't like, gives a truly moving performance. nice little film.

okay, i love this movie!!!!! i watched it over and over again. it is so hard to tell who the attacker is. you keep thinking it's one person, then another, then back to the first person, then another person. it is so suspense full you want to fast forward your tv to the end to see who it is.summary: gail osborne is raped and left at her home. she is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped. it goes from her meeting her steady boyfriend, to her teacher who takes a liking to her, to her ex-boyfriend, all different stories, all suspects. but who did it?i love the acting, they have a lot of great talent in here. the suspense is wonderful and the settings are superb. if it comes on tv watch it. *** 1/2 stars 10/10

ascending to power in 1933, hitler and his "national socialist german workers party", which of course we all know as the nazis, tightened their grip on the country more and more as the time went by. early in their rough-shod trampling of the german people, they called any and all artists, newspaper men and film makers into their nazi hq in order that the may be informed of just what the newly declared "third reich" (aka 'empire') expected of them.when the master director from the german cinema's silent impressionist and expressionist era, mr. fritz lang, was called in to meet with herr goebels; he listened attentively and said nothing. immediately after leaving the minister of propaganda's office, herr lang went directly to the train station and took a passenger directly to paris. not even going back to his residence, fritz lang did not return to germany (at least not until many years later. he remained in france; eventually immigrating to the united states of america.* mr. lang went right to work in america; creating a variety of most enjoyable, solid and substantially literate upper echelon movies for many a year. included in this smörgåsbord of titles is today's lucky subject, western union (20th century-fox, 1941).typically a film about the old west and pioneer days needed both quality as well as quantity of cast. western union qualified on both requisites. we are treated to a fine array of starring talent as well as a supporting cast which makes just about every minute and each scene a delight to our senses.heading up the playbill are robert young, randolph scott, dean jagger and virginia gilmore. others prominently displayed are folks like john carradine (playing not a vampire or other scary guy, but a physician), george "slim" summerville (veteran character actor, silent film veteran and graduate of mack sennett's keystone comedies), chill wills (always dependable supporting player and former singer in "the avalon boys") and burly bad guy barton maclane. added to this mix, we have names like russell hicks, victor killian, minor watson, george chandler, addison richards, irving bacon, james flavin, francis ford, frank mcgrath and kermit maynard (ken maynard's bro).prominent in those american indians featured are: chief big tree, chief thundercloud and mr. jay silverheels. also featured is that one great representative of the aboriginal peoples of north america is that great, singularly impressive and memorable example of the red man, the louisiana native, iron eyes cody (born espera decorti of sicilian immigrant parents).the filming of the fine outdoor scenes was done on location in arizona and utah and rendered in the highest grade of technigolour available. (there is no monument valley; but then, that's the province of mr. john ford.) in some respects this film is a far more amazing accomplishment than we might think; for it took a sort of pulp magazine story, adapted it to the tastes and idioms of the pre-war america of the late thirties and early forties. all of this being done by a german born director who was only had been in hollywood and america for the shortest length of time.in its final analysis, western union, while it may not be the most historically accurate example of the western genre; we just don't care. it scores in all of the necessary categories needed for a great night at the movies! so, who really cares about little details such as "accuracy"? we give mr. lang and 20th century-fox a rating of ****!note: * we just saw a special on pbs station wttw, here in chicago that was all about all of the film actors, directors and other artisans whom the nazi rise to power caused to take refuge in america and hollywood. (it seems that movie folks and scientists were the biggest export for germany at this particular time; being that the scientists who built the atomic bomb, as well as the future nasa people, came from europe at this time.) poodle schnitz!!

doe-eyed high school student kathleen beller is found beaten andraped in the opening scenes of this made for tv movie. the filmthen flashbacks to the few days before the rape, as beller isharassed by a stranger.beller and scott colomby and her best friend robin mattson anddennis quaid are double dating early on. beller's anxious parents,laid back tony bill and shrill blythe danner, wait at home wringinghands and so on. right away, the 1970's makes its datedentrance, as the young couples discuss the romance and love in"three days of the condor."beller, an amateur photographer, begins getting threatening notesstuffed in her locker at school. the film makers wisely give us awhole slew of suspects: beller's new boyfriend, mattson'sboyfriend, beller's dad, beller's ex-boyfriend, and what about thatoverly friendly photography class teacher who wants beller to be alittle more sexy in her self-portraits? i knew who the rapist wasbecause the worldvision video company video box has a picture ofthe attack on the back cover, destroying any suspense in thatregard.without giving away who the attacker is, beller begins gettingharassing phone calls, and is eventually raped. the movie thenheads south as she makes like nancy drew and secretly sets upa time lapse camera to catch the guy stalking another student.finally, the film makers tack on a hokey ending narration frombeller about the lack of understanding for the victims of rape in thatday and age.the suspense here is very real, without going over the top intoscary movie stuff. beller is very good, and watch for her andmattson's scene in an abandoned theater- both do great jobs. thefilm is full of familiar faces, including ellen travolta in a small role,and everyone is professional.this was made in 1978, and it shows. i am sure no one had anyidea that this would be reviewed in 2001 by an overcritical horrormovie lover who needs to get to bed and be up early in themorning, but some of the attitudes here are embarassing. theteacher who tells beller to be sexy is never made to explain whatexactly he had in mind. nowadays, if any high school teacher saidthat, then that would have been a made for tv movie on its own.after beller is raped, the rapist is still a part of her life, as warrantsare issued, blah, blah, blah. there may not be a case becausebeller is not a virgin, and cannot prove she was raped by whomshe said. many of these problems have been addressed withmodern technology and policing efforts, but this film obviouslyknew it would have a chance to add to the reform debate. rape isan act of violence that has not gone away, but efforts today to catchthe attackers are miles ahead of twenty four years ago. theproblem is the anti-rape angle feels tacked on, like anafterthought. before that, we have a tight little suspenser that hasreal honest to god characterization. after the rape, everythingchanges, filmwise, and not for the better.i remember beller from the '70's and '80's (and who could forgether revealing role in "the betsy"), but she has not done anything inalmost ten years. this is a shame, since she was very good wayback then.i will recommend "are you in the house alone?!" based on theacting alone, with a reluctant nod to at least the first two-thirds ofthe film. if you want to relive 1970's made for tv high school life,this is your cup of tab.this is unrated but contains physical violence, some sexualviolence, and some adult situations.

an enjoyable movie, without a doubt, and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boy's 'rites of passage'. but i have to say that having read the very positive comments here, i was a bit disappointed. the period was captured, but the plot was desperately thin. the whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays. the idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns, but a philanderer, is risible. and without that, nada. the sub-plots bore no relation that i could see to the main plot - all of them could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story - which surely suggests a fundamental flaw. when all your sub-plots look like padding, you know a central idea is being stretched beyond its limits. nevertheless, it's a benign movie with its heart in the right place, there are some fine performances, and you just get the feeling that everyone involved felt deflated at the final 'cut!' that good feeling permeates the film. and that has to count for something. a flawed really quite good movie. 7 out of 10.

i was at school in the late sixties and early seventies and this film is very much how my school was. the school play where the leading actors kiss, that happened at my school. a crazy gang of lads, my school again only when we went on a cross country run we would have a smoke! 'getting the whack', some one at my school broke in through a sky light and broke the canes! after that they were kept in a safe!!! and as for certain nocternal activities! what can i say.... the film actually came out in 1982, i remember that as it was when i bought my house and the film was showing at the same time. if you like british films and films about school, growing up and period pieces, then this is for you. another film very much like it, 'swalk', came out a few years before and i for one would like to see that again, also 'kes' is in the genre. highly recommended. (but trust me, 1982 is when it came out)

this movie is a perfect example of barkers cinematic gifts to the horror/ monster genre. i thought this movie did a great job of keeping the feel and look of the novella and comic books (or actually, the comics may have come second, i forget). this movie was made for barker fans. it helps to have read the book beforehand, but isn't that important if you can follow a film. i saw to anyone who is on the fence about this film, read the book, then re-watch the film. you might find a new respect for the movie. i came to this movie a big fan of barker already, and having read the book prior, loved the film instantly. there are great cameos, makeup, writing, directing, etc in this film. this movie does something that most monster/ horror movies fail miserably at, show the monsters. they are there in full color, not hidden in shadows, and taking most of the screen time. unlike other films that use quick cuts or trick lighting to hide the creature, this movie celebrates the grotesque, and casts them into the forefront as the good guy. two thumbs up clive. we're waiting for the thief of always :)

i absolutely love this movie. i just managed to get a copy and saved it to watch on my birthday. this movie brings up several questions. one is. who are the monsters of this world? to be different is just that. different. the real monsters hide behind masks of ordinariness. they are those that everyone considers "a nice quiet bloke" who "didn't bother anybody". or they are worse they are the characters such as played by croneberg. men who draw pleasure and power from carving up people and creating their own books of blood. i love the shapeshifters, people with gifts and those that may be abhorent for people to look upon. this movie touches on and explores what is normal. who are 'other' and what fear does to some. even though i gave this movie 10 i am still sick of women who either scream or are so set in their ways that they cant see what is happening and being a vehicle for the things that destroyed median. my other complaint was why didn't they ever make a second film. i for one would have loved to see a continuation of this most intriguing story that keep me captivated from beginning to end

it's a horror story alright. but perhaps not as you know it. the real monsters in this flick are humans. while the monsters, are human and prey. as weird as that may sound i see this as "monsters inc" for horror film fans.sure, the effects are of a std horror film, the monsters are there as in any monster based film, the gore is there as well, there even is a slasher in the shape of dr decker (played by david cronenberg; i see flash of cillian murphy as dr. jonathan crane in batman begins here - or is it the other way round?). and it is decker &c who are the bad guys. the monsters want mainly to mind their own business, warding off intrusive humans more or less misguided, wanting to join there society.by the end of the film you actually grow to like the quite little monsters (and the dog) - not perhaps what you had expected from the first few scenes....

i'd love to see some tie-in between nightbreed, the fury, and the x-men series, sort of the way the second outer limit's series would tie-in particular stories and plot-lines after the fact, to create a story arc although one was never intended. i'd also like know if some more information - anecdotal or otherwise, exists anywhere about the relationship and/or collaboration between clive barker and david cronenberg. i simply can't get my mind around the fact that david cronenberg appeared as a mere actor in a clive barker film. does any additional information on the subject actually exist? finally, it's been 17 years since the film was released, and i had hoped there would've been a sequel by now. does anyone out there know if there were any plans in the making that never came to fruition, or if in fact there are plans even now for a sequel?

as an avid reader of clive barker, i truly anticipated this film prior to it's release... i was not let down. "nightbreed" is a horse of a different color. rich in the underlying decay of western civilization and dripping with alternative existence in a way we have never seen before. barker is at his best when he allows us to peek into his world of unprecedented horror, yet showing us the other side of the coin. here the "monsters" are the hideously beautiful beings, while the humans are the deceptively ugly creatures of self indulgence. we soon learn that we were wrong all along. by far my favorite performance by the often under-used craig sheffer, and the added bonus of david cronenberg as "decker" is a cast best seen then believed. the "monsters" are portrayed flawlessly by a bevy of english creature masters, whom many also brought the "cenobites" to life in "hellraiser", including "pinhead" himself doug bradley. "nightbreed" is an absolute must see for any fan of the horror genre, and anyone who needs just a little (something) more out of their horror story. this is clive barker at his finest.

although i don't like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago, i still think it is one of the best coming-of-age movies ..i remember the day i returned home from my school and sat down to have my lunch, i saw the opening titles of that movie and then....i was so immersed in it that i felt i was there, it really affected me personally. i still remember how i felt when i first saw it ,i felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine, going through the same adolescent experience we were having in those days. what i really liked about that movie is the main theme of a "shy" boy fantasizing about "kissing" his dream girl, no offense but if that was an american movie, you would certainly see-at a certain point, mainly climax- the "shy" boy "making love" to his girl, and i really can't grasp this contradicting concepts till now...i have a simple request ,if anyone knows how to get this movie on a dvd by mail ,please let me know cause i need a shot of memories..thanks

i enjoyed this film. the way these mutants looked, along with the tone of the film, is very good. plus, david cronenberg as philip k. decker was great! it makes me wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life (except for the killings of course).i was impressed with the creatures for this film, although this movie probably had a somewhat low budget, the mutants/creatures/monsters looked great, especially from 1990. this is definitely a unique film and not crap. it makes me want to go find a read the novella it's based off of. this is an interesting film because it shows how humans can be monsters and the "monsters" are the one with humanity.

i just watched nightbreed for the first time since seeing it in the theater almost 20 years ago, and while i remember liking it at the time, i don't remember being blown away by it like i was today. i really can't complain about anything in this movie. craig scheffer is excellent as the lead character of boone. i never understood why he hasn't had a more successful career, because most of his early work is outstanding. as good as scheffer is, cronenberg is even better. his portrayal of the psycho dr. decker is unforgettable, and steals the show. the rest of the cast, which includes doug bradley is very good, save for the ridiculously over the top redneck sheriff. the visuals are good, and in some shots great. the danny elfman composed score is as good as it gets, and is among his best work. the ending was epic, with nonstop action for close to twenty minutes. overall, nightbreed is a tremendous accomplishment for clive barker, and ranks as my favorite of his movies, just slightly ahead of hellraiser. 9/10

why didn't critics like this movie?? i don't get it. this is easily my favorite clive barker effort. "hellraiser" is a bit too rough around the edges (the film just never leaves that stupid house) and, lets face it, "lord of illusions" doesn't move at all!!! i have loved barker's writing for years, especially his "books of blood". terrifically entertaining. he has a vicious side to him that is totally unlike a stephen king. he freely mixes in his own homosexuality and odd religious and occultic elements. i love love love love it. i also realize , however, that barker is as much a dark fantasy writer as he is a horror writer. and fantasy just isn't my bag. puts me right to sleep. always has. i also think barker works best with short stories. his novels tend to wander a bit. that was my experience when trying to read "the damnation game". it started out well. then 100 pages in i thought "where is this going?" because it wasn't going anywhere.i read "cabal" (the book nightbreed was based on) and thought it was good. i especially like the elaboration on decker's character. the way the mask talked to him and controlled him. i like the way barker simply presents it. black and white. there it is. he gives it a simplicity that's attractive and believable. when asked why decker kills he says (simply) "because i like it". probably something jeffrey dahmer said at some point.but i actually liked the film nightbreed better than cabal. i adore the visual attention to detail that barker gives to his films. adore it. i think it is just beautiful. lord of illusions had some of this as well. some of the drawings in the beginning, during the nightbreed credit sequence. it's like an entire vocabulary barker dreamed up just for the nightbreed world. i'd be curious to know how much was purely his design. i know he is an amazing artist who his own style and language as an artist.nightbreed is also (i think) barker's most entertaining film. it moves very quickly. well edited. it doesn't drag like lord of illusions does a little bit. very quick. everything in it is just perfect. it also works as a fantastic and scary little slasher movie. the stuff with the killer in the beginning killing the family and later tormenting the old man in the shop is really scary stuff. that mask is frightening. i'd be curious to know if barker designed that as well. it's not just a hokey jason or "scream"-type mask. something about it is really disturbing.anyway, this is a great flick. definitely check it out if you haven't seen it. highly recommended. one of my favorite horror films of all time. in my opinion clive barker's best. it is scary and violent though, be warned

if you're looking for an original horror flick, this might be the one for you. it's strange and at times lingers on stupidity, but it's just such a good looking, nice sounding and original movie, it never fails, except maybe during the over long climax. "nightbreed" is a must see for horror fans, or for fans of monster movie make-up.boone (craig sheffer) has been having dreams of a town called midian full of mutant creatures. in therapy, his psychiatrist dr. decker (horror director david cronenberg) has come to the conclusion that boone is a murderer, and gives him hallucinogenic pills, and tells him to turn himself in. after almost getting killed, boone ends up at the hospital, where he runs into a mental patient who also knows about midian, and tells boone where to go. midian, located in a graveyard, is inhabited by vile mutant creatures that don't let boone in. after escaping with only a nasty bite, boone is shot dead by the police, who were lead to his location by dr. decker. but boone isn't dead. the bite causes him to live, and he goes off to midian. meanwhile, boone's girlfriend lori (anne bobby) tries to find boone and get to the bottom of this. when dr. decker also finds out about this place, chaos ensues.the plot seems long and complicated, but it really isn't hard to understand. the plot, among other things, makes this movie really interesting. the make-up effects are astounding. the creatures look unique and amazing, and make this a very appealing film. to add to more senses appeal, we have a musical score by danny elfman, that is both lush and bouncy, and fits the film like a glove. the shots in the movie are also set up beautifully. the cinematography is lovely, and the movie sets up an atmosphere that is never broken. even the acting is good, with the biggest surprise being director david cronenberg giving a great, menacing performance as the man, who for one reason or another, wants to see boone dead. it's odd for a horror film to be this well done.the problems with the movie...well there are a few, but the positives outweigh the negatives. the script features the occasional lame jokes to try and add some humor, but almost every one falls flat. the mutant creatures look great and for the most part are well acted, but sometimes it feels like they are just posing their awesome makeup for the camera. the worst part of the film would have to be the climax. it takes so long, and is just constant chaos. it's the portion of the film that moves from individual characters and nice tight knit shots, to fiery explosions from each direction and violence happening to characters we don't know or care about.overall, this movie is amazing to look at. it's a well done horror film, but even with that said, it has the occasional failure in character's lines, and a messy climax. nonetheless, this is one to check out.my rating: *** out of ****. 101 mins. r for strong violence and language.

adapting his own novel "cabal" for the screen, author / screenwriter / director clive barker fashioned this marvelous story of outré horror and fantasy. craig sheffer plays boone, a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer. the cops gun him down in front of midian, on the surface a cemetery but which is actually a haven for monsters that have been shunned by society. when they lay claim to boone and make him one of their own, this causes repercussions for everybody, including boone's sweet girlfriend (the very cute anne bobby) and dubious psychiatrist (a most enjoyable david cronenberg)."nightbreed" displays the kind of wild and twisted imagination that i don't see in movies all that often. for one thing, ralph mcquarrie, an old hand at conceptual art having worked on such films as the initial three "star wars" entries, helps barker to create excellent visuals for "nightbreed", starting right away with the opening credit sequence. the visual and makeup effects are elaborate, and production design and cinematography quite impressive. barker and crew do a wonderful job at creating this whole other world with compelling characters. it's colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take in. and of course there's the strong sense of social commentary regarding intolerance and bigotry, not to mention the heavy consequences that can result from a person's actions.great supporting performances add to the fun. cronenberg oozes lots of malevolent intent and is a real gas as the bad doctor, while charles haid is a fine love-to-hate-him type of antagonist, a rather nasty police captain. doug "pinhead" bradley once again gets buried under heavy makeup as the weary lylesberg, and is solid as a rock. hugh ross is great fun as narcisse, as is catherine chevalier as rachel (as an added bonus, she bares her breasts in one sequence). simon bamford, who played the "butterball cenobite" in the first two "hellraiser" pictures, turns up here as well. there's even a cool cameo by 50's and 60's sci-fi star john agar.danny elfman supplies another of his fantastic scores, and barker leads us steadily through the intriguing story towards a terrific apocalyptic showdown."nightbreed" is an excellent genre film worth checking out for anybody who hasn't seen it. i give it a hearty recommendation.9/10

nightbreed is definitely my most favorite movie, i've worn more than one tape as it is. the make-up is awesome, the story is lovely. it takes a few different twists and isn't quite as deep as the story it's based on (cabal, by clive barker) but for a movie adaption it stays very true to source material. the only problem with this movie were the producer's vain attempts to turn it into a teen slasher movie, hence the changed ending to allow for sequels *eye rolls*. apparently someday we're going to be getting a director's cut that will (i hope) clear up this bit of nonsense. until then, i'd suggest it to anyone who like dark fantasy type horror as opposed to freddy/jason/micheal type slashers. i really don't know what would be comparable...

don't ask me why i love this movie so much...maybe it came at a time in my life i desperately wanted to fit in, maybe it is the amazing monster effects, maybe because i enjoyed the novel "cabal", but it's probably because i love clive barker. i think it's fair to warn you the movie and the novel have no true resolve and like me you'll probably have a wtf moment at the end. at least two sequels were planned but never came about due to the fact the movie flopped for a few reasons. the studio made drastic cuts to the film cutting a good 30 or so minutes out of it and they did a horrible job promoting it. the adverts made it look like just another cheap slasher showing mainly the "button face/mask" decker character. this is a movie about the monsters! about fantasy! about a place called midian! it's a story where the monsters are the good guys. there is truly nothing else out there like it! it's not a movie for everybody i suppose but it stands as one of clive's many great works. sit back and be prepared to be taken to midian - where the monsters are.

nightbreed is not only great, it is also unique, even taking into account other barker's movies, which never lack originality. an amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book. for the horror genre, it has quite a few of subtle symbolics and references. certainly a lot of fun to have, a a bit to think about, if one cares to. and, not to forget, a nice music score. well, the special effects, as usual, get old faster than anything, but that is probably the only drawback. i've just seen it again after ten years, and i still find it something to recommend.

what's fun about barker's nightbreed is that it's the story of a human on a rampage, a deadly threat to monsters everywhere. in this one, the monsters (the night breed of the title) are the "good" guys. it shares its sense of celebrating the different, the twisted, and the dark with the first addams family movie, and much of tim burton's work. it also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by barker.especially fun is the performance by cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the nightbreed. as happens in most classic monster movies, the villagers surround the monsters' castle with torches and pitchforks. only this time, the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic "weapons" with guns and bombs. and this time the sympathy you felt when you saw frankenstein's monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the movie.this isn't a masterpiece, and even barker has done more interesting, and certainly more chilling, work. but it's pure fun, it looks great, and remains light without mocking itself. worth a look!

i was peeved that the best make-up academy award went to dick tracy, a horrible film with horrible make-up. the nightbreed (based on the better titled "cabal" novella) look terrific, the acting is excellent and david chroneburg makes for a truly creepy and terrific antagonist.the plot focus's on aaron boone, who has recurring nightmares about a society of monsters living under a cemetery. is he making it up or are they real and calling to him? his pyschologist (chroneburg) convinces him he's a murderer, a slayer of families.troubled and suicidal, boone seeks refuge in midian but the monsters don't want him at first. he is also tracked by his girlfriend, lori who refuses to give up on him even after he dies and comes back cold and monstrous.but decker isn't about to let boone continue on. he raises the locals on an all out assault on midian, like a holy war in gods name led by the devil.barkers themes of misunderstood monsters may come from his experiences as a homosexual male, but they are always strong and honest. nightbreed turns the genre on it's head. the monsters are just trying to survive and want to be left alone, but man is hunting them.a 20+ minute longer cut was originally submitted by barker, but the studio chopped it into this fractured masterpiece. barker is hard at work trying to locate the missing footage for a directors cut release. until then, this version will have to do.

postwar england, the dawn of the "atomic age". yet, the worries of a young schoolboy yearning to experience his first "kiss" cannot be derailed by something as inconsequential as the bomb. this was a delightful if not educational look at young love from the vantage point of an adolescent male and his world of the1940's. free of political correctness and preachy messages, this film exposes the viewer to the world that only the mind (andhormones) of a young teenager can create. wonderful subplotsmaintain character interest ala "gregory's girl", and plentyof well blocked shots help keep up the imagery of this era. this is a very good story for anyone, young or old, who hasever been in love, or ever wanted to be. does he ever get his wish? watch it and see.

it is interesting to see what people think of this movie, since it is, in fact, quite unique (though it bears some of the trademarks of clive barker's writing). even though it might seem a bit cynical to say so, the movie is just intricate enough to deflect those that need standard hollywood plot hooks, and layered, so that if you expect to be fed, you will see a normal monster flick with lots of monsters and a disjointed plot.those who need a linear, specific and untangled plot line will hate this movie, because the story lies, like in the novella, partially between the lines, or in this case, partially off screen, in comments and the imagination.another possible hang-up is the ending, of which i can say, without spoiling it, that it is not entirely good and not entirely bad. it is, in fact, not very defined at all, which i know sends some people into raging tantrums about that they didn't get to know what happened, but to me, and to many others, i'm sure, just adds another dimension to the story - the dimension of speculation, and, in addition, the point that great disruption has a tendency to cause ripples that extend quite far.there is definitely moral here, but of a rather different kind than the standard hollywood in-your-face-at-the-end-of-the-movie sort of display. summing that moral up is simple, even though it is not quite that simply displayed; prejudice and the human tendency to hate the different.i love this movie, even though, as many of the reviewers have noted, the expressions of the actors (with the exception of david cronenberg, who does a wonderful appearance) are rather tacky. i'm not sure they are entirely to blame for their rickety appearance and lack of depth, though, seeing that these are common problems in converting literature to screenplay.all in all, this is a great movie, provided that you do not expect it to be a standard horror movie.

this movie was really well written and was very entertaining.there was great acting in it too. luke perry did a very convincing job. (like he always does)if you are looking for a eventful movie to watch this should be at the top of your list. there is a mixture of comedy, drama, and action. you can literally feel what the actors are feeling at points. i was very impressed by this movie. the special effects were very well done. the whole movie was very convincing. this movie is one of my favorites. what happens is north america could be torn apart and jack and his team have to try and to stop an eruption by destroying north america. it was a very cool and creative idea. i loved this movie and i know you will too.

this is a story of a long and awkward love. the daily life of a woman of 50 years old and some people around her is depicted. her daily life is so ordinary and routine that i doubted who was the real lead character in the beginning. then the audiences know that the woman and a man who was her high-school class mate had very tiny connection. the woman has been doing the same job - a milk-woman and a supermarket casher - so long. there are so many slopes that delivering milk bottles is a very hard job. the man had married another woman, who is now dying of cancer. he works at the city hall and devotedly cares her at home. they never look straight nor talk each other, but they never forget each other. the original japanese title means "at some time the days you read books". but of course when the man said "now i want to do what i've always wanted to do", it was to hug her and make love with her. she writes to a radio disk jockey that "if god gives us time to talk, we need at least a whole day". dreaming of that day, she has been sublimating the desire in hard work and book reading. i personally know a woman who has loved a man for long years, even after he married another woman and died for an accident. therefore the story setting is not that special. rather, this movie well portrays unspoken romances in many ordinary men and women. through this movie, you will recall your romance that is lost long ago. this is a movie with lasting effect.

the storyline of the milkwoman is a simple one of unrequited love that despite the passing of decades still remains strong. now 50 years old, minako obha (yuko tanaka) lives alone and works two jobs  one as a checkout clerk in a supermarket, the other as a milklady, doing her daily round on the hills of nagasaki. one of her stops is at the house of kaita takanashi (ittoku kishibe), a government official who tends to his terminally ill wife yoko (akiko nishina). minako and kaita used to see each other as school children, but after the death of minako's mother and kaita's father, who it seems were having an affair together, their own relationship was destroyed. lying in her sick bed, yoko knows however that her husband's feelings for the milklady aren't completely gone and, for the sake of kaita after she has died, she attempts to engineer a means of bringing them back together.while the story might be simple, the emotions it deals with and the means by which it expresses them is really where the heart and beauty of the film lie. the film takes its time to show the simple daily routines of each of the characters, their actions being recorded by an old lady who is writing their story for a book while looking after her own husband who is showing signs of dementia. in the process it depicts the social circumstances of people from different ways of life, how they interact with each other on a daily basis, how relationships form, and how past and present can collide. the director handles this marvellously with a strong structure and visual style. it's only later in the film that the story starts to follow a more conventional and inevitably melodramatic path, as if it is indeed being constructed to fit the narrative structure of the book that is being written. it's all validated by the emotional depths the film touches, represented most effectively in the exceptional performance of yuko tanaka.

i guess those who have been in a one-sided relationship of some sort before will be able identify with the lead character minako (yuko tanaka), a 50 year old woman who is still in the pink of good health, as demonstrated by her daily, grinding routine of waking up extremely early in the morning to prepare for her milk delivery work, where she has to lug bottles of megmilk in a bag in a route around her town like clockwork, to exchange empty bottles for full ones, and to collect payment and issue receipt. and there's always be that one delivery stop that's right at the top, needing to scale a long flight of stairs in order to achieve customer satisfaction.and peculiar enough, that stop happened to be a stop delivering to a man with whom she has been in love with for almost all her teenage to adult life, and not having the product appreciated, but poured down the sink. having gone to the same school, we see that they're not talking to each other, and in their daily life always seem so close physically, but yet so far away. there's no eye contact, save for cursory glances by chance, and little acknowledgement of each other's existence. we learn that they share a past that probably destroyed all notions of being together, where clear attraction between the two was hampered from developing further by the earlier generation.while i thought minako was an interesting woman in herself, one who has kept her feelings suppressed for so long, one can only wonder what kind of damage it would do. if i read that the original japanese title means "at some time the days you read books" and it's accurate, i felt the movie had a wonderful finale with that shot of her well stocked bookcase, likely alluding to the fact that she's not alone after all, and had probably fallen back on her crutch of sorts to deal with the pain of being alone, and back to a lifestyle which she had already been accustomed to for 50 years. besides immersing herself in two jobs, she has those books which serve as a form of escapism, and occasionally pens little sweet nothings to song dedication shows on the radio.yuko tanaka did a commendable job as the emotionally strong woman resigned to her fate and her decision to love none other, her object of affection, takanashi (ittoku kishibe) was a more interesting character who has more facets. staying true to marriage vows, he spends significant amount of screen time looking after his sickly bedridden wife (played by akiko nishina), while juggling with his job of social welfare in the children's affairs department in city hall. i felt that as a childless couple, the job provided him a means to care, not for his own, but for other people's children, the troubled ones who are neglected and left to fend for themselves. in a rare moment of rage, we see how he angrily chides such wayward parents who don't appreciate and wastes their children's lives away.the story by kenji aoki provides little quirks to make its characters appeal and successfully attempted to provide a lot more glimpses and dimension into them as well, such as how takanashi is a hopeless haiku poet despite being a member of the haiku club, and supporting characters such as the aged minagawa couple, where masao (koichi ueda) lent some comical though sad moments as he slowly turned senile, while wife toshiko (misako watanabe) narrates and brings us through this love story of a single woman at 50. even akiko nishina's performance as the bedridden wife was nothing short of arresting, with her character's enlightened state of knowing her husband's past, and making unselfish, and painful decisions in her sickly state.it's what you can expect from a typical japanese romantic movie, sans young, nubile leads as star-crossed lovers, but with all other elements in place such as romantic set ups, love songs and those quintessential restrained but affectionate behaviour. i thought the story was in danger of going down the beaten track when unrequited love gets consummated, but director akira ogata managed to steer clear of the usual melodramatic moments in such stories, though the story did call for some obvious plot development into the final act that you can predict, especially if you're already way past your romance movie 101.not being your average lovey-dovey story, i thought the milkwoman told a strong story with unrequited love as a central theme, and frankly a recommended romance movie (though told at a measured pace) if you're in the mood for some bittersweet loving, reminiscence, and seeking to live without regrets.

lead actor yuko tanaka fulfills so much in the exceptionally meditative "the milkwoman," a tranquil canvass on missed chances in the life of a 50-something woman, charting her routine with sincerely poignant motives. played out in the picturesque, tranquil town of nagasaki, akira ogata's unconventional romantic film, so to speak, is less a straight-out melodrama than a deliberate introspection of its characters' surrender to their current lives as a result of a tragic past that forced them to a choice they did not call for.perfectly embodying the requisite world-weariness subjected to a spiritless routine, tanaka plays minako oba, a middle-aged woman who, before her work shift at a supermarket, takes it upon herself to deliver bottles of milk among the residents of the hilly nagasaki. one of the houses she constantly passes by to make such a delivery is that of kaita takanashi (ittoku kishibe), a local government employee caring for her terminally ill wife (akiko nishina). minako and kaita were high school sweethearts who, courtesy of an ignominious event concerning their parents, separated ways since then.opening his film with the foreboding narration of a young minako vowing never to leave nagasaki, ogata does as such with the narrative, patiently sticking with minako as he, deftly aided by tanako's understated yet highly effective performance, follows her -- whether she's having chitchat with her aunt (misako watanabe) on being single, or when she jogs up and down the countless footsteps of their hilly town to distribute milk -- as she and kaita gradually overcome the hindrances that kept them apart for years. such unhurried development may not suit viewers weaned on fast-paced narratives but for the rest, it's a heartfelt introspection that affects powerfully and emphatically.

there is a great danger when you watch a film that had had such a profound affect on you the first time around , that 20 years later , it wont hold the same magic as it did before. i must admit i wasnt expecting it to be as good as i remembered but a was pleasently suprised. p'tang yang kipperbang is still as fantastic as i remember it when i was a 12 year old .this film has a certain type of brilliance that not many films possess. it is engrossing , it is briliantly acted and best of all it makes me feel like a kid again and there isnt many things that can do that. john albasiny and abigail cruttenden's rolls in this film are 1st class and i had forgotten how good they were until now. i urge any parent of teenagers to sit them down and watch this and see if it has the same affect on them as it did on me. p'tang yang kipperbang eehhh! 10 out of 10.

just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent bbc mini-series, published in 1981, it was not available on dvd until the last few years. since then, it has become available, but initially only in the british format (for which i bought an 'international' dvd player, which you have to hack--illegally, i suspect, to see it), but the series is now available through amazon.com--3 discs-- for between $19-21, to be viewed on dvd in the us format, no hacking. there were 41 reviews, average 5 stars. this mini-series is one of the very best on oppenheimer, or the manhattan project, or virtually anything produced by the bbc.

like an earlier commentor, i saw it in 1980 and have never been able to shake the memory of the gripping story, splendid acting, and dramatic musical score. it certainly contains some of sam waterston's finest work. he and the writers depict oppenheimer not simply as an unjustly victimized hero -- which he was -- but also as naive, fond of alcohol, and snobbish, a rounded portrait instead of a stereotype.

>>> great news there is a bbc dvd release scheduled for 31st july 2006,uk - there is also a scheduled release in states - don't know the date - can't wait ! ! <<<<>>>> below is my original comment <<<<<i agree with all the other reviewers - it is simply staggering that one of the greatest tv dramas ever has never been released on dvdthe story line is gripping - the acting is outstanding and the character development is enthralling !over here in the uk we have quite a history of getting tv drama series and films out onto dvd through popular campaigns it's very hard to see why the rights owners do not go into a dvd production ? i'm going to e:mail one of the leading players in this grass roots movement and see what happens. who did the production ? was it bbc ? rw

insanely well crafted mini-series.i recall seeing most of it twice when shown on american playhouse on pbs. was heavily promoted at the time. i believe it might have been one of the very early mini-series showing on pbs outside of the masterpiece theater series.the full length production was shown i believe only once during its first broadcast. was 6-8 hours total. this length was edited down somewhat to 6 hours. cut some interesting, but slow scenes.i am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and restore a complete, not edited version to dvd. not worth creating a vhs version at this point.would fit in very well in the mini-series or dramatic history genre.

oppenheimer was a great series (it was the first thing i saw waterston in) and it is too bad copies aren't available. a similar situation exists for "glory enough for all", a british series from around the same time, about the discovery of insulin. i would pay a good price for both of these on dvd. is it really so difficult to get oppenheimer on a dvd that is able to be played in the us? another very enjoyable series, again from about the same time, was "danger uxb". a series about defusing unexploded bombs, hence the name. that one you can get from your local library.pete

'oppenheimer' with sam waterston in the title role and with david suchet as evard teller is an example of the docudrama at its very finest. well written, well acted by actors who bear a believable resemblance to their historical characters, highly informative, and very entertaining. the set designs and costumes capture the feel of the us during world war 2, and the plotting and dialog make the viewer feel as if he were really present at los alamos and caught up in the excitement of the manhattan project. the only downside is that this is a british production, and some of the actors lack skill in affecting a convincing american accent. (the skill of current day australian & irish actors taking on non-native dialects is amazing.) the storyline is fully consistent with richard rhodes' definitive history of the development of the atomic bomb. sadly, the mini-series was shown only a couple of times on pbs at the beginning of the 1980s and then apparently vanished into oblivion.'oppenheimer' compares favorably to the more recent 'fat man & little boy' feature film with paul newman as leslie groves (the chronically overweight and rather homely general would be thoroughly flattered) and dwight schultz (alumnus of tv's 'a-team') as oppenheimer. as a mini-series, 'oppenheimer' is around 4x as long as the newman feature, but uses the all of the additional time completely to its advantage.

not wishing to repeat what everyone else has noted, i will only say this: nearly everybody says they loved curly best... but i will put brideless groom up against any of other the stooges shorts. i think it's the most hilarious from start to finish, as well as being the most re-watchable.the off-key singing student... christine mcintire's "cousin basil" routine, and of course emil sitka's j.p. are highlights, but only around the stooges' impeccable timing and the great writing too!nuff said.

a three stooges short, this one featuring shemp. of all those involving shemp i've seen, this is my favorite performance by him in a stooges short. the basic plot is that shemp must get married by 6 o'clock that very evening if he's to inherit the half a million dollars a rich uncle left him in his will. so shemp sets out to get himself a bride but finds it a tougher road than expected, that is until they learn of his inheritance money. best bits here involve shemp shaving, shemp and moe in a telephone booth and larry on piano as accompaniment to shemp's voice-training session. also the sequence where shemp is mistaken as cousin basil and its outcome proves hilarious.

for the record, i am a curly fan through and through. but i do have to say that in reality, shemp wasn't really that bad. yeah, he might have lacked the same kind of slapstick that curly had, but in his own way he was hilarious. at least he wasn't as bad as joe besser.in brideless groom, shemp plays a music professor (stooge? a professor? yeah right), who recently inherited a half million dollars from a dead uncle, and moe & larry have to prepare him to marry a woman by six o'clock that night, or no money.this was one of the stooges' first skit with shemp, before they started recycling their material. perhaps it isn't surprising that shemp was part of the stooges before curly came into the picture, so he seemed natural at this. the slapstick gags are hilarious, especially this one scene with moe and shemp in a phone booth. essential stooge short to be honest.

almost certainly the best three stooges short with shemp, 'brideless groom' is as good as any of the trio's best shorts featuring curly. memorable stooge moments abound. the opening with 'professor' shemp giving voice lessons to homely, untalented and lascivious miss dinkelmeyer (dee green), wincing at her horrendous singing notes and fighting off her advances, is an excellent example of shemp howard at his best. many considered him the most naturally funny of the stooges.later, when moe and larry try to help him get spiffed up to find a wife (and claim $500,000), shemp thinks he has cut off his head when his mirror gets flipped backward. fixing the mirror, he cries with relief, "there i amand pretty as a picture!" "yea," moe quickly replies, trying to hem his slacks, "of an ape!"the best scene (and maybe shemp's best with the trio) comes when he pays a call on attractive young miss hopkins (christine mcintyre). mistaking him for long-lost "cousin basil," she smothers him with hugs and kisses (also leading to a hilarious bit between moe and larry in the hall), not giving him a chance to explain his true identity. suddenly the real cousin basil calls and she goes berserk, slapping him repeatedly and accusing him of taking advantage of "a poor . helplessdefenseless  woman!" that final line is delivered as she socks him in the jaw (with a real punch, according to shemp and crew members), knocking him through the door and into the hall in a perfectly executed gag. "what happened, kid?" moe asks. "can i help it if i ain't cousin basil?" shemp asks before passing out.other classic bits include moe and shemp getting tangled in a phone booth, trying to find a lost coin, larry getting slapped because of shemp's bad looks (his face pressed against the phone booth glass), and the great girl fight in the justice of the peace's apartment. the great emil sitka delivers his classic line (inscribed on his tombstone), "hold hands, you love birds" over and over as his apartment is trashed.i prescribe 'brideless groom' as medicine for anyone who thinks the stooges' glory years ended when curly left. true, shemp didn't have as many great shorts with the group as curly, but that was due to an increasing lack of support from columbia and his (and the others') advancing ages. when shemp was healthy and the trio was given decent material to work with, they were still on the top of their game.

this is the very first three stooges short with shemp that i saw, and it is one of my favorites! that is what i really liked about shemp when he returned after curly's stroke, he did not try to be like curly, he was his own character, and that is what i admire! shemp is my favorite third stooge, i like him more than curly, but i like curly as much as i do shemp. shemp is great, he's funny, he's silly, he's shemp! i really loved the scene where he dropped the nickel and moe got into the booth with him to find it and they ended up getting tangled in the wires and really badly hurt! but what i really thought was scary was when shemp had his face smashed against the glass of the phonebooth, he looked like a deformed professor snape!poor shemp, he had a lot of bad things happen to him in this short, but that is just typical three stooges, they always have a lot of bad things happening to them! this short is another must see for three stooges fans! 10/10

the stooges are back and funnier than ever. "brideless groom" in my opinion was probably the best shemp flick.shemp has the opportunity to inherit $500,000(which was probably more than a million dollars compared to today) from his dead uncle. but! there is a catch. he has to marry someone that day by 6 o'clock. shemp is a bachelor with not too many admirers, except for one high pitched aggressive annoying singing student of his. but he doesn't want her, he wants someone a little more on the victoria's secret model type of women. but obviously he has no choice since he's no collin ferrel himself. but when it is printed in the papers that he is to inherit all that money if married, his ex girlfriends are on the "i want my man back" attack! what a great stooge flick! this is up there with thewinners of all stooge flicks! 9/10

"gargle with old razor blades. can i help it if i'm not cousin basil? i think the piano's out of tune. ginger grey. this is your little snookums." laughs throughout the entire 20 minute short as the boys spoof gold diggers and opera singers. they even manage to show us how to properly demonstrate to some attractive ladies how to handle both a rifle and a bear trap. wonder how many times they rehearsed the scene with the phone booth. adding christine mcintyre and emil sitka, 2 frequent collaborators, to the mix makes it even better. only vernon dent is missing. the stooges did some great individual scenes, but this was their best overall.

clyde bruckman borrows the premise of this short from buster keaton's "seven chances," recently tepidly remade as "the bachelor." in the original, buster has 24-hours to get married in order to inherit a large sum of money. in this version, musical teacher prof. shemp has only 7 hours (after all, it is a short!). this is one of the better stooges shorts due to the storyline and wonderful routines (including the telephone booth scene with moe & shemp, reminiscent of laurel & hardy's "berth marks" and the marx brothers famous stateroom scene in "night at the opera - here the boys hold their own in their variation of this routine). i'm not a huge stooges fan, but this one should be noted by any student of comedy as one of their very best since the early 30s shorts.

ok, the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem, i.e. the story started out in life as material for buster keaton's silent classic "7 chances". comedy, or acting in any genre for that much, is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before, if it's not a totally original creation. here we have the stooges essentially doing material that was written and performed by someone else and yet for a low budget, short time span of a film, they're handling things just fine. regardless of what the credits say on their films, real "stooge-philes" know that they had a lot of input on lines and direction. they took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation. words spoken by emil sitka himself during a documentary about the boys. here, what appears to be their usual anarchy over something so simple as getting married, is actually organized chaos. every line is perfectly timed with a related physical action. how many comedians are around today that can claim such mastery? most obviously the seinfeld crew but none others that i've seen in the last 35 years of watching tv. the critics will always "pooh pooh" the stooges or laurel & hardy and others but then again...who ever remembers the critic's names or what they said? simply watch, laugh and enjoy!

the entire civilized world by now knows that this is where emil sitka says his immortal "hold hands, you lovebirds." but shemp howard, professor of music, steals the show. watch him tutoring dee green as she fractures the "voices of spring." watch shemp as he shaves by a mirror suspended from the ceiling by a string. watch him as he gets walloped by christine mcintyre. watch him, and you will laugh and learn. moe is no slouch either. watch him as he attempts to induce a woman to sit on a bear trap. larry, as usual, is the zen master of reaction. all in all, one of the very best stooge shorts. you won't find one weak moment.

looks like the bet movie i've ever seen. not too much for intelligent perception but so rich for perception sensitive. antonioni is comparably wise to his movie. malkovich's so organic, roles are so true, situations are so real. i've change my world outlook after this cinema. i'm a beginner literati in russia -- country of tolstoy and dostoevskiy -- and i'm quite sure watching antonioni is good and fun for russkies, because i and we do understand his point of view. so i don't understand his lesser raiting on imdb. i'm sure, speaking from russia and our people, we like antonioni because of his romantic soul and positive sensation of surrounding reality

first, the positives: an excellent job at depicting urban landscapes to suit the mood of the film. some of the shots could be paintings by de chirico. sophie marceau, beautiful.the negatives: the stories are hard to believe. unreal, uni-dimensional characters preen and posture 100% of the time, as if they were in some kind of catwalk. this is neither the antonioni of his earlier, much better movies nor the wenders we've all come to know and appreciate. malkovich is excess baggage in this movie.

amazing movie. some of the script writing could have been better (some cliched language). joyce's "the dead" is alluded to throughout the movie. beautiful scenery and great acting. very poetic. highly recommend.

if you speak french or can put up with sub-titles, you will really enjoy this movie. if on the other hand you just want to see god's most beautiful creatures, this is a must see. not an ounce of silicon in sight. zalman king eat your heart out. sophie marceau's body is the epitome of perfection and everything i had ever fantasized about. her part is even in english. even the fact that she was nude with john malkovich did not detract for her beauty. sophie is a ten if ever there was one. chiara caselli and inés sastre are 9.5s. oh yeah, it is a pretty good story. several little vignettes are woven together in a sort of six degrees of separation style.

this the the final feature film that michelangelo antonioni directed, with the help of wim wenders, and adapts from his short story collection "that bowling alley on the tiber". beyond the clouds contain 4 short stories with familiar themes that we've come to be accustomed to from his earlier works, and sums up those themes in vignettes which are weaved together via wenders' directed scenes involving john malkovich's the director character. however, most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth that we're used to from an antonioni movie, while malkovich's narration of supposed depth rattled on with unclear diction that sounded a tad pretentious and out of place.nonetheless, all four stories seem to touch on chance encounters, and extremely quick romances that played out more like lust at first sight, perhaps due to the lack of time (since they're short stories anyway) to allow for a more layered approach to carefully define and craft the characters as we know from a typical antonioni movie. and the obsessive approach here is for the characters to disrobe to showcase a lack of deeper connection sacrificed for the immediate satisfaction of the flesh. maybe this is the point to want to bring across with an observation of the more modern relationship?the first story, story of a love affair that never existed, tells the romance between silvano (kim rossi stuart) and carmen (ines sastre), who meet when one asks the other for directions to a hotel, and later meet at a cafe. it's as if fate is playing games on them when they meet, but part and meet again much later, but like the games people play, it's almost like a l'avventura or a la notte with the lack of communication, and of the expectations from the man.john malkovich's director character takes central role in the next short, who exhibited some really lecherous looks toward a girl working at a shop, played by sophie marceau. she is deeply disturbed and made to feel uncomfortable, but somehow plucked up the courage to approach him, and in what i thought was to scare him off, tells him her background that she murdered her father by stabbing him 12 times. but in a flash these two are off toward bedroom gymnastics.the next short, don't look for me, is the longest of the lot, with peter weller playing a cheating husband who has to choose between his mistress (chiara caselli) or his wife, played by fanny ardant. perhaps the more star studded of the lot, with jean reno also stepping in for a coda at the end of it, which sort of expands the little universe in which this short exists. but unfortunately reno's involvement also got relegated to some stifle of laughter as it goes into the implausible domain with laser quick romantic tanglements. there was a key element adapted from l'eclisse with a kiss between a couple through a glass panel too, while the introductory tale about the story of souls was quite interesting. if there's a negative theme here this short wants to play upon, it'll be the duplicity of man.in between this short and the next was a small scene which reunited our couple from la notte, marcello mastroianni and jeanne moreau, where the former was painting a landscape which was reminiscent of that in red desert. finally, we have the final shot this body of dirt, with vincent perez as a young man going after a girl (irene jacob) whom he just met, and falling in love with her, only to realize that it is a love that is too late. it's a relatively talkie piece, just like the first story, with the characters engaging in conversation while walking the streets of the city they're in, which sort of brings to mind richard linklater's before sunrise.while on the whole the movie may have succeeded as individual pieces, they never quite measure up as a combined effort given the "excuse" to link them up was a film director's exploration of possible stories and a look for inspiration for his next film.

even though the story is light, the movie flows so beautifully and its visual so tranquil and poetic that it could almost carry the whole movie.the film consists of four interconnected stories, all about different aspect of attraction between man and/or woman and how it frequently is ethereal. their true desire seems to be always something that they cannot hold onto, it will flow out like a handful of sand.i thought the most intriguing story was the last one where the more unattainable the woman was, the more the man desires her. it parallels her deep love for god, who is infinitely out of reach, but never closer to her heart.a very good movie. 7/10

i saw this film for the first time last night. i have been thinking about it all night and this morning. i cannot say that it was my favorite film, at least not yet. i need to see it again. the cinematography is stunning. each shot has a lyricism that one would expect in a film that has wim wenders's name attached to it.it is always tempting to see de chirico in any picture of rows of orders vanishing into the gloom, but in this case the analogy fits. in many ways the figure of malkovich walking through the fog and wind of ferarra echoes the shadow of the off-canvas statue that haunts milan in the major works of the italo-greek painter. he is slightly menacing, a presence who watches and, in his capacity as a film director, exerts influence on the entire story. the dedicated wenders fan cannot help but think a little bit of damiel and cassiel wandering through the streets of berlin, watching all but not directly interacting with the inhabitants. and, following the himmel uber berlin metaphor, the angel (or in this case malkovich the director) gets to interact with one of the stories. at this point i have to bow out of taking this line of criticism too far. i need to see the movie again. i am fairly sure that this is the thread that will bring malkovich's monologue together. perhaps his musings and pontifications are pretentious, empty dialog that sound good but cannot possibly be parsed into real communication. maybe that is the whole point of it. no one can make that judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until having done his homework.we must be careful when throwing around the word "pretentious." it is easy to write off anything that smacks of the intellect as pretension, but that leads to a terrifying mental state, one in which the only conversation seen as genuine, earthy or authentic is the most banal. when we shun all discussions of philosophy, god, existence, meaning and all that brain candy, we are setting our culture up to die a slow, stupid and ugly death. perhaps this is the warning that wenders and antonioni are giving us. it certainly is not the only theme of the film, but i think that it cannot be ignored.the other (and most obvious) leitmotif is that of satisfaction. there is a lot here on that, and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of the development of this leitmotif would well exceed the 1000 word limit for this review.my advice is to see the film. but i offer a caveat: it is not an autonomous film (at least i don't think so yet). some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their times so much that the viewer needs to have a background in the zeitgeist before approaching the film. par-dela les nuages is one of those films.

i was stunned by this film. i have been renting antonioni's films/rediscovering them, and this film showed me the climax and fruits of his 50 years of directing. what an eye for setting, color, and detail! i have never seen such visual beauty and poetry filmed before. i had to stop after the first story and hold back the tears. yes, beauty moves me, like it moved keats to write ode on a grecian urn. this movie is made for the mature, emotionally and intellectually, audience. those hoping to see physical action and soap opera will be disappointed. i will have to see this film several times before i can truly appreciate it and judge it. this film should be required viewing for all cinematographers and directors.possibly a truly great film, on the order of kurosawa's dreams.

beyond the clouds is in many ways the weirdest film i have ever seen. not for its cult appeal, gore, or even for its ideas, but because of the elements that combine to make this a masterpiece of cinema. beyond the clouds was directed by michelangelo antonioni, one of italy's most famous directors. however, if you gave this film only a quick watch-over, passively i mean, it would seem one of those melodramatic and often pointless romances. this movie deserves great attention, to the point of embracing all its cheese. by cheese i don't mean a slice, but a whole brick of cheddar! the music seems like it's from some italian porno, the story and dialogue like they are from a corny japanese soap, and the metaphors are so obvious you want to smack yourself on the head.but once you get passed all this, you are engaged in an existential work of art. the cheese feeds into the subtle filming and draws our attention, perfectly, to what needs to be known. the basic plot is of four chapters, unrelated, and all about love. what we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said, people cannot communicate to each other. instead they can only communicate through each other. i suppose that's why the dialogue and plot is so cheesy, because the conversations are overly irrational with lack of causality and people's reaction overly melodramatic.i left that film thinking to myself; maybe all life is one big melodrama. we judge our feelings towards others as real and purposeful. i hate, because i have reason. but what does the hated think? maybe they think that my hate is stupid and arbitrary. in other words, melodramatic.so melodrama is actually an existential function. a corny romance is simply human interaction put under a magnifying glass, allowing us to see the futility of who we are and what we do.this is a great film, i recommend it to all!

i'm not really sure what to make of this movie, especially after seeing a great film like la notte. unfortunately i saw this in german during an antonioni film festival at the frankfurt film museum, so i didn't get to hear malkovich's great voice. he is supposed to tie together four stories about couples in italy. however, as good an actor as he is, malkovich cannot rescue the most ridiculous of the four stories portrayed here: a woman who comes up to him at a waterside cafe near a shop she owns and blurts out about how she killed her father nearby. then the two of them go home, have sex, and he leaves. it seems as if antonioni lost the subtlety had in earlier films (like the passenger) when dealing with sex and replaced it with blatant nudity.however nonsensical the storyline is, the film features two things that make it watchable: eye and ear candy. the actors and actresses are all beautiful people, and the cinematography is marvelous - scenes in old italian cities contrasting with a bit in a tall apartment building overlooking a city (reminiscent of la notte).the ear candy, however, is what really makes the film worth watching. u2 and brian eno collaborated on "your blue room" and "beach sequence," both of which set the mood perfectly in the film. the songs are available on "passengers: original soundtracks 1."

i was stunned by this film. afterwards, i didn't even want to see any films for a long time- any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison.for many, it may be the worst of antonioni- very slow, without an engaging conventional story line, microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions- and the worst of wenders- verbose, confused transcendentalism. it is composed of short distinct episodes linked by wenders' typical meandering hero's stream of consciousness, so it doesn't produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema.but for fans, the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film. wenders and antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things.

this is a special film if you know the context. antonioni, in his eighties, had been crippled by a stroke. mute and half paralyzed, his friends -- who incidentally are the best the film world has -- arranged for him to 'direct' a last significant film. the idea is that he can conjure a story into being by just looking at it. so we have a film: about a director who conjures stories by simple observation. and the matter of the (four) stories is about how the visual imagination defines love.the film emerges by giving us the tools to bring it into being through our own imagination. the result is pure movie-world: every person (except the director) is lovely in aspect or movement. some of these women are ultralovely, and they exist in a dreamy misty world of sensual encounter. there is no nuance, no hint that anything exists but what we see; no desire is at work other than what we create.i know of no other film that so successfully manipulates our own visual yearning to have us create the world we see. he understands something about not touching. no one understands van morrison visually like he does. morrison's celtic space music is predicated on precisely the same notion: the sensual touch that implies but doesn't physically touch.antonioni's redhead wife appears, appropriately as the shopkeeper and she also directs a lackluster 'making of' film that is on the dvd.ted's evaluation -- 3 of 4: worth watching.

i first saw the movie a couple of years ago and was totally and utterly impressed but its sensuality. it is one of the most touching films i have ever seen, though it might appear a little bit pretentious and artificial - too much beautiful, if you will. anyway, one thing is for sure - the camera man has done a great job - each picture deserves to be cut off the film and displayed as a separate peace of art, comparable to the chirico's or bernard buffet's paintings.the music forms a perfect background for the story, especially u2's one played between the first and the second novels at the beach scene. as for the casting - i cannot be objective since i like sophie marceau and jean renaue very much and cannot add more to the praising comments of others.however, the very fact that many people (critics and those sophisticated in cinema) criticized the movie made me watch it with a more critical eye for the second time. no doubt, the setting is splendid and the casting is gorgeous. but this is somehow not enough to make a comprehensive and cohesive film. the second novel (when sophie marceau tells her story to malcovic is somehow superficial and does not tell much about the motivations of the people involved - was it only about shooting a beautiful and sensual love scene with the naked marceau or what?). apparently, it does not add anything to the idea of the movie and even the husky voice of malcovic is being unable to link it to the main plot.other stories are more justified and are really beautifully shot, which indulges many of the logic fallacies within them. the scene when jean reneau is overlooking the city through the huge window of his apartment on the top of the high building is absolutely incredible. the feeling of moist air and fine haze, which is being spread by the first "ferrera" scene can literally be sensed through the screen. no doubt, antonioni is a great master of shades and semi-shades. my favorite novel is the last one - the most romantic, deep and meaningful - i guess that it the most antonioni-like one in the whole movie - almost a parable.probably, the overall positive impression from the movie is mainly due to the last one shot somewhere in a small ghotic italian town, with its winding narrow streets and crooked pavements, fountains with the l'eau potable and monumental cathedrals... it was laconic but really touching.i hope that my impressions and comments on the movie, however chaotic they are would motivate somebody to spend an evening watching it (it works better with the home theater, having somebody caring by your side, than in the movie theater). enjoy.i beg your pardon for the imperfect english and any possible misspellings

here's another antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or dvd. i saw it a few months ago when it ran for the first time (even in metropolitan movie capital l.a.!)for a couple of weeks and then disappeared (art house audiences seem to have opted for their own special territory, where older favorites like antonioni and resnais are only welcome as occasional curiosities).at first i was disappointed, thought the pace to be unbearably boring, and that the man had lost a chance (for years antonioni had found it difficult to find financing)at an advanced age to add another masterpiece to his canon; but knowing antonioni for what he was and how i had at first reacted to blow-up and the passenger, i refused to pass judgment until i had seen the film again. i went back the next day and i should not have been surprised that the film kept pulling me in, making me aware of things i had thought about and lost track of throughout my life, driving home, in a contemporary setting, points exposed for the first time some forty years ago in 'l'aventurra,' forming an environment of subtle moods so characteristcally and fascinatingly alienated in tone (and quite comedic actually) that i couldn't get enough. the scene with malkovich sitting on the fancy colored swings on the windswept beach, with the weather so beautifully silver skied, and the eno/u2 track in the background flowing through at just its rhythm, had been my favorite; it still was, but now the whole film was just as great! what a strange phenomenon, the complex simplicity or the invisible complex which antonioni's eye alone seems to be able to pick up and communicate. the odd thing is, though it does look at first glance like a softcore porno of some kind and it does feature plenty of sex and the maddeningly gorgeous sophie marceau and plently of other international stars to distract you, this film is unmistakably antonioni's to its core, but you will not sense to what a profound extent, until you have seen it a few times and got used to its rhythm. for example, it is quite a funny film with a deep sense of humor, something i did not notice at first, but was turned on to by another critic, and noticed to much delight on further viewings (4 before they pulled it and would've gone back for more). if this film had been promoted right and people guided to a certain extent as to how to approach it, i have no doubt it would have succeeded on the art house circuit like most of antonioni's '60s films. but the '60s are no more and the film will have to find its audience on the small screen where half its beauty will be lost even in a letterboxed dvd version (if and when it's released). i urge all film nuts general or esoteric to see 'beyond the clouds' and add a piece of magic to the tragic.

beyond the clouds is a hauntingly beautiful, elegiac work of art. the overall softness of the light that this movie is bathed in, makes you want to touch the screen. the autumnal mood conjured up could only been achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience. or, to put it another way, an old man. i know of no other movie that captures and uses the softness of light and seasonal mood with such ravishing quality as beyond the clouds. nearly all the people in this film are beautiful, unless your idea of a beautiful woman is a pneumatic blond bimbo, that is. the dialogue doesn't really matter too much, not that there is much of it anyway, and as for storylines, forget it. some films exist just as visual experiences, this is one of them. don't bother if you want "simple entertainment",this not for you. i could enthuse about the visual perfection of this movie for days, but i won't. if you are at all interested in cinematography, photography, film direction etc., watch this film.

like a lot of horror fans out there that went looking for the next great scare flick, we plundered the asian horror market for whatever we could get our hands on, leaving no dark haired ghost lady unturned. we had good reason to do so, the asian market had spawned such terrifying wonders as ringu, dark waters, juon - the grudge, and a tale of two sisters. by the time takashi miike started ripping the mick out of the genre with one missed call in 2003, the market seemed to be drying up, leaving it open for mockery and derision, despite the continued hollywood remake machine working full steam ahead. now, don't get me wrong, there were still plenty of good asian horrors being made, the likes of marebito and shutter, to mention but two, will stand as minor genre classics some day. but the lank haired ghost lady had definitely had her feed at the party, and was time to take that success-drunk tramp home to bed! then along comes a film like noroi - the curse. a film that is smart enough to pay subtle homage to it's roots, yet throws the rulebook out the window whilst doing it. what i'm about to describe in terms of plot will probably make you think there is nothing new here at all. the film is a documentary about one of japan's top paranormal investigators as he receives stories and tip offs on ghostly goings on. he starts investigating the claims by a woman that she regularly hears a baby crying in the house next door, yet there is no baby there, apart from a middle aged woman and her son. these two disappear sharpish when the reporter pokes his nose around, but strange other coincidences start popping up. a psychic young girl, a mentally ill clairvoyant, a pretty young actress who had a strange vision, a lot of dead pigeons, and a very sinister demon by the name of kagutaba, leading to a truly terrifying showdown in a small historical town...to say any more on the plot might ruin the fun a bit. the film is shot in 'faux documentary' fashion, and incorporates footage from tv shows and news reports, and the labels via subtitles lets you know where you are in terms of the time line. the film has drawn more than a few comparisons to the blair witch project, but apart from the shooting format and the creepy trip through the woods late at night, the comparison ends there really.what is refreshing about noroi is how it doesn't pander to modern horror audiences. if you are expecting croaky ghost ladies to pop out of the attic, look elsewhere. the film's strength lies in it's slow, gradual build up of terror, a terror so profound that it will stick with you for days after watching it. the climax is pretty damned freaky, but just when you think the film is over, you get treated to the 'real' ending when the credits start to roll, and sweet holy f*ck, is it a killer. in terms of acting, it is mostly convincing. you get some 'comedy' relief from the crazy, tin foil covered clairvoyant, but that soon dries up half way through the film. the film also has a slightly 'nastier' feel than a lot of asian ghost horror, as there is a violent streak to some of the events too.overall, noroi is one to watch on your own, late at night. not since my first viewing of ringu ten years ago have i been so delightfully creeped out watching a horror film. it is one that will itch away at you until it is too late, then it is under your skin. just let yourself go to this one completely. and not a lank haired ghost lady in sight?? no wonder it has barely been released outside of japan, let alone had an american remake lined up yet. check this one out if you can, essential viewing in my books!

another hand-held horror means another divisive movie that fans should still seek out and make up their own minds about.imagine a cross between the blair witch project and the grudge and you're close to the overall content of this movie. it's another videotaped horror but this time most of it is edited together in readiness for a video doc that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who disappeared.i certainly had a feeling of dread while watching this movie (does anyone do dreadful better than our asian friends?) but the creepy moments, the genuinely creepy moments, were sadly a bit fewer and farther between than i had hoped. i also felt that i was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when apparent "revelations" appeared throughout so i certainly can't recommend this as highly as [*rec].having said that, it would be remiss of me not to highly recommend any film that goes on at length about ectoplasmic worms, contains at least two subtly spooky ghost moments and made sure that i had to put the lights back on for a while when the sun went down.check it out if you have been enjoying some of the other hand-held genre releases of late. and the finale is a hair-raising doozy.see this if you like: the last broadcast, pulse, angel heart.

a documentary filmmaker explores seemingly unrelated paranormal incidents connected by the legend of an ancient demon called the "kagutaba."from the looks of it, the film looks like one of those camcorder movies that have been popular these last few months, even one that's going to be released next week (paranormal activity)! however, unlike movies like cloverfield, rec, and blair witch, where most of those movies are in complete chaos and mayhem with all of the shakiness, this one is basically shown in a traditional documentary style. it has tv excerpts and interviews and the scares are very subtle, well, excluding the last 20 minutes where we go into the chaos effect and where the fear factor is raised up tremendously.and it works. the film is very engrossing and it makes you think. yes, you heard me right: it makes you think. you have to pay attention to those unrelated details given throughout the film and the payoff is great when, in course of the film, these things start to intertwine one another. the film is also very slow moving, which, in this case, is a good thing. we, as the audience, get to absorb the details shown on screen, however subtle or blatant they are.above all, it's a frightening little film. i'm a person who is scared of ghosts and the paranormal more than killers who slashes away teenage victims so yes, the film gave me some nightmares. there are some images in here that are really disturbing to watch, including one closer in the end where it makes you go "what am i looking at?!" well, it's better left unanswered. there are around ten reoccurring characters in here, all of which gave authentic performances in their roles.the only thing i don't like about the film is the ending because most questions are left unanswered. the question "that's it?" went though my mind. it left a bad taste in my mouth. however, the rest of the film is just engrossing and really frightening. don't see this alone in the dark because you'll regret that choice. also, i can see in a couple of years that hollywood would remake this film. that will be interesting.

i, for one, absolutely loved this movie.it is not a "typical asian horror" where you would see a gruesome looking ghost (usually a woman) that is going around scaring people. you barely see any ghosts for a majority of the film, but the way this movie keeps you interested in the plot and characters is genius. this is not the movie for you if you're into gore (e.g. saw, hostel) or "surprise scares" where stuff pops out at you (hollywood horror, slasher films), but this movie has an underlying "creepy" factor throughout the entire movie which i loved. noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror amongst the ridiculous remakes and unoriginal crap being released by hollywood in today's society.please don't let the documentary-style of filming turn you off (why should it?!). it is far superior to the blair witch project because, for one, the acting in noroi is brilliant and it really makes you really feel like you're watching something you're not supposed to be seeing.noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies i have ever seen. only a few films have made it into my top 5 horror; and this movie holds a solid #1 spot on my list.

being a great fan of horror, especially asian horror, i have seen tons of movies, but this one is outstanding. why? it does have a plot (which is unfortunately quite rare among horror movies). the actors did a good job. it feels like a real documentary film (even if it's not). it does not get boring for a moment. the director cleverly combines the plot with the acts of a certain japanese magic cult (perhaps this cult never existed, but still, it's believable). it reminded me of the similarly great movie "forbidden siren".to me the one and only annoying thing about the movie was the character hori, the psychic, but this is subjective.i recommend this movie to all fans of quality horror.9 out of 10.

i can't praise this film enough. it had a lot of that hand-held, first-person shaking camera which i love (and some hate, because it makes them sick), like rec, cloverfield and blair witch project.it is a long movie for its kind, but i didn't even notice because the film was so interesting. by just showing the footage from a paranormal reporter's work the movie keeps up the pace, making it a real-time experience for the viewer.while i would never call this film the "scariest horror ever made", i'd have to say it's certainly one of the best i've seen. the fear factor here is constructed by details in the images, camera glitches, events linked to one another which lend a very mysterious and haunting tone to the movie. the horror is more in what is not shown, but left to our imaginations. the ending is perfect, and be warned that you might have nightmares afterwards. a second viewing is highly recommended, though.watch this one alone in the dark, don't expect anything and you'll have fun.

noroi follows a documentary filmmaker, masafumi kobayashi, as he slowly uncovers something mysterious and evil that's leaving a trail of dead bodies in its wake. after interviewing a woman who claims to hear loud baby's cries coming from the house next door (where there is no baby), kobayashi heads over to talk to the neighbor. he's greeted with hostility by the unhinged, disheveled woman (maria takagi) who answers the door (and promptly slams it in his face) and gets a peek at her 6-year-old son through a window. strangely, both the woman and her son disappear just days after his visit (leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on their back porch), and the woman who first complained about the noises, as well as her daughter, are both killed in a mysterious accident not long after that. this piques kobayashi's interest and he sets out on a quest to find out what's going on. he soon uncovers that those with psychic abilities and extra-sensory perception seem to be tuning into something sinister, unexplainable and possibly even apocalyptic. well-known 10-year-old clairvoyant, and tv celebrity, kana (rio kanno) seems to think we may all be doomed, but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of much help. another female psychic/actress (marika matsumoto) becomes involved, as does mr. nori, a mentally unstable kook/psychic who wears a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and thinks people are being eaten by what he refers to "ectoplasmic worms." clues eventually lead back to the site of a small village that's now covered by a lake, and the legend of an ancient demon known as kagutaba...unlike many other hand-held horror flicks, this one depends just as much on the plot as it does reactionary first-person scares. thankfully there's something of a storyline here, a very interesting and intricate one at that, so it doesn't rely on glimpses of horrific things through spastic camera-work every once in awhile to keep your interest. the way masafumi travels around following leads in search of the truth - with well placed jolts along the way - reminded me somewhat of the omen in its pacing. the film also doesn't entirely consist of footage shot by the documentarian, but weaves in news reports and television variety shows as if what we're watching is an already completed documentary. that helps to break up some of the monotony usually associated with films shot in this particular style. the performances are good enough not to harm any of the realism of the 'actual' footage either. overall, it's a well-made horror film, with lots of plot shifts, some suspense and quite a few genuinely creepy moments, that's well worth checking out. my only real gripe is that it could have used a little trimming here and there and seems to go on a bit too long. otherwise, pretty good stuff.

this review contains some small, yet significant, spoilers.---i just finished watching my copy of noroi......and it was great! this might sound cheesy, but several times during the film i forgot it wasn't real xd the acting is convincing, although the acting from masafumi kobayashi (playing himself, i think...) seems a bit hokey at times. marika matsumoto (yuka in takashi shimizu's rinne) seemed to change levels of believability throughout the movie: sometimes she's really good, then the next moment she's really cheesy (especially at the end's exorcism and subsequent re-possession.a character that was ridiculous at first was mr. hori, a man covered in tinfoil believing "ectoplasmic worms" are coming to eat everyone. he provides unintentional comic relief at the beginning (acting like the stereotypical alien abduction-type victim) but near the end has some really creepy scenes.the plot was very interesting and really kept me wondering how everything tied together. there are some things that aren't really explained (like a mass suicide in a tokyo park and where the reincarnated kagutaba-boy came from) but everything else turned out fine. the ending has got to be one of the most unnerving, if not the scariest, sequences i've ever had the pleasure to witness.all in all, noroi is a very fun way to spend 2 hours and the new hong kong r3 dvd provides great picture and sound (most importantly the english subtitles- engrish free!) for a great j-horror experience. i highly recommend picking it up.

never posted anything here before, but after watching noroi i just felt that i had to write down my thoughts about it.firstly do not compare this to blair witch, this movie deserves far better than that! simply put, noroi is (probably) one of the best horror movies i have ever seen (and i have seen a lot!).i really liked how the movie presents itself not as a standard horror flick, but as a documentary filmed by a reporter (i think?) named kobayashi and his cameraman. without spoiling to much about the plot, i can say it that it starts with kobayashi doing research on a series of seemingly unrelated events, that turns out to be connected to something far more darker and sinister.while the story might not be that original in itself, what really hooked me with noroi was the incredibly eerie atmosphere. if you're looking for cheap scares and seat-jumping scenes this movie might not be for you. this movie is all about the mood it presents, with haunting images and a general feeling of foreboding suspense. the documentary style filming just makes it farm more believable.this is also helped a lot by the acting which is superb, although not perfect for the general part of the movie! far better than in most other movies in this type of genre.well enough ranting from me, i highly recommend noroi to everyone, it is suspenseful, creepy, well acted and the first movie that has scared me in ages.

anyone familiar with horror films knows that most of them are not scary at all. some people enjoy gorefests with subpar story lines and character development. i personally enjoy horror films that focus on atmosphere and interesting concepts (e.g., a tale of two sisters, kairo, etc.). whatever the type of horror film one personally likes, there are only a select few that really scare you. noroi is one of them.this is a documentary-style movie, which means that the entire film is a compilation of video clips that are linked by the legend of a demonic entity named kagutaba. the premise is that a journalist filmed his own footage by interviewing people associated with the demonic rituals associated with kagutaba, then compiled footage from other sources that link with his research. what results is a relentlessly chilling experience that feels very real and very disturbing, despite the fact that the story itself is fake.some have compared noroi with the blair witch project, but the only similarity is the documentary style. one obvious difference between the films is that noroi scares the viewer by linking events to one another using different sources. for example, the journalist records the exterior of a house that he is researching and sees something strange on the porch. later in the film, a clip from another character's home video introduces that very same strange occurrence. the viewer's memory links the two incidents and chills start running down their spine. another example involves a television show with a child psychic who answers every single question correctly except for one. in fact, her answer is so wrong that the viewer may wonder what the filmmakers were thinking. later on, however, that wrong answer turns out to be linked to an extremely disturbing event. this is intelligent film-making indeed.another difference between noroi and blair witch is that noroi provides not one, but two very long finales, the second of which is placed a minute after the credits start to roll and is the single greatest scare scene in the history of horror cinema. i do not say such things lightly. it totally wrecked me in a wonderous way.other aspects of film-making are well done. the legend and ritualistic background of kagutaba are very interesting and most of the actors did a good job. the only over-the-top performance comes from a guy who's supposed to be crazy anyway, so that's expected. the cinematography is intentionally gritty because all of the footage is supposed to represent videos shot on camcorders. japanese films are not known for their special effects, but the effects used here were awesome. in some cases they create an other-worldly feel (e.g., the static interference or the first finale) but in other cases they are alarmingly realistic (e.g., the second finale).when all is said and done, noroi goes down as the scariest film i've ever seen. i would go so far as to say that there is no film in existence that provides such sheer terror from beginning to end like noroi does. see it now.

www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html an excellent tv series that should be captured on dvd. this was a show i rarely missed. i found a petition to bring it back on dvd. i recall one show where this obese lady wore a pair of glasses that let her food talk to her. needless to say she could not eat her friends so she starved to death. another episode had an accountant visiting an underground sewer & subway security branch. the accountant wanted to shut down the funding for the project. as it turns out the security branch was underfunded to fight the cannibalistic creatures that lived in the dark. www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html

one reasons why they call the 80's, "the awesome 80's" is quality television. shows like the wonder years, war of the worlds (the series), v, amazing stories, and many more have always left an impression to each "fortunate" one of us that in time will always find a way to reawaken itself. to top that, here comes monsters! a series quite unique of its own, and a theme fully dedicate to - monsters. may it be the good, the bad, and the morbid.if you're a fan of classic shows or if you have the fascination of horror films then this one is absolutely for you. provided you can find this rare gem. even the newer generations will be in awe with some of the episode with its grittiness, it's indiscriminating use of gore effects or its story telling power and simplicity. i guarantee, because i'm 23 :).be sure not to miss this!although, it's a show seemingly forgotten by the modern world, it will always be with those who can always remember...

i think that it's great how chiller picked up this series and showing it for this generation. film making has come such a long way especially with the special effects and for one to be able to watch archived shows that they never knew existed, they will certainly be able to see the progress compared to now. monsters is neither lame nor spectacular but it is entertaining. it takes creativity for the types of story lines they came up with and each generation seems to have it's own horror series. this particular series was not as horrifying as the friday the 13th, the series, nor as adult oriented as the freddy's nightmares..it was something that an entire family could watch and still get a laugh and a fright at the same time. i am happy the chiller channel shows it in their line-up, i am just about caught up on the episodes i missed when i was growing up.

this was one of the best half-hour horror/suspense/fantasy shows of the eighties, without a doubt. granted the show had a barely capable cast with every single episode, and it stank as far as production values (i.e. the sets) went, but darn it i have to give it some credit for being gutsy with the plots. i mean the plot of each episode was edgy enough that even i, a hardened horror movie, shock-film, and 70's grind-house buff got a little sickened and creeped out. great show, just great, regardless of what the other reviewers have said here. my favorite episode was called "bug house", yeah that was the title i think? anyhow it still gives me the willies every time i think about it to this day, almost 20 years after it first premiered. other shows like "tales from the darkside", "the outer limits" and (of course) "the twilight zone" were definitely better production values-wise, but in my opinion they ain't got a thing as far as plot lines go when compared to this sick little show! it definitely paved the way for the even more graphic cult classic phenomenon that was, "tales from the crypt".

this show has to be my favorite out of all the 80's horror tv shows. like tales from the darkside, also from the same creators, this show is a rare gem. if you agree with me, please sign this petition i started, to get the word out for monsters and get it out on dvd. here is the petition address: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html some of my favorite episodes would have to be glim glim, and rain dance. i also loved the opening intro with the monster family. that used to creep me out! one of the things i would have to ask the dvd creators to include would be the organ sound heard right before where the commercial break would be. i don't know if any of you remember that part but that's one of the main things that brings back memories to me. i mean, come on! war of the worlds the tv series already has been released on dvd, so i say monsters, and also tales from the darkside, and friday the 13th the series should be released too! we the fans need to speak our minds! we need this awesome show on dvd so please spread the word!!!

this picture is an interesting saga of the struggle of pioneers led by daniel boone in the wilderness of cumberland gap while being threatened by hostile indians. a treacherous frenchman is the cause of all the trouble between the settlers and the red men while boone tries to convince the indians that the pioneers only want to build homes and live in peace. the film has a certain appeal because it is not a polished production but there are good action scenes, although somewhat violent for its time. the cast is comprised of b actors but they are all good, especially lon chaney as the indian chief. bruce bennett is okay as boone but is a bit too clean cut and soft spoken to be believable as a frontiersman. the dialogue is rather trite but the scenery lends itself to the realism of the kentucky backwoods.

i was enchanted by niami's debut. i hope that we'll soon see more of his work. i was lucky enough to catch the film during its brief nyc run and it struck me as a worthy successor to such downtown 80s flicks as desperately seeking susan and after hours, but with a gentle european whimsey that made it fresh and fun. a strong ensemble cast playing mostly against type was a pleasure. and i thought the complexly inter-threaded plots were just right. sandra bernhard puts in her best performance since king of comedy, while peter stormare is hilarious, and ling bai touching. see it.

despite its new york setting & new york characters, 'summer in the city' is not an american movie, it is better than that. what is most unusual is the mixing of styles and genres. director niami's shows a deft touch in combining comedy with tragedy, pathos with drama.the secret of niami's success appears to be a smorgasboard of great characters - each could have their own film built around them - and then filling them out with beautifully realized performances from one of the most wonderfully eclectic casts one would struggle to find in the same country let alone in the same movie, ranging from bai ling to ornella muti, robert burke to peter stormare who here reveals that he has a lot more in him than the bad guy stereotypes he plays in hollywood pictures. even sandra bernhard is funny here !an added bonus, cream on the substantial cake, is john cale's soundtrack.

this film did a wonderful job of capturing nyc stereotypes at there best. if you want a simple, cute story however, you won't find it here. the related tales are woven together in a manner that does an excellent job of capturing the close-knit yet contrastingly anonymous lifestyle that is manhattan. a perfect watch for those who enjoy and can laugh at new york life in its most natural state.

i saw this movie awhile back and can't seem to track it down. does anyone know where i can get a hold of it? i feel it is worth seeing again.i'm sorry to say i had never heard of chloe nicholle until this film. yes she can act. when i first began to track this movie down i mistook it for another one of her movies, sex spa. the plot seems similar to me but the roles are reversed.this is the first film i've seen dru berrymore. i looked up some of her other films and i feel she looks better as a blonde. i agree this is a good introductory movie. not too soft. not too hard. you got to start somewhere.

there's not much anyone can say about this flick....the plot is quite simple: two police officers (who also happen to be lovers) are using a brothel as a stakeout in order to catch a criminal, with the help of the "lady of the house", played by hardcore pornstar chloe. as anyone can guess, there's a few plot twists and some blurred alliances, but the writing was just horrible, even for a softcore movie.i've read some previous posts about nicole hilbig's accent (she plays the female cop). yes, it's hard to understand what she's saying at times, but i think i've placed it. i did some sniffing around....i think she's from germany, hence her odd-sounding accent. she makes an impression even without speaking, however...she's got a great looking body.there were a couple of "from behind" sex scenes in this movie that were quite graphic for a softcore film....excellent work there. the three-way scene toward the end wasn't bad either.*spoiler alert*i kinda knew the female cop was gonna turn into a part-time call girl at the end. she enjoyed her three-way way too much.*end spoiler*i'm not gonna nitpick about the story too much, seeing as this is a low-budget, direct-to-video softcore flick. however, it just seems like i've seen way too many movies in this genre with a similar type of storyline.women: b (chloe and hilbig were okay as the eye-candy) sex: b+ (scenes were kinda short, but good) story: c (a recycled plot, but whatever works, eh?) overall: b-

thank you the filmzone for showing this sleazy soft core sex flick at 1 a.m. i truly enjoyed it. to be honest, i expected a lot more from a sexy cast with mckayla, dru berrymore, and of course, the talented chloe nicholle (as rebecca carter).the production values are truly bad mainly because of the low budget but a little more effort wouldn't harm. for example, the cinematography makes it look like a hard core porno movie. there's absolutely no effort in lightning. but let's ignore that fact because let's be honest, we watched "pleasures of sin" because of the high amounts of sex.the sex factor is pretty good and offers steamy, explicit scenes. chole nicholle delivers the best performance of the female cast.so my advice is , watch this movie if you are in the mood for good explicit sex or just watch it if you are a fan of mrs. nicholle.recommended only for the sex scenes; don't expect anything else.

i've taken another look at this film and still consider it pretty good. chloe is one of the few hardcore stars who really can act. she appears occasionally in soft core such as "body of love" and "lady chatterly's stories" on showtime. i thought nicole hilbig did ok too with her nice body and charming accent. too bad she's not in more films.

progeny is about a husband and wife who experience time loss while making love. completely unaware of what this bizarre experience means they try to go on with their lives. the hubby begins questioning the bizarre event and gets help through a very annoying psychiatrist. he comes to believe that aliens are responsible for this lapse in time and that the unborn baby he once thought was his and his wife's actually belongs to the aliens.if ya ask me, this is a great scifi/horror story. taking a highly questionable real-life scenario involving alien abduction and hybrid breeding is definite thumbs up from this guy. i love all things related to aliens and this story definitely delivered some good ideas. so if you also share an interest in things extraterrestrial, you should be pretty happy with progeny. at least story-wise anyways.unfortunately the movie overall is pretty average. with average acting by all actors. yep, even by the consistently awesome mr. dourif, who still does deliver the best performance. though the black head doctor, delivers his lines really well. there are a few points in the flick where some of the delivery is cringe or laugh worthy, which is fine in my book. i like them cheesy and this had a little bit of some nice stinky cheese, and i mean that in a good way.anyways, with a less than stellar script you can't really blame all the actors. i especially didn't care for the mother hysteria the film went for. she wanted a baby so badly that she'd neglect and dismiss everything her loving husband (who's a doctor!!) said to her. it almost reached a point where you actually didn't care what happened to her.the progeny is another flick by brian yuzna from the icky-sticky film, society. again he delivers some slimy effects, and again he delivers a pretty unique tale of horror. if you're into scifi/horror or are a fan of dourif and or yuzna films, there's no real reason not to check out this flick if you get the chance. a generous 7 outta 10.

first, let me review the movie. this movie creeps me out, and i don't even believe in aliens! however, the movie has its flaws.there are three acts to this movie. act one is perfect. it sets up the movie, and really builds up the creep factor. i must say the score is great! everything is set up and it's set up perfectly.act two begins when jillian, playing sherry burton, goes to the shrink. they hypnotize her, and she recalls the abduction. act two ruins the film when the aliens show up. "screaming mad george" did the effects for the aliens. i must say they did a good job, except with their depiction of the "gray" aliens. no offense, but the grays looked like inflatable door prizes.on a side note, i liked how they treated hypnosis in acts one and two. if you paid attention, you would notice that the husband and wife had two different memories. in the husband's version of events, the blue light zaps them and his wife says, "somebody's here," or something like it. it makes sense. the husband is concerned for his wife. "someone" may hurt her. that's his issue. however in her version of events, she says, "help me!" she does not say "somebody's here." this also makes sense. the aliens are after her. wanting her husband to help and save her is her issue. now back to the film.act three turns the film into a gore fest. it begins with a "strange" ultrasound procedure. it's a typical gore fest, but it does have a surprise ending. i won't ruin it because it's actually an interesting development. the dvd and commentaries takes itself too seriously, but if you think wilford brimley saying "horsesh**" is funny, you might want to check it out in the cast interviews section. now on to my praise of jillian mcwhirter.i could only hope jillian will read this. i had never seen her before, but wow, what a performance! let me tell the rest of you this. first of all, this is supposed to be a serious film. the details i will now describe may sound campy and fun, like "humanoids from the deep" (1980), but it really isn't. got that? okay.jillian is hot, naturally good-looking. she is naked for a lot of the film, a good thing. unfortunately, she is usually being assaulted, terrorized, and raped, a very bad thing. however, she must act in a lot of this film naked. she gets points for overcoming that. she has to act happy, sad, horny, afraid, and physically hurt all in the span of a few moments. the turnaround of emotion is astounding! she has to cheer for joy when she learns she's pregnant. she has to scream in terror when the aliens take out her guts. she has to act very angry when her husband suggests that the baby isn't his. she has to act like she's in denial, saying nothing is wrong with her baby, when her husband says otherwise. a denial, i should note, that is really forced upon her by the aliens controlling her. i am talking oscar-caliber performance here!then there is the rape scene. it's disturbing, but since it's just some rubber alien, it's not too bad. in this scene, the alien is not a "gray" alien, so i will describe it. the alien has tentacles, and it's kind of like a table. jillian is on the table-like part, restrained by the tentacles. by her head is the alien's head. the alien's head is long, and it flips down so that its head is now above jillian's legs. then, the alien's hey-nanu-nanu comes out of his forehead. it's forehead! sounds pretty campy, right? well, jillian plays it straight, and she pulls it off! she has to act like an alien with its hey-nanu-nanu coming from its forehead is raping her, and she pulls it off! it's a very intense scene, but that's not what makes it. you see, this scene is done in a flashback. what makes the scene is jillian's performance recalling these events. she is just lying in a hospital bed under hypnosis recalling the alien abduction, but her acting here is more intense than the actual rape scene! how many actors can pull off a performance in a scene that describes a rape that is more intense than the scene with the rape? not many! however, jillian does it.i could go on and on. jillian, if you ever read this, i want you to know that i, (name withheld) alias of megamanx-1, believe you are the best actress ever. you are the best actress ever! i could only hope you read this and take it with you always.as for everyone else, "progeny" (1999) is an okay to good film. i would recommend it.

<-----minor spoilers!----->a woman gets pregnant, but not by her husband. she develops 'something' inside her, or at least thats what her husband thinks. they go through a lot of hard times, while she is on the brink of a nervous breakdown. the husband contacts an ufo professor, and with his help they try to find out what is wrong with her.<-----minor spoilers!---->the story could have been a bit better, or at least be made less predictable, but the movie is catchy and it got me and my sister hooked through the entire movie without a problem. the acting is very good, and the filming is much better than normal, if you compare this to your normal b-alien movie. the effects are good, and something is happening every second of the movie. the characters are really likable, and apart from a stupid nurse in oné scene, they are all very convincing in their roles.i thought it was a good movie, and can recommend it, if you like alien/monster-abduction movies!7/10 - the story could have been a bit less predictable.

an odd beam of light penetrates the bedroom of dr. craig burton(arnold vosloo)and his wife sherry(jillian mcwhirter)as they are making love. about two hours are unaccounted for as they embrace seemingly unharmed. under hypnosis during a session with psychiatrist dr. susan lamarche(lindsay crouse), craig discovers that his wife was impregnated by aliens. sherry resists this notion as absurd and is quite happy to relay news to her husband that she is indeed pregnant. ecstatic after their trying for ages to get pregnant, sherry is frightened at craig's persistence of the fetus not being his..this stems from a check on his low sperm count with odds especially high that he could in no way have impregnated his wife. awkward, troubling experiences with the fetus inside her leads sherry to some scary discoveries..her doctor, david wetherly(wilford brimley)finds that the ultra-sound gives some unusual results of the developing infant's appearance, but it's craig who notices that it resembles an alien! sparks ignite cutting out the electrical equipment, even shutting off wetherly's pacemaker! through hypnosis, sherry reveals the experience of her abduction, but lamarche believes her problem is psychological not physiological. with no one believing his wife's alien impregnation theory, craig turns to sociologist dr. bert clavell(brad dourif), whose work is in the studies of alien life and abduction. but, bert is reluctant to help craig who will go to the ends of the earth to save his wife's life from possible harm. tragic results occur as lamarche and others try to keep craig from his goals of "cutting the thing out" believing he is mad. craig will still pursue his task trying to drag bert down this path with him.grim, absorbing horror tale about one man's struggle to save his wife from the harm of beings no one else believes exist. thankfully, dourif's character isn't some quack nutjob but an intelligent doctor who wishes to learn more, but his pursuit of the truth of aliens isn't hostile..he does hope to learn from sherry, but isn't incredibly demanding in this goal. the story is told realistically..it's easy to understand why others might deem craig off-his-rocker. vosloo doesn't take the character too far, but expresses the distress of his current situation. how can he save his wife from this hostiles and prove to others that he's not nuts? mcwhirter deserves credit for the demands of the difficult abduction scenes where her unfortunate character is naked on this table being probed and molested by these things. crouse is fine in her limited, but important role as the voice of reason in a situation where her clients seem out of control psychologically. the monster effects are icky and effective. i think the film works quite well and director yuzna deserves credit for restraining himself for this film at least. the final twenty minutes as craig tries to perform his "removal surgery" with a scared bert watching the crazy situation escalate is nail-biting.you know, fans of "fire in the sky" might dig this flick.

this movie will undoubtably not go over well with some, because most of the horror is mental. but it does have a little something for almost everyone, including a couple of really cool abduction scenes with aliens. the film makes extensive use of alien abduction mythology, while also showing a bit more intelligence about some facets of abduction myths than you would expect out of a movie. jillian mcwhirter is excellent in what had to have been a grueling performance.

i put in the dvd expecting camp perversion from the creators of society and re-animator, and was quite surprised to become involved in an authentically suspenseful tale. acting was top-notch (nice to see vosloo in a protagonist role after a long string of villains), the storyline involving, and the few twists fairly surprising. i figured i would fast forward through much of it to get to the abduction scenes, but instead watched it through, only being let down at the very end.maybe i'm being too lenient, but as i stated before, i wasn't expecting much more than alien sex. of course, if you are looking for some hot alien sex, you will be let down. it was mostly quick-cut exam table nonsense with a blink-and-you'll-miss-it glimpse of an interesting 'impregnator' alien.

it would be so easy to dismiss an alien abduction movie before even seeing it - as i did - but this is well worth a look. if you think about it, its not an easy subject matter to handle but this film manages to suspend disbelief which in itself is a feat for such a way out subject. casting the main character as a doctor was a sensible move which lends credence to his willingness to believe in the possibility of alien abduction. vosloo plays it very sensitively involving us in his pain and confusion at the weird events that befall himself and his wife. special effects are used sparingly but to shocking effect and at times the movie is totally gripping but sadly there are a couple of points where the plot wanders and leaves some confusion. also, after building to a tense climax the ending is something of a let down. the supporting characters were unnecessarily weak (the alien hunter) or menacing (the psychiatrist) which also served to detract.but all in all it raised some interesting issues amongst which was a telling line "how do think animals feel when we experiment on them".the concept of "lost time" was also thought provoking.

this is a phenomenal movie. truly one of the best movies i have ever watched. i am a serious critic and it takes much to stir me, but this movie had all the right combinations for "stirring". the passion of the actors,without the overacting, the aching for all the characters involved, the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce, all make this a must see movie, despite the fact that it is 1970s. this is definitely not an "old movie", but a classic/vintage movie. i hope you engage with it as i did when you consider how volatile relationships of all kinds can be, when you also consider how deep pain associated with love can be and how the hardest decisions to make will always be the most painful, but once they are made the pain will subside, but only gradually. this movie certainly demonstrates that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that leaving certainly is not synonymous with lost/lack of love. the 'crafting' of this movie certainly emanates from a place deep within someone's heart and mind.

i have seen this film on 3 different occasions.on the first occasion,i was bowled over by this film.it appeared as a very kind film to me.i hated this film as a sentimental garbage on my second viewing.however my third viewing reasserted my belief that it is a good film.there is a lot of emotional power in this film especially scenes of emotional confrontation between mr kramer and madam kramer.there are some scenes in which meryl streep appears a cruel person despite the fact that she is a beauty in real life.dustin hoffman appears as a lost hero unable to grapple with the recent task of his child's custody.there was even a controversy on the sets of this film.according to the master cameraman nestor almendros there was a shot in which he just escaped getting hurt as the character of mr.kramer,in order to show the intensity of his anger,decides to break a glass hard.luckily nothing happened to nestor.kramer versus kramer shows the destruction of a family structure.it also tells how family must be maintained if there are kids involved.

this is probably the best cinematic depiction of life in a manhattan ad agency: the pressure to perform; client and agency demands; the parties; the creativity; the money; the cool surface with powerful corporate undercurrents. toss in parenthood for dustin hoffman. the movie is textured and deep. it follows his internal relationship as he tries to understand and live with what's going on; his relationship with meryl streep (and her friend, who becomes his friend), and his the relationship with his son. while meryl streep was great, did she set the record for least screen time to win an oscar? she sure can deliver when she is on, though.

moving beyond words is this heart breaking story of a divorce which results in a tragic custody battle over a seven year old boy.one of "kramer v. kramer's" great strengths is its screenwriter director robert benton, who has marvellously adapted avery corman's novel to the big screen. he keeps things beautifully simple and most realistic, while delivering all the drama straight from the heart. his talent for telling emotional tales like this was to prove itself again with "places in the heart", where he showed, as in "kramer v. kramer", that he has a natural ability for working with children.the picture's other strong point is the splendid acting which deservedly received four of the film's nine academy award nominations, two of them walking away winners. one of those was dustin hoffman (best actor), who is superb as frustrated business man ted kramer, a man who has forgotten that his wife is a person. as said wife joanne, meryl streep claimed the supporting actress oscar for a strong, sensitive portrayal of a woman who had lost herself in eight years of marriage. also nominated was jane alexander for her fantastic turn as the kramer's good friend margaret. final word in the acting stakes must go to young justin henry, whose incredibly moving performance will find you choking back tears again and again, and a thoroughly deserved oscar nomination came his way.brilliant also is nestor almendros' cinematography and jerry greenberg's timely editing, while musically henry purcell's classical piece is used to effect.truly this is a touching story of how a father and son come to depend on each other when their wife and mother leaves. they grow together, come to know each other and form an entirely new and wonderful relationship. ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new outlook on life, and slowly comes to realise why joanne had to go.certainly if nothing else, "kramer v. kramer" demonstrates that nobody wins when it comes to a custody battle over a young child, especially not the child himself.saturday, june 10, 1995 - t.v.strong drama from avery corman's novel about the heartache of a custody battle between estranged parents who both feel they have the child's best interests at heart. aside from a superb screenplay and amazingly controlled direction, both from robert benton, it's the superlative cast that make this picture such a winner.hoffman is brilliant as ted kramer, the man torn between his toppling career and the son whom he desperately wants to keep. excellent too is streep as the woman lost in eight years of marriage who had to get out before she faded to nothing as a person. in support of these two is a very strong jane alexander as mutual friend margaret, an outstanding justin henry as the boy caught in the middle, and a top cast of extras.this highly emotional, heart rending drama more than deserved it's 1979 academy awards for best film, best actor (hoffman) and best supporting actress (streep).wednesday, february 28, 1996 - t.v.

ever since `midnight cowboy' i have been on the lookout for films with dustin hoffman and have mostly not been disappointed. ever since `kramer vs kramer' i have been on the lookout for films with meryl streep and have mostly not been disappointed. she gave a superb performance, really one of her best, in `sophie's decision' and i lapped her up in `out of africa'. that these two actors came together over 20 years ago for `kramer vs kramer' was definitely a very good idea: the result is an excellent character drama with a theme which is still very relevant in today's society.on divorcing everyone has a pretty bad time, though the kids seem to suffer most..beautifully handled by robert benton in some original directing presenting some memorable scenes: even the passageway takes on character and should be included in the cast! and as for the breakfast scene with billy (justin henry), just simply magnificent. just how do you get an eight-year-old to act? benton managed it, and of course with hoffman there seemed to be good electricity: the result is certainly engaging, endearing, and convincing. justin henry's performance must rank among the best 5 or 6 kids' performances of all time. the best thing, once again, was the naturalness, there was no going over the top, so frequent these days.this film came up again on the small screen the other night, though i have had it in my video collection for years: it is still worth watching and paying attention to everything. around 7½ out of 10.

life was going great for new york city advertising artist ted kramer. he had a great job and a loving wife. no, actually, his wife wasn't so loving, for when ted returned home late from work that night his wife, joanna, had a suit case packed and was heading out the door. he tried to stop her, but she just got into the elevator and out of ted's life. well, now in addition to his job he's now got to mind the house as well as their 6-year-old son, billy; ted assured his boss that his wife's leaving would not affect his job performance in any way. it did however affect his performance as a father. he blew up when billy spilled punch on his client artwork! well, some time later ted and billy receive a letter from joanna, and it was obvious from her letter that she wasn't coming back. ted was distraught. well, he was late coming home from work on billy's birthday, which made billy sore at him. ted was late to work one day and his boss yelled at him because he had missed a very important client meeting. when he got home, he yelled at billy for sneaking ice cream during dinner. then later he truthfully told billy that the break-up between he and joanna may have been his fault, not billy's; ted invited a good friend, phyllis bernard over that night, and well, billy got his first look at a naked woman. when ted took billy to the park the following day, he fell off the jungle gym and landed face-first onto his toy plane. ted literally ran him to the hospital where they had to administer stitches. after that, life began taking a downward spiral for ted. then one day out of the blue he received a phone call from none other than joanna! they met in a corner café. at first they have a pleasant conversation but then joanna informs him that she has returned to collect her son and take him with her. ted would have none of it and stormed out. well life got even worse for ted when his boss, jim o'connor, took him out to lunch and abruptly fired him. not only that but joanna was choosing to sue for custody of billy, and without a job, ted didn't stand a chance in hell for winning. he hired himself a lawyer, john shaunessy, who charged a pretty penny: $15,000 exact change. and that's if they win. ted was also able to find a new job. it was actually a step down from what he used to do with a considerable cut in salary but he accepted with great determination. finally the court date, january 9, 1980, arrived. judge atkins presiding. joanna took the stand and shaunessy proceeded to question her about why she left ted and about her other relationships and how they were failures. the next day, ted took the stand and joanna's lawyer really grilled him like a cheeseburger. ted's good friend margaret took the stand as well and she really didn't help matters. well, the judge took some time to think it over and sure enough, one day shaunessy informs ted that he lost. joanna got sole custody of billy. how typical! always ruling in favor of the mother. well, ted and billy were just devastated about parting ways. they had a tearful goodbye when suddenly joanna stopped by. she and ted have a little talk and well, rather than just give away the ending, let me assure everybody that everything turns out alright for everybody!this was a very good movie. dustin hoffman was very good. he earned that academy award. i've also seen him in hook, meet the fockers and rain man, which he also won an oscar for. meryl streep was good. she also got an oscar. justin henry was good too, so where was his nomination? i guess the academy had a rule against giving oscars to children, but the rule was lifted when haley joel osment came along. this movie has great drama, light comedy, and is very subtle. it does a good job of holding your attention. i was watching rain man on tcm the other night then this came on after and i just couldn't help but watch. and that's what you should do. if you like dustin hoffman or meryl streep or movies of this genre, then i recommend kramer vs. kramer! a gripping film about the pangs of two divorced parents fighting over their child. i liked ted's little speech about ruling in favor of mothers all the time. what was it about sex that makes a good parents? actually, that's how they have the child. but seriously, he's right. why always rule in favor of the mother because she's a woman? also in the cast, george coe, howard duff, who passed away in 1990, and howland chamberlain who passed away in 1984. watch for an up-and-coming jobeth williams in the nudity in the hallway scene. anyway, see kramer vs. kramer today!!! good movie!!-

good drama movie about a child custody case with great performances by all the actors.a good example of what an excellent script can do to propel a simple story to a much higher quality.the screenplay was just average though and this is what kept the movie from the list of the all time best dramas.still,the great acting makes this movie a good one to see if you are a fan of court dramas or a big fan of the lead actors.the movie really should have been a tad longer though for more excellence but that would really be nitpicking......

the child actor certainly deserves a lot of credit. it was a pretty weak field for best picture that year. i think "apocalypse now" should have taken it, but the academy probably felt it was too violent and strange, plus vietnam was still too recent. meryl streep was tremendous, as always, playing a very unlikeable character. i don't usually compliment directors, but i really liked that bit with the elevator doors. grade: b

i remember going to drive inn with my parent and sister. i was in grade 5, and still a kid, and the drive closed down 4 years later, but the film still lingers in my memory. an adult movie, which a kid finds entertaining. that is a mark of excellence. hoffman is one of hollywoods better actors, and this film proves it. i like the billy put down the ice cream scene, and i remember the sctv version in there film i factory myself. remember joe flairty crying. please email me if you like the sctv skit. not a bad film at all, it is a story about a father, and his son. touching and intertaining, i love the part where hoffman talks about killroy, and how the streets change. worth a second watch. 7/10

if you asked me to pick the best acted movies ever made, this movie would be on a short list along with 1951's streetcar named desire. i imagine i'll discover some others that qualify, but kramer vs kramer is an outstanding exercise in naturalism. so its a very satisfying experience on that level: just watching the marvelous, probing performances of dustin hoffman, meryl streep and the child justin henry in particular. one of the best child performances ever.but i also find it very satisfying to watch, because its such a thoroughly involving story - it always makes me forget my own problems. it has such excellent narrative drive. once you stick kramer vs kramer on, and alice kramer leaves ted to juggle work and their young son, telling him nothing more than she has to discover herself - you keep watching to know that everything turns out okay for them. and even once you know how things do turn out, each moment of the ride just rings so brilliantly true that its a joy to watch it happen again and again.make no mistake - kramer vs kramer is not light entertainment: its a very realistic portrayal of the effects of divorce on everyone involved.10/10.for one of the best scripts (born out of conversations between benton and hoffman, who was going through a divorce at the time) ever written, executed and performed beautifully and faultlessly. not to mention what a great, involving story it is. put simply, a perfect film.

i thought this film was quite good and quite entertaining for a film heavy on emotion. i agree with what another user wrote about the script being sympathetic to the three main characters. i think that this is what what made the film good. it didn't villainies either mr. or mrs. kramer and it was refreshing, i think, to see two people essentially work the issue out on their own and eventually do the best thing for billy. and, although it was a little strange, i actually liked the music in this film as well. for some reason the music seemed appropriate for the journey that the three main characters embarked upon. this movie flowed quite well and didn't doodle, like some emotionally heavy films tend to do. it dealt with a serious situation but didn't take itself too seriously. it simply told the story in a straight forward way and it worked quite well.

normally, movies stay out of the realm of "domestic drama," and for good reason: who wants to intentionally seek entertainment from a story about what they or those close to them have to deal with in real life? divorce hurts an incredible percentage of american families of all classes and custody battles are ugly and necessary parts of it. that's not escapism -- the number one reason the average person turns to movies -- that's sad reality. normally, divorce or custody is simply part of a greater story and affects the way we understand it or relate to its characters. "kramer vs. kramer" focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why that makes it so troubling. that's a challenge for both this film and its audience: turn something so real into something that can capture our attention and then make us not feel spiteful as the mirror is held up to our face. writer/director robert benton definitely achieves both and in impressive fashion in adapting this novel by avery corman.the story, as one would expect, is quite simple: big business advertising man ted kramer (dustin hoffman) comes home to find his wife joanna (meryl streep) is leaving him and their 7-year-old son billy (justin henry). ted then must quickly learn to be an active father in the boys' life and as soon as he does, joanna brings a custody suit upon him.to make an oscar-winning drama about something so generic and particularly dialogue- heavy first takes tremendous acting talent. you don't get much better than hoffman and streep. hoffman is in his prime in this role: his first oscar win after three other notable nominations. he creates a thorough character, one whose self-centered and quick-tempered ways clearly change as he learns to be a better father and the sole care-giver. streep wins her first oscar in only the second major role of her career as a woman who doesn't get much screen time but must communicate both inner torment at her decision to leave as well as renewed sense of identity when she returns to take custody. streep does so effortlessly. the young boy, justin henry, who at his age was the youngest competitive category nominee in academy awards history, plays the embodiment of all 7-year-old children exceptionally well.benton's writing and direction takes these performances to the level where we see deeper into this family's troubles than we do our own and thus reconsider our thoughts about love and raising a family. benton's previous notable credits ("bonnie & clyde" and "superman") wouldn't indicate a strong command of family drama, but the man can flat out write. numerous scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they depict. the first morning that joanna is gone and ted make's billy french toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent going into this movie in a scene that happens in americans' kitchens every morning.you'll rarely see a story as straightforward as "kramer vs. kramer" done better. there aren't any surprises at the end or twists and turns that will keep us desperately glued to the screen. the film then has to rely on its talents and they are all sure-fire, delivering a new understanding of a subject that's so familiar.

certainly when i saw this movie at hbo, i was bit erratic in following the plot, but it catches my attention when seeing dustin hoffman in it. honestly i'm not enthralled watching old movies, but then in the long run it changes my point of view. seeing this stirring film made me experience once again couching at my seat not noticing my tears suddenly roll down my cheek, and then after, let loose a heavy sigh in realizing the impact of what i've just witness. kramer vs kramer was indeed one of the best classical drama movies i've witnessed for a long time that even i, myself couldn't imagine how it touched me. the story was strongly emotional, but is not saturated with such. the characters weren't unrealistic for their roles; they possess qualities that make viewers like them whatever position they have in the film, like the role of meryl streep, she was a mother who honestly concede her mistakes at the past but then she's confident to stand up her emotional motives to get what she desires in a fair and square battle. dustin hoffman was way too outstanding, i can't even fathom how this guy could play seriously difficult roles and suddenly jump into another role which is completely different, then performed it well. even though i have already seen the movies a lot of times, when i seat back and lounge at my home scanning worth movies to peer and buy a time for it, catching a glimpse for kramer vs kramer will make my experience another worthwhile moment.

kramer vs. kramer is a near-heartening drama about shocking, drastic augmentations of the two subjects of a failed married couple. meryl streep, in the throes of her trademark maternal sensitivity, plays an unhappy stay-at-home mother who feels confined to such a role and within the first five minutes of the film leaves her inattentive husband, in a fantastic performance by dustin hoffman, to find another role for herself. hoffman is dumbstruck, having absolutely no idea what to do with himself, having taken so much for granted that he doesn't know the first thing about getting his son to school in the morning.hoffman seamlessly characterizes this husband as such a juicy load of setbacks. he is restless, relentless and impatient, but even though the positive side to those three adjectives should include just the opposite, he is unremittingly fixated on whatever he turns his head to. he's been focused on his career in advertising, and when he is left to raise his son billy all by himself, chaos ushers in immediately. he's the one throwing temper tantrums and quitting angrily halfway through an activity. after awhile, as he befriends his neighbor and joanna's former friend, played by sexy jane alexander, hoffman cools his jets enough to understand why his wife left. in the meantime, his boundless energy redirects towards raising billy and he loses his job.the custody battle of the title is a brilliantly grey circumstance. even if the ending is a little unmotivated, subjectified for the audience, the last line and the last shot still have that witty screen writing touch that seemed to diminish after the magical 1970s.

i've seen many dustin hoffman's movies like straw dogs or rain man and i liked them, but his characters are much to often calm or even shy persons. i expected him to be in this movie the same as he was in straw dogs, but i saw a totally different person. he was much more energetic in this film and kinda reminded me of al pacino in serpico. the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end. i liked the way dustin hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son. this movie is also revealing. personally, i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.

kramer vs. kramer is the story of a marital breakup and the consequences of same. they can be devastating to the partners and even more so to a minor child which in this case is played by justin henry.what i really did like about kramer vs. kramer, it's greatest strength as a film is the way that parents dustin hoffman and meryl streep are presented to the audience as whole people with many sides to their nature. though the film is slanted in hoffman's direction and more about his relationship with his son, he's not presented as any kind of saint, nor is streep a completely black villain. hoffman's a career oriented man in the advertising game. he's pretty much ignored his wife's dreams and aspirations, still it's a big shock to him when streep says the love's no longer there and she wants out. she also wants out of being a mother, at least for a while.hoffman and henry make do the best they can. the pressure of being both parents causes hoffman to lose his job and he has to take a lower paying one in another agency. at that point after over a year, streep decides she wants custody.both parents make compelling witnesses and state their case beautifully, but in these situations, the tie is always broken in favor of the mother.dustin hoffman and meryl streep won their first of two oscars respectively for this film, her in the supporting actress category. i'm not sure how these things are decided, streep does get less screen time than hoffman if that's the determining factor. the film does focus on hoffman's relationship with his son and his evolving realization that he has his share of the blame for the marriage failure. as for meryl it's a hob's choice for her as it is for many women, to balance a career and motherhood. the conflict in her psyche registers for all to see on the screen.dustin hoffman may have won that oscar partly for the same reason that spencer tracy picked up his first, by performing the impossible task of not letting a scene stealing child steal the film. children with their lack of inhibitions are natural actors and henry is great because he comes over as a real kid, not a hollywood kid. i wonder if hoffman saw captains courageous and saw how spencer tracy dealt with freddie bartholomew. dustin could have done a lot worse than channel spencer tracy in his performance.kramer vs. kramer also won oscars for best picture, best director for robert benton and best adapted screenplay. it's an intelligent and compelling drama about adults falling out of love and trying to deal as best they can with it for themselves and their child. don't miss it if ever broadcast.

i can't imagine why it hasn't been theatrically released yet. it's got a great ensemble cast, with sutherland, lane, and especially chris evans doing spectacular work. wake up, studio execs!the story is based upon the experiences of the author/screenwriter, growing up as the "poor kid" in an extremely affluent community, where class is everything, and makes a difference in every aspect of life, from clothing to justice.during the film's q&a, the author was asked about his experiences, and particularly what we don't know about the ultra-rich. he said they aren't stupid, they're very smart (as opposed to how they may portray themselves), they've got plans, and they are a threat!in many ways, this film is extremely timely.

i was lucky enough to see this at this years tribeca film festival. i was stunned by how well made and how entertaining this wonderful little film was. director griffin dunne has done a great job assembling this film that has several characters and several story lines that blend so smoothly and seamlessly. the main story involves the family and it is very thought-provoking and entertaining story that involved the viewer in every scene. the film as a whole has credibility and integrity, yet still has that commercial edge - an "indie" movie for the masses if you like. the performances by the cast are all excellent but it is diane lane who shines the brightest. diane lane is simply sensational in this wonderful film and should be oscar nominated. early days i know, but lane acts her socks off here.

i thought this was a very good movie. someone said it was 'sick' so they couldn't watch it. i think if you realize its rated r then you will be prepared for the nudity and drug use. it is a good story and the acting is amazing. just can't be a prude to appreciate it! its basically about a mom who does drugs and wants to get clean so she calls a very wealthy old friend and he moves them to his estate and crazy things happen. i guess it is a drama. i am just so sick of people who don't like movies because of cursing or nudity. that is the world we live in. you obviously aren't comfortable with yourself if you can't see things like this movie. and it's rated r. so, that should tell you from the beginning that its not all peachy happy rainbows. i liked it. i think you will too!

one of the best movies i ever saw - a classic "matrix" movie. for many years, i have been trying to get it on vhs or dvd - to no avail. the german movie/tv industry still prefers to let valuable cultural contributions (and this is fassbinder, after all!) rot away and collect dust in some archive rather than distribute it commercially (and make a lot of money with it if that is what stimulates them instead of the promotion of creative thinking). though, the wdr once told me if i paid dm 200.00 to check the copyright (non-reimbursable), and then dm 8 per minute of copying, plus the cost for the materials, then they will consider preparing a (single!) copy for me. some way to sell something! the same problem we have with many other tv movies or series like "so weit die füße tragen", "sonntagseltern", "kellerkinder", and others. excellent tv series - never to be heard of again. germany, wake up!update from march 2007: last year, i finally could get a dvd copy from the "mittschnittservice" of the wdr for about 50+ euro. great!

i really liked this picture, because it realistically dealt with two people in love, and one of them having a disorder. though the ending saddened me, i know that that was the best way for it to finish off. i would recommed this to everyone.

because it's late and i'm running short on vocabulary, i will describe this film as "beautiful and heartbreaking," begging the forgiveness of those who cringe at such cliches. robin tunney does an amazing job portraying a young woman in the clutches of tourette's syndrome - her character was absolutely sincere and convincing, and i will follow her career wherever it goes because of this film.

niagra niagra was certainly not the best movie i have seen. however., i cannot describe the way the movie made me feel while watching it and how i felt as it ended and also how i feel about it now. very few movies have such an effect on me. i like them or i do not. i look at niagra niagra as a work of art. we all see something in it and it may remind us of something or it may instill fear or fun etc... this movie had me in not the best mood. in fact it left me feeling empty somehow. i guess because the lives these two persons led were so empty in so many ways. they had no direction. their only direction was to have no direction. they had many problems to deal with and i guess needed to get away from what could not have been a happy life. but on the way things really only got worse. a steady decline from where it started. it was sad as it was so well acted and i guess we have all most likely seen someone in some situation that may in some way resemble the situation these folks were in. they might have had a good life if they had any idea how. but it wes clear they did not know what to do. so they kind of rambled to someplace they had heard about. no real goal. they had no idea how to have a goal. they had no idea how to overcome the life that was set before them. i felt bad but could not stop watching the movie. only good actors can make me feel so much about a movie that i would not like if just anyone played the parts. these two did a great job to the point you just did not see the acting. i am very impressed and want to buy the movie when it is available on dvd. you know. it left me feeling a little like leaving los vegas did. but again it is in a class of its own. not a great movie but well worth an hour or two on the right day. if you are a person who has problems i would not suggest you watch it. it could depress you. it depressed me and i have not the conditions these folks had. jimmyjoejetter

i tuned in to this movie because there was nothing else to watch. i was immediately sucked in by the characters.robin tunney is nothing less than spectacular in this film. her portrayal of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100% believable. really, this sort of thing is not easy to do. she pulls it off fantastically.we know early on this film is going to end tragically, but you cannot take your eyes off of it. the characters do stupid things, but unlike most hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot demands it, these people do stupid things because the are not right in the head - and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters.this is just a great example of film making imho. great writing, great acting, great directing. a film for people who think film can be more than mindless entertainment.

i have watched this movie time and time and time again - each time it makes me laugh, it makes me think, and it makes me cry. robin tuney does an incredible job of portraying marcy (and i'm kind of glad that kate winslet and that other lady turned down her part) its just one of those rolls that you know that no one else could have even compared.its a beautiful love story of these 2 very different people in crappy situations that team up together. they stand beside each other no matter what, even if it is in an odd situation and crazy ways.i'll tell you now its not for everyone - out of everyone i've shown it to i'd say the results are 50/50 - but if you like it, you'll love it and want to share it with others! 10 stars all the way!

i like movies about quirky people. "one flew over the cuckoo's nest" is maybe my all time favorite, so one can imagine i had a blast with this one. it's definitely not one to watch if you want to walk off smiling. this movie is unpredictable and intense. some scenes are downright frightening, even after multiple viewings (because this kind of stuff really can happen). it will most definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride. and after you see the ending, if you're not deeply disturbed, you really should check yourself for a pulse.the acting was phenomenal. marcy, with her rather extreme case of tourette's, shifts from quirky-cute to utterly terrifying, sometimes appearing so out-of-control that she looks like the undead. seth was great, too. the focus of the movie definitely does not fall nearly as much on him as it does on marcy, though he happens to be the one that gains the most momentum as a blossoming character.it's a classic love story with some unconventional twists, and it's also my favorite love story next to "true romance." there are two bad reviews for it up here, but one of the people who gave such a review didn't have his facts straight and admitted to not seeing the whole film, while the other was just looking for some hollywood thrills without the deep characters (and perhaps was a little thrown off by the apparent shallowness of the plot, seeing as the end goal revolves around stealing a black bobbi head from a toy store). the point is that this movie is not for those who want to see something "normal" or "lighthearted". this one is messed up and indie as can be, and won't let you go until the heavy climax.

this movie is truly worth seeing - robin tunney excels and henry thomas proves that he's one of those rarities, the child 'actor' who grows up to become a real actor. the characters are perfectly drawn, and in the wrong hands because of their depth, they could have been unconvincing - but all the actors are simply astounding. the cast of this movie has to rank up there with that of "girl, interrupted" (both movies coincidentally star the brilliant clea duvall). the score and music selections fit perfectly, and there is plenty of action to prevent the movie becoming just a character study. if you want the story, you won't find it in this review, but i will say that the climax will haunt you for a long time.

not only is this a very interesting exploration of tourette's and how we react to people in our lives, it has some of the most well-filmed views of a bleak northern winter landscape. there's nothing pretty about this film, but it stays with the viewer.

wow! i caught this on ifc recently after i watched but im a cheerleader. id never heard of this movie but the description sounded remotely interesting. i went in with low expectations and now i must say this is one of the best love stories ever in film. robin tunney does an excellent job portraying a person with tourettes. the relationship between the two and just the slightest details in the film are so acurate and believable. i usually hate "romance" and love films but this movie truly touched me. i so recommend this movie to anyone with the ability of vision.

niagara, niagara is a stunning and heartbreaking story about the two outsiders seth and marcy. robin tunney gives a fantastic performance as marcy suffering from tourette's sydrome, getting sicker and sicker as the movie progresses. this movie is not very optimistic and it's very hard emotional, but at the same time very romantic. it's hard to explain, but see it and find out for yourself. it's definitely worth it.

henry thomas, and robin tunny, are a couple of the most underrated performers in the business. it's beyond me as to why they haven't received more recognition than they have. this movie is a perfect example of how boundless their abilities are.acting out the lives of folks who could be referred to as a bit odd seems to be their speciality, and if these characters ain't odd, i'm at a loss to find anyone who is.the story is funny, romantic, dramatic, complicated, and tragic. i hated the ending, but if i hadn't, i wouldn't have loved the story as a whole. so there ya go.

there are many things to admire about this film, but the thing that got me above all others was the part of an eccentric recluse, the sort of role that hollywood loves & romanticizes but which here is absolutely convincing & unlike any character i've encounterd in film or in life. also a very convincing & disturbing depiction of tourete's syndrome

i watched this movie in 75 and this movie was a kind of open mind to me about how important is to care the natur and the wild life. when i got a dog in 83, i called him truska ( in movie..avakun's dog ) to never forget this movie. by the way, i have a copy this movie, but is in portuguese language and the quality is not so good like a dvd or a new vhs ( i recorded almost 20 years ago and in slp speedy.. so the quality is not so good..)if somebody wish a copy.. i'll try convert to dvd and i can send for you ok?ot's a great movie and i agree that is a movie to be always watched.waldemar braz - sao paulo/brazil

another "must have" film. henry brandon is a favorite! i was so surprised when i learned years ago that he was from germany because he sounds & looks so typically american! and wasn't he great in "the searchers" as chief scar??!! another of my favorites, i have it & watch it over & again. now if i could add this one to my collection, it would make my day! this is a great wildlife story & film for all ages. the scenery is so absolutely beautiful & the plight of the endangered snow leopards is told with such great emotion it will spark the interest in endangered species in anyone, especially children. if i could i would give a copy to all of my grands & great grands!

this is one of my favourite films, dating back to my childhood. set in the remote wilderness of siberia at the turn of the century, a small community is stirred when an extremely cold winter forces two tigers to come down from the mountains in search of food, preying on outlying farms. in this atmosphere we are introduced to avakum, a hermit fur trapper, who lives out in the wilds, as he comes to the village to sell his annual catch to boris, his close, and rather only, friend in the village, who runs a store. at boris' request, avakum accompanies his friend's arrogant son, ivan, on the hunt for the menacing tigers. personalities crash and tempers flare as the older, more experienced avakum criticises ivan's amateur methods, an encounter noticed also by the other members of the hunt. on the second day, the hunters sight their prey and give chase. in a thick wood, ivan wounds one of the tigers, which then attacks the hapless man. avakum, seeing ivan tangling with the enraged beast, fires, but accidently hits ivan. he kills the tiger as it flees. the other hunters arrive on the scene, suspicious.back in the village, the doctor works to save the wounded ivan. avakum attempts to leave the village, but is confronted by ivan's friends. the trapper brushes them off however, and speeds off with his dog-drawn sled. the young villagers swear after him that they'll come for him if ivan dies, which he later does, but before dying explains to his father that it was an accident. old boris, upon learning of his close friend being run out of the village, straightens out the gathering "lynch mob" and goes out after avakum, to find him and set things right. and so the main story begins.a simple film, it raises the conflict of man and civilisation versus nature, mainly avakum's struggle to survive alone out in the wilderness. the winter landscape is very well filmed. perhaps the strongest element in the film is the soundtrack by jimmie haskell. very sentimental and evocative, the main theme reminiscent of albinoni's adagio. other movements reflect russian styles, as well as a couple of folk music type tunes.unfortunately, this film is not available to buy, to my knowledge, which is rather a shame. the copy i own, recorded off tv nearly twenty years ago is slowly deteriorating. this film is a must see for those who can appreciate it, if they can find it. 8/10

i managed to obtain an original bbc broadcast of this film on video and loved it so much i had to try and locate the original video in its original box; thanks go to ebay.deleted on any format since 1990, this exceptional wildlife film is finely constructed and well acted. directed by stewart raffil (mac & me), the scenes of leaping tigers running through the alaskan wilderness is nothing short of stunning and its timeless tale of a trapper trying to survive on his own in the frozen wastes with two young tiger cubs is moving on each viewing.why no major company has picked up this movie to distribute on dvd is a big wonder; but makes it that extra special to know its also hard to locate.if you find this film by chance or eventually track it down to add to your collection, make sure never to let it vanish out of your grasp. films of this calibre, as shown, don't come often.a true masterpiece in every sense of the word, and highly worthy of its praised comments, "when the north wind blows" will sink deep into your heart as soon as you see it.

i collect films on super-8, and managed to snag a full length print of this one last week on e-bay. it looks like at least for the moment, this is the only way to see this film in a country having ntsc video. i have seen it available on region 2 dvd many times, but never region 1. i just finished watching it a few minutes ago and i am amazed by it. it's a powerful testament to freedom and finding your own place in the world. the photography and music were wonderful, and i really felt empathy for some of the characters.i kind of like the idea that i was probably the only one in the usa watching "when the north wind blows" tonight! long live avakum!!

i remember this film,it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 74/75 my dad took me my brother & sister to newbury cinema in newbury berkshire england. i recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adams actor dan haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies. if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me know.the cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away, would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it.

this film is one of the best memories i have from childhood. having always loved tigers my mum took me to see it. it is absolutely amazing. its is one of those films that leaves a lasting impression on you. the image of tigers running through the snow with it all spraying around is still in my head some 25 yrs on, not many films have managed that, as other comments have said photography is stunning. a must see. i have also been looking for the film for some time with no luck at all. :-(. checking amazon every now and then reveals nothing, not even listed. if anyone does know of a source, please contact me or post here. tim

78 years ago...the premiere of "anna christie" advertised by the slogan "garbo talks!" the film runs for 16 minutes and the viewers reach the climax of curiosity: greta enters the bar and gets through a long awaited transfer from silence into sound: a few seconds closing her silent era and, at last, greta garbo says a historic line: "gimme a whiskey, ginger ale on the side and don't be stingy, baby!" "anna christie" (1930) is the movie by clarence brown that introduced a great silent star greta garbo to talkies. nowadays, we can only imagine what serious transfer it was for actors and actresses. the careers of many were bound to end - something we hardly or not at all see at present. and it was no coincidence that it was clarence brown who directed the first talkie with the swedish beauty. garbo trusted the director after two of his great silent productions, flesh and the devil (1926) and a woman of affairs (1928): movies that achieved a smashing success at the box office, both with garbo in the lead. but we are in 2008 and that fact about the movie, now purely historical, appears to be of minor importance. the question for today's viewer is not what garbo's voice sounds like but if the movie is still watchable after these 78 years. in other words, we all strive to answer the question if the movie has stood a test of time. has it?when i recently watched it, i came into conclusion that, except for some minor technical aspects, including static camera, "anna christie" is still very entertaining. it's, on the one hand, a wonderful story of a life, of a reality that the young woman faces (being based on eugene o"neill's play), and, on the other hand, an artistic manifestation of true magnificence in the field of direction and acting. let me analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs.content: chris christopherson (george f marion), a heavy drinker, lives a life of a sailor, on a barge. although his days are filled with sorrows, he is consoled by a letter from his daughter anna (garbo) whom he hasn't seen for 15 years. she says that she will come back to him. he starts to change everything for better; however forgets that his daughter is no longer a child lacking experience but a 23 year-old woman who has got through various sorts of things on a farm in minnessota where she lived and worked. moreover, he forgets that she has a right to accept another kind of male love in her life... this brief presentation of the content not from the perspective of the main character but the one which is introduced to us sooner than anna (her father chris) makes you realize how universal it is. simply no letter from the whole text that life appears to be has been erased after all these years. cases discussed here in 1930 are still meaningful and valid...performances. there are not many characters in the movie, but there are two that really shine in the roles. it is of course greta garbo herself who did something extraordinary in her 15 year-long phenomenon, the presence that strongly marked the history of early cinema (something i have already discussed in many of my earlier comments on her films). but here, garbo is slightly different. i admit that there are moments in this movie when she does not feel very comfortable with her role. that seems to be caused by her new experience with sound in english; however, her performance is, as always, genuine and unique. but that is what everyone has expected from garbo. the true surprise of the movie for the 1930 viewers and also for us is marie dressler as marthy. she is excellent in her facial expressions, in her accent, in the entire portrayal of a drinking woman who looks at life from the perspective of "hitting the bottle." her best moments include the conversation with anna christie in the bar preceded by her hilarious talk with chris. the rest of the supporting cast are fine yet not great whatsoever (here the german version makes up for it). particularly dressler, except for garbo herself, constitutes an absolutely flawless choice.if you asked me what i like about "anna christie" nowadays, that's what i would tell you: it's a classic movie. however, there is one more thing that i must mention at the end. it is humor, wonderful wit that is noticeable throughout. although the content is quite serious and "anna christie" in no way carries a comedian spirit (the only garbo's comedy was ninotchka), there are such moments when you will split your sides. don't skip, for instance, anna and matt's visit in the fun park, particularly at the restaurant where he orders milk for her thinking how virtuous and innocent she is, beer for himself and where suddenly marthy joins them by chance..."anna christie" is a perfect movie for classic buffs and a must see for all at least a bit interested in the true magnificence of performance. if you are fed up with many of those modern starlets, seek such movies out and you shall be satisfied. very worth your search! skaal greta garbo! skaal marie dressler! let us drink a toast to the great jobs you did in the movie! skaal after all these years when wine tastes much better and your spirits are with us in a different sense...

garbo's first spoken words in this 1930 film electrified audiences and became part of hollywood legend. garbo had become a star in her first american film, the torrent, in 1926. and audiences waited til this film to see if garbo could make the transition to talkies. she did. and while pola negri, vilma banky, and renee adoree fell by the wayside because of their accents, garbo sailed on for another decade. despite the staginess of this film, garbo is really excellent, especially in the opening scene with the equally great marie dressler as marthy. the two great stars trade dirty looks and sharp words as they size each other up while they have a few drinks and set the tone for the remainder of the film. garbo was 25; dressler was 60. charles bickford is ok as matt, and george f. marion is good as old chris. marion originated this role on broadway in 1922 and also played it in the 1923 silent version with blanche sweet. this eugene o'neill play is a true classic yet, oddly, was never filmed again. anna christie ranks as one of garbo's greatest performances. and despite the staginess of the film and the grimness of the story, she is truly a marvel. see this one for garbo and dressler!

this is an amazingly well-filmed early talkie adaptation of the eugene o'neill play. its major drawback is a static camera, and as a result it comes off much of the time as the filmed play it is, which is a pity, for it's a good piece of primitive moviemaking, made at a time when sound was posing all kinds of technical problems, and as a result most films were experimental whether or not this was their maker's intention. garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as she was in her silent films, and her entrance is still classic. her voice is strangely deep, almost boyish, which only enhances her already seductively eccentric persona. as her boyfriend, charles bickford is appropriately virile,--he was apparently born craggy--and a perfect counterpart to the divine garbo. his irish brogue is not bad at all, and he seems always a natural man of the sea, very o'neill-like in his independent, brooding nature. as garbo's (very) confused father, george marion seems truly from another time. he has the sort of face and voice,--open, unmannered, totally without guile--that has vanished from the earth. marie dressler is also in the o'neill swing of things. her blank expression and intensity around the eyes speaks volumes, as she plays her boozy character as a woman at times bordering on psychosis. poetic license, perhaps, as this is not in the script, but we can forgive miss dressler's excesses; she is too good at it not to. the story ends with a movement to the next thing, as distinct from resolution, which isn't the author's cup of tea; and those who like their films neatly worked out in the end will be disappointed by the absence of any real surprise. in anna christie we are in o'neill country, a place of sea, storms and fog, a feeling of all-pervading and damnable uncertainty, which we would now call ambivilance, or anxiety neurosis. rather than analyze this mood the author simply and wisely presents it, as weather, land, ocean and people intertwine and address one another in a unique language we feel priveleged to have heard.

i would say that this film is disturbing. the brutality is depicted in a very sick way, it's like a psychosis in 40 minutes. in the same time, it is a cruel introspection in human behavior. the scenes are ferocious, starting with the butchery of the horse and ending with the brutal sex scene in the kitchen. every emotion is exploited to extreme, the frustration of the butcher, the love for his daughter almost incestuous, the rage when he finds out she has been abused, every feeling is so natural and so wrong. this film delivers the truth about human nature in a very honest and brutal way. the message of the film is that one's life can change in a second as a consequence of one's behavior and that the most primitive emotions are the most powerful and can determine one's acting. i'd loved the unique manner of filming, the simplicity and the brutality accompanied with the silence in which only inner thoughts pierce through.

the short film which got gaspar noe on the movie map, introducing us to his horrific, but thoroughly interesting character the butcher, played brilliantly by phillipe nahon. noe's direction here has all the hallmarks of his later films, showing he was carving his own voice and style from the beginning. his sudden cutting along with harsh, loud noise, skipping flashbacks and many other techniques all are used to disconcert the viewer. and it certainly works. also, he is not afraid of showing violence, as viewers of irreversible will know. here the violence is equally powerful, and in the sequel seul contre tous, it is almost unbearable.the film opens with a horse being killed. it is shot in the head, and we watch it writhe on the floor, its pool of blood flowing out. we then see a human birth in all its bloody glory, the daughter of the butcher. he was orphaned in wwii, and has grown up hating the world, and everyone and everything in it. he serves his customers, but his interior monologue constantly reminds us of his thoughts- he wants them all dead. his daughter blandine lenoir, who would also reprise her role six years later, is the only thing he cares about, and we watch them grow older together. she is however mute, and the subject of bullying and toying. the butcher's relationship with her is almost incestuous, bathing her when she is old enough to do it herself etc,but this is explored more in the next film. when she is attacked by a man, the butcher explodes with rage, stabbing an innocent man in the mouth. he goes to prison, taken from the only things he wants- his shop and daughter. in the short 40 minutes we see all this and more, his time in prison and release back to his world. because of his daughter's state, autistic as well i think, she is bland, does little except stare, and is under the full control of her father. the film continues in the exceptionally bleak seul contre tous. if you can, watch these two films, this one first. it has some truly excellent acting, but is very difficult to watch because of the relentless tone.7 out of 10

this is the forty minute film that introduces us to the character of the butcher, who will later be examined more thoroughly in the feature seul contre tous. in this film, it follows the early period of his life from 1965-1979, but focusing on the late seventies. the first images are of a slaughter of a horse, then the birth of a baby, the butcher's daughter, who we quickly see growing up each year. the butcher (played by philippe nahon in both films) is a man bitter with the world. he hates many things. his anger comes to a head when a man assaults his autistic daughter. the butcher then maims the wrong man, and finds himself in prison.this film follows the butcher's life to just after his release from prison, then seul contre tous takes over from there. i watched the films the wrong way about, seul contre tous first. try and watch this little film first if you can.

this is a film about loneliness and how the distance  physical and emotional -- between people tends to stultify relationships.the narrative is simple to the point of banality: a young man yusuf (emin toprak), from a rural village, arrives in istanbul to stay with his older and successful cousin mahmut (muzaffer ozdemir); yusuf wants work in the big city. after trying for a few weeks to find work without any success, the strain of having yusuf living with him is too much for mahmut. they quarrel  nothing physical, just verbal. eventually, yusuf goes, leaving mahmut alone again. end of story...except for the fact that the performance of the two men as relatives is one of the best on film. much is said visually; dialog is used to bring out disagreement, distrust, hostility, and insecurity that exist within and between the two men.there are many visual gems in this film. for example, while searching for work, young yusuf, needing a relationship, tries in vain to gain the attention of various young women around the city. the look on his face, as he is thwarted every time, says it all.or, wanting a cigarette, yusuf opens the door to the balcony of mahmut's apartment and lights up in the frigid december air, leaving the door open; mahmut, eventually gets up from his work desk, walks to the door (all glass) and the cousins just look at each other for what seems way too long a time. then mahmut closes the door, leaving yusuf out in the cold. the metaphor is complete.or, mahmut cleaning up after yusuf, grudgingly and with increasing anger; and all the while, yusuf wastes his time chasing skirts instead of looking seriously for work, and spends mahmut's money on a toy for a nephew yusuf is emotional, untidy, impulsive, and vulnerable. mahmut is rational, logical, self-confident and a demanding control freak: the right-brain, left-brain dichotomy beautifully played out by two actors who say more with a look, a gesture, a frown than any words can convey.but, mahmut is not completely emotionless: he still loves his ex-wife who tells him that she's off to canada with her husband-to-be. mahmut affects a distant and confident friendship with his ex, and makes sure that she is okay about going. he wishes her well. he says goodbye. he leaves the coffee shop where they were talking. later when she calls to say a last goodbye, on the way to the airport, mahmut goes there and secretly watches as she leaves. the poignancy of the emotion on his face, as she disappears through a door, is worth the wait.all in all, this is a standout piece of work by the two main actors and the director, nuri ceylan. some might argue that the pace is too slow; but life goes slowly for much of the time, especially for those who are alone. the camera work is relatively simple also: choose the scene, set up the camera and lighting, and let the actors move across the scene, enter the scene and leave the scene, all the while keeping the camera still. there were a few panning shots, some high-angle tracking shots, a few rural scenes  but much of the film is shown as though on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide angle lens. except for tv and radio music within the story, there is no music sound track. and, there are those many long silences as the two men sit and watch tv together and/or engage in very limited conversation.i saw this movie on tv so i was amused to see that, on a few occasions, i was watching tv as they were watching tv also. the silence in the movie matched the silence in my house (i was awake, all others in bed); my chair and position matched that of mahmut's as he watched tv. quite eerie, giving me a sense of almost 'being there' with him and, i guess i was, in a sense.i'll say no more, because i want you to savor the other scenes that i haven't described. it's not a movie for everybody, for sure. more than any movie i've seen, it shows just how much we die when we are all alone  just as we are all alone when we die. mahmut's face, as it fades to black in the final scene, will stay with me for a long, long time...highly recommended for serious movie buffs.

when you're watching distant you know you're not watching a french movie, there's little sex and it's mostly elliptical and people don't talk that much here, there are a few lines scattered here and there and a couple of important conversations, just to let you make sense of what's going on. it doesn't look american either, there aren't any car chases or shoot-outs or violence, unless you consider the killing of a mouse an act of blood or the daily tension of getting by a subdued catastrophe. at times, the relatively long-held medium-distance shots may remind you of 'contemplative' asian cinema, but just reminds you, the director doesn't push things to the radical minimalism of some taiwanese filmmakers but then again, this is not a taiwanese movie, it's a turkish movie. i don't know what that means, i don't even know if that's supposed to mean something.the movie doesn't have a plot proper and yet, those few lines, those somewhat long-held shots and that often mitigated tension gradually build a sense of something happening, a sense of 'plot', for lack of a better word, that grows on you. by the end of the movie you may get the feeling you're going to miss those two cousins who have many things in common but are worlds apart.

for those who are like me and are used to watch and enjoy high budget hollywood films, on huge screens with a surround audio, this film seems to be so distant. however it surprised me how close can it be to any human while i watch it. it is so natural that you feel like nobody wrote a scenario or nobody directed it. you are the director and you are writing the scenario while you watch it. for me, the time i spend on watching a film is the only time which i go to another world. this film is the first sample for me which shows that it is not always a must to watch millions of dollars of budgeted films, surround audio capabilities to go to another world. this films sends you to another world (or maybe makes you return back to yourself) without millions of dollars of budget, or technical capabilities. i felt like that i'm reading l'etranger from camus.

hysterically painful; perhaps the kind of movie chekhov would have made had he made movies. what's really funny is that the two cousins have so very much in common (many descriptions of their relationship on this site are dead wrong).what's really funny and uncomfortable about these characters is that they just can't bring themselves to talk to each other - or anyone else! it's horrible. if you've ever been too shy, worried, self-involved, or just plain scared to talk to someone (and who hasn't?) you'll definitely see yourself in this film. and it won't be pretty.it holds a mirror up to the audience and says, "if you don't like what you see... change it".

it's probably a year since i saw uzak, but it has left strong memories of the two main characters, jaded photographer mahmut and his naive cousin from the village yusuf.it's a long film with very little dialogue and a quite limited plot. this has evidently annoyed a fair few viewers. but the film constructs such a painfully believable portrait of mahmut and yusuf that there's just as much emotional tension as in the paciest thriller.just to be clear, there's no padding in this film -- in the long pauses where no one speaks there as much happening in the characters' emotions (and in yours, watching them) as you could bear. go to see it awake and alert, and you'll be gripped rather than anaesthetised.uzak rings true in so many ways, and that sincerity is probably its greatest accomplishment. people don't grapple with events and problems, so much as with each other. in fact, in the whole film, there's probably not one point where the main characters (mahmut, yusuf and mahmut's ex-wife nazan) are not opposed.much of it is true the world over: country cousin yusuf's perhaps wilfully naive expectation that a job on a ship will drop into his lap; mahmut's urbanised cynicism and unwillingness to sympathise with yusuf.other truths are more-specific to turkey: yusuf's incomprehension that mahmut might be tolerating his stay with gritted teeth; yusuf veering between macho ambition and wide-eyed awkwardness when he tries to get to know a woman.uzak is undoubtedly a pretty bleak film, and one ceylan's strengths is not to beat us over the head with the themes he explores. for me at least, i believed entirely in the behaviour of his characters. all the little failed attempts to connect and petty cruelties ring so true. and yet i didn't leave with a message that "the world is like that", but instead i got "this is how we sometimes treat each other."

reading some of the other reviews of this film, i was reminded of both good and not so good aspects of it. but overall, i have to say it is one of the better films i have seen from any number of genres or countries recently. more than anything else, it avoided many of the typical traps of more recent international cinema, like taking nice pictures of landscapes or being 'hip', 'fun' or imitating american films like pulp fiction. the film is unique in many ways. for one thing, it is a film about relationships in which sex plays no role (unusual, especially for foreign films). it is also a film about two men's relationship to each other (also unusual - not a 'buddy film', no homosexual tension, no ego/phallic competition). it uses little dialogue, but communicates a tremendous amount. it is a simple story, yet full of complex details which are easily understood by any human being and universal in their relevance. i did not find the film dark or depressing (everything would seem this way if you watch hollywood happy ending films all the time), but rather a true reflection of human emotions. for instance, in the scene where mahmut realizes his cousin is gone is you see both his feeling of relief, that the cousin is gone and yet regret, that he pushed him away. who has not felt such ambivalence - when losing a friend or lover, or in some other situation? it's rare to get these kinds of real human emotions displayed on film in a non-cliché way. as far as culture is concerned, or this being a turkish film, i feel it strikes the very difficult balance between being a 'turkish' film - about realities which more apply to that place (the greater struggle to make it in a turkish city versus a european one; the greater contrast between country and city), and a universal, human story which didn't necessarily have to be set in turkey. in this day and age where people around the world are consuming culture and fetishizing it, this film does not try to entice us as 'turkish', nor does it try to communicate it as a 'harsh reality', or 'that's how turkey/istanbul is'. and yet the cultural elements are there. i think the comparison to 'lost in translation' that somebody made is quite good. everyone, at least in the us, was raving about that film. i personally thought it was mediocre at best. it was well put by someone as a vague story which supposedly was supposed to deal with 'disorientation' that happens to people living or traveling overseas. even if the film was supposed to be humorous, the characters and their motivations or crises were never clear (even for a 'lighter' film or comedy, this is necessary). and i found myself being treated to a typically 'orientalist' story of the alienated amerian overseas. going back to 'distant', as for the idea that this is bad acting, or too slow, or has no plot, i'm sorry but people who say this know nothing about film making and maybe nothing about being human, no offense. you do not have to be a film aficionado or cultural connoisseur to appreciate this film. this film will be two hours of your time well spent!

i am very thankful that the small college town of abingdon, va.- near bristol, tn. and home of the famous barter theatre where gregory peck once acted- managed to get an art film festival togather and show this film there. abingdon is two and a hour hours from where i live, but the trip was worth it in every sense of the word. uzak/distant is an amazing, brilliant, jarring, emotional, captivating film. as a turkish-american, this film was not only a testimony as to what life in turkey is like; but on a larger scale it tells the world of what it is like to be turkish whether one lives in istanbul, berlin, montreal, new york, or omaha. it may be two hours in length as opposed to five minutes, but this is effectively our bob marley song. there are so many wonderful scenes in this film. it is very difficult to choose just a random few. but, for me, one telling scene takes place in a beyoglu (downtown istanbul) cinema. the title character, played by mehmet emin toprak who sadly died in a car accident shortly after this film's completion, follows a very attractive young woman down a staircase to the cinema's main auditorium. she goes into see "vanilla sky." as the image of tom cruise is reflected from a glass, we sense that turkish men are competing with tom cruise for their own women's affections even though tom cruise is nowhere to found in beyoglu. the scenes shot across the bosphorous shores are also quite revealing as they symbolize the beauty, yet desperate empty gulfs, which are a painful fact of life in turkey. in this film, the gulf separates lovers and families. a simple, empty packet of samsun (turkish brand) cigarettes and a dying mouse jump off the screen the way seagulls did in the 1982 serif goren-yilmaz guney film "yol." many of guney's films, including "yol," "suru- the herd" (1978- completed by zeki okten) and "baba-the father" (1971) have been considered by many to be the best turkish films ever made. without guney's sometimes overblown social-political anger (especially in his last film, the 1983 prison drama "duvar-the wall"), "distance" captures the essence of turkish life quite remarkably. this is a crowning achievement for a director who in my view can already be proclaimed as the turkish equivalent to directors like tarkovsky, bresson, and ozu. i can't wait to see his other films!

this has to be one of the most beautifully morbid films i have ever seen. merhige has created a living painting that unfolds with horrific violence, sex, and a minimalist retelling of the life of jesus christ. the high contrast and thick layer of grain make you question yourself as to what you are really seeing at times, but the use of texture, combined with the extreme contrast, create an incredible viewing experience. this film is not for everyone. i think you have to keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this film for its content, which if extremely rough, but does make a fairly important statement about creation, god and humanity. whether this film is a work of art, or shock value trash is open to discussion.

if you are dating a girl that is into wicca!many parts of this movie were killer and the feeling you get from this movie while watching it and immediately after is enough alone to sit through it all but some things really bothered me about this film that i cant really put my finger on...i definitely think that this movie is one that any art student or photography student should see b/c of the camera style and graininess that ive never seen but that is just it...it looks like an art student made it and the plot if there is any is so jumpy that you really need to be on a lot of drugs to get just what is going on

thank god for the internet movie database!!! when i first got this movie i watched it every night just before before bed and was getting something different out of it every time. but no matter how i sliced it, it came up disturbing. the black and white and all the twitching really freaked me. you stare at the screen unsure of what you are looking at, and just when you think you got it, it becomes clear and it's something completely different. the imagery is very disturbing, twitching and straight razors do not sit well with me in any movie. still everytime i watched it, i was interpreting it somewhat differently (there is no dialogue, ya know), so i decided to check the imdb for the plot summary. boy that throws me for a loop, i had no idea that was supposed to be god. now i'm going to watch it with this in mind and see what happens....

begotten is black and white distorted images. it looks like it could have come from the nineteenth century. however, the sound is crystal clear, minus the sync and the addition of calm nature sounds.this movie was very critical of the struggles of life. it shows a single mother and child in a violent world that thrives on the innocent. the mother is very oblivious to her surroundings. this leads to lots of torture, pain, and death. you may watch it many times and see different symbolisms, plot devices, and basically "what does it mean?".if you appreciate art in movies then you will love it. otherwise, don't bother.

begotten is one of the most unique films i've ever seen. it is more, to me, a study of sound, light and dark, and movement than a real story. the type of thing you see as a video instillation at the museum of modern art than a film enjoyed at the local theater. i'm not going to try to interpret the images of the mother nature, the beasts in cloaks, the twisted and tortured body of her "child". some things just defy interpretation.

i loved it, it was really gruesome and disgusting. i thought that the tearing of the human flesh was thoroughly provacative. the way that it was depicting the human crucifix about jesus christ was really interesting. the tearing about limbs and jaws was awesome brutally gruesome. don't watch this if you have a weak heart, you wouldn't be able to stand it.

anyone who correctly identifies the opening images as god killing himself without reading the end credits certainly deserves a free ticket to a rest home in transylvania. i would imagine this as being a favorite movie at "twin peaks" dark lodge on movie night if time existed there. i would think that a better title might have been, "how much fun can you have with someone who's almost dead in the forest with only neolithic technology?" the answer, it would seem, is quite a bit. so, despite the silly "god killing himself," the uber-pretentiousness (an apt phrase taken from a previous letter), the more clearly "alistair crowley - hi, i'm the beast, deal with it!" than christian cosmology (i can't believe another viewer had the thick-headedness to see the judeo-christian bible in this)... despite all of that... this is a daring, important work that most people should not see. i am both impressed and creeped out that it was made at all.

first of all, this is an art film and a good one at that. i loved the presentation and way it was shot. very cool. certain scenes were some of the more graphic horror sequences i've ever seen. this film did scare me, not because of suspense or shock, but because i was deathly afraid that i'd soon see something really appalling. that did happen in a few places, but mostly at the beginning. this film also dragged and the 74 minutes seemed long. however, if you're into film you have to see this. to date, i've seen nothing like it. 8/10

not really sure what to make of this movie. very weird, very artsy. not the kind of movie you watch because it has a compelling plot or characters. more like the kind of movie that you can't stop watching because of the horrifically fascinating things happening on screen. although, the first time my wife watched this she couldn't make it all the way through... too disturbing for her. runs a bit long, but nonetheless a worthwhile viewing for those interested in very dark movies.

i absolutely like this film a lot. it is not very entertaining, but it's a feast of bizarre and stunning images! there's no dialog ,only some background sounds and noises. if you are into something completely different and original, and enjoy the obscure and bizarre...then you might like this work of art. ik looks like a film made with the very first camera ever made ,in a time where strange human-like beings live and perform their bizarre habits. god has killed himself with a razor and gave birth to mother earth. mother earth impregnated herself with god's semen after an act of fellatio, and gives birth to a son "flesh on bone". what follows are inhuman acts of ritualistic torture, rape and murder for purposes we do not know....or do we?

this kind of angst can only be inside a young person who seeks very seriously his religion and his place in this world. as the text in the beginning of the movie says, these pictures are dead: they are the past already, and have been right from the moment when the product was ready. but that is only for the maker of these "products": maybe to somebody, who is in the same frame of mind (i think very many people, at least of those who are seriously interested in religion, go through the same terrible angsts and doubts in their personal development). and that, of course, is the reason that art is made in the first place: identification and consolation amongst fellow human beings.this film uses very well the "classic" technics of the experimental cinema. and this is where those technics are to my opinion in the best possible use: as an instrument in telling stories and creating atmosphere to them, not just as a pure abstractions or as an end in themselfes. those "tricks" have already been made many enough times. some other movies that i imagine have influenced/inspired this director, are "eraserhead" and "nosferatu". it's interesting how these technics make this movie totally timeless: there is nothing contemporary in this movie. or nothing from any other specific time either. it could have been made a thousand years ago.it is interesting in this story how these people treat this new born holy child: they use it selfishly in their own purposes, and don't even try to listen to him. they beat him, rip off his intestines and castrate him. they drag his (living) body forcibly from place to place. and they do the same kind of violence to his mother. the story also reminds me of the borges' short story "el informe de brodie". also the critique towards the practices of the christian institutions reminds me of the great "el topo".unpleasant watch at times, but beautiful. very simple, thought and concentrated. very strong movie, almost too strong. the whole human energy has been concentrated to this. also this movie shows that when you have the passion and ideas, you can make a movie with a round zero budget.but i have to admit, it was a bit hard to watch for a "contemporary" viewer like myself, because of the experimentality. it was so slow and demanding. but after all, worth the suffering. i have to give ten points just for the effort that somebody makes this kind of movie.

what this movie is not: cool, entertainingwhat this movie is: visually interesting, difficult to get through, intentionali feel that this movie puts the viewer (if he or she is willing) through a clip of time where they experience a world without language. much like how animals must experience the world. you don't really watch this movie as much as you witness an awful series of events in what "feels" like real time.consistently, it goes on much longer than is comfortable. this movie could be edited down to a 20 minute short and it would be a totally different movie. it would be cool and entertaining, but the experience would be lost. i have seen a lot of cool movies, but i have never experienced one like this. if you can get your head in the right place for this one, you should be able to really appreciate (but likely not "enjoy") what they accomplished here. 10 out of 10.

sui generis. folks, i'm not going to lie to you; merhige is a one or two hit wonder, but what a film (it almost excuses suspect zero). i'm also not going to pretend to understand it completely; half of what makes it what it is is trying to second guess what the hell they are doing on the screen because of the chiaroscuro.richard corliss says, "it is as if a druidical cult had re-enacted, for real, three bible stories -- creation, the nativity and jesus' torture and death on golgotha." that's not a bad description, but there seems to be more to it than the seemingly one-to-one religious correspondences.there's an environmental theme right up near the surface -- note that toward the end (after the barrenness of the landscape) there are large pipes not unlike those on a construction site. oh no, he's going to say look at how people are raping mother nature. one rarely sees a dead metaphor in action, and with this much hyperbole, but to see it acted out is way grislier than language implies.and yeah, if you just want something to sync with a death metal soundtrack, it does have the requisite atrocities. but as for myself and others like me, it's an important art film that should merit a criterion collection release. ranks right up there with murnau's faust.~ ray

god cuts himself with a straight razor, afterwards, he gives birth to mother earth, which then gives birth through gods semen, son of earth. this is a one and a half-an-hour movie that sort of depicts a dark version of how god created the world. its surreal, dark and poetic. the most important aspect of the film to me is the visuals. its shot in a very grainy black and white film, using both slow-motion and normal shooting. sometimes even fast film and stop-motion. the scenes are long and dragged out, that sets a very weird mood. no sounds were recorded when filming (i think), sound effects were added afterwards, such as criccets, water and other ambient sounds, repeated over and over. as you might understand this movie is certainly not for the impatient person...i often felt it was similar to david lynch's eraserhead, only this one is even harder to understand, and even more dragged out, but that's okay for me, i like that kind of stuff. its certainly not entertainment (at least not the hollywood kind) so if your going to check it out, i recommend you set yourself up for it. be open minded, and except something like the end of 2001: a space odyssey.

this is not a story. it's a bunch of psychic needles reaching for your subconscious. if you wait for a story you'll be bored. but if you give yourself over to it you'll be inside it's dreamworld within 10 minutes. the vague but disturbing images of pain and torture in a desolate landscape leave room for your own fantasies. the strange soundtrack that gives you the feeling of isolation, the visual echoes of the crucifixion of christ, the pulsating light and deep dark shadows, they all reach to your subconscious to fill in this mind-space. i found myself trembling and unable to escape in front of my television. it was like dreaming with eyes wide open. a strange nightmare, a bad trip, a religious experience... it touched me deep inside and marked me for live. it freed my mind and gave me one of that rare experiences of loss of personality, and merging with the world of archetypes. a little freedom for the soul. a violent freedom however.... not a nice movie, but a very strong and unforgettable one. literally my text has no spoilers. for me the great surprise of this film was the unbelievable intensity of it, and describing this can be understood as a spoiler. the less you know about this film as you watch it, the better.

there have been many (well, more than a few in any case) attempts over the past 30 years to create film that has an "otherworldly" appearance. supposing that this is a film director's wish to distance himself from other movies, or simply to gloss over the low-budget and shabby look, "begotten" is on the top echelon of this pile.apart from the peerless "eraserhead", anyway.merhige's painstaking process of artificially degrading his film changes it's structure completely (imagine what this film would have looked like in glorious, standard technicolour) - it can almost be envisaged as an artifact from another, unknown culture. some images are so far removed from what we expect to see on the screen, they disturb mainly as they are dislocated. this is not "last house on the left" disturbance, more like leaving-your-cave-for-the-first-time-and-seeing-the-sun disturbance.watch this fever-dream if you get the chance, and relish. remember, they make other, more standard films every day. they can wait.

a warning to potential viewers of this experimental film: the nature of the imagery and the effects are such that this is one of those types of films that should really be seen on film, projected. the pixellation created by digital transfers sucks a lot of depth and adds a lot of noise to already abstract and grainy film. however, since this movie is pretty much unavailable in any format, i suppose you'll have to make do with what you can.anyway, this most excellent artistic endeavor comes courtesy of the guy who would eventually give us shadow of the vampire. it's a dark and dirty film of the genesis of the elements (as far as i can glean from the character names) through a process horrifying and surreal. begotten is a very good example of what is known as abject art, a stylistic approach that seeks meaning through the visceral more than the thematic.and visceral describes it. not very much stuff happens in the movie technically, but the levels of emotion it'll put you through are innumerable. the very repetitiveness of some of the imagery creates a mesmerizing catch over the senses. the sound editing and score in particular are immaculate, and serve the imagery incredibly well.fans of this film would do well to check out the collections of short films released through other cinema dvd, experiments in terror i, ii, and iii. movies such as these make me more and more certain that the realm of true horror resides in the abstract, abject, and non-narrative, rather than in spooky tales of ghosts and axe-murderers.--polarisdib

begotten.the magic.the terror.the slight boredom.that "begotten" is for acquired tastes goes without saying,you don't just happen to watch it unless your friends are real art-house movie buffs.you must dig the weird,the macabre,the bizarre.you must dig cool flicks.and you must dig to find diamonds."begotten" is one of the most visually dazzling and mystifying films ever known to man.the visual part is something to behold,something no one can prepare you for.but since the film is devoid of any type of dialogue,the visual part is pretty much the only part...."begotten" is a visual film.the soundscapes created for the film are magical and groundbreaking but still....the sight of it....god commits suicide in a particularly gory scene then from his corpse rises mother earth who impregnates herself with god's semen and gives birth to flesh on bone,a retarded child.she then abandons him,and he gets tortured by heathen-like creatures.mother comes back (to save him?) but she and her son get murdered by the horrible creatures.the film is about the meaninglessness of life,and about the fact that we come to this planet to suffer and to die,and that when something dies something else is born etc.nihilism.the film's no.1 quality is of course the visuals,the setting,those haunting images,this other-worldly quality....after you're done watching,you feel like an alien.it's that mesmerizing.when people say it should last 30' instead of 70' they're right.no they're not,it could last 40'.it's just that everything happens to such a slow pace.in fact,the plot summary i provided is all that happens in the film,like no kidding.still,it's....i don't know....glorious... ...like a flame burning away the darkness...

begotten is certainly an experience, and a out of the ordinary experience at that. the use of colour is fascinating and at times, frustrating. a lot of what happens on screen is incredibly difficult to make out. your view is either obscured by a sudden bizarre change in colour and tone, characters in the way and random cuts to the sky. the sound is very haunting and a welcome addition. it really aids the nihilistic and hopeless tone that smothers this film. as for what begotten is about, the "rape of the environment and rebirth" theory feels pretty accurate to me. but i wouldn't spend a lot of time focusing on the meaning, it's virtually unimportant. it's clear the director didn't want to explain anything. he simply presents it as it is, and if you want to search for a meaning that's up to you. watching begotten is definitely not a walk in the park, but i was captivated from the opening. it really is like watching a person's worst nightmare. what we see is at times distressing and very unpleasant, but there is a surreal dreamlike beauty in there. if you're an art-house/experimental fan and you haven't yet seen begotten, make it a priority. i doubt you will ever forget it. i sure know that i won't.

e. elias merhige's begotten is a one of a kind, surreal depiction of the mankind's treatment of religion. there are a couple of different ways you can interpret things, but the plot itself is simple: a god disembowels himself, and out of his corpse springs mother earth. mother earth then felates the god's corpse post-mortem, and then impregnates herself with what remains of his seed. following this, she gives birth to a messiah figure who quivers, presumably in infancy, but possibly with terror at being brought to life on earth. this all takes place in the first 15-30 minutes, and after that, the rest of the film consists of robed figures dragging the messiah (who is incessantly quivering, or seizing) across a desert landscape. the robed figures pause only to brutalize the messiah, then continue to drag him around.there are a couple of ways to interpret this, depending on your level of optimism and your world view. it can easily be interpreted as a bleak nihilistic atheist allegory about the total lack of apparent power that christian "deities" can be perceived as having in a modern society that only invokes their names to advance its own selfish goals. or you can interpret it as a postmodern pro-christian allegory, in which you view the film as being about how mankind has twisted christ's message around so much that it's original purity and innocence can no longer have relevance in a world where that message and image are inappropriately used to endorse everything from interpersonal violence, to war, to totalitarianism.the visuals of this film are phenomenal, and you will not see anything like it, period. if you can, watch the original vhs release, i recommend it. i'm not sure if the visuals are changed on the dvd, but i have seen clips of this streaming on you tube and the effects are seriously diminished. on the vhs version, merhige achieved total binary contrast. meaning, there basically aren't any mid-tones except for some grain in some of the shots. other than that, this film offers the rare opportunity to see pure white and pure black, and the result is stunning, hallucinatory, and quite unsettling. this film makes film noir look positively washed out and mediocre. the shots fade into each other in a surreal manner that recalls un chien andalou without completely aping it, for an effect that has been called a filmic rorschach test.that being said, the film can certainly try a viewer's patience and commitment. there isn't any dialogue for starters. the only sound throughout the film is a fairly constant loop of crickets chirping, peppered occasionally with the gurgling and death rattles of the dying deities, and an amelodic droning synthesizer texture. personally, i find that the film is best enjoyed listening to experimental industrial music like the instrumental nin remixes from the downward spiral era, more abstract noise/experimental music like f*ck buttons and odd nosdam. it also works quite well with apocalyptic black metal. basically any music with extreme textures and/or hypnotic rhythms. that's one of the most amazing and versatile aspects of this film, it is prime for postmodern re-contextualization, like projecting it during a performance of avant-garde music, or composing avant-garde music to accompany it.once the messiah figure is born, there really isn't much change for the rest of the film, meaning that you are basically sitting through at least 45 minutes or more of the messiah figure being drug around the desert and beaten. it looks bleakly beautiful, but there isn't really anything new unfolding. it helps to cement the filmmakers intentions of communicating that for thousands of years now people have been using christ's name and image for personal benefits, but can be tiresome to a casual viewer or someone with a short attention span. basically, if you are looking for a modern horror film with suspense, look elsewhere. if you are looking for a unique film experience, and you aren't particularly fond of mainstream hollywood cinema, this could be your quivering messiah.

i want to preface this review by saying that i have no idea what "begotten" is truly about. all i really know is that in the beginning god kills himself, in turn birthing mother earth, who proceeds to impregnate herself with god's semen. she then births a son. the rest is pretty subjective, and you have to interpret it in your own way.how i chose to interpret the film was this; god killing himself signified the start of the scientific revolution, when people started questioning the doctrines imposed by the church, like the geocentric view of the universe and etc. mother earth symbolized people starting to think for themselves and reject the church's "it happens like this because god says so" views. the tribal people were the church lashing back at them, trying to force christianity down their throats. i'm not exactly sure how son of earth fits into all of this. mother earth and the tribal people seemed to be fighting over him, so maybe he represents the freedom of people or something to that effect.i have no idea what the final parts of this movie are supposed to mean. bludgeoning, raping, then dismembering mother earth and son of earth and grinding them into the ground like a mortar and pestle could mean anything, but that is where the fun of this film lies; you can interpret it any way you want. there doesn't have to be a definitive meaning to it, you can let your mind wander. sometimes you don't even know what you are supposed to be looking at because it is shot in a weird angle or it is too fuzzy.the only thing that disappointed me was that i was expecting a truly terrifying film. i was going into it thinking i was going to get a phone call immediately afterward with a foreboding "seven days" warning. what i got was pleasantly different. it was not scary at all, but it stirred my imagination. trying to decipher the movie's cryptic message was a creative challenge. there were many scenes that were in fact beautiful. mother earth just after she was born and the final shot of the forest path come to mind.so overall i would have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed this film. it is certainly the most abstract movie i've ever seen, but that's not a bad thing.

e. elias merhige's existentialist experiment in the enduring is definitely one hell of a boring watch. this is like something alexander de large was forced to watch in "a clockwork orange." but, despite just how unwatchable this film really is, it is a success.if you are reading this and have not already seen the film, then it is too late. for me, at least, the payoff (after 3 separate viewings with lots of break in between mind you) was seeing the list of characters *after* the story was told. that's when the simple message hit home. but i wonder if merhige could have told a 5 minutes story in about 30, instead of 78.however, seeing as how the cast of credits is displayed prominently on the front page for this movie, the cat is already out of the bag and you surely will only appreciate this film if you appreciate existentialist film making from the early 20th century. even then, you might puke.4/10 (but i commend merhige for crafted a piece of art, even if it is unwatchable)

even though it doesn't really matter to the film, this is a creation myth. god (a convulsing, bloody figure in a chair) cuts his organs out with a straight razor and dies in his own filth. mother earth rises from his corpse and impregnates herself with his seed, giving birth to man. it is, however highly unlikely for you to figure any of this out without reading a synopsis first, and it's not especially important to the film that you do, as it's more a surrealistic art-house imagery thing, all in inky, processed black and white. a sick, bleak atmosphere is created with the stark photography and minimal sounds (mostly water dripping, groans, scrapes, etc.) but each scene goes on a bit too long and so does the film as a whole. this could've been great as a short film, and the god killing himself scene was excellent and extremely creepy, especially being the first thing you see, but it's hard to be patient when it goes on for so long and you don't even know what you're seeing for much of the time.still, a good film for the original style, images, atmosphere and content.

daniel percival's "dirty war", a bbc production made for television was shown recently on cable. the film has a documentary style in the way it goes after the people that caused the near holocaust in one of the big metropolis of the world, london. in fact, this film, produced in 2004 is almost a cautionary tale of the events of the following year, in which terrorists set explosive devices in the public transport that killed innocent people that were in the wrong place, at the wrong time.the film impresses for the pace the director and the production team gave to the project. there are no dull moments in the movie as we watch the preparation by the terrorists and the people that are following their dirty work. although the inevitable happens, it's amazing just to think what would be the consequences if a real 'dirty bomb' was planted in such a densely populated area.the last images of the film have a chilling effect. the mob scenes and the way the whole area is contaminated send shivers of fear, thinking how it could possible happen anywhere.

well this movie certainly was in keeping with the current times. no happy endings, super-heroes, or miracles here. just down-to-earth fiction to stimulate our minds along the lines of terrorism, and what-ifs. kudos to percival and mickery for an excellent screenplay and superb direction by percival. films like this are needed to keep us aware of what is out there. if every peace-loving man and woman on earth reported obviously suspicious activities i believe terrorism could not thrive. this movie showed just how hard it really is to subvert these terrorists, even with good intelligence. even though the film is a bit propagandist against islam (the use of a muslim police officer as a main character) i believe it was entirely realistic. there was meant to be shock-value in the bombing incident. as a very clever tool to relay the humility and indignity of people caught up in an attack such as this, they showed full nudity of women being decontaminated post-attack. it didn't take me long to realize that this was meant to even further instill into the viewer that thought, i.e., we are not in control of everything in a situation like this. although this took place in london, with the usual high-level british acting, it makes a statement for any part of the world. great movies don't have to be blockbuster epic productions, and this movie is very very worthy of viewing.

the bbc and hbo teamed up to create "dirty war", a 90 minute tv movie about a terrorist "dirty bomb" attack in london. the film gets down to business quickly as it packs both the terrorist and the government anti-terrorist efforts into the film leaving little room for human interest subplots. on the terrorist side we follow the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive materials to assembly to deployment to detonation. on the government side we see pr and training exercises, intelligence gathering and analysis, interdiction, post-detonation response, and follow up. the film also imparts a sense of how al-qa'ida type terrorist cells are organized, the radical islamic terrorist mentality, and terrorist strategies. a sort of anatomy of a "dirty bomb" incident, "dirty war" will answer many questions lurking in the minds of a public becoming ever more aware of this insidious threat.

i just wanted to say that when i was young my favorite t.v show back in the day was night heat. i loved the characters and the plot of the show. i thought that it was an excellent show and still do to this day. i enjoy watching the reruns and i am a big fan.i love the way the characters played off one another.i would always stay up late to watch my favorite show with my mother who also was a big fan. now i can enjoy watching my show again and listening to the theme song.which i thought was a cool song for the show.my favorite characters were scott hylands and jeff wincott.i enjoyed watching these handsome guys take down the bad boys.

this lasted several years despite the late hour it was on.like a lot of 80's crime dramas, it looked cold. both physically and figuratively. this isn't a bad thing though. and the (obviously) low budget actually worked in it's favor. gritty during a time when 'slick' was in.allan royal's wraparound segments as the news writer gave it a slight edge.the only actors i remembered were scott nylands (earthquake) and tony rosato (sctv). the cast of barely knowns was a good thing because one could see the group as a whole and not as a bunch of people supporting a 'star.' and yes, that's a young clark johnson (homicide) in a recurring spot.i hope a dvd release is in the future. someone out there wanna get on that?

i feel the niiiiiight heat! i feel your heeaaaaaaaaaart-beat! something ain't right!" theme song written by b.j. cook from skylark- david foster's old band and wife. she also wrote the memorable theme from cbc's "airwaves." oh night heat! what a program! well-written, well-acted and totally classic. crime solvers and a good team and a dash of humour at the end. i'd like to think this is really what detectives do/did. giambone was a real favourite! on a canadian tip, i learned every canadian actor's name and style from guest spots done on night heat. everyone passed through the night heat set and like law & order, it was story-driven so you could just watch and enjoy without a lot of character melodrama.

beautiful, emotional, and subtle. i watch this movie at an art center with a smaller screen in a film room with 95% of senior citizens. i wish bigger cinema like lowes around here would show it. great cinematography by wong and christopher doyle. since i understand cantonese, it's a lot easier for me to understand the movie. as simple as the story goes, many english speaking viewers didn't get the whole story. three old ladies next to me keep yapping and have no clues about the movie.spoiler; they were surprise when i mention that mr. chow did sleep with mrs chen and they have a son. she went to singapore trying to tell him but didn't.spoilerthe mandarin translation of the movie title actually means flowery like moment or memory. the phrase usually used to describe beautiful and wonderful memory that was inpermanance and short. the whole movie pretty much fit the title. not to mention the flowery "cheung sam".my favorite scene was definately the street corner in the alley. it looks so beautiful, the sun shining on the old and faded wall, at night in the dark, in the rain, truely a poetic moment. i felt a strong sense of intimacy of their relationship seeing them standing against the wall and talk quietly. i felt a terrible heartache when mr chow was rehearsing his departing moment, and mrs chen cried on his shoulder.... bravo wong kar-wai!as much as i like this one, chungking express still top my favorite. however, i'll give this one a 10 as well. as a point of reference, cthd only got 7.if you love art, you will love this movie. don't miss it.

kar wai wong's incredibly impressive romance that is to me, perfect. set in 1960's hong kong. as we are shown, this is set in a turbulent time. tony leung and maggie cheung play chow mo-wan and su li-zhen chan. a man and a woman who meet each other in a hong kong apartment, in which they both move in. chow mo-wan works for a newspaper company. su li-zhen chan is a secretary. two very different people. chow mo-wan and su li-zhen chan create a special bond after they both find out their spouses, constantly away are committing extra-marital trysts. with each other.the characters of chow mo-wan and su li-zhen chan are nothing short of amazing. both leung and cheung manage to strike such amazing chemistry with one another, it's better than any hollywood romance that is put out today. combined. the film is all about the focus of the two leads and their feelings after the infidelities of their partners. kar wai wong manages to create such strong character development between these two characters, you really start to feel for them. leung and cheung are both wildly amazing, are better than any hollywood pairing shown on the screen today. combined.there's nothing much else to describe fa yeung nin wa other than beautiful, energetic romance that also features a moody, atmospheric piece with gorgeous cinematography. so much elements of this movie help create it to be flawless. as well as kar wai wong and the acting, the cinematography from both christopher doyle and pin bing lee is haunting. beautifully understated. the shots from kar wai wong help makes your mind create a world of it's own. a world that creates these characters. original, melancholic and nostalgic. this film is incredibly unforgettable.the costumes created by kar wai wong regular william chang are absolutely beautiful. cheung, who wears an elegant, ankle-deep, beautifully patterned dress in every scene. she's a scene-stealer. her costumes say a lot about her character and an emotion is fitted in all of her dresses colours which are vividly and smartly used. highly original. chang, also the production designer creates a brilliant setting for the movies moody piece. especially with the help of the marvellous music used in scenes and masterful film editing, again by chang. william chang seems to be incredibly versatile and is an unsung hero for this movie.overall, this movie is one of the best from this millennium. incredibly compelling and filled with nostalgia. the shots are mesmerising and haunting. kar wai wong somewhat proves to be a master at the top of his game. the acting; music; cinematography; editing; production; costume and direction all help create one small, little perfect film. a masterpiece in romance film-making. visually spectacular. overall, a masterpiece to film-making. a film that reminds me of old classic hollywood, was the one that never was. never forget fa yeung nin wa. i know i won't.

this film is wonderful film for students of film. in mainstream american film it is common to see stylistic techniques used to draw the audience into the movie. in this film, the director uses stylistic techniques to push the story forward.this is a love story that offers no sex. to be honest, i can't even recall the characters kissing. rather, the plot focuses on the emotional ties between the two characters.i would not recommend this film for everybody. it is not very accessible. it is very slow moving and the subtle. it is a difficult film and mostly not entertaining.i would reccoment this film to people who want to see something different. it is a piece of art. the soundtrack is most beautiful and visually, every frame is a photograph. and most beautiful of all, it's not visually stimulating for the sake of being visually stimulating. every frame illustrates a little bit more of the story...

spoiler alert!!!you can listen to wong kar-wai's movies like a radio play: invisible vibrations between the characters, the rooms where they stay in, the rhythm that presses them ahead, attraction and dislike - the whole spectrum of the atmosphere is played back by the sound track. the dialogue is mostly completely unimportant.the narration is similar to a childish amorous look at a beautiful woman and a sad man whose sorrows are noticeable, but helpless. "in the mood for love" is told from a child perspective, but the child never appears as a narrator. the aesthetic of the film is developed by an extreme light and color dramaturgy, harsh cuts, an unattached, almost documentary camera and a complex, unobtrusive sound.the genius use of nat king cole's "perhaps, perhaps, perhaps", whose mysterious power grows the more often it is repeated and the melancholic waltz helps in the graceful choreography of the two protagonists. maggie cheung in her beautiful dresses is brilliant, the perfect vis-à-vis to the handsome, stylish tony leung. the audience assumes a romance between them, but wong just sees sad resignation. the two potential lovers are revolving around each other like satellites, knowing that they never will share the same orbit. you wish that they will find each other. they won't and the emotional power of their non-love-sex-relationship makes the movie immensely fascinating.it is about broken luck and unspoken love. in all of wong's films these are the leitmotives. love, whether it comes too early or it comes too late to take the one and not the other person. the yearning of the characters that is never satisfied, their loneliness, the mourning, and the luck that they experience when it is too late.

in hong kong, 1962, the editor chow mo-wan (tony leung chiu wai) and his wife, and the secretary su li-zhen chan (maggie cheung) and her husband simultaneously move to an old building. each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor. their wife and husband stay most of the time away from home, and chow and li-zhen have the same habits: they like kung-fu stories and noodles and soap from a restaurant nearby the building. their close contact becomes friendship and a sort of platonic and repressed love. later they realize that their mates are having an affair, chow falls in love with li-zhen, but her shyness and probably repressed condition of married woman keeps her love in a platonic level. 'in the mood for love' is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story, with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. the film had not had a screenplay, and the actors were never sure about what they would be shooting. later, the director edited his story based on the footages. when chow moves to singapore, there is a gap of many years in the story until 1966, when its conclusion is intentionally open and not well defined, leaving questions such as who is the boy with li-zhen. my vote is eight.title (brazil): 'amor à flor da pele' ('love on the surface of the skin')

beautiful film set in 1962 hong kong about a man (mr. chow) and woman (mrs. chan) who become close friends when they suspect their spouses are having an affair. stylistically, the film is also beautiful. wong kar-wai uses a lot of slow motion and close-ups on parts of the body (feet, hands, waist). the film itself has a reticence and properness that suggests its time period. it's sexy without showing everything. wong kar-wai also doesn't allow the audience to see what the spouses look like, suggesting that mr. chow and mrs. chan should be together. smoking is even made to look elegant with close-ups of the curls of smoke. a really lovely film. just prepare yourself for the ending.

warning: spoiler,spoiler,spoiler!!!!this is written for filmgoers who may have walked away from "mood for love" perplexed and confused about paths the main characters choose in life. from reading other comments and reviews it seems that many viewers and critics missed some very important details which may have prevented them from enjoying this delightful tease of a movie.we are so use to seeing blatant sex in narrations that we forget that there was a time when filmakers would suggest the "dirty deed" by simply showing the slack-mouthed couples ride off in a sleigh or haywagon only to return into the next scene with a bulging gut or a fat toddler stuck to the hip..."meet your child".the director chose the same nostalgic approach in telling the story of mr chow and mrs chan. last warning...spoiler spoiler spoilermr chow fools mrs chan into showing her real emotions when they rehearse his departure forever. next scene: mrs chan leans her head on mr chow in the taxi and says "i do not want to go home tonight". translation: "let's do it"why then did the couple just not do the modern thing of dumping their cheating spouses,get a divorce,raise their love child and live happily ever after? the answer is that this whole story takes place in hong kong during the sixties. a bastard would live in a bleak life of shame if he were the child of an adulteress;whereas,a "legitimate" child could live a tragic but noble/honest life if his mother chose to raise him away from his cheating "father"-the invisible mr chan. in short,mr chow and mrs chan sacrifices their relationship for the future of their child.that is why mr chow,upon learning that mrs chan lives alone with a little boy gives a knowing smile and ends his dreams of making mrs chan his mrs chow. he then,also realizes why mrs chan went to all the way to singapore to be with him,only to reconsiders at the last momment and leave..,choosing to never see him again.(but not before taking some unnamed keepsake) mr chow lives with this wonderful secret with no one to tell. no one,except for a crumbling temple wall and of course we the viewer,...but only if we listen carefuly.

set in 1962 hong kong (in turbulent times, as we are informed), this extremely intimate story of a failed romance between a two married people tied to their traditions manages to recall the essence of old hollywood in scene after scene of lush colors, evocative yet restrained sensuality (as opposed of the requisite sexuality and occasional nude scenes which has become part of the norm of a romance in film), and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication. it's not hard to see the influence of marguerite duras here, since she is known for minimalism in storytelling as well as describing powerful drama using the art of verbal and non-verbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond as well as the use of re-enacting scenes that could eventually take place in both the characters' lives. from hiroshima mon amour to moderato cantabile, her pen is strongly visible here from the moment we enter the cramped rooms of mr. chow (tony leung) and mrs. su li-zhen (maggie cheung) to the last scenes which explain the intensity of regret that he feels as he recalls the opportunity which was lost in reaffirming this relationship.the plot even resembles something that duras could have written: mr. chow and mrs. su li-zhen, neighbors in a tenement apartment while both being fairly successful professionals, begin to discover in the most banal of ways that their spouses are cheating on them, and they discover quite naturally, it's with each other. the question is, should they act upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners? every scene plays with the notion that at any moment they will give in to each other, and at one point, it is suggested that eventually they do though as intrusive as the camera is in detailing to us their encounters (which seem to occur on a daily basis as seen by the frequent changes of cheung's dresses), we never see it. and just as not seeing either of their spouses heightens their own love story, not seeing them carry through with their attraction makes the eventual separation even the more bitter because at every moment we want for something to happen -- some catalyst -- and the only one which comes is when leung reveals to her that he loves her, followed by his quietly brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband, which implies that neither will he. it also gives us a glimpse of what culture and timing can do: from a western point of view, a consummation of their romance into a more solid, lasting affair would have been possible especially in the 60s, but as it's hong kong, cultural values are markedly different.performances here are of the high order: it's very easy to play a torrid love affair, but to continually play a repressed, platonic relationship that is brimming with desire only barely suggested is hard and makes all the sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual. cheung and leung smolder and their blighted chemistry lingers long after the credits have rolled.

"the missing star", who competed for the golden lion at 2006 venice film festival, is a film that, when you think about, the first adjective that comes to your mind is: intense. intense looks, intense sequences, this movie's intensity captures the viewer since the very first scenes at the steelworks, in italy (i couldn't recognize the city, maybe genoa or even naples), although the pace is quite slow.vincenzo buonavolontà, the male lead, and with him, all the audience, sees a completely different china than a normal westerner imagines: horrible high-rise building with about 8 hundred flat owners inside, skyscrapers, desolation, fog, scrapers and cranes everywhere, but also the beauty of the yangtze kiang river, that will soon become a big lake because of the controversial dike that will wipe a lot of towns out. china is a country under construction, but, under all these colossal public works, there are still poverty, backwardness and unfair laws.we can relate more easily to this story because gianni amelio, the expert director, chose two phenomenal leads: sergio castellitto, a well-known actor in italy, and the chinese surprise tai ling, a total unknown girl that gives an as intense interpretation as castellitto's.the film is not perfect, there are some flaws here and there, but that doesn't mean it's a mediocre film. try to see it.

as a modern marco polo, from venice to china, here we come amelio, again, taking on the task to render us the grey area in the middle of two worlds in solid colors. eroded by globalization's collateral damages, the pessimistic vision of europe is mutual with chinas. the view of that charming but puzzling country is dealt from below, devoid of any claim to learn or impose opinions. reality, nonetheless, is harsh. abandoned and exploited children, beehive-homes, backward areas is the other china we ignore. vincenzo (castellitto), a technician of a steel factory, is one of us. his voyage to china is a pretext to understand, to learn from the inside a country where progress and third-world problems live together in an infamous balance. it's not exactly clear if vincenzo knew by the first time that the mechanical component was already been fixed, i think so; anyway is a minor aspect. liu, the chinese girl, is the key of the whole film. she carries on her back a lot of difficulties, she's got the strength to overcome, but how could she fight with little money and little help ? the realistic and unbiased view of the facts by the girl, refusing vincenzo's money, touched me a lot. a pack of bank-notes can't get back her husband, her baby (forced to treat like a stranger for the law), protect her by scorns. liu knew his intentions were benign and kind, far from a cold charity act. their friendship is beautifully narrated, the way it grows step by step, dignified and formative, unique. a priceless legacy to keep.some scenes are stunning, either for the acting (vincenzo crying on the ferry) or by the dialogues (at the restaurant, on the railroads). besides a careless editing and a pretty lazy start, "la stella che non c'è" is brilliant and sharp just because chronicles the untold verities.in competition at 63rd venice film festival, plenty bet on tai ling for the mastroianni prize, dedicated to emerging stars. she definitely deserved that award.[8/10]

when i went to the cinema, i expected not much. i knew nothing about this movie but it was the only movie i could see, 'cause i was in a small town then. so i saw this movie and i was fascinated! "la stelle che non c'è" is a trip through the new industrial china and it shows it honestly! you see most of the time the ugly places of china, and you see what really happens with this new industrializing. the main characters are sad but hopefully people. he's the naive italian guy who can't believe what he see's. she's a translator from china who's missing her son. sometimes sad, sometimes funny but every time poetic! a wonderful movie with wonderful actors! so only one star is missing!

this is a wonderful new movie currently still showing in cinemas in my country. its director, the calabrian gianni amelio, is in my humble view perhaps the only contemporary italian director, along with nanni moretti, to deserve being called great (that is, apart from the old masters who're still around and occasionally still churning out movies). it's one of my greatest regrets that contemporary italian cinema has been ailing since the mid-70s, mostly due to a dire lack of funding and nurturing of new talent, something which can be transferred to most fields and which makes italy one of the most static industrialised countries of our time production-wise (both in an industrial and cultural sense)... unlike, say, china. and this, among other things, is precisely the subject of amelio's latest movie. few directors can speak to me about the true, present state of my country and the world as amelio can, yet his pictures also have a precious timelessness and universality. and for those already worrying that they may be slow, ponderous and worthy - rest assured: of the ones i've seen they most certainly aren't, at least not if you're used to quality european cinema.the basic plot outline: vincenzo buonavolontà is a technician at an obsolete steel plant factory somewhere in italy, probably the north. he is played by sergio castellitto, one of contemporary italy's most versatile and talented actors. when a major chinese steel company purchases some of the italian steel plant's industrial machinery, vincenzo, who struggles to make himself understood with the non-italian speaking chinese director, tries to tell him that the machine is defective and its converter needs substituting, an element he's working on custom-building himself. he warns them that not doing this might have very dangerous consequences. meanwhile a young chinese woman called liu hua acts as interpreter between the two men, but seems to struggle to find adequate translations for some of vincenzo's technical jargon. the italian eventually loses his patience with her, virtually pushing her aside and asking her to hand him the chinese-italian dictionary so that he can do the translating himself.despite vincenzo's warnings, the following morning he finds that the chinese factory director and his employees have returned to their own country while not heeding his advice about the adequate use of the industrial machine at all. thus vincenzo, equipped with his great integrity, sets off for china. and here begins an endlessly fascinating road movie through china, a very topical 21st century odyssey through the asian giant. a latter-day marco polo's quest for the secrets of the mysterious nation? not quite. as in all of amelio's movies, the journey itself becomes far more important than whether its ultimate "mission" is carried out or not. in fact, the way in which the point is literally brought home, not without a touch of humour, is a lovely, poignant paradox and irony, which made my eyes well up while i was simultaneously smiling. the spectator is let in on the secret that vincenzo's trip was ultimately completely useless, but he himself doesn't know it, and goes home a satisfied man, a deluded innocent. at least, you figure, he's happy. sort of.the journeys that amelio's characters embark on totally uproots and strips them down to their bare, human essentials. they are momentarily without name, status or someone to put in a word for them. these theo angelopoulos-like themes are also explored in lamerica, actually my favourite amelio movie, closely followed by la stella che non c'è in order of personal preference. in the 1994 movie lamerica, two italian racketeers travel to albania to "do business". just like vincenzo, they intend to go there, do what they have to do and then go back home. instead, one of these two italians accidentally ends up on an almost homeric journey through this devastated land just after the fall of communism.but let us go back to la stella che non c'è: once vincenzo is in china, he predictably discovers that the seemingly "simple" task of handing the converter to its new owner is anything but straight-forward. the piece of machinery's new location is seemingly almost impossible to determine, unless he embarks on an arduous journey through china. when he comes across liu hua, the young interpreter he'd mistreated now working as a librarian, he tries to speak to her but she reacts in a hostile manner, informing him that because of him, she'd lost her job as interpreter back in italy. played by the relative newcomer ling tai, liu hua soon becomes a virgil to vincenzo's dante when she grudgingly figures that she could do worse than to act as guide and interpreter for the italian on his trip (obviously for a consistent sum of cash). this young chinese actress may not have the beauty of ziyi zhang, nor the movie star glamour of gong li, but her charming, expressive and pretty face oozes a combination of defiant strength, intelligence, dignity and wry humour that'll make her features difficult to forget once you've seen the movie. furthermore, she and castellitto have wonderful emotional chemistry as co-stars.amelio weaves dramas that are serious, poetic, mythical, post-neo-realist and humorous all at once, while maintaining a heart-warming ability to explore the fleeting essence of humanity in everyday, commonplace circumstances. a documentary-like naturalness conceals what is actually a meticulously conceived tapestry of faces and places, a vista which also manages to incorporate a cinematography of breath-taking beauty. the photography here is functional yet gorgeous, as befits a movie on the displaced in an industrial and emotional wasteland.amelio's observant eye is a grown-up, disillusioned one, yet also never a cynical or misanthropic one. the masterful camera angles also often gives a sense of vincenzo's alienness in the eyes of the chinese, bringing home a sense of objectivity and cultural impartiality that's very rare in movies about a "familiar" westerner exploring an "unfamiliar" non-western country. i cannot recommend this movie enough.

this is an enjoyable movie. its very realistic to the "wonderful world of music" i've been there and done that. it shows a human element in each character and the realism that nobody is perfect. these amateur musicians weren't all that bad players. cleavon little's character, marshall tucker, was played very well. marshall was no saint himself. here he was getting paid to do a job and he's giving these guys a hard time about everything in the van on the way up there. you don't bite the hands that feed you. i do find it hard to believe that a player with the jazz experience he has, claims he does not know any of the dixieland tunes. he has a tremendous sense of predicting chord changes to tunes he does not know. not common, but not unheard of either. he delivers a true and harsh message at the end of the movie when he tells the clarinet player, "its not a religion, devotion is not enough." on that level, he is correct, although i think the clarinet player could have handled the job. he was practicing his butt off and vocal accompaniment music is not that hard to read. very enjoyable movie.

this movie is almost never seen today - the only reason i can enjoy it again and again is from a slightly worn out vhs copy i made when the film was shown on tv in 1991 here in england.an ensemble cast are obviously enjoying themselves and this is reflected to the viewer. a razor sharp script helps things along, and once you've seen this you will want to watch it over and over again.wayne rogers is the 'star' but everyone contributes to a great film, with a great jazz soundtrack to boot. there are emotional moments during the film, but never to the point of sickly sweet sentimentalism - these are guys on the trip of a lifetime, and they convey that excitement wonderfully.highly recommended if you can actually get to see it.

"the gig" is a tight, funny and poignant little movie about a group of friends that have gathered together on a regular basis to play dixieland for fun. the group unexpectedly lands a real paying job, in musician's parlance; a "gig".they travel to upstate ny for a two week gig at a summer resort minus one member, who bows out due to contracting cancer. at the last minute, they hire a professional to take his place. things get sticky as an over-the-hill frankie valli type attempts a comeback at the resort and tries to utilize the group as his band.the attitude the professional bass player gave the guys rang true. by signing up to play the two-week gig, they were taking bread out of the mouths of someone who needed the job to feed his or her family. while pop, rock, rap, country and western, and r&b stars make money off of albums. jazz musicians have to travel abroad to make a living. almost nobody gets rich. the guys living their dream also cost others a needed income.i believe that almost everyone who can play a musical instrument with some proficiency dreams about playing a paying "gig" one time or another, woody allen and kevin bacon are two popular examples of this amateur-to-professional crossover. i especially recommend this movie to anyone who has ever played music professionally. my mom, who was a musician, loved it.

i absolutely love this movie! evil dead has nothing on this film! night of the demons 2 and 3 are a total bore fest, but this one is a classic. it's super cheesy and the acting is alright at best, but what more could you want from an 80's horror movie? stooge has some of the best one-liners to ever hit the screen in this one. (he's my favorite character) a lot of people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie, but my personal favorite is the ending, sadly enough has nothing to do with the main characters, when the old man eats his left over halloween apples in a pie, and his throat is mangled from the inside out. the sound track is awesome. the scene with angela dancing is totally creepy, especially after the strobe light comes on, and you can see her jump from one part of the floor to the next with every sound of a camera shutter click on the song that's playing. the make-up effects in this movie are pretty sweet; angela gave me nightmares as a kid. if you're the type of person who demands perfection out of your filming experience, you might want to give this one a pass. but, if you're like me, and you really dig the whole halloween, haunted house with the demons cliché, than this one is definitely a must own.

once again almenábar has provided us with a top quality film. this director is amazing, and he's proven that he's equally talented and effective when crossing genres. the excellent character development of the movie, through dialogue and personality quirks, but with more subtle details as well (ramon's father's gaze), allows the audience to identify with the protagonists very closely, making the importance and emotional impact of the events which take place all the more profound. the visuals are at times, simple, at times stunning (the dream to the beach), and i think almenábar's films really benefit from the fact that he also composes the music - it matched the film's varying moods flawlessly.more than just a film about euthanasia, which in itself is an important issue, this film tackles the duality of a man who at times genuinely seems to enjoy life (albeit in a quite limited way), and yet one who is unswerving in his desire to die. the overwhelming sadness of the film is punctuated by well-timed quips of humor, which seem all the funnier because they provide a welcome respite from the melancholy you will certainly feel.although clearly in favor of euthanasia, this film does an excellent job representing the myriad points of view of ramon's friends and family. most poignant was ramon's father, when he said, despondent, "there's only one thing worse than losing a child. that the child wants to die."excellent writing, acting, directing, cinematography, music - 10/10.

since many other users have already explained and commented the storyline, i won't do it.however, i'd like to restate that bardem's interpretation is terrific, as also are those of the other actors and actresses in this film. reading the previous comments i've noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film doesn't show points of view opposed to euthanasia and that those little present are ridiculed. in my honest opinion this is far from true.there are many characters that move in a gray zone between loving ramón sampedro and wanting him to stay, and understanding his desire to die. most obvious of those are the family. for instance, ramón's sister-in-law never talks for or against euthanasia. another such character is gené (the social rights activist) who, in the last moment, tells ramón to re-think it all. the scene clearly shows that she doesn't want him to die.then there are characters who are clearly against euthanasia. ramón's brother is clearly against it, as is his father ("there's only one thing worse than the death of son, and it's having a son that wants to die.") other users have commented that the discussion between ramón and the priest is ridiculed and filmed to make us think that ramón is good and the priest is bad. well, no doubt the scene is comic, but that doesn't mean the priest is caricatured or ridiculed. from my point of view, the comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest is trying to convince ramón to keep on living using arguments totally alien to ramón's thinking. the priest's speech goes on the line of "god gives and god takes", "we aren't the owners of our own lives, they belong to god"... and so on. the comedy arises from the fact that ramón is atheist and all the priest is saying to him is therefore nonsense.this film is the antithesis of manicheism, it leaves the spectator the chance to think on the subject and make up his/her own opinion. and above anything else is a chant of freedom.

i just saw mar ardentro and felt that i had to comment on this film. euthanasia is a difficult topic in any field and unfortunately is can sometimes distort the true value of a movie. many people have raved about the excellent cast and it's beautiful imagery/camera-work. certainly javier bardem is an actor that brings something extra to each film he makes. to say that he encompasses the real sampredo is a little silly since i don't think that any of the reviewers have known sampredo personally. to lie still and use a certain charm is a acting skill that although well performed doesn't constitute a 'perfect' performance. bardem just does what he does well...and that's it. the camera-work is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the movie itself lacks to deliver. sampredo here is shown as a man that is bend on dying so much that he leaves his loving family behind and marries a woman that he only seeks out when the other will not help him in his quest for a dignified death. now i'm not here to say anything about the right for or against euthanasia. the problem is that when commenting movies like this you can hardly escape it. the movie's subject is so strong that you're almost compelled to discuss the movie in that strong subject matter. i find it a weakness for the movie -unintentionally- portrays sampredo as a unsymphatetic character. someone who is much smarter then his family as portrayed in the simple cousin that doesn't "get" the double layered poem directed towards him. someone who will leave a loving and caring family because he thinks his life is undignified. a scene that is juxtaposed to the female lawyer who according to the movie makes the "wrong" choice ending up in a far state of dementia thus indicating that sampredo's choice was the right one. the woman that constantly seeks him out is almost disregarded for the beautiful lawyer but suddenly is married by sampredo when she agrees to help him die. these choices make sampredo into a calculated figure no matter how charming bardem portrays him. argumentive i would say it doesn't convince fully and i kinda think that amenabar didn't intend on adding this unbalanced element in his film. for a young director it's still an impressive film and it certainly has it's strong moments (the discussion between the priest and sampredo for instance). the camera-work is impressive and the film is well acted. but 10 out of 10...no the movie doesn't reach that excellence.

the true story of a spanish paraplegic, ramón sampedro, who fought for decades for the right to be euthenized. this film, along with the best picture winner of the same year, million dollar baby, caused a stir that year with their depictions of disabled persons desiring death. both advocates for the disabled and (unfortunately for the disability advocates) conservative pro-life groups protested both films, and their oscar nominations. the nominations also came during the entire terry schiavo debacle, just to put it all in some historical perspective. the protests, especially from the disability groups, against million dollar baby make some sense  the film clearly depicted, without wavering, the life of a paraplegic as worthless. the film's central character, maggie fitzgerald, becomes a paraplegic, doesn't seem to get any counseling whatsoever, no help whatsoever, and immediately wants to die. the film is, honestly, pretty dumb and uncomplex. the sea inside, based on the true story, is certainly a lot more thoughtful on the subject. it most likely got railroaded into the same category as million dollar baby without its protesters having even seen it, an incredibly common phenomenon. the film does give time to many different sides of the argument. and it immediately declares that the wish to die is that of the protagonist and the protagonist alone. it is guilty of a couple of crimes, though, and i'd still understand why disability groups could have a problem with it. first and foremost, there's the protagonist's meeting with a paraplegic bishop. i don't look kindly on the way he's depicted. his orally operated wheelchair is depicted as absurd, and there's almost a comic sequence where his effeminate, boy-toy servants are dragging him, in his chair, up the stairs. he can't even reach the room in which ramón is located, and one of the boy-toys is forced to carry the conversation between them. i had to think, gee, maybe if ramón lived in a slightly more wheelchair-accessible household, he wouldn't spend his entire life in bed, and might find life more fulfilling (who knows how closely the film depicts the reality). director amenábar (the others) also includes some laughable scenes that try to make this film about suicide more life-affirming, like a cross-cut sequence where ramón looks thoughtful and his lawyer's baby is born. but besides a few ugly moments, the film is very good. it hurts that someone may want to die when they have the ability to bring so much joy and insight into the lives of others. however, in the end, our lives do belong to us. shouldn't we have the right to choose? the film's strongest asset is its supporting characters, and the actors who play them. it depicts how ramón's fight and decisions affect those around him with a beautiful precision. the family members in particular are great, and ramón's final departure from them is absolutely heartbreaking, and had me in tears. my favorite performance in the film comes from lola dueñas, whom i also felt gave the best, or at least certainly most undervalued, performance in almodóvar's volver last year.

the sea inside a film by alejandro amenabar.almodovar has always single handed the flag for spanish cinema for years now, out of nowhere came amenabar reinventing genres and injecting some new blood to the otherwise malfunctioning spanish industry, now in a big gamble he switches from psychological terror to social drama, well the big ones would be, are audiences ready to embrace the swing and more important can he hold the flag? this is the story of ramon sampedro, a sailor that in his twenties was paralyzed from the neck down in an accident at the sea and his fight with the spanish government for the right to end his life. the story has the traces of an afternoon made for tv melodrama and the only way this is going to work is through words and honest performances and they both come in spades. mateo gil and amenabar co-write in a way where the audience is not meant to be lead blind to a death end but they are encouraged to make up their own minds in the process and that is a brilliant stroke, this is not a movie pro death but a movie in favour of the ultimate illusions of our time liberty. there is a few laughs spare a long the way, like when the church comes home in a wheel chair to deconstruct sampedro beliefs but is mostly a valley of tears through out, punches coming from all fronts even when you think you are safe his father that to that point didn't make any sense comes up with the most moving line of the entire movie. it is a heartbreaking experience specially when sampedro seems more full of life than most the people wandering the streets and everyone around him tries to convince him of the wonders of life even those who are helping him to die but when you strip a man of his dreams the film is almost exclusively built on close ups bringing a claustrophobic feeling that makes the audience more sympathetic with sampedro. that's for the actors a huge challenge that must construct their whole performances with their eyes and the eyes don't lie. bardem was not granted his second oscar nomination, probably in favour of eastwood, but in my opinion he was the only one who could have shadowed jammie fox. this role reminds me of the great gregory peck in to kill a mockingbird where the acting looked effortless and i reckon bardem has reached that status where the line of what is acting and what is real has become completely blur. i was never fond of his early work but since almodovar's live flesh he is on a roll, los lunes al sol, the dancer upstairs and the oscar nominated before the night falls made him an international star and although he and banderas come from the same almodovar background is fascinating to see how different paths they took and how bardem has now become a real reference for spanish cinema in the whole world. a golden globe, 14 goyas, jury prize at venice and probably an oscar with permission from the chorus boys, amenabar directs, co-write, edits and puts music to a high caliber drama, he has pull it off what about some science fiction now? whose life is it anyway?****.

in spain, the former sailor ramón sampedro (javier bardem) has been quadriplegic for twenty-eight years and is fighting in court for his right of practicing euthanasia through an association that defends the freedom of choice and leaded by his friend géne (clara segura). ramón is introduced to the lawyer that is defending his cause, julia (belén rueda), who has a degenerative fatal disease; and meets rosa (lola dueñas), a lonely worker that has been abused by men. their relationship changes the behavior and viewpoint of life of rosa and julia.the chilean alejandro amenábar is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary directors. his filmography released in brazil is composed by excellent and original movies: "abre los ojos", "tesis", "the others" and "mar adentro". javier bardem is probably the best actor in spain in the present days. their association produced this sensitive drama about a very polemic theme, the right of committing euthanasia. this drama is never corny or depressive, since the screenplay uses humor as a relieve valve in the most dramatic situations. the performances of the cast are perfect, with characters having and defending different positions regarding this unpleasant theme. the dialogs and lines are very solid and intelligent. i noted in imdb plot outline that this movie is based on the real-life story of ramón sampedro. unfortunately, neither the movie nor the dvd gives this important information. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "mar adentro" ("sea inside")

alejandro amenabar, the young and talented spanish director, clearly shows us he is a serious film maker. anyone doubting it, should have a look at his latest film "the sea inside". this is a movie that has been rewarded with numerous accolades, not only in spain, but throughout the world, wherever this wonderful movie has been shown.if you have not seen the film, perhaps you would like to stop here.ramon sampedro is a man confined to bed. being quadriplegic, he depends on the kindness of strangers for everything. since his accident, ramon only thinks in one thing alone: how to end his life! this is the moral issue at the center of the story, based on the real ramon sampedro's life.mr. amenabar tells the story from ramon's point of view. there is nothing here that is false or manipulative on his part. after all, he relies on facts that were well known in his country as this case became a "cause celebre" in favor of euthanasia, a theme that no one in that country wanted to deal with in spain.with its background of being a predominantly roman catholic country, spain has evolved into one of the most democratic societies in europe, a distinction that is more notable because of its long years dominated by a dictator. yet, in spite of the advances in that society, the idea of taking one's own life, is something not clearly understood by the majority of its citizens, who still considered this subject as something that could not be done in their country.ramon sampedro was a man that loved life. he lived an intense life as a young man when he enlisted as a sailor to discover the world. having no money, this was the only way for him to see other lands, experience other cultures. ramon's love affair with the sea, is something that people in galicia learn to love from their childhood. imagine how that same friendly sea is the one that takes away ramon's life, as he knew it! in a second, ramon goes from a vibrant young man into a vegetable!ramon's family is shattered by the experience. suddenly they must leave everything aside to take care of him at home. his brother and sister-in-law, are stoic people that deal with the situation as a matter of fact. their lives become something of an afterthought, because ramon's life comes first. they tend to the sick man without protesting, or blaming ramon for the sacrifices they must make to keep him alive.that is why, in their minds, the sampedros can't comprehend ramon's wishes to end it all. haven't they given up having a normal life to take care of him? this moral issue weighs heavily on these uncomplicated and simple people because in their minds, they are doing what came naturally.the second subject of the movie is the legal issue of the euthanasia and the well meaning people that suddenly enter ramon's life in their desire to help him put an end to his suffering. there's julia, the lawyer who is herself handicapped and suffers from a rare malady. there is rosa, the fish cannery worker who becomes infatuated with ramon. javier bardem, makes a brilliant ramon sampedro. his transformation is total. we don't doubt from one moment he is no one else but the paralyzed man on that bed. mr. bardem can only use his face in order to convey all the emotions trapped inside ramon. mr. bardem makes this man real. this is perhaps javier bardem's best role of his career. he surpasses his own award winning performance as reynaldo arenas, the late cuban poet he portrayed in "before night falls". in the supporting roles, belen rueda, makes an impressive appearance as julia, the woman fighting her own physical problems. lola duenas is also effective as rosa, the kindred soul that loves ramon deeply. celso bugallo, as ramon's brother shows a man at a crossroads of his own life. mabel rivera makes a compassionate manuela, the sister-in-law that never asks anything of life, but tends to ramon without questioning why she has to do it, at all.mr. amenabar also has composed the haunting music score for the film. he is a man that never cease to surprise. one wonders what his next project will be, but one wishes him success in whatever he might decide to do in the future.

i had the privilege to watch mar adentro last friday, and i am still shocked by its beauty, the powerful work of every single actor and actress and amenabar's unbelievable ability to narrate the story of ramón sampedro, who was well known in spain for asking for a legal euthanasia, lost the court cause, and eventually died in front of a camera drinking a glass with poison, freezing all our hearts with his determination not to go on living forever immobilized because of an accident. before watching the movie i was already mesmerized by the strong symbology in its title, which i would translate as "into the sea" and not as some suggest "out to sea", and which is taken from an original poem written by the man this story is about. then i watched the movie. oh my friends. this is cinema with a capital c. the narration flows to take you to the heart of every single character: sampedro, reincarnated in a bardem that you forget from the very beginning, is in the center as a man full of sense of humour and full of hope, and his hope is to die, because for him, the life he is living is not worthy to be lived. the rest of the characters but one dance around him and respect his decision because they see him as a human independent being (forgetting he depends on the others for everything), even though they do love him so much. and this is what the movie is about: love. you can feel it, you can breathe it in the skin of every character. you witness the growing of the feeling within three women who meet him in the movie: gené, the member of the association that defend his right to die with dignity, his friend, her story in the movie is the hope for us the lucky ones that can live a normal life in this world; rosa, the woman who meets a good man in the middle of her list of broken relationships and pain in the hands of all the men who used her and despised her; julia, the woman who shares a tragic destiny with ramón, and eventually acts in a way we cannot but only understand.however, before meeting these women ramón knew what was love like, because you cannot meet him without loving him, and he is deeply loved by his abnegated family: four characters unique in their humbleness and bravery, each with their own thoughts about his decision, each thought respectable in its own way, because the terrible thing about this story is that nobody is to blame for what happened. that, sadly, life sometimes is that terrible. from this familiar quartet i specially liked mabel rivera's work as ramón's sister in law, manuela: a terrific performance.i would like to draw attention to three episodes that are for me the best climax points i have seen in a long time, and if you haven't seen the movie don't read this, pass over this paragraph and read again from the next one starting "mar adentro", let the movie show its secrets to you. the episodes i loved were: 3. the best love scene i have seen in a movie, when i really felt love invading the screen, is when ramón dreams awake that he is flying to meet julia in the beach and they kiss each other. 2. gené speaking by phone with ramón, the day before he is going to do it, and he tells her it is better they say goodbye at that very moment, not to put her in trouble with the authorities. and then she knows it is the last time they are going to talk, and she has fought for his right to die... but she does not want to lose him, because she loves him as a true friend, and even though she is respecting his decision at all cost. 1. the best. a young ramón in the beach, looking at his girlfriend under the sun, jumping to the water from the rocks to a sea that is retreating. we see the crash, we hear his voice recalling what happened and claiming he should have died that very moment. the face of bardem, face downward, shown to us from the bottom. and the hand of a friend who pulls him from the forehead and brings him back to a life that will be a hell for him in the next 30 years. there are many others, like the impressive ending, in spite of the fact that in spain we know too well what ramon did.mar adentro did not deceive me, amenabar never does, but this time he has to thank the actors that took part in the project, and who maybe took it personally, because this is not just a movie, it is an elegy to a man who died alone when he was asking to die "legally", which meant for him, as bardem pointed out, dying with the people he loved and who loved him around.

this story about a man's 28 year struggle for a death that would liberate him from his already dead body becomes a masterpiece to be remembered,thanks to a team of artists in a state of grace. directed, written,edited and scored by alejandro amenabar, it touches you from the very first images, and doesn't leave your eyes and your heart to rest until the last credits, thanks to alejandro and a group of wonderful actors and actresses at their best. bardem is an acting animal:one of those few comedians that can make a masterpiece from almost any character, the supporting actresses are great in their roles and the story is told with such a sensibility that one laughs and cries in the same minute, as we used to do with the great old masterpieces. the year's best film in all senses. 10 / 10

this small, quiet, harmonious movie grows into a masterpiece on human dignity. it is intelligently structured, filled with meaningful little details and important side-plots. it tells a story of one man with great humanity without positioning itself politically, but fostering life as a precious right (not an obligation) and underlining individual's right to choose. it enjoys the richness of different landscapes (mental and physical) and languages (important detail). outstanding acting by each of the actors, especially unbelievable javier bardem. his screen-presence has such a force that you forget that this is fiction. the movie has a wonderful rhythm, it is beautifully shot and outstandingly directed. it takes real talent to make a movie on such a difficult theme with understanding, humour and heart. six stars out of five.

director and co-writer alejandro amenabar didn't make things easy for viewers of his taut, a bit overlong but very disturbing story, accurately based on a spanish man's struggle to obtain assisted suicide. "mar adentro" ("the sea inside") is gripping and its impact far exceeds the time spent in the theater.with the award-winning canadian movie, "the barbarian invasions," folks got to see a family along with a coterie of devoted friends address the wish of a beloved albeit irascible man to end his life. in that movie, the center of attention suffered from progressive, incurable cancer and his descent into a terminal stage was fast. emotional as the scenes were, death was inevitable - the question was how gentle could it be made through solicited intervention.ramon sampedro (brilliantly played by javier bardem) is a different story. for well over two decades he's been a quadriplegic because of a diving accident. (very sharp viewers may detect a terrible irony as to why he ended in that condition because of his improvident dive.) once a world traveler and lover of beautiful women, he now lies trapped in an immobile body, his every need attended to by a truly devoted family who willingly surrender much of their privacy and time to sustain their beloved relation.rosa (lola duenas), a single mom of two small boys, enters the sampedro household out of what might have been mere curiosity to learn about the paralyzed man's plight but she becomes both an emotionally supportive centerpiece for ramon as well as an amusing but occasionally aggravating presence. a nice performance by duenas.the problem, of course, is that sampedro isn't sick in the normal sense. he may well live for decades more with proper care. so his softly but persistently voiced desire to end his life with "dignity" creates a moral dilemma for friends and relatives who, not surprisingly, react from different ethical and religious perspectives.ramon is the poster quad of a group dedicated to changing spain's laws concerning assisted suicide. "death with dignity" is their watchword. gene (clara segura) is a sensitive activist who enlists the aid of pro bono publico counsel, julia (belen rueda). julia has her own health issues which carry an indefinite but catastrophic prognosis. happily married to a devoted spouse, she bonds emotionally with her client.what follows is an acutely sensitive interplay of values and emotions. ramon lives with his brother and wife, their technophile teenage son, not the intellectual ramon is, and his aged dad who can't stop grieving over his son's cataclysmic descent into absolute helplessness.the moral and legal issues are played out through excellent acting and short vignettes including a courtroom scene in which formalism triumphs over any judicial interpretation that might take into account ramon's feelings and views. it may be spain but the issues are alive in most countries, including the u.s.especially amusing is a shouted, first floor to bedroom, debate between ramon with a drop-in, lecturing jesuit priest, also a quadriplegic but one whose hidebound dogma casually masks the absence of a soul.special kudos to mabel rivera, ramon's sister-in-law-manuela, for a wrenchingly authentic portrayal of a strong woman who holds the family together. and the same compliment fulsomely extends to belen rueda, julia, who segues from objective advocate to close friend to a woman hurtling towards a dark fate.the director imposes no value judgments allowing each character full range to express his or her feelings effectively and, at times, movingly. like "dead man walking," this movie can support any view about its deadly subject.no one can stop a person from committing suicide if he/she is determined but the universal tragedy of the world's ramons is that without assistance, life in a body in which only the heart beats and only the head can move is a sentence no court could pronounce on the most depraved of criminals.the cinematography is well-matched to the story and the beautiful galician scenes are an intended contrast to the limited views the once globe-trotting ramon experiences from his special bed.9/10

greetings again from the darkness. director alejandro amenabar creates life against all odds in this based on a true story version of one man's struggle to control his destiny. the great javier bardem is fascinating to watch in his role as ramon. his eyes and head movements leave little doubt what is going on in his mind. the dream and fantasy sequences are not overused so prove very effective in explaining why he wants what he wants. rather than force us to answer the euthanasia question, the real question posed is , what is love? at every turn we see people in love, looking for love or dying to be loved. the script is tight and keeps the film moving despite being filmed mostly in one room. the supporting cast is wonderful and we truly feel their pain and how each family member deals with ramon's decision. this is a gem and deserves to be seen.

many more eloquent reviews than this have described the quite spectacular acting, casting and styling of this film. it appears that the only negative reviews focus on a perceived imbalance in the film's handling of the core moral question (euthanasia).this film is, bar the final scenes, meticulous in stressing ramon's belief that he's not making some grand point but merely that, for him, a life devoid of dignity is a life not worth living. we, as viewers, see an enormous amount of dignity in his life - we see family and friends and culture and, but for its physical limitations, a life fully lived. central to the tragedy of this film is that there is really only one person who thinks that ramon's life is not worth living - and that is him.to watch this film and say that the only counter argument comes from the visit of a bumbling priest is a nonsense. the priest's visit is pure farce, a direct assault on the simplicity of the spanish catholic church's response to the issue of euthanasia. however, the sister's parting words to the priest momentarily expose the powerful 'pro-life' sentiments quietly underpinning the entire film. we are constantly encouraged to see the hope and the beauty of a life lived with love. as the film progresses, we may gradually be encouraged to understand ramon's reasoning but we are never reconciled to his decision. i do not remember a film which moved me and provoked me as much as this.

if you go to the cinema to be entertained, amused, so as to fill up your time, do not go out of your way to watch this film.if you go to the cinema to appreciate the depths of human-kind, the feelings of real people, to explore the characteriology of personalities, if you go to the cinema to absorb magnificent photography, be sure to put this film very high on your list, preferably in first place. the experience is profoundly rewarding, causing the intelligent viewer to make diverse reflexions over the meaning of life itself. with 'mar adentro' alejandro amenábar has surpassed the best he has done to date, and even redeemed certain deviations in his earlier films which smacked a little of being aimed at hollywood. this is not the case with this visual poem put to music: hollywood could never get anywhere near the effect of this tinglingly inspired human - and humane - story.in no way should one interpret 'mar adentro' as an apologia for euthanasia; this story, based on the real life of the galician fisherman ramón sampedro, is a cry from the bottom of the heart for life and love, a reaching out for human compassion, for understanding emotions. sampedro was an articulate and intelligent man who after a diving accident off the rocks of the galician coast as a young man was condemned to live the next 27 years in bed. 'condenado a vivir' (2001) (tv) was the first version of this man's life on which i have already commented. however, amenábar has succeeded remarkably at portraying this man, with his permanent enigmatic smile and witty sense of humour, in an equally articulate and intelligent way.and javier bardem rose to the occasion, met the challenge head-on, complete with a galician accent, producing an electrifying, compelling, enthralling performance, such that the actor and the fisherman become fused into being the same person on screen. here, indeed, is an occasion to doff your cap, and softly mutter 'chapeau'. bardem is driven on in his task by a magnificent cast, especially belén rueda, lola dueñas, mabel rivera, celso bugallo (los lunes al sol) (qv) and clara segura, galician and catalan accents taking prominent part. amenábar produces wonderful dialogues as these six rotate among themselves one-on-one, or in groups, with excellent chemistry, thus demonstrating that this young chilean-born spanish director is an artist who knows what he is at and how to get his results; his global concept of the film includes his own music, interspersed with pieces by beethoven and puccini on sampedro's record-player.whilst viewing 'mar adentro', i found myself a couple of times comparing him and this film with stephen daldry and his masterpiece 'the hours' (qv). i refer to the way in which the dialogues work with tenseness and passion and that careful sense of timing in each scene.javier aguirresarobe's photography is superb as usual. as i have mentioned elsewhere on imdb, he does not simply film the events and scenes - he captures even the feelings and the atmosphere of the moment, deftly catches that look in the eyes, light and shadows, such that his work behind the camera is at once another player in the story. a superb artist.'mar adentro' is another landmark in the history of spanish cinematography, among the best five or six works of art produced here in the last 25 years. this film places itself alongside such cinematographic art as 'el sur' (qv), 'los santos inocentes' (qv), 'el abuelo' (qv), 'la lengua de las mariposas' (qv), 'las ratas' (qv), 'a los que aman' (qv), and i think i must add 'te doy mis ojos' (qv).superbly orchestrated story of a real man, and those who loved him around his bedside: not to be missed.

one of the more lucid statements against the death penalty ever filmed, quite a frontal attack against the most disgusting way of doing justice. the final sequence, with that parallel between the crimes that the convicted poncelet committed and his own execution are just superb.no, what about the work of sean penn and susan sarandon? it leaves you breathless, they're two giants and their performances achieve the highest levels of emotion.tim robbins put clear that he's not only a good actor, he's a nice director as well.*my rate: 9/10

i have just seen this broadcast on channel 4. having seen some of the earlier comments here i think i would like to state firstly that i am not in favour of the death penalty. with that out of the way, i was expecting great things of this film, but it just didn't quite deliver. dead man walking is very cleanly done, with good performances all round, and a good script. in fact it's hard to fault it artistically. however, i felt that although it attempted to confront the issues surrounding capital punishment, it seemed to become sidetracked by the religious/moral stance (hardly surprising given that the main character is a nun). although i'm not a heartless individual, i didn't really empathise with any of the characters in the story. if you don't take religion seriously then you probably won't see much in this film. i think that peter medak's let him have it was a much more powerful and moving film, and i would strongly recommend anyone considering watching this to go and see that.

this movie has two new features in relation to the message conveyed by other equally good movies about death penalty and executions. those are the stress also given to the drama endured by victims' parents -- without for that reason disguising the hatred and desire of revenge they feel or lessening the horror that execution represents -- and the christian vision of all the questions implied. we must also point out that in this movie the sentenced man is not the usual nice innocent person we see in other movies dealing with executions which doesn't lead us to abandon the idea that a penal execution is no more than a legal murder anyway. last but not least we must mention the extraordinary emotional weight put on the last moments of the execution course with all the catharsis shown by the convicted's last words and the detail with which the act of the execution itself is viewed in a parallel cut with images of the murder scenes in the forest to stress that we are being confronted with another murder so pitiless as the latter but performed in a cold and supposed "legal" way.

i saw this movie many years ago and it has never left my list of all-time best films ever made. when i first watched it, i was just beginning what has become a life-long passion for justice. it gave an interesting perspective of the death penalty and also gave me a few things to think about.when you have a cast like this one, you are right to assume it is going to be nothing short of fabulous. this is, by far, the best role i have ever seen sean penn play (along with i am sam). he nails the role, doesn't glamourize his actions while doing so. he manages to maintain a level of debauchery throughout the movie that i think was very important. up until the very end, he does not try to be seen as anything more than what he is. he is a sick man who regrets his past, but still makes excuses for it. he ends up able to redeem his sense of self-worth as much as a convicted (and guilty) murderer can through the aid of susan sarandon's character, sister helen prejean. her character taught me about good will towards others without making me forget how horrible a person's actions can be and without making excuses for them.the supporting cast was also top-notch. i was surprised to see a small cameo of jack black in this film given the funny-man he has become today! i loved this movie for both personal reasons and just because it was a work of cinematic art. and, in my opinion, this is one of the rare exceptions when the movie far out-did the book.

the greatest effort plus the finest cast ever assembled in a movie by the director tim robbins and susan sarandon and sean penn on the front row. someone said that this movie is good because directed and written by tim robbins but i convince you that sean penn and susan sarandon had give me a truly superb performance that i cried my heart out. their acting is so real! no doubt about it that this movie is rated 4 and 3/4 out of 5!

i read the book before seeing the movie, and the film is one of the best adaptations out there. very true and faithful to the book. sean penn and sarandon are amazing. robbins is a talented filmaker and i wish he would add more to his repetoire. he made the film very haunting and intentionally slow-paced to add depth. an especially brilliant bit of filmaking was the reflection of the victims appearing in the glass of the execution room at the very end.

i really enjoyed this movie. it challenged my emotions and beliefs, making it a true piece of artwork in my book. the acting was unsurpassed. i would never watch this movie with anyone i could not cry around, i don't think i cry harder to any movies, maybe because it makes me look at myself, i dunno. it is a must see.

one of the best ever. direction, fotography, a thrilling and dramatic history, wonderful soundtrack and, most of all, the incredible credibility of susan sarandon and sean penn, the best and most underestimated "under-40 generation" actor. after seeing this movie i guess if there's anyone who couldn't have any doubt about giving death to another man, in spite of the ugly things he could have done?

i must have seen this movie about four or five times already, and it gets better with each viewing. suffice it to say: this is the best film i've ever seen. and i think i've seen a lot.but i've always wondered why this film got so shunned in some reviews or ratings. for example, take the imdb top 250. why does it rank only at #216 (as of today)? surely, the answer's not in the film itself (because that is nothing but flawless), but in its reception. the film caused controversy in its portrayal of compassion for a convicted murderer and its anti-death penalty attitude. and so, obviously, the more conservative-minded user probably didn't like the film (as you can see from some of the other comments). so dead man walking gets a ranking that's nothing but ridiculous in relation to its quality. those people didn't understand what the film wanted to say, and maybe they didn't want to understand, being pro death penalty. so now i get it: it's all political. you're pro death penalty- you don't like (and therefore don't want to hear) what the film has to say.i'm truly sorry there are still so many people out there who simply tune out when a new perspective questions their beliefs.mr. robbins, your movie's issue split people's opinions. some reconsidered their point-of-view, some simply didn't listen, but you made a very important point. your movie will probably never show up on any "top 100 movies of all time"-list, but it'll be remembered, long after films like braveheart or babe or apollo 13 (all of which were unjustly preferred over your film at the oscars 1996) are forgotten. congratulations, mr. robbins, and thank you for this important piece of filmmaking.

how do you know if a movie is good or not? it is the impact it has on you that makes the difference. "dead man walking" upset me a great deal. i watched it twice. i don't know if i will be strong enough to watch it again. no, i did not feel good at all after watching it, but the film was as successful as it can be.robbins did a great job in incorporating all aspects of this controversial topic. he avoided making an argument that could easily be seen as biased or subjective. i hope that many people get to see "dead man walking". i believe that anyone who supports or opposes the death penalty so enthusiastically should see the movie.i don't know what else it could take to finally convince everyone that this relic from ancient times does not have a place in modern society anymore.the movie itself does not make an argument for or against death penalty. it describes reality. the reality is the best argument against the death penalty.a 10/10 for great performances, good filmmaking, and for the most important film made in yearsthank you, tim robbins!

it was very sensitive very deep. it's my favorite all the time you can't see movie more deeper than this incredible movie. susan sarandon made her role as matured mind actress, and she realized her role. she deserved the award. she convinced me with for being a nun. the music was very impressive and sensitive. really i liked this deep masterpiece.

"dead man walking" is one of the most powerful movies i have ever seen. i find it hard to believe that anyone, after having seen the movie, could feel indifferent about the film or its message. tim robbins does not try to impose his ideas and beliefs on the viewers, but manages to make a film that are in most ways sympathetic to both views on the death penalty -- whether it is right to murder a murderer or not. i have always known where i stand in this question, even as a child, and this movie -- despite the fact that it does not really take any sides -- made me even surer in my conviction that it can never be right to murder *anyone*.sean penn is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of matthew poncelet, his nomination for an academy award was very well-deserved. even if nicolas cage does a great job in "leaving las vegas", i would have been happier if penn had won the award. susan sarandon is also brilliant and she deserved the academy award she won. and tim robbins certainly deserves the vote i have given this film: 9/10!

"dead man walking" is a piece of incredible filmmaking. all the acting is top-notch and realistic, and the script examines the issue of the death penalty from both sides, paying equal homage to both. above all, this is a deeply moving story of redemption, of death with dignity and loss of ego. any film that deals this courageously and maturely with such incredibly difficult subject matter deserves a rating of 10/10. thank you, tim robbins!

in a world in which debatable and misunderstood subjects can be listed endlessly, this powerful 1995 film takes on one at the top of that list; moreover, it does it objectively and realistically, and with a sensibility and sensitivity that makes it a truly great film by anyone's measuring stick. and to add some irony to it all, even the subject matter of this film has been widely misunderstood, as it is wrongly perceived that this is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty; it is not. at the heart of `dead man walking,' directed by tim robbins, is a subject that in reality is possibly the most misunderstood of all, and with good reason, because it just may be the hardest thing there is for a human being to really-- and truly-- understand. and it is what this film is actually all about: forgiveness. real forgiveness; not excusing a heinous crime or the perpetrator thereof-- not saying that what's happened is okay-- but finding the strength to go on, and to do so by choosing life.	director/screenwriter tim robbins has crafted and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by sister helen prejean, in which she discusses her involvement with the death-row inmates to whom over the years she has ministered her faith in god. as chronicled in the film, what for her was to become a lifelong pursuit of not only justice, but human dignity, began with a simple letter from a death-row inmate at the louisiana state prison at angola. sentenced to death for rape and murder, matthew poncelet (sean penn) was reaching out to anyone who would listen, when his letter ended up in the hands of sister prejean (susan sarandon), who soon found herself venturing into a territory of which she had absolutely no knowledge or experience. and robbins has successfully captured sister prejean's emotional and turbulent journey succinctly, while managing to keep it devoid of any maudlin sentimentality, which makes it not only real, credible and believable, but makes it a poignant and thoroughly emotionally involving experience for the audience. through the medium of the cinema, what was once a personal, significant emotional experience for sister prejean, becomes one for everyone who sees this film, as well.	for her soul-stirring, impassioned portrayal of sister prejean, susan sarandon deservedly won the oscar for best actress. sensitive and fraught with emotional depth, her performance is incredibly touching and real, especially in the way in which she conveys sister prejean's underlying natural fragility and vulnerability, which she adamantly tempered with the toughness she needed to carry on with her endeavors on behalf of poncelet (and in reality, a total of five since she began). whatever your point of view regarding the matters examined in this film, sister prejean is without question an individual of heroic proportions, which sarandon exquisitely personifies here; and she does it without resorting to any superfluous melodramatics, but rather by keeping it real, by subtly and humbly exploring the humanity of the person in a very believable expression of characterization. it's an extraordinary performance, arguably the best of sarandon's brilliant career. 	turning in a career-best performance, as well, is sean penn, who was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of poncelet (he lost out to nicolas cage, who won for his performance in `leaving las vegas). perfect for the part in every way, penn has quite simply never been better, before or since. he effectively presents poncelet as a real person, rather than as an overblown caricature of a monster capable of perpetrating the crimes depicted here. not that it makes poncelet any less despicable; just the opposite, in fact. it makes it genuinely disconcerting to be faced with the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live next door to you could be capable of such things. and that's the strength of penn's performance-- it's so disturbingly real, presented with depth and nuance; you have but to look into his eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul. a terrific performance, and -- as good as cage was in `vegas'-- penn should have received the oscar for it.	in another stand-out performance, raymond j. barry is memorable in a supporting role as earl delacroix, father of one of poncelet's victims. with limited screen time, he nevertheless develops his character in such a way that enables you to empathize with him, as well as with sister prejean, as it is through him that we are given some insight into just how complex and seemingly tenuous her position is, at least on the surface. barry presents delacroix in such a way that gives the necessary balance and perspective to the story, which is ultimately extremely effective and helps to underscore the message of the film.	the supporting cast includes r. lee emery (clyde percy), celia weston (mary beth percy), lois smith (helen's mother), scott wilson (chaplin farley), roberta maxwell (lucille poncelet), margo martindale (sister colleen) and jack black (craig poncelet). it is doubtful that this film will change anyone's mind one way or another about the death penalty, but that was never the intention; what was intended, was to make a thought-provoking, emotionally involving film, which is exactly what robbins has accomplished with `dead man walking.' regardless of your personal point of view, this film will have an impact, and hopefully will open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness. for, as we see through the character of earl delacroix, true forgiveness is not something one merely decides to do, but is a task that can become a lifetime's work. and it's possibly one of the hardest things in life to effectively accomplish; and you come away from this film with an appreciation for individuals like sister prejean, who has selflessly dedicated her life to helping those in need, and to filmmakers like robbins and sarandon for bringing her to life for millions of people who otherwise would never have known her. i rate this one 10/10. 

'it's easy to kill a monster, but it's hard to kill a human being.'set in st. thomas housing project and angola prison in new orleans, "dead man walking" is the true story of helen prejean (susan sarandon), a louisiana nun sister who befriended matthew poncelet (sean penn), a murderer and a rapist bound for a lethal injection machine for killing a teenage couple sister helen agrees to help the convict and to remain with him till the endan act never before attempted by a woman at their first meeting, poncelet swears to the nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both of the kids and pleads her help for a new trial in order to convince the pardon board hearing to spare his life the film challenges the audience to actually give some thought to the human consequences of the death penalty, but gives voice to angry bereaved parents whose kids were shot, stabbed, raped, and left in the woods to die alone as poncelet's execution looms closer and closer, his character is seen deceptively complex, harboring doubts about the rightness of what they were doing to him in one moment, we hear him sensitive asking for a lie detector test to let his mother know that he is innocent, in another we see him furious playing the victim, blaming the government, drugs, blacks, the kids for being there poncelet never understood that he has robbed the percys and the delacroixs so much, giving them nothing but sorrow they are never going to see their children again, never going to hold them, to love them, to laugh with them in the scenes leading up to his execution, the death-row inmate drops his terrible facade and reveals his identity luckily both sarandon and penn are here exceptionalcarrying out successfully an exquisite, tangible harmony of souls when sarandon was looking at penn, she was projecting compassionate eyes brimming with tears she asks him to visualize her as he dies ''i want the last thing you see in this world to be the face of love''in that moment, we truly believed that she'll be the face of love for him

tim robbins did a masterful job directing this film. i say this because he avoided convention and cliché. he also oversaw superb performances from susan sarandon (who won an oscar for her role) and sean penn. even more amazing, robbins doesn't patronize. he just tells the story and lets the events play on the viewer's mind. this is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinions on the death penalty, one of the most controversial subjects of our time, without being unfairly manipulated in either direction. i can't recommend this film enough, 9/10.

i'm astonished how a filmmaker notorious for his political left-wing fervor could make such a subtle, non-sanctimonious picture. if you're for capital punishment, you'll still be for it after seeing this. if you're against capital punishment, you'll still be against it. but whatever your stance is, this movie will, at the very least, make you reflect on why you feel the way you do. there's not one false note in the film.

first off, let it be known that i came into this movie not for the music; actually i find it repugnant. really, i was interested in the psychology of the punk subculture. on this point, the documentary did fairly well. one disagreeable aspect was the numerous scenes in which songs are played and the hyped-up band and belligerent crowd are shown running amok. if you've seen the first such scene, you've seen them all. this superfluity is party made up for by printing lyrics for some of the songs. with these, the audience is able to somewhat connect mentally with the band. the lyrics are of far more interest than the jumble of sounds projecting from the speakers. i don't know why all the lyrics were not printed. scenes without lyrics slow (ironic eh?, given the many references to the speed of the music) the flow of the movie. also insightful were the interviews with fans and bands, though there is a letdown when the latter band's interviews prove to be not nearly as enthralling or humorous as the first two. overall, a good movie that i'm glad i saw. i'll check out the follow-ups if i ever get a chance.favorite quote: he tried to hide the fact that he couldn't play by rubbing peanut butter over himself and breaking glass. broad punk generalization: though their disgracefulness, lack of vocabulary and hygiene, and drug-induced obliviousness is often hilarious, in the end it is understood that punks are just pathetic juveniles who rebel just for the sake of rebellion as seen through sophomoric lyrics and naive attempts to philosophize and politicize (disregarding black flag, who are slightly less misguided than their peers).

the one and the only!the only really good description of the punk movement in the la in the early 80's. also, the definitive documentary about legendary bands like the black flag and the x. mainstream americans' repugnant views about this film are absolutely hilarious! how can music be so diversive in a country of supposed liberty...even 20 years after...find out!

this is one of the best films made about the 80 punk scene. i saw this a few years back on a "bootleg" copy and was amazed. very few of todays kids know the true roots of punk and this movie shows some of the 80s punk legends such as the germs and shows how it was back then. nowadays so much punk has gone mainstream with mtv and radio and its nice to see the true underground rebellious movement of the original scene. darby crash (of the germs) is one of my heros and this film shows why. a must see for all "punks" and anyone curious about the 80s punk scene

i regard this loving, and sensitively written story, to be one of the screen's true masterpieces. after having seen this film, originally on the silver screen with my mother, in los angeles, california when it first came out, many years passed before i would have the opportunity to experience it again. the beauty, quiet simplistic elegance and tranquility of the film to me, set it aside from many, many others of its kind. yes, tears still come to my eyes when i see it, and hear the refrain of that once in a lifetime song. perhaps still, today my number one all-time most beloved film. i would hope, this classic love story will be enjoyed, and appreciated, by our future generations.

age cannot tarnish the beauty of this east-west love story for me. ignoring the famous and lovely title song and its lyrics, what we have is a dramatized biography of two remarkable people caught in a moment of counter-currents involving social conformity, bigotry, war, doubt, and the need for immense courage. with hong kong as the backdrop, this movie tells the story of a eurasian doctor and a u.s. journalist who meet and fall in love during the korean war. as mark elliott, william holden is intelligent, breezy and a bit weak; jennifer jones is perhaps well-nigh-perfect as dr. han suyin, by turns doubt-torn and ecstatic, eager and hesitant. others in the large cast include torin thatcher, isobel elsom, murray matheson, virginia gregg, richard loo, soo yong, philip ahn, jorja curtright and donna martell; many of hollywood's best oriental actors played smaller uncredited parts also. the script by john patrick followed han's exquisite novel closely; the direction by henry king was solid as always. the thrust of the storyline is how unwilling han was to fall in love with elliott, with her busy and demanding schedule as a doctor and her doubts about their future; and how unafraid he was, despite the intolerance and interference they faced as their affair became known. the film is unarguably physically busy, interesting and often beautiful also. the hill to which the lovers go to be apart, the lovely bay where they swim are set against an already busy and crowded business city, large social events, and teeming streets, hospital corridors, and traffic-filled arteries. with cinematography by leon shamroy, ben nye's makeup and helen turpin's hairstyles, the great work by set decorators, sound and lighting, art department and all concerned, this has to be one of the most memorable productions set in a major non-u.s. city of all time, and one of the most difficult to capture on film. yet what one remembers most here is the lovers, thankfully not extremely young, facing the odds against them and assessing exactly what they are--then going ahead as if love mattered and those conditions which are set up as barriers to love do not., the climax of the affair is mark's going back to war; thereafter han receives his letters, even after she knows he is has been killed; they seem messages from a better wold. a world where hope is all that matters, courage is the price of admittance to that world, and it is always summer on a high and windy hill set apart and above a zone where beauty and individual desires can be victimized, made subject to ill-fortune or brushed aside by militant forces of evil. truly, love is a many-splendored thing, dr. han says; and this movie stands as one of that doctrine's shining proofs, lucent as a pearl, timeless as a chinese proverb and lovely as polished jade set against a rough background.

"love is a many-splendored thing" is set in hong kong in 1949-50, and tells the story of the relationship between mark elliott, a white american journalist, and han suyin, a half-chinese half-european doctor. this story of a mixed-race love affair was quite a daring theme for the fifties, and, as it often did, hollywood tried to soften the blow by casting a white actress as the supposedly non-caucasian woman who falls in love with a white man, something that would be regarded as politically incorrect today but was quite acceptable then.. (think, for example, of the casting of ava gardner in "show boat" or natalie wood in "west side story") the setting of the story in a british colony was also perhaps a way of exploring racial issues in a way that would cause less controversy in america. suyin loses her job in a hong kong hospital because her british superiors take exception to the fact that she is dating a white man, whom she is unable to marry because his estranged wife will not grant him a divorce. as was sometimes the case, european colonialism was made the whipping-boy for some of america's own failings. imagine the furore that would have been unleashed had a similar film been made about a black or mixed-race woman doctor in a hospital in alabama.besides racial issues, the film also raises questions of international politics, referring to both the communist seizure of power in china and the outbreak of the korean war. han suyin was a real person and a well-known author of the period; in reality she tended to support mao's communist regime, but here she is shown as firmly anti-communist. this is not, however, primarily an "issue" movie about either racialism or politics, but rather a romance, a good example of what would have been known at the time as a "woman's picture". such films, although mostly made by male directors, were mostly aimed at female audiences. they dealt with love and romance- often unhappy romance- from the woman's point of view, and had a strong female character in the leading role. the genre often provided roles for actresses older than the heroines of standard romances. earlier examples were normally in monochrome, but by the fifties they generally, as here, used lush, sumptuous colour.although a chinese or eurasian actress would have been more convincing in the role, jennifer jones, does a very good job as suyin. i found william holden, as mark, rather uncharismatic, but this does not matter much as suyin is very much the dominant figure. she is screen much more than mark, and the film examines her family and professional life much more than it does his. although jennifer was still strikingly beautiful, she was in her mid-thirties, rather older than most romantic heroines of films of this period. holden was about the same age, unusually for the fifties when "boy-meets-girl" often meant "older man meets girl".the film is not particularly profound, but is well-made with some attractive photography, particularly of hong kong itself, reflecting the growing trend in the fifties for shooting on location rather than on studio sets. seldom can hong kong have looked so beautiful; the view from a hill overlooking the city takes on a special meaning, as this is where suyin and mark go for their romantic assignments. the overall mood is one of poignant, doomed romance, a mood heightened by the atmospheric photography and the musical score, including one of the most memorable movie themes ever written. 7/10

another brilliant portrayal by kiefer sutherland who plays mickey hayden, a cop dealing with psychic visions of murdered victims. i absolutely love movies dealing with the psychic realm, and i wasn't disappointed with "eye of the killer" (aka after alice). i only wish the movie had been released theatrical first.

alice is the kind of movie they made in the 30's and 40's. never attempts to be an "event". just wants to entertain. and it does. i was surprised by kiefer sutherland. in a role that could be a cliche, he made it real. the plot does make allusions to alice in wonderland. a guy dressed in white does go through a hole and kiefer does fall down one. like alice the plot does twist and turn, but with a freshness you don't see in small movies. i loved the direction, sutherland, just a very fast paced and interesting movie.

a tale of a young boy, dexter (joseph mazzello) with aids who befriends a rough and tumble boy (played by brad renfro) his exact opposite, the cure is sad, if a bit too soapy, pull at your emotions "message" movie with it's heart in the right place. for that fact alone, it's a recommended view. the highlight might be just watching them finding friendship and hanging out with each other when no one else accepts them. however since the real story centers on the boy's aids - things take off when one day at the local supermarket, dexter's eye catches a checkout tabloid magazine that states a new orleans doctor has discovered the cure. both of them, obviously a tad naive, make it a plan to set out for new orleans in whichever means possible. which kinda pulled me two ways. it's a mite heart warming and i hate to nit-pick, but i found the plot wanders in a melodramatic, predictable sense and the proceedings have a coat of gloss over them like only movies can do. i couldn't escape the tugging notion i was watching a road trip movie about self discovery, sickness and growing up. for instance, i know they're young, but i found it a real task to belief in the things these boys do. like boiling tree leaves and drinking the hot 'tea' or eating an experimental diet of chocolate bars because they believe it will combat the ravaging disease. to say nothing of them making a cross-country voyage as they do with no legal or downright scary repercussions. still misgivings aside, those movie conventions you come to expect, it's a story worth seeing particularly with family.

although flawed in it's view of homosexuals, this movie will shed light for the viewer about the myths and inaccuracies concerning aids. despite the depressing subject matter, this film depicts a warm friendship between two boys, and will make you laugh as well as cry. very well-acted by all, especially joseph mazzello and brad renfro. the language is a little strong, though appropriate, and it's an entertaining and intelligent film for the whole family. but remember to have the kleenex ready!

this early warner brothers talkie "son of the gods" (1930) deals with the racial intolerance that anglo-saxon americans show towards the chinese. chinese-americans are treated like second-class citizens, and whites hold them in nothing but contempt.prolific scenarist bradley king based her screenplay on rex beach's novel about a young, impressionable chinaman, sam lee (richard barthelmess of "only angels have wings"), who experiences racial prejudice first-hand when the girls that his college chums bring along for a party reveal their racist sentiments about sam once they learn about his heritage. sam goes to his father, lee ying (e. alyn warren of "gone with the wind"), who is a wealthy chinaman with offices not only in new york city but also in san francisco. sam feels deeply wounded by the racial slurs and he wants to leave new york and go where he cannot be hurt by americans. his patient father warns him that racism is a fact of everyday life and the only solution to racism is tolerance. sam has yet to learn this lesson. he refuses to take any more money from his father and catches a ship to london, england, peeling potatoes while he is on board.during the trip, he encounters a british playwright, bathurst (claude king of "arrowsmith"), who needs some help writing a play about the chinese. sam and he strike up a friendship and sam furnishes him with cultural information about asians. while they are relaxing in france, sam meets a beautiful young woman, allana wagner (constance bennett of "two-faced woman"), who falls madly in love with him. it seems that allana and her wealthy father are vacationing in the same motel. everybody at the motel knows about sam being a chinaman with the exception of allana. sensitive about his racial heritage, sam holds allana at arm's length until she convinces him that nothing could change her mind about him. they fall madly in love together. allana's father drops the bomb on her when he reveals that sam is a chinaman and all the memories of living in san francisco and dealing with coolies floods allana's mind. she storms into the dining room at the motel and publicly flogs sam with a riding crop in front of a room filled with on-lookers.of course, sam is terribly devastated by this reversal of events. he thought that allana loved him but she didn't. about this time, sam's father lee ying falls tragically ill and ying's secretary of sorts, eileen (mildred van dorn of "iron man") sends sam a telegram about ying's illness. predictably, sam rushes home to new york to be at his father's side. since his public humiliation, sam has vowed to show no kindness to anglo-saxon americans; eileen is an irish-catholic and probably one of his few white friends. lee ying dies and sam assumes control of the business and he practices his anti-white racism, until he learns that he was an anglo-saxon foundling that a san francisco cop on the beat gave to lee ying and his wife to bring up. the cop forgot about it until two white busy-bodied social worker types wanted to take sam away from the yings. sam learns this revelation about the same time that allana comes to new york and falls ill. during her illness, she utters his name repeatedly in her sleep and her devoted father goes to see sam and requests that sam visit her in order to help her recover. unbeknownst to allana, sam does visit her and she improves, but she has no memory of his visit, merely a hazy notion. eventually, allana learns the truth about sam not being a chinaman and they marry and live happily ever after.this socially conscientious warner brothers/first national pictures release contends frankly and unflinchingly with the race issue for the first hour or thereabouts before the revelation that sam has no chinese blood running in his veins catches both him as well as the audience by surprise. the reconciliation between allana and sam stretches credibility, despite their self-professed undying love for each other. however, in the name of a happy ending that would erase all the negativity that came before it, they wind up in each other's arms.the capitulation on the race issue with the revelation that sam isn't chinese damages some of the film's moral power. incredibly, "son of the gods" is a pre-code film that almost seems prudish; for example, sam is an american, not chinese! constance bennett gives a wonderful performance as a petulant beautify and she holds your attention when she whips sam with her riding crop. claude king is good as bathurst, and e. alyn warren is convincing as lee ying. interestingly, warren made a career out of portraying asian characters. richard barthelmess is flawless as sam; he delivers a highly nuanced performance. despite its age, "son of the gods" is a son of a good movie!

i loved this movie - the actors were wonderful and suited their roles. the story itself was great (and true, the setting was perfect and the message about human response to the war, danger and risk was exceptional. the person who wrote the music score also did the music for life is beautiful (another favourite of mine)- his comment was apparently that "...this was not a like an english movie, it was like an italian movie." i think he's right! callum blue is perfect for the part of eric newby. i recommend this movie to everyone who wants to watch a story that is true and morally uplifting as well as a beautiful love story.

i have just watched this movie for the first time today, and just loved it...yes it is simple in it's storyline, the sweetest love story,and how any female could not fall in love with callum blue beats me...the scenery in italy was as you would expect, beautiful, the baddies lost in the end,and for the two lovebirds to be reunited at the end, was wonderful, but that scene where a certain italian was sweeping away the confetti after eric and wanda's wedding, perfection!.have a cup of tea and watch a fantastic movie, yes, better have a tissue ready and be enthralled, i know i was and hope to get it on dvd real soon. all the actors played their parts perfectly, this was a ww2 film you could believe in as it was so realistic, and without going over the top as in other films...

"in love and war" is a simple feel-good tv-film, and should be viewed as such.(possible spoiler)it is the story of a wwii british soldier, newby, captured with his commando by the italians and imprisoned in a former orphanage. as the italians surrender to the allies, the commando is freed, and attempts to flee. however, the germans arrive and the commando is captured again. only newby, injured, remains at large. the rest of the film recounts how he is hidden and protected by the partisans, and his survival.(end of spoiler)based on a true story, "in love and war" is a refreshingly straightforward film. half comedy, half romance, the story is simple and unambiguous. the 'atmosfera' is warm and sunny, and the various stereotypes (the desperately unorganized or romantic italians, the serious stern-looking germans and the phlegmatic and pragmatic british), although unoriginal, are still humorous. nicola piovani's musical score also adds to the mediterranean flavour.although it is far from being a "tea with mussolini" or a "la vita e bella", "in love and war" is a sweet simple film that will put a smile, and maybe even a little tan, on your face.

this delightful, well written film is based on a new york stage play bearing the same title where sir aubrey (knighted sir charles aubrey smith in 1944) originated the role he plays in the film. here, in 1931, we see him in the early part of his acting renaissance in the very early era of "talkies" and in the character role that he would make his own until his death in 1948 after finishing his last performance in little women which released in 1949.this engaging play is about an elderly british aristocrat who locates his illegitimate children and introduces himself to them, having brought them to his manor in england.marion davies plays his daughter-by-error and it's a tour de force for her. she is all at once endearing, impatient, shallow, enchanting, wise and compassionate while creating an indelible and beguiling character that remains well ensconced in the memory.the 26 year old ray milland appears here in a small but prominent role having already appeared in seven other pictures then only in films for a bit more than two years.the film should be enjoyed as a representative of 1931 hollywood factory production of course and as such is not flawless. however, it's a charming pleasure from first scene to the last.

this is one of the better marion davies talkies - and one of the few to allow her to exhibit her skill as a physical comedian which was so endearing in her silent films. ok, so she does a clunky tap number, but even ruby keeler's dancing from the era does not hold up for younger generations. the problem here is the script. the story falls into unbelievable melodrama in the last reel. it's quite stagey, and is obviously adapted from a play... but not well enough. still, there is some snappy dialogue and slapstick throughout. worth a look.

toplines this ok comedy about an aging father (c. aubrey smith) who decides to gather his grown children from around the world. davies is working as a chorus girl in new york when she gets the news that "daddy" wants her. hmmmm, sounds familiar. davies' considerable talents as a comedienne save this otherwise so-so comedy as she upsets the staid british countryside with her brazen american personality. not as sharp as some other davies comedies, but still worth a look. ray milland plays her long-lost "brother." doris lloyd, elizabeth murray, and halliwell hobbes are all fun, too.

this 1931 comedy gets better with every viewing because of the comedic talents of marion davies and a terrific performance by c. aubrey smith. smith plays a gruff old man who gathers his grown children (from his younger days as a rake) in his declining years. one is american (davies), one english (ray milland who looks about 18), and one italian (nina quartero). there are some surprises as the plot moves along with ralph forbes(was has no appeal at all) falling for davies.davies and smith are just wonderful together and very touching. davies also gets to do a few dances and make a few "big" entrances. and of course davies is just gorgeous.halliwell hobbes, doris lloyd, elizabeth murray, guinn williams, edgar norton, and david torrence co-star. had they given out supporting oscar awards in 1931, smith might well have been nominated. he's just excellent in this this gem.

a grumpy old baronet, happily unmarried, decides to send for his three grown-up illegitimate children and provide them a home at his manor. to his surprise, he finds himself bonding with his uninhibited american daughter. can he find satisfaction in his new role as the bachelor father?this 1931 film, in which he gives a robust performance, marked the arrival at mgm of elderly sir c. aubrey smith, very soon to be one of hollywood's most valuable character actors. with his great hooked nose & beetling brows, sir aubrey looked every inch the part of the duke or general or statesman he would play so often. the acknowledged leader of the british community in hollywood, sir aubrey would also champion the game of criquet in southern california. he would remain very much in demand in studios all over town, right up to his death in 1948.the film's top-billed star is marion davies. best remembered today as the mistress of media mogul william randolph hearst & the chatelaine of hearst castle, the most fabulous residence on the west coast, she was actually a very talented & pretty comedienne. for a few years, hearst attempted to make her the queen of mgm (with her own production company & a huge bungalow-dressing room) but the studio already had several other queens - dressler, garbo, shearer, crawford - and he eventually moved her to warner bros. here miss davies gets a chance to joke & clown and her scenes with sir aubrey are entertaining.her love interest is played by ralph forbes, a handsome young british actor who was just starting to find good films (the trail of 98) as the silent days ended. he had all the qualities for major stardom, but sadly it was not to be. celebrity would come to ray milland, here making one of his first screen appearances. halliwell hobbes & doris lloyd also appear to advantage.

i think this show is awesome!!! i love it, and i love fabian (not in a romantic kind of way) but if i was there i would totally support fabian like haley did, and the other girls, yeah!! i mean if they're rood why don't you want to fight them back!! fabian is the only who have guts to confront people and say what he thinks, not just stay and suck it!!! fabian 100%!!!!! i love haley too, because shes like a normal girl who doesn't want to be with cows and bugs and grass everywhere, and sleep in a warm bed with servants, i mean, if you have the chance and the money why wouldn't you do that!!! and fabian too, fabian brought pizza and just like 2 or 3 people said thanks, i mean he spend money!!

this film for me and my wife is more entertaining than all the bloc-buster violent thriller/mystery/murder movies that abound. it is about real people making the best of their lives. they just happen to be indian and the main characters are in law enforcement. the realistic acting and the great scenery more than make up for the slightly implausible plot. the sound track is by bc smith, who also did the soundtrack for coyote waits, and is great. adam beach plays a tribal policeman who is a little bit accident prone and wes studi is the stoic consummately professional detective. there are many other fine either supporting or cameo roles by graham greene, tantoo cardinal, etc. we have also seen coyote waits, another adaptation of a hillerman novel, and we greatly enjoyed it too.

i hope robert redford continues to make more films like this. hillerman's books are wonderful, and as a young child raised in the southwest his stories hit home! adam beach is a highly under rated and under used actor. wake up hollywood, not everyone thinks that your mel gibson's are cool! many movie goer's today want to see films that make you think. i have seen all of the redford/hillerman series. they are thoughtful, scenic and have great plots. i'm hoping that if enough people write to robert redford he may decide to make a few more! thank you adam beach and tony hillerman for great entertainment! if anyone get's a chance to read tony hillerman's latest book do so! it's great. i also recommend traveling through arizona, new mexico, utah and colorado. stop at every view site and feel the setting of hillerman's books. amazing experience.

joe (wes) & jim (adam) re-acquaint us with the beauty, isolation (psychological as well as physical) and utter terror of "murder most fowl" in the navaho southwest. characterizations, settings and plot continually build .. . even if at times the personal asides leave us wanting "more" .. . with some interesting alternative choices as to "who done it?" flashbacks (e.g. peter fonda . .. good to see him) provide clues but they don't go where you might think. comic asides (e.g. the preacher) are mild and appropriate. where "skinwalkers" and "coyote waits" start to drag .. . "thief" engages the clutch and four-wheels you around the next corner, never quite sure what's there. disagree with joe leaphorn's manic comment to jim chee to "slow down" for the potholes. wrong ... there are no potholes in the plot, just tracks to follow. on to the next episode! great photography (as always), appealing characters and more to explore!

i caught this movie the other night on one of the movie channels and i haven't laughed that hard in a long time. this movie was so funny i went out and bought the very next day. i love this type of comedy. it just seemed so real in the way the actors react to the different situations here. i was rollin. i had never even heard of it and just started watching because of the title "seeing other people". the title caused me to give it a shot and i'm glad i did. i laughed so hard that it hurt. now it's part of my collection. i definitely recommend it to all those that enjoy smart-ass type of comedy. i will be watching this one over and over.

"seeing other people" is a daring romantic comedy about a couple named ed and alice (jay mohr and julianne nicholson) who are engaged and plan to be wed soon. they live together but are both having doubts about their relationship. alice realizes she's had so few sexual relationships in the past, she might just be marrying ed because she's never felt anything else. so they agree to begin fooling around with other people for a while to test their own relationship.the movie balances a prescient question - by focusing too much on the "what if?" aspects of life, can it in fact do the opposite and only make you feel more constrained? when ed begins having sex with a college girl he begins to become addicted and almost forget about alice - when he realizes this, it scares him.i hadn't heard anything about this film in advance but i enjoyed it. it's not extremely well-made and definitely has that purposefully low-budget indie feel to it - but it's a lot better than most romantic comedies out there in the mainstream today.check it out if you get a chance.

i loved this movie. it's a lot of laughs. the acting is good and the writing is really sharp. i'd rather see a hundred movies like this than three lord of the rings repeating and repeating themselves.it's a low budget affair and seems to be shot on dv but looks good and jay mohr and julianne nicholson are great together. why do you have a ten line minimum? i'm not a critic, just a patron.i doubt very much that quentin tarantino could write a picture this funny without filling it with masturbatory gratuitous violence. this movie should be seen on more screens than just one. i laughed from beginning to end. >

i was hugely impressed with this movie, if for nothing else than for the comedy. it might not be the edgiest, wittiest humor at all times, but i found it appropriate to every scene.the flow of the film is certainly a bit jumbled, almost confusing sometimes, but that is how the characters feel. sometimes, we're watching a bit of slapstick and other scenes revolve around a decisive discourse on relationships. this might be a bit frustrating to certain viewers, but it brought me closer to the characters' dilemmas of irregular chaos.the acting is great from everyone. i'm a huge andy richter fan, but i wasn't head over heels for his part like everyone else seems to be. he did very well, but julianne nicholson and lauren graham stole the show for me, both in their respective ways. jay mohr performs as expected, if you've seen him in other films. i've always liked him.overall, the movie is very funny and offers some nice foundations for a few types of relationships. when it comes to relationship questions and problems, some films try to surprise. there's nothing surprising about the conclusions offered here, but it's entertaining to watch them be revealed throughout the film.

i paid attention and enjoyed the very rich expressions capability of the main actress, julianne nicholson. i don't have words to describe how much have i been enchanted. all the actors and actresses played well. especially i noticed the solid good character who has been consistent in foreseeing the future - andy richter who played carl. i think that the idea to show a variety of friends and relatives with different opinions, and the several consulting meetings, is like the real world. jay mohr who played ed, the future husband, also played very real behavior. but, i want to emphasize again the point of very rich expressions repertoire which julianne nicholson is capable of and does so naturally, was overwhelming for me. indeed, the subject which this movie handles seems to me as very important and touches strongly meaningful thoughts of many people. i've seen this movie several times and have not been bored. it raises again and again in my thoughts.

i happened into the den this morning during the scene where ed was engaged in the 3-way and thought my wife was catching up on some early morning porn! much to my surprise it grabbed my attention and i rewound it and we started watching it at 4:30 in the morning! what a very entertaining, rich, funny and well developed plot line and script. we both thoroughly enjoyed it, my wife so much that she shared the experience with her girlfriends at work! going on to recommend it and say what a "kick" she got out of it. i am in my late 40's and she in her early 50's. i think this movie would have appeal to both young and old. an unexpected, very enjoyable surprise. nice work! thanks! two thumbs up!

plot: ed and alice are engaged. they live together and are living the dull life. he has slept around before meeting alice. she has a lot less experience. she decides she needs to sleep around before marrying. he very reluctantly agrees they should both see other people for a while. at first he is not really into it. his wild days are behind him and he is simply content. until one day alice comes back and tells him she made out with some random guy; who of course starts to fall for her. of course this is a bad idea which causes extreme strain on the relationship.good movie. you can see the train wreck coming but still good.worth a rental.

well, the movie did turn out a lot better than i expected. it's not boring and it's not unoriginal. it's really not a silly romantic comedy. the situations the characters put themselves in are very unusual, of course, we're still talking about a movie, but the main characters are indeed plausible. donald is, of course, an exaggeration, but he's just a pawn in the movie, a means to prove something. the ending isn't one of those ridiculously happy, always the same, moral containing pieces of crap you can usually see in movies of the genre. i genuinely liked it and i'm hard to please when it comes to this particular genre of movies. it's worth a watch. besides, it's better directed than other movies, the story line always stands up, the characters themselves stand up. and they do not experience this miraculous change and love is not revealed to them like a holly god given artifact, yada, yada. at the end of it all you actually see yourself going through it all, the movie makes you feel something, you may even learn a thing or two. it's not the usual hope-producing, tissue moistening idiocy. it's a good movie, not a consolation prize for teary women around the world.

[warning: contains spoilers]written by husband and wife wally wolodarsky (who also directed) and maya forbes, this indie film is one of the better romantic comedies in recent memory.jay mohr takes a break from playing smarmy weasels to be the nice guy faced with the fact his fiancée wants to bed other people and he's allowed to do so, too. julianne nicholson, who was so good in "tully," plays spunky and vulnerable with great gusto. too bad she doesn't get the recognition she deserves. good supporting performances help immensely, too. lauren graham, who made last year's "bad santa" memorable, plays the jaded, cynical sister to perfection, bryan cranston (the dad on tv's "malcolm in the middle") gets a few funny, raunchy moments, and andy richter plays a genial guy who falls for a single mother - helen slater in a credible, albeit familiar, role as a mousy woman.what surprised me most about "seeing other people" was how funny it is. there are some genuine laughs here. ed's first attempt at meaningless sex gets some great lines, and there's a ménage a trois that elicits one of the most truthful reactions from a man as the male fantasy gets tweaked.the film's premise isn't unusual, but i liked that it was alice (nicholson) who thought of it, much to the chagrin of ed (mohr). given the genre, you know that no matter how good her intentions are, alice's plan is doomed. we see how the couple works through this strange situation. initially, alice and ed are turned on by the idea, but then the human element sets it.i appreciated forbes and wolodarsky not turning this into a cheap sex romp. yes, there's sex and nudity, but there also are real emotions at work here. the "other people" alice and ed befriend don't want to be the objects of casual sex; they have feelings, too. in one case, too many feelings.granted, some scenes run one joke too many, the richter-slater subplot isn't necessary and alice does something truly uncharacteristic. but that's forgivable because mohr and nicholson generate such tremendous intimacy and honesty - check out the scenes where ed rummages through alice's underwear drawer or his reaction to her announcement about ending the experiment - that no matter how much we might enjoy their little game, we root for this couple to succeed.unfortunately, this film got little, if any, publicity and a limited release. hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies often veer on the unfunny, turgid and unsurprising, would do well to learn from this intelligent and funny film.

i liked this movie.no one i know likes it, but i do.i didn't like it as much as the first one but it was still good. the script and plot may not have changed at all, but the story was better than caddyshack 1.the only reason i didn't like caddyshack 2 is...no rodney dangerfield!i think the movie would be better if rodney dangerfield had jackie mason's part. although i did like jackie mason in the movie, it would be alot better if they kept rodney dangerfield.another flaw in the movie, that i didn't hate as much, was dan akroyd. the movie was done 8 years after the first one. bill murray, "carl", could've quit his job as an assistant greenskeeper and joined the military, you know? if warner bros. had thought of that, it could've made the movie better, also.this was my comment for caddyshack ii.i give it 8.2 out of 10it could've been better, but good nonetheless.if you've seen caddyshack 1 and are debating on whether or not to see caddyshack 2, i say give it a try.

the only conceivable flaw of this film is it's title!! please stop comparing it to the first! i did in my previous review only to separate it from the first. if you haven't seen the movie and are curious, totally forget about the first and invent a different name for this. there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own. this is a great exponent of screwy mid-80s comedy. i seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first. anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus. i maintain, the only reason this is in the imdb bottom 100 is because of its title. i usually hate movies like these (i.e. adam sandler, will farrell, farrelly bros....), but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically. i dunno, maybe it's like a bad relationship i can't get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure. either way, this is the single most underrated movie of the 80s behind 'the stunt man.'robert stack- we love you!!! (1919-2003)

amazing, one of my favorite movies way down at the bottom. guess i can take some pride in not liking what "the general populace" tends to go for. jackie mason is hilarious in this movie, and so's randy quaid. i can never get enough of his "strong-arm" tactics, just like in moving. he was also notable in national lampoon's christmas vacation. love that guy.

i am in a vast minority here. i also didn't much care for the original caddyshack, aside from the chase/murray duo scene and select rodney jokes. okay, break it down: rodney vs. jackie- both jewish and have similar humor. rodney's a bigger name and more distinct. jackie has an incidental and more observational approach to his jokes and is more 'up yours' in this sequel. jackie's attitude toward everything is memorable and in a way, inspirational! his quick lines and over-confidence left me wishing i could express myself in such a way. rodney was good, but there wasn't enough of him, and he was more 'in your face' and dismissive. jackie, in a rare film appearance, makes a perfect sub for rodney (come on, a gun shaped hair dryer?!?!) really, look at the little things!stack vs. knight- both play snobby yuppies very well. ted knight, despite his wonderful tv/film career, kinda shows his age. but, he does pull off the snobbish demands of the part and we want to see him fall. ted looks kinda weak and is pretty annoying, playing his anger and frustration too slapstick, while stack is more incidentally snide and vengeful; you really hate him and enjoy see him constantly fail. stack wins with me.murray vs. aykroyd- well, both had great, vintage snl-like scenes with the ever-present and enjoyable chevy chase (ty webb). i did like the murray/chase one better. murray plays his great, annoying, chatty character with obvious improv skill and is loveable- yet annoying. and the exact same can be said for aykroyd. both get annoying after a while, but it's a tie.i really loved part 2 over the first. they are 2 totally different mooded films. part one is more drug/bathroom/sex humor with a cast full of great names. part 2 uses golf as a backdrop for a 'stick-it-to-the-rich' type of comedy that makes one feel better about being working class. 80s script? yes. a bit far-fetched? yes, but wasn't the first? an insult to the sport of golf? yes, it's a movie. thin story? yes, it's a comedy with actual humor- not 'dances with wolves'!! besides- part 2 has a much better soundtrack!! please- don't expect this to be a sequel to part one!! it is 98% its own movie and shouldn't even have the name 'caddyshack' in it. that said, i am a big fan of caddyshack 2 and it is a great exponent of 80s fluff entertainment with quality humor. viva jackie mason!!! to all the reducers- lighten up! it's a great comedy of its own. randy quaid was wonderful, jonathan silverman was wonderful, heck, everyone was!! all this chatting and now i feel like watching it! i think i will

i have no idea why everyone hates this movie to call it garbage a travesty an unexceptable sequel is just unfair i mean what else could they have made for a sequel then. cause seriously i think it should have had a sequel (rodney dangerfield) says: hey everyone were all going to get laid and then a little dancing goffer and thats it thats the end of caddyshack even though the film rating on first one was (r) and the second one was (pg) it was still lots of fun .(7/10)

like richard pryor, mason never got the material he deserved. whatever you know of him is probably wrong. get past the accent and go see his stand-up. you'll be very surprised -- he's one of the best stand-ups i've ever seen and i have seen a lot of stand-up comedy (from lenny bruce to eddie murphy to jerry seinfeld to chris rock -- jackie mason is definitely up there). he's known for being a comic's comic. even howard stern said he is one of the top 3 funniest comedians ever.the accussation that mason is no dangerfield is ridiculous. dangerfield is known for having been a huge mason fan. dangerfield's career was going nowhere for a long time until he started following mason's shows. that is when mason provided dangerfield with inspiration for his, "get no respect" routine. while i think dangerfield is great, see them both do stand-up and you'll see mason is the better comedian.

one of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is highly touted as an `in-name only' sequel. there's nothing wrong with that except this: the return of chevy chase as ty webb. this connects the viewer to this character (from the original caddyshack in 1980,) and makes fans thinking or wanting caddyshack ii to be similar to the first one.there are rumors that rodney dangerfield was supposed to return. he carried a big part of the first film, so his return would have put caddyshack 2 over the top. jackie mason is the `new' rodney for this movie and does a decent job, even though their comic deliveries are way different. dan aykroyd was great but not in the film enough. he should have been involved to the tune of how much screen time bill murray got in the first one. robert stack (airplane!) was good in the `new' ted knight/villian role. (we miss you, ted!) danny noonan should have been back. so many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later. bushwood should not have undergone the total makeover it did. instead, the characters involved, rather than the club itself, should have been the main focus like they were in the first one. when you watch this film, keep in mind that it isn't a major sequel and you may think it's another good or bad eighties comedy. fans of the first should see it but don't be shocked when the comparisons between the original and part ii are so far apart.

everyone is entitled to an opinion. the only critic who counts is yourself. i think this is a great movie. much better than the original.in "caddyshack", rodney dangerfield is funny, but obnoxious. he was asked to do the sequel, but things got in the way. jackie mason shows the saying that "less is more". he is funny, but a man with real family issues, a more rounded person. it's no drama, but a movie that makes you feel. actually in some points, you feel sorry for jackie mason, especially when his daughter walks out on him.it has a good soundtrack, and overall, a good sorry. a good end to the series.in the tv show "alf", alf says that he cried in "terms of endearment". the wife , kate tanner, played by anne schedeen, also says he cried at "caddyshack 2".

seriously. if this had been the first shack movie, it would have been passable as funny, silly and goofy. light satire commentary on the class system would make this an enjoyable late-night rental.however, everyone wants to compare it to the first film, and maybe that's not fair. the first film is a cult classic; what could possibly follow it up? nothing. so take this second film as a stand alone, and it certainly has its moments.jackie mason is amusing, doing his best rodney-wannabe impersonation. is he as good as rodney? no. are his lines as good? no. but he is funny. the rest of the cast falls in line as being decent, but not outstanding. you'll recognize faces amongst the cast and wonder how they got to where they are today.the film is predictable, but aren't most in this genre? again, it's not the best comedy you'll see, but if you like cannonball run-type fun, you'll enjoy this one.

caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly-held classic. people have criticised the film on a lot of grounds, but they all ultimately hark back to the fact that this is not caddyshack.i would begin by saying that we should just take caddyshack out of the equation and consider this film on its own merits, but i think that would be unfair. the movie does have a lot in common with its predecessor. the class-related themes of 'snobs versus slobs' and the desire to fit in to a class above your own are as prevalent here as they were in the first movie. the two things that are truly lacking here are bill murray and rodney dangerfield, who are replaced with dan ackroyd and jackie mason respectively.now i am not about to try and argue that ackroyd comes close to murray in the movie, but jackie mason is an admirable successor to dangerfield. he comes off as a cross between dangerfield and arnold stang, but without biting too heavily on either. i wouldn't say that he is anywhere close to being as funny as dangerfield is in caddyshack, but there is a whole lot more point to his character and his dilemma in the film.chevy chase only pops up and handful of times in the movie, which is another common complaint. maybe these particular naysayers didn't notice that he only popped up a few times in the first movie. for my money, his scenes here are a lot funnier, if somewhat over-directed.while i'm on the subject, it is really the over-direction of this movie that brings it down. it comes across as far more self-conscious in its attempts to get a laugh. many of the jokes are laboured and there's far too much of the gopher, who seems to have taken on a far more anthropomorphic personality and a voice, just in case we didn't grasp the idea that its meant to be funny.characters are similarly hammered home, particularly the smarmy yuppy kids. jackie mason rarely misses a beat, and is consistently likable and very funny, but we didn't need the tango sequence at all! the director is clearly not of the same school of thought as harold ramis. not to suggest that caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a little overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with a quirky music cue.all things considered, this is a fun, goofy movie with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at the time were saying. don't be put off by the appallingly low rating on imdb, check it out for yourself.

i have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and each time i watch it the movie is just as entertaining as it was the first time! george berger (played by treat williams) leads a small group of 1960's-1970's era anti-war "hippies" living at large in new york city. this small group happens upon a young man, claude bukowski (played by john savage) who has been drafted into the us army for service in vietnam. despite their best efforts to dissuade him, claude does eventually report for basic training in the army. still distressed over his having left them, the hippie group steal a car and travel across the usa to visit claude "...for a couple of hours," in the words of george berger (to an m.p. stationed at the entry gate of the army base claude is temporarily stationed at in nevada). the outcome is truly touching, so i won't spoil it for those who have not yet seen this fantastic movie. the musical score is equally fantastic! don dacus (of the rock group chicago), who plays the part of "woof" - one of the hippies, is a not a key character, but the movie wouldn't have been the same without him. beverly d'angelo (who plays sheila franklin, an uptown girl who is befriended by the hippie group) is sensational in her role! a must see film!!

i first saw this film in the early 80's on cable. it was unique as a statement about the sixties, culture, war, music, race, and a bunch of things i'm certain i missed. however about a year ago it came back into my life as i started enjoying it with my son. he's a little young (9) for a lot of the themes in it, but he understands dancing hippies are fun to watch, and he gets the idea that end is ironic. while i can't think of other films in this genre, it does have a stand alone genius i love. it also does a unique justice to central park. most musicals are lost on me, one way or another. "tommy" was over the top and heavy handed in direction, "oliver" seemed like crowd control on the silver screen, "the wall" was so much abstract self important and indulgent dribble, but listening to "failure of the flesh" from hair sounds right for our times today, as it did in the eighties, as it must have in the sixties...truly timeless.

the largest crowd to ever see a wrestling event in the us took place at wrestlemania 6. over 93,000 people showed up to break the rolling stones indoor record, and this event didn't disappoint at all. maybe the biggest match of all time took place as the immortal hulk defended his world title against the ultimate warrior. there are over 12 matches in all so you get tons of action

*spoilers ahead*great wrestlemanias were still a few years away. but this one was certainly good, with lots of good matches, and one great match.demolition was always at their best at wrestlemania. i'm glad their last wm hoorah (i refuse to include the other version) was a win over the colossal connection. i liked the gag of andre never tagging in.few fans know that this was the first time anyone ever beat mr. perfect. for some reason, brutus beefcake's feat was never recognized. or the fact that he did it pretty easily.the hart foundation's win over the bolsheviks was the shortest in wm history, including the 24/9 second match between king kong bundy and s.d. jones.i'm glad jake and dibiase got to fight at wrestlemania. this made up for the fact that the feud had to be put on hold for so long.i expected the big bossman-akeem feud to heat up, but the bossman just clobbered him. as good as bossman was as a heel, he was just great as a face. he was always intense and obviously loved his job.if the warrior just had a better work ethic and maybe tried to learn to wrestle, he would have been a great wwf champion.worth a watch, especially since the boring matches are too short to complain about. and the tag team matches are all very exciting.

this event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that, i believe, is not equaled today. the colorful characters - in their stereotypical garb - brought a certain charm to the show that has since been raped by society and overexposed. wrestling had a bit of an innocence back then. a kid could watch it without watching an episode of jerry springer.looking back now (i was 5 at the time), although i loved both warrior and hogan, i think i enjoyed warrior more because of his mystique. hogan was the branded hero who weilded an impressive public image. the ultimate warrior, on the other hand, was a masked man of few words - an out-of-the-limelight hero for a different audience.this rivalry was so exciting as a kid because of this duality in me duking it out for each combatant. i had a place for both of them. because there was bloodshed too in this long, heavy battle, the stakes were high - at least to me as a kid. on a similar note, because of hogan's defeat, this made him more human - i remember feeling kind of sorry for him.all of these emotions at play in the juvenile boy's soap opera made wrestlemania vi such a great time to witness this game.

in the 1980s in wrestling the world was simple. hulk hogan would take on roddy piper, or bobby heenan's cronies or ted dibiase and come out victorious more often than not. occasionally he would get an ally like randy savage in 1988, but mostly it was all about hulk hogan vs bobby heenan, and that's the way it should be.but on this night that was about to change, a new champion, a man who the wwe thought would be their man for the 90s was crowned. it didn't work out. but the wwe was right about one thing: hulkamania was finished and a new order needed to be established.this historic wrestlemania, the first to be held outside america, kicked off with rick martel defeating koko b ware. koko never really had a lot of luck at wrestlemania and was taken down in short order here.next up the colossal connection andre the giant and haku put their tag team titles on the line against demolition ax and smash and lost. new tag team champions crowned.next match saw earthquake defeat hercules. hercules was another fellow who didn't really have a lot of luck at wrestlemania. plenty of luck for brutus beefcake as he ended mr perfect's undefeated streak. well, i guess someone had to end it.roddy piper and bad news brown fought to a double count out in a slow but fun match, next up the hart foundation defeated nikolai volkov and boris zhukov in 19 seconds. not really a match, unfortunately. the barbarian then defeated tito santana in a short match.the american dream dusty rhodes and saphire then defeated the macho king randy savage and queen sherri in a messy mixed tag match. this was the only female wrestling really going on in the wwe at this point of time.next up was a fun match as the rockers marty janetty and shawn micheals defeated the orient express in a fast paced encounter. there were a lot of good tag teams at this point in time. jim duggan then beat dino bravo in a nothing match.next ted dibiase put his most cherished possession, the million dollar championship on the line against jake roberts. roberts was distracted by virgil and counted out allowing ted to retain his title in an entertaining match and one of the longer matches on the show.next up the twin towers collide as the big bossman defeats akeem in short order, this is followed by rick rude winning a short match with jimmy snuka.finally we come to the main event with hulk hogan putting the wwe title on the line against intercontinental champion the ultimate warrior. this is an entertaining back and forth match won by the warrior after hogan missed a leg drop. the crowd was extraordinary and the match was a great spectacle.and so the torch was passed, but would the ultimate warrior prove to be the champion the wwe hoped he would be?

wrestlemania 6 took place april 1, 1990 at the skydome in toronto, ontario, canada.match 1: rick martel vs. koko b. ware - for what it was, a very solid opening match. koko was always fairly popular with the fans, and at this point martel was still getting over as a heel talent. in the end martel is able to snag the win in a pretty non memorable match.match 2: the colossal connection (andre the giant & haku) (c) (with bobby 'the brain' heenan) vs demolition (ax & smash) for the wwf tag team championship - at this point andre's health was really awful, so his performance was really nothing special. the crowd is 100% pro demolition in this match. in the end haku is pinned and we have new tag team champions. after the match andre lays out haku and heenan and turns face at what would turn out to be his last wrestlemania.match 3: earthquack vs hercules - very short match. big dominant heels were really a popular thing at the time. r.i.p. to both men in the match. john tenta (earthquake) passed not that long ago and same with hercules. in the end earthquake pins hercules for the win.match 4: mr. perfect vs brutus "the barber" beefcake - the first really good match of the night. r.i.p. to curt henning (mr. perfect). really solid back and forth action from both of these talented guys. in the end brutus gets the win thanks to a lot of his major fan support during the match.match 5: 'rowdy' roddy piper vs bad news brown - not a technical classic, but a pretty decent brawl for wrestlemania. piper comes out half black/half white in what is considerably a classic moment. in the end both guys fight to a double count out with no clear cut winner.match 6: the hart foundation vs the bolsheviks - complete squash match. the hart foundation gets an easy win. surprising that wwe used to have a tag team division.match 7: the barbarian vs tito santana - bobby heenan's "heenan family" fairs better in this match as the barbarian takes the win against tito santana. not memorable, but good to go back and watch years later.match 8: randy savage & sensational sherri vs dusty rhodes & sapphire - big inter-gender tag team match. dusty rhodes wears the uncomfortable polka dot outfit out to the ring. in the end rhodes and sapphire get the win over "the macho king" and sensational queen sherri.match 9: the rockers vs the orient express - surprisingly another tag team match. tag wrestling used to be so much better during this time period. a young shawn michaels and his partner marty jannetty take a loss by count out in this match to the orient express.match 10: dino bravo vs jim duggan - duggan gets a decent reaction, despite his american patriot gimmick. bravo, a member of jimmy hart's group, comes to the ring with hart and earthquake. although he has support, duggan takes the win.match 11: "the million dollar man" ted dibiase (c) vs jake 'the snake' roberts for the million dollar championship - the first major main event of the night. roberts was extremely over with the fans. match was considerably good for what it was. dibiase is able to pick up a count out win on roberts. but roberts ends up possessing dibiase's money and giving it away.match 12: the big boss man vs akeem (with slick) - one man gang's sad attempt at being an african dream named akeem. a really short match that needed some more time to develop itself as a match. boss man wins with a slam.match 13: jimmy "superfly" snuka vs rick rude - heenan comes to the ring with rude for this match. snuka, never really got it good at wrestlemania. he always seemed to be on the losing end. after a short 5 minutes, rude gets the win over snuka.match 14: wwf champion hulk hogan vs intercontinental champion the ultimate warrior - dubbed as "the ultimate challenge" we get some interesting promos from both men earlier in the night. the match was actually very good, given that people tend to think hogan can't wrestle. a lot of near falls that really got the crowd and people that watch at home into it. in the end warrior gets the win on hogan and wins both titles. a stunned crowd looks on as hulk hogan suffers his first loss at wrestlemania.

wrestlemania 6, is an entertaining wrestlemania, if not an entirely successful one. the ultimate challenge, is of course worth the price of admission alone, but once again as with a lot of the early mania's, there's too much filler in between. the crowd pops for almost everything, and as always, giving us the reliable announcing team of gorilla&the body. having a face vs face match as the main event for a wrestlemania, was absolutely unheard of at this time, it only made things that much more tense. matches. koko b. ware/w frankie vs "the model" rick martel. for a 3 or so minute match, this is as good as it gets. i wish it was a tad longer, but what i got, was pretty damn good. martel wins, with the boston crab.2 1/2 /5wwf tag team championship. demolition vs colossal connection|c|/w bobby heean. huge pop for demolition. match itself is pretty dull, i often had trouble paying attention. andre really didn't do much, so in a way it was more like a 2 on 1. there is solid talent involved here, and it's a shame they couldn't produce better. demolition wins that titles, with there pattened maneuver off the top. crowd blows the roof of for the finish.1 1/2 /5earthquake/w jimmy hart. vs hercules i got what i expected here, a standard boring filler match, with earthquake doing his thing. i'm not really a fan of either, so it didn't perk my interest much. quake wins with his sit down splash.1/5brutus beefcake vs mr.pefect/w the genius. deafening pop for bruti. really good match up, with sadly not enough time given to develop even further. it really kept my interest, and remains one of my favorites on the card. beefcake wins with a slingshot to the post, much to the crowd's approval.3/5roddy piper vs bad news brown. huge pop for piper. nothing more than a boring brawl, that does not know what it wants to be. some entertaining antics from the hot rod, but nothing else. noteworthy for roddy painting himself half black, and calling himself "hot scott"1/5the hart foundation vs the bolsheviks. record breaking, but other than that, nothing to see here. harts win with, the hart attack.0/5the barbarian/w bobby heenan. vs tito santana. average for the time it got, but watchable nonetheless. crowd was rather dead for it, except for heenan's interference. jessie's hilarious cracks, about tito's food is more entertaining, then the match itself. barbarian wins with a nasty looking, flying clothesline off the top.2/5mixed tag match. dusty&sapphire/w elizabeth. vs macho king&sherri. big pop for dusty, and an even bigger one for elizabeth, who looks absolutely stunning, might i add. i thought it was ok. it was lively at least, if nothing that great. i'm not a fan of dusty' so. dusty and sapphire win, when she rolls up sherri.2/5the orient express/w fuji. vs the rockers. crowd is rather anemic for this, surprisingly. decent no doubt, but with these guys involved, it should have been better. the constant focus with fuji, kinda detracts from the match. express wins by count out, when janetty gets nailed with salt.2 1/2 /5jim duggan vs dino bravo/w earthquake&jimmy hart. duggan like an idiot, brings out the american flag in canada. duggan gets some solid boo's for it too, but that also may be due to bravo's canadian heritage. crappy match all around, i don't care for duggan, but that's not why it sucked. too short in the end, to really matter. duggan wins when he whacks bravo in the back, with the two by four. duggan gets splashed for his troubles.0/5million dollar championship. ted dibiase|c|/w virgil. vs jake robers/w damien. some slow spots, but when all was said and done, i had a good time. two solid wrestlers giving it there all, resulted in an entertaining match up. crowd noticeably gets ancy during parts of it though, by doing the wave. dibiase wins by count out. jake has the last laugh, by giving away some of his money, much to the crowd's delight.3/5big bossman vs akeem/w slick. nice pop for the bossman. too routine, and too short to really mean anything, in the end. akeem was a gimmick, i was never too fond of. bossman wins with his slam.0/5the rhythm&blues segment was pretty much a failure. crowd wasn't into itrick rude/w bobby heenan. vs jimmy snuka. for a filler match, before the main event, this wasn't too bad. if it had time to get going more, it would have been excellent, for sure. rude wins, with the rude awakening.2/5title for title. ultimate warrior|ic champ| vs hulk hogan|wwf champ| this one is all about the atmosphere from the crowd, and the split crowd reaction, for the most part. warrior got a pretty decent pop, but in my opinion it was a little underwhelming. hogan dwarfs it completely,with his. it's one of wrestlemania's best matches in history. with two people, who aren't really known for there wrestling, they managed to create an amazing match up that was talked about for ages. i have seen this many times, and my respect level grows higher for each one, for their effort, considering i'm not a fan of either. even die-hard fanatics who crave pure wrestling, can't bitch about this one!. warrior wins with his splash. 5/5bottom line. wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining entry, if nothing overly special. it's memorable for the main event, the location, and the crowd, but it's not one of the best if you ask me. that being said i do enjoy it, and i give it my recommendation to fellow wrestling fans.7/10

this was a very good ppv, but like wrestlemania xx some 14 years later, the wwe crammed so many matches on it, some of the matches were useless. i'm not going to go through every match on the card because it would take forever to do.however major highlights included the huge pop for demolition winning the tag team belts from haku and andre the giant, the first ever mixed tag match featuring randy savage and sensational queen sherri vs dusty rhodes and the late sapphire and the first ever clash between the ultimate warrior and hulk hogan.some matches were a complete waste of time. like the bolsheviks vs the hart foundation was only about 40 seconds long, koko b ware vs rick martel was short and big bossman vs akeem was too short.mr perfect vs brutus beefcake and ted dibiase vs jake 'the snake' roberts were very good indeed.overall grade - b

this movie is amazing. you will never laugh harder. it's a target. no, i think it's...yes it's...a boob! this movie gets funnier by the second--like when jackie chan's character finally dies in his final fight scene. this movie is velly velly seekwet like treasha! congrats if you buy or rent this. you'll never return it, in my opinion. i didn't, and i haven't found it in a store since. i watched this movie once and i was forever in love with kung-fu action flicks. if you're looking for an amazing film in the realm of great production value, good or even mediocre acting, and good special effects...this is not that movie. if you're looking for laughs and timeless wonderment, pick this up for a dollar and you'll probably never let it go. with friends, popcorn and drinks, it's the perfect evening.

the hand of death most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to- due, in no small part, to john woo's masterful direction, coupled with kat's superb cinematography: some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental; there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art-house film. both james tien and sammo hung make for the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate. tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad. it's a role reversal the likes of which i don't think i've ever seen before (tien normally played a hero and, in fact, with his moustache, i didn't even recognize him at first). sammo's goofy "buck teeth" only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed; that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable- in a villain you love to hate kind of way. his choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic. jackie chan appears briefly (early on and late in the going) as a blacksmith, and i believe i actually glimpsed yuen biao somewhere along the way. tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent.

the hand of death aka countdown in kung fu (1976) is a vastly underrated early work by director john woo. the film stars dorian tan (tan tao-liang) and features jackie chan, sammo hung and james tien in significant supporting roles. many people believe, or have been lead to believe by deceptive advertising, that this is a jackie chan film. this is not a jackie chan film, dorian tan is the star but jackie gives one of his best (most serious) early performances.the hand of death is about a shaolin disciple named yunfei (tan) who is sent on a mission to assassinate a shaolin traitor named shih xiaofeng (tien) and protect a revolutionary named zhang yi (woo). along his journey yunfei meets up with a young woodcutter named tan (chan) and a disgraced sword fighter (chang chung) known as "the wanderer." both men have suffered at the hands of shih and want to take revenge. the three team up to defeat shih and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety.the martial arts action is above average under the direction of sammo hung. dorian tan uses his trademark high kicks very effectively as the "northern eighteen styles kicks" along with some "southern five styles boxing." sammo hung and jackie chan provide excellent martial arts performances as well. james tien is not the greatest martial artist on the jade screen but does an acceptable job. some of the early fights are a bit slow and seem over choreographed but the final showdowns featuring chan, tan and hung are very good.director john woo provides plenty of interesting character development in the film, which is refreshing. the cinematography by leung wing kat is very stylish, unique and beautiful for a kung fu film of this era. joseph koo's music: a combination of soft flutes and 70's "shaft" style orchestral pieces is kung fu cinema at its best. hand of death is not jackie and sammo's usual kung fu comedy. hand of death is a serious, straightforward revenge driven story.hand of death aka countdown in kung fu is an underrated classic in the old school kung fu genre. the film is one of the best artistically of its time and a preview of the great things to come from jackie chan and sammo hung. hung's great choreography is put on display here before his directorial debut and chan's early charisma and talent can be clearly seen.hand of death is a solid, stylish old school kung fu film and a brilliant early work of the legendary john woo.kung fu genre rating 7.5/10 wanderer to tan (referring to his new weapon): "the little eagle wing god lance." tan: "just a knickknack."

my friends and i saw this at the san diego black film festival. it was great. stormy is a strong black woman and nana reminds me of my grandmother. rene is fine!!! seeing him take off his clothes was definitely worth the price of admission. can someone forward me his contact info?my friend thinks flex is the finer of the two. she's been a flex fan for years though so she might be a little biased. the cousins were funny and just as trifling as nana described them. lol.i am looking forward to seeing this movie again when it comes to theaters.

true love, i truly enjoyed and loved this movie. it was fun, funny and inspirational. i just saw it on dvd. how did i miss this one it's a winner! i mean flex was "that guy". i wanted to marry him. this was my 1st time seeing him as a straight leading man and he pulls it off. i thought tangi miller was the best ever and i was a felicity head too. a fearless woman who only fears her nana. thank you for giving women of color range in your work and she looks great! tasha smith was a blast! aloma wright was priceless as nana. this cute romantic comedy is "a must see". oh and the new comer marcus patrick is worth the surprise ladies...true love. karen

cute movie feel good movie i had never heard of this movie but ran across it while looking for something to rent. i had high hopes for this movie based purely on flex being in this movie. i have never seen him in anything not worth while. true to form this movie delivered for me. i enjoyed the story. the movie is full of great actors and actresses. the hilarious tasha smith, essence atkins and of course tangi miller. i really liked this movie a lot. i didn't give it five stars because it did not discuss certain issues that i thought the movie should have detailed. the issue was apparently resolved but i would have appreciated a discussion resolving the issues. i liked the movie so much that i am now buying the movie after i've already rented and watched it.

this film was great!tangi miller and flex did a great job. they both look good together and they both pulled it off.tasha smith was so funny as the cousin,and she couldn't stay out of her business.essence held it down for her girl, when she needed her. aloma was sweet and played a dear grandmother she really reminded me of my grandmother.and oh,i can't forget about the stripper, he was so find, and i didn't know if i should cover my eyes or smile while i watch him reveal his sexiness on the big screen.damn! he was fine! tangi looked flawless, and sexy, and she stepped up a notch since felicity. over all the movie had a lot "a" list actors and actress. it was funny, sexy, crazy, touching,loving, emotional and wonderful. this movie is a must see! go it get on dvd now if don't have it!

travis (james franco) is a young man riding a train for business reasons (we're to assume) who leaves his beloved phone behind. it gets picked up by a prostitute, terri (rachel miner), and when he goes to her city to pick it up, a series of events occur that are sure to stay with him forever.both characters have barriers they've put up to defend themselves from communication. but despite their facades, it's obvious both are eager to bust them down. in total there are about 30 or so spoken lines, but from the way james franco and rachel miner use their faces you might as well turn off the volume, words are unnecessary. a scene to look out for is terri staring at herself in the mirror. you can just feel her despair permeating the room.but, the movie isn't perfect. it's mostly filmed using hand-held cameras, which gets a bit distracting. mainly due to the acting of mr. franco and miner and the photography, the script's flaws don't stand out as much. still, sometimes it seems as if the story doesn't really know where it wants to go.all in all, this is the type of film that truly stays with you long after you watched it. an hour after you've seen it, you're still 'what-if'-ing yourself on the behalf of certain characters. it's not flawless, but still leaves you wanting more, wishing it were at least 4x as long.

this film, for what it was set out to be, succeeded. it's a short tragic film. although my choice of film are ones that really develop characters and their relationships, this film is meant to just give a taste, leaving you with the "what happens next" factor. after watching it, i really was wanting more, more of the characters back story, what influences they had to make them into the people they were. i think thats what the makers intended the viewing audience to think. the acting is amazing. there aren't many lines in the film so their body language, facial expressions, and overall presence needed to be powerful enough to withhold a scene. both franco and miner have that element and it shows. for them (especially franco) to take the time to make this, obviously says they believed in this film and wanted to be apart of it and for that, i appreciated the film for what it was. also i'm happy i own it so i can share it with other people that would've never known it existed.

hello all denver fans!i couldn't agree more with you guys! this show was so cool and cute, i i watched it as a kid in the late 80s. among denver are other favourite too, such as care bears and rainbow brite. i am 24 now, but it is still one of my favourite shows, and my favourite cartoon from the 80s. it brings back all the memories. the theme tune was great too, i get goosebumps whenever i hear it. it is sad that it lasted such a short time, but it has remained a firm favourite. its great that i am not alone and that there are people out there who liked it too. this is one of the cartoon shows i shall keep for future generations. viva denver! :)

heya denver fans! the animation is a cartoon's classic & one of my favorite too (and yes, it was broadcast in europe as well. including my tiny central-european country, slovenia! =:) oh, how i miss the 80's cartoons!! honestly, they were way better than today's children shows. more imaginative, creative, full of fun with good morals, more substance, great storyline and excellent character voices. computer animated shows of today lack all of these features. so all of you, who agree and want to bring back all the shows so that the kids of today's generation would see the entertainment that these cartoons brought to us, please log on the side posted bellow and sign a petition for a rerun of the 80's best cartoons! http://www.thepetitionsite.com /1/we-want-an-80s-child-cartoon-kids-show-channelcarpe denver! =) lejla

while caricatures and/or references to entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products is usually a staple in shorts like this one, they aren't used in quantity here. most of the individual gags are rather generic. as i'm going to give examples, there will be spoilers below: there are only three (well, technically four-there's a quick one at the very end of the cartoon) caricatures that i spotted, which is kind of low for this type of short, though one is a featured character with a fair amount of activity. they are jack benny (as jack bunny), leopold stowkowski and the inimitable ned sparks (as a crab on a can-chances are very good that, if a crab was involved in a warner brothers short in the 1930s-1940s, the caricature used would be ned sparks). there are also references to billy rose's aquacade and a riff on a radio show character called "henry aldrich" (coming, mother!), a play on superman (superguy here) and the villain is a take-off on "king kong". that's it for that kind of gag.the products themselves are mostly generic and the gags are more plays on basic items in unusual situations, such as turtles coming off of cans of soup to attack the villain as tanks, tomato soup cans doing "the can-can', gingerbread men who turn into paratroopers, using tissues for parachutes and so on. the gags are very good and it's an excellent example of a bob clampett cartoon. clampett had hit his stride as a director by this point and while it isn't anywhere near his best work, it's nothing to sneeze at either. this short can be found on looney tunes golden collection, vol. 3, which is an excellent set that i highly recommend. this short itself is also recommended.

once again, we are fortunate to see a gorgeous opening scene where the artists' work has been fully restored and we see this old-time grocery store on a street corner with the snow gently falling. inside are the rich colors of all the merchandise, from produce to canned and boxed goods to medicine to candy, etc.in essence, this is a story of those goods "coming to life," such as the animals on the labels of items, or a pie, or even a pack of cigarettes.the whole "show" is narrated by "jack bunny," a jack benny impersonator, with music from conductor leopold stokowski, who was in so many looney tunes animated shorts i have lost count. a lot of the humor is topical, so it pays to know who "little egypt" and other characters. the busby berkeley-type "aqua" number with bathing suited-sardines coming out of the can, and the tomato can-can dance were both clever! all of the above, and more, was in the first half of this slightly longer-than-normal length cartoon. the second half was about a king kong-type which escapes from the "animal crackers" box and terrorizes everyone. that part was not much, and ended on a somewhat stupid note. so..... an "a" for the first half, a "d" for the second, making it about a c-plus or b-minus overall.

adapted from sam shepard's play, this movie retains many play-like elements such as a relatively fixed setting (a roadside 50's motel in the southwest) and extensive, intriguing dialogues. a woman "may" is hounded by a man "eddie" (played by sam shepard). she tries to hide from him in the out-of-the-way motel, but he finds her. the film explores the history of their relationship, mainly from their childhoods, that has led them to this point. it's very easy to feel sympathy for the characters and to understand that their dysfunctional present relationship is a result of past events out of their control. we mainly watch them fight, make up, fight, make up and so on. one image that stands out in my mind, is of eddie hauling may over his shoulder kicking and screaming, taking her somewhere she doesn't want to go.the soundtrack is also perfect soulful country with vocals by a lesser known artist "sandy rogers". she has this country doll voice that almost yodels at some points in the album! this is the kind of movie that will stay lodged in some part of your brain/soul. in other words, go see it!

(warning - contains mild spoiler) a movie almost designed to make you pause and check your recollection of it - it's confined to an almost empty motel where the huge courtyard resembles a circus ring and the rooms seem like temporary withdrawal points rather than refuges; as the characters become increasingly preoccupied by the past, the present increasingly falls away, until the ultimate incendiary appearance of the countess in the black mercedes marks the fusion of reality and fantasy. whether or not their stories are true, and whether stanton is truly the father or just a crazy old man stepping into their stories, seems impossible to determine. the theme seems to be how love of an extreme and unconsidered nature messes with stability to the point where reality itself breaks down; where exotic, misplaced fantasy becomes dangerously tangible. the image of the burning motel - a symbol of dislocation beset by destruction - is an appropriately weird ending for this strange but effective, startlingly imaginative, movie.

why would i say that? because when the movie ended, i was in a good mood. so many people exclaim at the end, wow! bruce willis can be funny. for those of you who believe he learned how to act after the sixth sense, you must be very new to his career. he won an emmy for best actor in a comedy series before he did die hard. it's like saying, wow, the sky learned to deposit snow on the ground just because it's your first winter in life. the movie was hilarious. what boggles my mind is how some other comments made about this movie claims that there are no memorable lines or scenes. spoiler...the waaaambulance? i am not a loser? have you ever seen a grown up scream i am not a loser before?i thought this movie was great. it was funny, it was never boring and in a cheesy disney sort of way, it had a point to make. something to do with life and of course any kid movie trying to do that is in over it's head but for once, i didn't care.if you haven't watched it. do so. you'll like it.

i couldnt believe how well this kid did on screen, you will completely forget that they are actors and loose yourself in the movie. it is like watching home movies with a twist. i recomend this to everyone. highly.

the story is quite slow at the beginning except few interesting humour that come along the way but some of the plot still empty.the science on how the kid entered the 21st century is still a mystery except at the end of the movie, we have been shown of how.other than that, everything looks ok!

perhaps i was just in a really good mood when i watched this film. but, for whatever reason, i really liked this film. was it terribly original? no. was it a bit predictable? yes. and so what? it was still a really nice movie. i've always liked bruce willis (well, almost always, there was hudson hawk and the fifth element, after all), and he portrayed a selfish, sarcastic b***ard perfectly. maybe this movie isn't academy award material, but it sure is feel good material. go rent it.

in this dream-come-true, i found myself loving what was going on. it's a good movie, and should not be passed off as a corny fantasy movie. it's too smart for that. it's definitely a feel good movie, but with a nice message to leave you with. 7/10, b, **1/2 out of ****

at last, a great film that doesn't have to be edited for profanity or sex! it's a fun film that the whole family can enjoy. willis is great, as always. "rusty" was delightful. just enough action to keep interest going.

i waited long to watch this movie. also because i like bruce willis. the plot was quite different from what i had expected but still quite good. its a good mix of emotions, humor and drama.left me thinking over and again :)

while it comes no closer to the tarzan of edgar rice burroughs than, say, the johnny wiesmuller flicks did it does have it's own peculiar, and entertaining, slant on the story. its a well done tarzan movie. nice scenery, good photography, workable continuity, and a tarzan yell that echos the one described by burroughs. the players all perform well. the only bad points i found were, i think, related. it moves slow in places. that slow movement? makes this picture to long. it could easily have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter, which i think would have helped with the natural flow of the plot line and the character development. but the rest of the film works well enough to carry it over these two rough spots and still leave the viewer satisfied with the flick. short version of all the above ... its a very good tarzan movie.

i thought this was a very daring representation of the old hokey 'tarzan' concept made so popular by hollywood, weismuller, et al.yes; there is a lot of silly stuff. but then, the idea is silly. it is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be sired to adulthood by chimpanzees. i am tempted to say completely unbelievable, but that the concept has never been tried. and there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort. though under the circumstances i can see how that would be very difficult to avoid. we also now have a much greater insight into the issues of acculturation, and know that a human raised from infancy without human behavioural prompts would ultimately never learn them in adulthood.still, if you can get your head around that lot, there's a great deal to admire that is both imaginative and daring. lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb. i am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role i have seen him play. there are plenty of other excellent performances too. not least of which are sir ralph richardson and ian holm.what is particularly disturbing - and rightly so - is the simian perception of humans. we get to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor, dumb, helpless brutes over whom we so routinely lord it. and it demonstrates well how the phony 'civilisation' and 'morality' with which we cloak and justify our conduct, is no more than an expression of own selfishness and arrogance. it may seem a little overstated at times, especially in the hideous museum dissection rooms, but what we see isn't just a truth about the victorians; its a truth about the way we are today. it's one that needs to be stated, and cannot be stated often enough. holm's character's obsession with the 'ray-zor' as a symptom of civilisation - as if to possess facial hair were a primitive condition to be scorned - is an excellent case in point. primitive bearded readers take note.the story is depressing. ultimately it's a tragedy. because even though he returns to the jungle and the freedom from moral tyranny that is truly human 'civilisation'; we know he's doomed. before the third millennium is 50 years old, wild simians will be hunted into extinction as bush meat, and their environment developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to gratify insatiable human excess.in the end, it's a tale about ourselves. the path to extinction that other simians tread, must eventually be followed by humans.highly recommended for its ethical take, despite the hokey moments.

before i review this film, i must make a confession that is rather a bold statement to make as a film reviewer. anyone who has already read any of my previous reviews may know that i've always been controversial in a low-key sense, giving high marks for flops such as "captain america" and 1985's "creature" and panning such film classics as alistar sim's "a christmas carol" and "shakespeare in love." with that in mind, this confession might not come as a surprise:the simple fact is, christopher lambert is probably one of my favorite actors. woah, now, don't start getting crazy on me just yet. let me explain myself: i by no means think he's the greatest actor in the world. i clearly confess that he is not. he is certainly no morgan freeman or anthony hopkins, but i would say that his acting ability is probably somewhere up there with at least bruce willis. what i admire about him, however, are the human qualities that he brings into his action heroes. he is just an average guy who laughs and cries and bleeds, who is a hero because he has to be, not necessarily because he wants to be. it takes a lot, in my opinion, to be able to bring out those qualities in a character (especially in the movies he's worked in), and lambert's heroes are a far cry from schwartzennegger's or stallone's. quite frankly, lambert's characters are easier for me to relate to. hence, he's not the greatest actor in the world....he's just a personal favorite.i can't say that same, however, for his films. however much i appretiate his acting, it would be foolish not to confess that his choice of films leave something to be desired. most of them are, quite frankly, terrible, and any ridicule that he's gotten over the years from me isn't due to his acting, but rather his bad choice in scripts.with that in mind, i can say that his debut film, "tarzan," is one of his best films and probably his greatest performance. as i mentioned, it is effective becasue of the humaness he brings to the role, and for how seriously the director, writers and actors handle the material. this is a far leap from the b-movie action adventures with johnny weismeller from the 1940's. in fact, i would hesitate to call it an action movie. instead, it is a serious drama that takes all of e.r. burrough's material seriously, showing tarzan's quest to discover his real family in scotland after realizing that he doesn't fit in as a "white ape." he is torn in between his old family and his new one, which includes a wonderful sir ralph richardson in his final role. in an attempt to adapt to humans, his ape instincts also kick in, and he can't decide what he loves more: his real family, or the one that he's always known. all in all, it is a wonderful commentary on society, and a wonderful character study.if nothing else, it launched lambert into international stardom, which continued will into the 1980's with films like "highlander" and "he sicilian." unfortunately, it didn't last. but just wait a while....his latest career moves such as "gideon" and "resurrection" have proven that though he still have a long way to go, he's a competent enough actor to be able to perhaps make a... ahem.... comeback if he'll just pick his roles better.for now, however, here's the verdict on his first film:*** out of ****

the greatest tarzan ever made! this movie is done in a way that no other tarzan ever has come close in doing. it has every thing in it that you would want in a tarzan movie. no other tarzan movie ever has or ever will portray the character this well. i would say that if you have seen a tarzan movie and liked it you should see this one you will love it, and if you have never seen tarzan you should see this one and forget the rest of them.

i really enjoyed this movie. yes there was disrespect throughout the movie, but bruce willis learned, from the kid, that there is more value in repecting others, and his life of disrespect needs to change. this movie was a refreshing change from the trash that hollywood is trying to shove down our throats. there are some very good lessons to be learned in this movie. i really believe this was one of disneys best, even though a couple of things could have been left out. i was impressed with the lack of swearing and lack of sexual inuendos. it isn't perfect, but much better than most everything else out there.

i must confess that i don't remember this film very well. but, certainly i liked it. i think it was the best adaptation from burroughs novel, really. and of course it's one of the best movie from christopher lambert.a good movie about tarzan, as cult as the ones with weissmuller.

don't let the wildly varying reviews of the movie deter you. you'll love it or hate it according to your own tastes. however, if for no other reason, see "greystoke" to experience the excitement of a great actor grabbing your heart as he breathes life into his role. ralph richardson was not a great actor for how perfectly he could handle shakespeare; rather, he is to be remembered for his sensitive treatment of every character he portrayed. he was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor. his reading of the part of the sixth lord of greystoke, his last performance, is to be cherished by all who love the theatre.

this is one of bruce's most underrated films in my opinion, its an awesome heartwarming film, with a neat story and an amazing performance from bruce willis!. all the characters are great, and i thought willis and spencer breslin were just awesome together, plus bruce willis is simply amazing in this!. this is definitely one of bruce's best comedic performances (the waaaaaaaaaamabulance thing was great) and i thought it was very well written and made as well, plus the finale is especially cool!. it's good natured and it was cool how you can see russell's (willis) character change throughout the film! plus the ending was pretty good. i think this should be higher then 6.0 and it's one of the best disney films i have ever seen! plus it has many surprising moments throughout. all the characters are extremely likable, and it also has a cute love story angle too it as well, plus bruce and spencer breslin both had some really funny lines (holy smokes!). this is one of bruce's most underrated films in my opinion, its an awesome heartwarming film, with a neat story and an an amazing performance from bruce willis and i say its a must see!. the direction is great!. jon turteltaub does a great job here with really good camera work, and just keeping the film at a very fast pace. the acting is excellent!. bruce willis is amazing as always and is amazing here, he gives one of his best comedic performances, is hilarious had wonderful chemistry with both spencer breslin and emily mortimer, had some funny lines, and was dead on throughout the movie, he was one of the main reasons i liked this movie so much! (willis rules!!!!!!!). spencer breslin is fantastic as the younger version of russell, he was very funny and didn't get on my nerves once, he is one of the better child actors out there!. emily mortimer is good as amy and was really cute i liked her she had decent chemistry with bruce too. lily tomlin is funny as janet i liked her quite a bit. jean smart is good with what she had to do, which was not much. rest of the cast do fine. overall a must see!. **** out pf 5

hello, looking for a movie for the family to watch on a friday night? can't find what your looking for? i thought this was an extremely enjoyable movie. good for the whole family. i found that it had a remarkably rare combination of it being appealing to both adults and children alike. it was brilliant, to say the least. bruce willis's acting was top-notch, there was a lot of humor in it and overall, a great movie. in my opinion, it's a must-see movie. and i don't think that about a lot of movies, believe me when i say it takes a lot for a movie to get me to think that. it's clear that there was much work done by bruce willis and cast to get this movie done. excellent story, good acting, and again, overall a thoroughly enjoyable movie.

i would just like to point out (in addition to pleading for the series to be released on dvd) that a show does not have to be realistic to be entertaining. these days, with all the blood and gore in the news and in crime dramas, reality shows, etc. it's nice to get lost in a good, cheesy show with entertaining characters. pwog fits the bill. was it emmy material? no, but it was awesome just the same.i also have to put a vote in for the second cast - they were more charismatic than the cast of season one. i would definitely agree that the first season had a more serious vibe than the second two, but i was definitely more sucked in by the latter cast. even though the series has been off the air for years, i'll never stop hoping that it be released for purchase.

i heard that after the first oceans movie, the sequels begin to go downhill. i believe that this is not the case(at least not for this film). this movie is even better than the first film! the original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed terry benedict's casinos. now, benedict is visiting each one of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks. to do that, they must do a couple heists in europe to get the money.the acting is very good. the all-star cast exceeded expectations. matt damon, brad pitt, and catherine zeta-jones were probably the best in this film.there are some confusing moments in this film. but that does not matter because there are only a few confusing moments. anyway, this movie is only made for harmless fun.overall, this is a great heist movie. i rate this movie 9/10.

ocean's twelve is probably better than ocean's eleven. i know most people would disagree, but i actually liked it more. after three years, it was good seeing the gang return. the reason behind the heist is a bit more inspired the second time around. i see why they stole from benedict(andy garcia) in the last film. this film they have a bit more motivation the second time around. ocean's twelve is more entertaining, and cooler than ocean's eleven. with a funny cameo by topher grace saying "i just walked in that new dennis quaid movie" and other things. i think ocean's twelve is probably the best in the series.the plot: a year or so after ocean's twelve, terry benedict(the guy they robbed in the last film) is back and says that if ocean's eleven doesn't pay him back the money they stole, he's going to call the cops. so danny ocean and the gang go to europe, where rusty meets his old cop girlfriend isabelle. after she meets him again, she begins to follow them around. also, the gang learns that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they are.with many funny scenes like when tess(julia roberts) goes to europe and pretends to be julia roberts, ocean's twelve is a pretty clever film. it's cooler, funnier, and more entertaining than ocean's eleven.

ocean's 12'if you steal fifty million dollars, they will find you.' (alan rickman as hans gruber, die hard)this adage certainly rings true in this sequel. terry benedict has been informed that danny ocean and his compadres were the ones who ripped him off and now he wants it all back. the ocean gang need a lot of money and fast, but cannot work in the states as benedict has made it impossible for them. so it's off to europe to perform acts of death defying thievery, whilst trying to avoid catherine zeta jones' super cop, an old flame from rusty's (pitt's) past. on their first heist in amsterdam they find out that who ratted on them was the 'night fox', a super slick thief with a legend complex. he issues them with a challenge that could write off their debt in full or land them in some kind of uma thurman-kill bill ii-buried-alive-type-sequence. interesting? well, yes. slow? sort of. entertaining? mostly. unnecessary scenes of character development? plenty. ocean and his band of merry men are charismatic, if nothing else and as this is a sequel and we are all old friends we see plenty more 'pally' situations and conversations. too many. damon's linus is more nervous than before; the cousins are bickering as we knew they would; bernie mac talks too much and don cheadle's cock-er-ney accent is as bad as ever (i really like cheadle, but could not abide this). pitt and clooney talk like old friends, filling each other's glasses and reading each other's minds. however, what worked so well in the last film was the lack of character development versus how slick the whole damned op was. and as much as these actors work well together, zeta jones fits into this film like a big square peg in a tight 11 sided hole. she simply doesn't fit and her chemistry with pitt is non-existent.the stars of this film for me, however, were vincent cassel as the night fox and soderbergh's choice of locations. cassel plays pomp and wealth as if he was born into both. his night fox is arrogant, 'awfully cavalier with other people's lives' (danny ocean) and a total contrast to the ocean gang. this is where i think the film loses its way. cassel and the european locations provide an all too realistic contrast with the american actors and the style of the first film. we want slick, brash and quick-witted; not gritty, considered and intellectual. this is where the film doesn't work.admittingly, you cannot repeat the same formula twice to the letter, but going to far left or right usually does more damage than good in a mainstream film like this.

with a cast like this, i knew the acting would be amazing. still, i was cautious, as i always am of sequels. would it sustain the feeling of the first film? could they possibly replicate the tension and thrill of the masterful heist of ocean's 11? we'll never know, because they didn't try. at least, not in the way i expected. instead, they made a light and truly funny parody of the heist genre. if you want a gripping, logical heist, don't watch this. if you want a good laugh, with witty dialogue, quirky characters, and an absolutely genius scene where julia roberts has to impersonate herself, then you'll love ocean's 12.

film certainly can be a narrative medium, but by no means is it the ideal medium. literature best carries a plot, because the reader can supply the imagination necessary to complete the structure. film is appreciated best when viewed for what it is: a series of images grouped together. what soderbergh does in ocean's twelve is combine impeccable film-making technique with the free-flowing form of american movies from the 1970s. from looking at the comments posted recently, most people went in expecting a standard-issue heist movie, a la entrapment; it seems people actually miss the tiresome clichés of romance disguised as tension between the leads and ridiculous plot twists designed to keep the audience awake. soderbergh's directing prowess is reason alone to see this movie, but close-ups of pitt and zeta-jones forty feet high on the screen don't hurt either. a true treat for those who love the flickering of lights on the silver screen, and a disappointment for those trying to make film something it's not.

soderbergh is a fabulous director, but nothing he could conjure could beat the amazing cast he gathered for this zenith of sequels. clearly, he knew this from the get-go. the term "star-vehicle" has traditionally been used to refer to a movie that builds itself around one star. what this film does is net a whole herd of hollywood hot shots and make them shine even brighter than before. the last scene says it all--all the stars sitting around with nothing happening and nothing being said. we just get to see them socialize as though it were a scene from a reality show where george clooney, catherine zeta-jones, matt damon, brad pitt, and don cheadle are just hanging out, being themselves. so the story's not important at all--at least, that's not where the films' greatest pleasures come from. if you want a clever heist movie, better stick with 11. but if star-gazing turns you on, this will make your day.

an on screen caption informs us that it is 'the caribbean sea, may 1891'. a small lifeboat drifts aimlessly at sea containing six convicts from a shipwrecked prison ship, and the ship's doctor a lt. claude de ross (claudio cassinelli). it's night, a strange current takes the boat towards a strange, unnamed and uncharted island. the boat hits some rocks and is torn apart. one of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fish-man creature. the next morning morning claude wakes up to find himself washed upon a beach. he finds a pool of white bubbling water and one of the prisoners dead beside it. claude warns another surviving prisoner jose (franco iavarone) not to drink the water as it will kill him. they both eventually meet up with the other surviving prisoners, peter (roberto posse), francois (francesco mazzeri) and skip (giuseppe castellano). francois wanders off on his own to try and catch an animal for food, he finds and kills a large water bird. but in turn he is killed himself by one of the fish-men. claude, jose, peter and skip continue to explore the island as they put francois's death down to an animal attack of some sort. soon after skip is killed when he is impaled on a spike at the bottom of a pit. now only claude, jose and peter are left. they stumble across a cemetery with lots of empty graves and signs of recent black magic rituals. claude spots a snake on a nearby rock, suddenly a shot is heard and the snakes head explodes. a woman on horseback named amanda marvin (barbara bach) is revealed to be claudes saviour. she tells them to leave the island immediately as it is owned by a edmund rackham (richard johnson) and he doesn't like visitors. claude, jose and peter decide to carry on regardless, eventually finding rackham's large house in which they are invited to stay. that night peter goes after amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp, peter quickly becomes food for the fish-men. and a voodoo priestess called shakira (beryl cunningham), who lives with rackham, performs a black magic ritual involving slitting the throat of a chicken at the cemetery. the next day claude and jose decide they should leave the island as they feel very uneasy about rackham and think he is lying to them. jose rides off on horseback and is lost. claude is saved from one of the fish-men by amanda and is again told to leave. claude wants to confront rackham again. rackham reveals that he has a scientist, and amanda's father, named professor ernest marvin (joseph cotten) who he needs to be kept alive. rackham says that the longer ernest stays alive the chances of his own survival will dramatically increase. rackham tells claude his plan. rackham has found the lost city of atlantis at a depth of over 2,000 feet. he is using the fish-men as a means of getting at the lost treasures of atlantis, and needs amanda and her father to control them. he claims the fish-men are descendants of the original inhabitants of atlantis. rackham offers claude a share of the treasure if he will help him keep ernest alive. later claude remembers the name ernest marvin as a scientist who was condemned for experiments transplanting animal organs into human beings. finding ernest's secret laboratory he discovers rackham had lied to him and the fish-men aren't descendants, their actually genetically altered people turned into amphibious creatures by ernest's grotesque experiments! rackham has finally had enough of claude and decides to put an end to his meddling by sticking him in a large tank and slowly filling it with water, as the islands volcano starts to erupt and send lava flying everywhere. rackham wants to leave the island with his treasures and amanda, will claude escape almost certain death to save amanda and get off the island before the erupting volcano tears it apart? directed by sergio martino i really liked this film that mixes various genres. the script by sergio donati is fast paced, interesting and entertaining. the plot is revealed bit by bit, which kept me interested in watching it all the way through. i must say at this point that i've seen the original version and not the one with added scenes inserted for it's us release by roger corman. barbara bach makes for an extremely attractive leading lady, but i hated the way she was introduced by shooting a snakes head off, i thought it was more than a little distasteful. richard johnson makes a great villain and claudio cassinelli a likable hero. the fish-men themselves look a little fake when the camera lingers on them too long but their cool looking and i've seen worse. some of the miniature effects look a little poor too, but overall again i've again seen a lot worse. there's no real gore, violence or nudity in it, but that didn't really bother me actually. the photography by giancarlo ferrando and the production design by massimo antonello geleng combine to create a very nice looking film. period costumes, props and sets like rackham's house and ernest's lab with it's old scientific equipment. the lush green jungle settings also add to the visual splendour on show. i really liked this film and i was entertained throughout it's running time. i'm not sure who i'd recommend it too as it mixes various genres, i guess someone who maybe fancies something a little bit different and generally well made. if you can find a copy give it a go, i'm glad i did.

this movie is based on the novel island of dr. moreau by h.g. wells. it's a fairly good one too, it's at least better than the version by john frankenheimer.

1891: stalwart, morally upright military doctor lieutenant claude de ross (solid claudio cassinelli) and several other shipwreck survivors wash ashore on a remote tropical island that's governed with an iron fist by the ruthless and sadistic edmund rackham (superbly played to the deliciously slimy hilt by richard johnson), who lives on the island with the feisty amanda martin (a winningly spunky performance by the ravishing barbara bach) and her unhinged rogue biologist father professor ernest martin (a marvelously dotty portrayal by joseph cotten). moreover, de ross discovers that professor martin has control over a dangerous race of fishman beasts who are being exploited as slave labor by rackham. director/co-writer sergio martino relates the lively and absorbing story at a constant snappy pace, offers a flavorsome evocation of the lush and remote tropical setting, does an expert job of creating and maintaining a creepy and mysterious atmosphere in the spooky opening third, further spices things up with a nice line in dry humor, and stages the exhilarating action-loaded climax with considerable rip-roaring aplomb. while the central premise is obviously inspired by "the island of dr. moreau," the story nonetheless is given a great deal of freshness and intrigue because of martino's artful melding of such diverse elements as voodoo, the lost underwater city of atlantis, a rousing mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption, buried treasure, unscrupulous genetic experiments, and even some exciting rough'tumble fisticuffs between de ross and rackham during the thrilling conclusion into an altogether dynamic, imaginative, and often immensely entertaining whole. the sound acting by the sturdy cast qualifies as another substantial plus: cassinelli makes for a likable hero, johnson essays his juicy villain part with supremely lip-smacking aplomb, bach rates as a quite fetching damsel in distress, plus there are neat supporting contributions by beryl cunningham as sinister voodoo priestess shakira, franco iavarone as the superstitious jose, and roberto posse as surly troublemaker peter. giancarlo fernando's sumptuous widescreen cinematography delivers a wealth of striking visuals while luciano michelini's throbbing tribal score hits the funky spot. the amphibious humanoid fishman creatures are pretty gnarly-looking, too. an extremely fun flick.

watching this odd little adventure movie, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who brought us such high quality giallo classics as the strange vice of mrs wardh and the case of the scorpion's tail, but it has to be said that despite it's low quality production values, island of the fish men is an entertaining ride and one that surely deserves more praise than it's getting. like many italian films from the seventies, this is one is a rip off of a successful american film, the one in question this time being the critically panned island of dr moreau. sergio martino's film takes ideas such as mutation, greed and adventure and moulds it into one slightly compelling film, which makes up for what it's lacks in coherency and logic with a load of mostly intriguing ideas. the central plot follows a boat which crashes on a small island. it quickly becomes apparent that not everything about this place is normal, and it soon transpires that half of the population has been turned into "fish men" - a cross between a man and a fish, which exist for purely selfish reasons...the truth about this movie is that it's a lot more fun if you ignore the trashy production values. the central monsters look completely ridiculous, and much of the movie takes place on sets that look like they cost someone a few pennies - but the movie is well shot in spite of this, with the underwater photography being a particular highlight and the pacing of the movie is well done in that the film never becomes boring. the way that the plot comes together isn't exactly genius, but it takes in a lot of ideas and i've seen films made on plots with much less thought put into them than this one. the biggest location standout in the film is definitely the lost city of atlantis. to be honest, i'm not a massive fan of adventure movies, and therefore don't see this lost city get mentioned much - but it is always nice to see it in a movie. the central island location is good in that it provides an apt setting for the story and also provides the movie with the right amount of mystery, as martino makes good use of the voodoo theme. overall, this isn't exactly a classic and there are certainly a lot worse trashy adventure movies out there than this one.

lt. claude (claudio cassinelli) and several prisoners from his sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by edmond rackham (richard johnson). following a few random prisoner deaths, rackham takes in claude and his two remaining prisoners. luckily for everyone, barbara bach just happens to be on the island too! unluckily, there are some crazy fishmen who like to kill people.this italian produced exploiter seems to have it all - a touch of creature from the black lagoon mixed with dr. moreau with a dash of white zombie voodoo and atlantis stuff. despite some wonky looking fishmen costumes, the film does benefit from some beautiful location photography and a nice twist about halfway through. all of the actors are good and joseph cotton even pops up as a old biologist. director sergio martino handles himself well enough as there is action ever 10 minutes or so. that can't be said for his belated follow-up the fishmen and their queen (1995), easily one of the wackiest and most off-base sequels since highlander ii.

i saw this movie on television as screamers and loved it. i heard an interesting story about this film. when roger corman released it to drive-ins in the summer of 1981, his trailer department sent out an advance trailer which was not actually footage from the film. it was allegedly footage of a naked woman being chased around a laboratory set by a monster. during the film's opening at drive-in's, irate customers complained the did not see the movie they paid to see. theater owners called corman and said their customers felt ripped off. so corman had to run off copies of the footage, and send the positive film to theater owners to splice into the film themselves. since the footage was never part of the film negative, it has not appeared in any video, dvd or television broadcast. has anyone ever seen this footage? anyone who saw this film at a drive-in in the summer of 1981 remember this?

action packed,with my favorite type of creature.i won't give any of it away if you have'nt seen it,cause it's worth taking the time to sit down and unravel in the mystery of things as presented in this film.it did gets slow at times and those were the moments my mind wondered which does easily anyways but moist of it kept me quietly thrilled,where you keep it in your head instead of letting it out,probably the mood i was in at the time.special effects and action sequences you could feel made up for the occasional lulls.of course there'es a duschload of movies out there exactly like this,the film still has it's own style and flavor,which i respect from underground independent horror movies anyways.

although the video box for many copies of this film claims it is about people turned inside out, this is a total lie. in fact, apart from the opening segment, the film isn't even a horror movie. with its sunken treasure, legions of fish people, and mad scientists, it's a lot more like a doug mcclure adventure movie. obviously, this film is no work of art, but it's kind of fun to watch... just be warned that the beginning is quite gory.

when a group of escaped convicts manage to flee to a remote island,they soon find that their new home is inhabited by a strangely menacing doctor(richard johnson of "zombi 2" fame),a mad scientist(joseph cotten),his beautiful daughter(barbara bach)and a horde of superstitious natives.the tribesmen say that the doctor has created grotesque half-human,half-fish creatures for evil,secretive purposes.and though at first the prisoners do not believe this,as they disappear,one by one,they begin to change their minds."screamers" is a very entertaining mix of "mysterious island" and "humanoids from the deep".there is plenty of gore with really cool decapitation scene and throat tearing to boost.the acting is so-so,but the film is fast-paced and entertaining.give it a look.8 out of 10.

fans of euro-horror flicks - portland's video/dvd store movie madness has a whole section devoted to this genre - can't afford to miss sergio martino's gut-busting "l'isola degli uomini pesce" (called "screamers" in the united states). here's the lowdown: some shipwreck survivors land on an uncharted caribbean island in 1891. the island is inhabited by a landowner, a scientist (joseph cotten) and his daughter (barbara bach). sure enough, it turns out that the landowner is making the scientist create a race of fish-men. and while the fish-men remain calm as long as they can drink their potion, they get nasty otherwise.this movie is sort of a mixture of genres: euro-horror, swashbuckling, voodoo, and maybe a little bit of "the island of dr. moreau". but it's mostly an excuse to have the fish-men disembowel trespassers; ya gotta love that! i wouldn't be surprised if the euro-horror genre gave quentin tarantino some of his ideas for "grindhouse". after all, the european horror directors have no scruples about what they show. this is one that you're sure to like.so joseph cotten is the only cast member from an alfred hitchcock movie (i mean "shadow of a doubt") who later co-starred with ringo starr's soon-to-be wife and audrey hepburn's ex (by whom i mean mel ferrer) in an italian horror flick. the things that we see in life...

screamers is an italian fantasy film (l'isola degli uomini pesce) bought by roger corman and released through his new world pictures. of course corman has to carve his initials on it by having one of his lackeys (dan t. miller) direct some additional gore footage before he has it released in the states.l'isola degli uomini pesce is a very entertaining retelling of the island of dr. moreau. it is 1891 and claudio cassinelli is shipwrecked on a mysterious island with a few newly escaped convicts. claudio comes across the stellar barbara bach and richard johnson. johnson plays the dastardly edmund rackham: a man who is able to manipulate scientist joseph cotton into turning the local native population into amphibious deep-sea diving creatures, (they look like a cross between the black lagoon creature and one of the humanoids from the deep), by convincing cotton that the mutations are being created for the highest of scientific and humanitarian motives.having discovered the lost city of atlantis, rackham is using the amphibious creatures to loot its treasures. sexy barbara bach plays cotton's daughter who has a psychic link with these mutations. in one memorable scene, bach takes a midnight swim with these mutants wearing only a thin white cotton dress that leaves little to the imagination. claudio discovers one of the convicts he has befriended has been turned into a gill-creature and then all hell breaks loose.filmed at the same time and in the same location as zombi 2, richard johnson didn't even have to change suits between films. the house where the experiments take place is the same house johnson uses to conduct experiments in zombi 2. talk about economic filmmaking!the additional footage features a few bloody beheadings, (way to go roger!), and a laughably bad cameron mitchell doing his best pirate imitation. all that's missing is the parrot.spanish title: le continent des hommes poissons

this movie surprised me. the box is misleading, the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading. the movie is quite gory, well-acted and beautifully shot. the special-effects are top-notch and seem to be ahead of their time, until you realize this movie came out in 1979, not in 1963 like it's tone would suggest. it is a unique take on the dr. moreau story, and one of the better versions filmed. the first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking, but the film doesn't ever really fall apart. definitely worth-seeing if you are a fan of dramatic costume/horror classics and gore-fests.

i finally got a chance to settle in and compare the two versions of this film currently going around -- first, the good old scummy, sleazy embassy vhs print called screamers, and then a new fully restored italian dvd by everyone's new favorite media company, no shame of italy.the american adverts about "men turned inside out" is as everyone says, totally misleading, and indicative of a roger cormanized take on what otherwise would be a superior fantasy-adventure thriller for grown ups. the complete italian version is a somewhat sprawling, well designed and deliberately paced take on "island of dr. moreau", and there's nothing wrong with that. it's a sumptuous, handsome euro horror outing with a brain, good plotting, character development, location shooting, period costuming and sets, etc.but i must admit that the 14 year old knucklehead weed puffer still lurking somewhere inside of me got a bigger kick out of the more lurid, sleazy and unkempt roger corman version, which has some nice over the top gore, a flashy but preposterous opening segment, and then the bulk of martino's original film, albeit somewhat abridged to make room for roger's idea of entertainment. the pacing was somewhat quicker, the shock sequences closer together, and you see just as much of ms. bach's fantastic form as you do in the extended italian version.i still don't have much of an idea about what the specific story concerns though: there are a number of plot twists and incidental characters that were somewhat hard to keep track of. a local voodoo subplot didn't help much, and it's funny how everything culminates in just another fistfight between the noble castaway prisoner and the mad scientist ... perhaps a few more viewings are in order. i will say this: fans of the movie should avail themselves of one of these pal imports and take a look at what is actually a movie rather than just another murky old home video -- the widescreen shot compositions once again reveal that martino had an eye for filling his screen with interesting stuff. nobody gets their heads ripped off like in the screamers print, but it's still interesting stuff, and once again proof that while his standards may have been pretty much confined to the area around the gutter, roger corman new good trashy fun when he had it made for him, and side by side these are actually better movies than they had to be.7/10

"what alice found" is the greatest movie that nobody's ever heard of! i underestimated it when i heard of it, and i though that it would all sex, no plot, and just really stupid, but in reality, it was really good. they say all indie movies suck, but this one, and "napoleon dynamite" didn't suck. i asked my friend, who'd seen it before i did, and she said that alice has all these three-ways, and you see all this nudity, but no, there is no three-way that i remember, and little nudity. the movie did have a point, and it taught me never trust hitchhikers. i liked that in the end, they got alice a little dolphin in the end, on her way to flordia. i totally suggest seeing this movie.

fantastic film! wow - this is really a treat. i can't believe that i discovered such a gem of a movie. a pretty young girl traveling south to florida meets a friendly older couple with an rv, after she has a flat at a rest stop. however she learns that things aren't as they seem and the couple gets a bit creepy after she spends some time on the road with them.everyone in it was just so perfect for their parts you just about believe that you are watching this happen in real life in front of you.newcomer emily grace did a fantastic job as the really cute, yet somewhat shy alice. emily gives you the feeling that you can understand what she is experiencing and you can see just how she got into the situation that develops in the film. i'm sure we'll be seeing emily in more films in the future.contrary to what some others have said, the lighting and photography in this were just perfect. the editing was done well too - just the right way to put together images of the highway to give you the feeling that you are traveling along with the cast on their road trip.i didn't see it on the big screen, but i can only urge everyone to go out and see it. more films like this are *exactly* what we need.sf

i wasn't expecting a whole lot when i rented this film, as a lot of independent films seem to be a bit overrated these days (well, hollywood films too for that matter) but this movie was fantastic, really great, it's too bad it didn't reach a huge audience because it's just superb. i really love alice's determination, it really makes me look upon my life as a gift, and i see how privileged i am just to have an education. but all of that aside, this movie really proves that a good artist can tell a good story, no matter what the budget, it's an excellent film and everyone should watch it, they will love it and definitely learn something from it. i don't have to be roger ebert to know it's one of the best movies i've seen all year, and certainly one of the most truthful.

this is most likely the best picture not many will see. it presented a culture in a real unhollywoodized way. a must see for all who like indie and for those who don't. i think this movie will draw more into the indie scene. the acting was top notch! the character of alice was portreyed so well. with perfect akwardness. this movie ahould be brought to the mainstream! i think it would do phenominally! alice is the most real look at an element of our culture that i have seen since go ask alice. a look that is untouched by the hollywood hand. movies like this show young people that these things aren't glamorous but that they are real and compelling. if you liked pieces of april you will love this one!

at the story. it is reality mixed with americana- and very original.emily grace is a young girl tired of her boring life working at a minimum wage job, in new england. her sleazy boss propositions her- she quits and takes a little bit of cash from the register. driving from new hampshire to miami, florida, is not a short trip, and her ford escort dies out. she then meets a personable older couple, portrayed by judith ivey and bill raymond. they have an rv and graciously offer to help her out- it isn't safe for a girl to be alone on the road. especially i-95.emily grace is very realistic as alice, and initially lets the judith ivey character help her; buy her decent clothes, cosmetics, etc. at first it is a nice vacation for alice, who hopes to hook up with her girlfriend, who attends college in miami. there is interesting cinematography, as the trio drives the rv down to florida: the rest-stops, bland scenery and eventually beautiful mountains of north carolina.eventually there is something awry, and the ivey character apparently has fabricated stories about her daughter, as well as her husband, who now seems a bit sinister.i will not spoil the outcome of this film- but it ends positively as the audience waits in suspense- this film reminded me a bit of spielberg's "duel"- while it was initially not as menacing- the moral of the story is - you never know what people are thinking- especially if you are driving cross-country. beware!!. you will enjoy this film.

judith ivey as the scamming old whore is awesome. emily grace the young girl. is innocent and exciting as she learns whats going down. excellent direction and camera. story is dark and disturbing.supporting cast is good. shows what happens and can happen with a run of bad luck. great independent film. small cast. pace is slow at first and then moves good. a good movie to show your teen age daughter who has aspirations of leaving home early, for the open road and adventure. this movie, film has a low budget feel to it, but it works because of the low lifes and areas that these people move in. i will never stop a rest stop again with out thinking of this movie and checking my tires before i go.

i just saw this on cable. i liked it. it held my interest and the dramatic choices were good. the old couple were very good and good at being subtly creepy. the cinematography is not so great, but the shabby video also adds to the sense of realism, so its a trade-off, you know? at times the girl would hit the new england accent to hard. the accent would sort of come and go. anyway, i thought the film was well done overall, though. the storyline was strong and dramatic tension was held because you felt their was some subtle mystery going on, even though things seemed mundane. good job on a low budget. another good suny purchase filmmaker. way to go.

a great performance by emily grace! i stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious by the summary of the plot giving by my satellite service provider. i was high entertained and had much compassion for the character "alice" played by emily grace. the story had me guessing in what would happen to alice and was not predicable. the overall story was refreshing and had some great twists to the supporting characters. the ending of the story ended on a rather fair way. i will purchase this dvd to add to my library. i am a new fan of emily grace and i high anticipate in seeing more from her performances.

everything about "choose connor" was top=drawer, especially the script and the very proficient work done by the 21-year-old director, writer, producer luke eberl . . . a talented young man from whom to expect great things. all the acting was credible, the dialogue smart, the theme important. loved it!!!saw it at the 2007 woodstock film festival, where it was screened twice and went over tremendously with the audiences. it's more than just a coming of age movie -- this kid learns a hard, heartbreaking lesson about trust, politics and "the system" -- how things really work to suit the personal agendas of those in powerful positions.i would recommend this movie to anyone with a working brain.

if there are people that don't like this movie, i don't think they are human. this film deploys all emotions and shows many sides of judith light's character. made in 1997, this is one of the best movies i have seen and really the film that judith light has starred in to make me a huge fan of hers. this movie, although sometimes you want to rattle the son for trusting her so much, is incredibly moving. i cry at the end every time and it takes much to do that to me! the plot doesn't have much to it but the acting provided by judith light is incredible. she looks beautiful the whole time and by the end, you don't want the fate imposed by the courts to happen to her. overall, a movie worth my highest praise! thank you for making it and redefining my view on the death penalty. i eagerly await this movie to come out on dvd or some other form of media since lifetime is starting to issue some movies to customers. although i don't have high hopes for this one because this took place almost 9 years ago, which is still hard to believe, since this movie is still ingrained into my head after all this time.

an incredible performance! this is one of the best films i have seen ever. i know this is being said a lot, but i bet you will not regret watching this film.it's great from the very beginning to the last second. the acting (of especially the mother - played by judith light) is so convincing, there are not many other films i've seen that could compare to it, and it seems it's impossible not to feel anything for the people in this drama.there are lots and lots of movies made every year, but if you have to choose just to see a few in your life - make this one of them.

when i first saw this movie back in the middle of january (2005) i didn't like it. i thought it was too weird and thought that some parts that the main star, judith light, acted were so unlike her. (which of course is true) and then i watched bits of it the next day when it re-aired and i felt pretty much the same. then i watched it again two sundays ago (march 20th, 2005) and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing. i even cried the first 2 times, but mainly because the actress was actually crying and i am a big fan of hers.it is a very well acted and done tv movie. judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film! i keep watching it over and over. it's a sad movie, but very good.if you have not seen this movie, i definitely recommend it! it's not usually my type of movie, but i did enjoy this one! a+++

the movie was certainly true to the real life story on which it was based. it was hard for me to find newspaper articles about the actual facts, but when i located them, i could see that truth, in this case, was stranger than fiction. judith light was frighteningly evil in her role as the mother in this movie, so much so that it was difficult to separate her from the role, the mark i think of an excellent performance. rick schroder was appropriately clueless as her son who also defended her in court, an example of how hard it can be in some circumstances for a child to accept the actions of a parent, no matter how criminal they may be. one can find fault with the movie, but not with its treatment of the reality on which it was based.

a story of love between two people at the end of wwii. beautifully filmed, very romantic and yet rather fatalistic fable of budding love and war that would not end. if you want happy endings don't watch wajda movies, sweety.

there is one of the best movies directed by andrzej wajda,that story told about young writer who is seekin' his place after a second war(he's survive german camp).excellent true atmosphere(action goes in camp for displaced placed),main hero(played by one of the best polish actor daniel olbrychski) finally fall in love ,but unfortunately his lady has been killed .there was beautiful scene,when he is talking with american soldier and says (about death his girl)"nothing is happen,simply you're shootin' to us now... he's condition of soul has been destroyed. 10/10

krajobraz po bitwie like many films of wajda is, perhaps, not understandable for the "rest of the world". story based on the few short stories of tadeusz borowski, who during wwii was the prisoner of oswiecim, dachau and dautmergen camps. borowski in his books describes inhuman life in the nazi camps from the point of view vorarbeiter tadek - porte parole of author who also was on the privileged position among the prisoners. borowski was merciless for the humanity and merciless for himself. he describes the human history as the endless chain of exploitation and humiliation. ironically, after the returning to poland he stopped writing artistic prose and became communistic propagandist, producing stream of anti-imperialistic and anti-american press publications. after few years he committed suicide. in the movie wajda changes point of view. vorarbeiter tadek - character created by the tadeusz janczar - plays only supporting role. story is focused on the poet, destroyed, burned out by the war and imprisonement and his one-day love affair with nina, jewish girl who escaped from communistic poland although she actually hates jewish life and mentality. as the background we can observe sad grotesque of so-called "dipis" (displaced persons) life, who after the liberation are settled by the americans in ss barracks. marches, patriotic kitsch mixed with hunting for the extra dose of food and/or prostituting german girls.

aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too fat, this film rings true on the chaos of the post-war.beautiful photography, and a powerful national expression of the polish national character.it's very slow at points, but its entire pacing is so different from american and western european films that it's quite refreshing.both lead actors do a very good job. on the dvd version, you can see interviews with the principal actors and crew, and the lead actress stanislawa celinska has gained about 50 lbs and lost all of her beauty. but in 1970, she was a stunner.

in landscape after the battle, andrzej wajda in the second era of his filmmaking career, depicts emotional and psychological confusion in a former nazi-prison in poland, freed immediately after the wwii.a hand-held camera explores a lot of extreme close-ups and vivid colors. the end credit as graffiti on flanks of freight train cars symbolically concludes the film. the soundtrack is great, except vivaldi, which sounds tacky in pop-art fashion, in the opening sequence.

"landscape after a battle" opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences - in rather funny movements accompanied by vivaldis four seasons. a touching opening. but we soon enough learn to know these prisoners as a mob, and when they (also treated humouristic) burry a man alive, the protagonist stops for a moment, but is soon more engaged in finding books from the turndowned camp than caring about his neighbour.the rest of the film is set in an american camp from where the prisoners are not released, in some kind of semi freedom, semi camp. a perfect set for a study of war criminality, american camps, polish nationalism, catholisism, grief and human misery in general.film makes an important turn. in comes women, and with them film changes light, colour and temper. at the same time it turns out that these prisoners were slaves in holocaust. i think a main underlying political theme of the film must mankind's treatments of jews under and after the world war, and not only the nazi exterminations, but mankind letting it happen - and even forcing them out of europe after the war. on an emotional level the film is about grief and the problem with letting grief come, how environment makes grief difficult, and how difficult it can be to share grief for people with different experiences. but the film is a carpet of underlying contradictions,humour, irony and sudden beauty. a couple of times during the film a gypsy prisoner plays on an harp, an emotional tune brutally rejected (filmatically speaking) by the protagonist. that example picks up an important essence of the film's style and theme. when it comes to humour its very comic how the protagonist constantly looses and finds back his glasses, in crowds, in hay stacks etc.its not hard to understand spielberg's respect of wajda when you see this film. the great treatment of light can be compared with spielberg on his best. the grunwald intermezzo speaks for itself. narrativly it only brings the film out of the camp, but filmatically it brings the film to dream and eternity with profound beauty. anyhow, there is also another scene i can't let go without comment. its the christian supper. undoubtly ironical, but simultaneously deeply religious we see the transsubstantiation moment, everybody falling on their knees, while the protagonist is saved from isolation by the priest to serve as a comic altar boy. his bells are mocking the scene, but also gives it emotion and love. when nina gets her bread, sun light falls upon her and bells ring spheric, its the peak moment of the film.main actors are excellent in their roles. olbrychski as the perfect wajda protagonist - the doubting reflecting mind, unable to put all the aspects of his mind and emotion into life. beautiful celinska is with great body acting debuting in a character unable to express all her inner in her proud movements.those who try to describe everything, often are unable to take nothing in consideration. this is what wajda manages. his films are either very moving, deep or beautifully shot, but pays attention to life's and society's particularity. a moment of joy for one, is the moment of irony for a second, the moment of grief for the third, a moment of nothing for the fourth.there is at least two reasons to pay attention to wajdas films of this period. first is the remarkable free expression of deep political impact. this country was the first to overthrow communism twenty years later. second is the development of a filmatic and narrative language that kusturica has rose to grandeur.

of course i am going to think it was a great movie. i recognized several people i didn't see during filming also. i was the one playing the guard about an hour into the movie in the death row exercise yard asking for a light for a cigarette. i also changed this one scene. they had originally had it set to go into the rec yard and straighten out the inmate and turn him around and walk him out. the director said "it is taking to long, what would you do gower." i said, "we need to go in and hook the arms and drag him out backwards. that way your camera can stay on his face as we take him off set." i also lived at this same prison as a young child as my father was the assistant warden of security. i am also a current employee with the tennessee deaprtment of corrections as a supervisor at the riverbend maximum security institution. even though a lot of the movie was a joke, the part i was in was reality enough. also in the bar scene the dancer kicking high in the air and leaving the stage was an actual stripper i use to work with at a club called "the classic cat".

andy mcdermott (tom everett scott) is a shy american teenager spending vacation in paris with his friends brad and chris. andy saves serafine pigot (the gorgeous julie delpy) from committing suicide in eiffel tour and has a crush on her. he does not know that she is a werewolf. they go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves. andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf. he is advised that the only way to become normal again is killing the werewolf that attacked him and eating its heart. this movie is a violent black humor movie. the special effects and the soundtrack are excellent, highlighting the song of the band bush. i do not know why some readers compares this movie with the masterpiece 'an american werewolf in london'. the stories have nothing in common (only an american teenager, werewolves and a city in europe). highly indicated for fans of werewolf and black humor movies. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "um lobisomem americano em paris" ("an american werewolf in paris")

is it full moon tonight? oh! it doesn't matter they can change whenever they want cuz of that drug! what was i thinking if its full moon tonight?! geezi really like this movie, there's romance, suspense, horror, and hot stuff ;) i like the first half of the movie when the guy saves the girl from killing herself by bungee jumping and catching her. that was really cool. the setting of this movie is in the city of love which is paris in france. the cemetery scenes are nice, it gives you chills not knowing what will happen there or who's behind the walls. the scenes that makes you jump out of your seat is really cool. even they got me on that scenes. his friend who died and the girl whom he killed in the cemetery but still shows themselves to the lead character(sorry i forgot his name), was really funny. the actors did a good job plus the make-up crews. the part when they're all partying in an abandoned church, i can't believe people would that because even though that's an abandoned church, that is still god's house. i bought this movie long time ago, and i do not regret buying it. i'm a horror-movie-lover. i give this movie 5 stars out of 6. for the people who are open and loves movies like this, give it a try, you might like it.

this movie is not as bad as some say it is infact i think it`s more enjoyable than the original . maybe that`s why some people hate it as much cos they dont want to admit it`s a good (not great) movie.most if not all fx were done by c.g.i which i didn`t mind at all cos it was an enjoyable movie. phil buckman - (chris) was in my opinion the best guy in the movie julie delpy was rather attractive she brought the sexiness to the movie.there were a lot of wisecracks in the movie which i thought were good. this movie is in my collection but the original is not because i dont like it as much as this one. i was not bored when i watched this movie it kept me watching unlike some horror movies i could mention like oh say = driller killer & suspiria (dario argento`s movie) thats to name but two.this is an ok werewolf film it should be in people`s collection if they like werewolf movies maybe i`ll get the original at some point maybe. i have only one complaint and that is phil buckman - (chris) should have been in it more than he was but apart from that the movie was fine.rating for this movie 8/10 an ok werewolf movie not the worst one out there.

i have never seen "american werewolf in london" but this movie was very entertaining. when renting it i thought it was a horror movie but it turned out to be more of a comedy with some horror aspects. i thought the transformation sequences were nicely done but effects wise, the best scenes were those where the effects and the lighting built off each other, nice. the transformations reminded me a lot of werewolf transformations in other movies, but the werewolves themselves are very beastly and not very dog like. gore: i do believe there is too much in this movie, which really takes away from the horror, when every frame has blood in it, taking the violence seriously is hard. j.hurst (8th grade)

ok, most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake, but at the same time it's also a different movie in its own right. don't get me wrong, 'american werewolf in london' is a superior film, but 'american remake in paris' is a decent movie as well.first off, the only real similarities are the title, 2 american backpackers, and werewolves. other than those 3 things, 'american remake in paris' stands apart fairly well on its own with its special blend of humor, action/adventure, and horror. most of the people who say this film is better than the original are the youth of today's generation that think any movie made before 1990 is total crap. while those of us who grew up in the 80's can appreciate older films and what they have added to the horror films of today. what a lot of people fail to realize is that without the old classic films, including the b&w ones, horror wouldn't be what it is today. now i'm getting a little off the beaten path...an american werewolf in paris is a good attempt at re-creating a classic, but it will never surpass the original, ever. with that said, this is still a very entertaining film to watch and i do recommend it. i'm giving it a 7 out of 10. maybe that's being a little generous, but i've seen much worse attempts at trying to re-create a classic.

i just finished a double feature night of an american werewolf in london & paris. let me start by saying "london" still holds up after all these years and the transformation sequence is by any standard quite impressive, the film was funny, and scary, also a bit of gore....now lets get to "paris" its enjoyable, a few scars, lots of gore not as exciting or eerie as original but it does have a few laughs in what has become quite the fashion these days in films so maybe in that sense it was ahead of it's time, the transformations al'a cgi while good for the technology of its time are nowhere near as impressive as the original. i gave this movie a 7 because i have to admit it was enjoyable, i laughed a lot and found tom everett scott to be so silly that at first i wanted to dislike his performance only to end up liking it...go figure...julie delpy was competent as was the direction it's the script that lacked a bit of shine & finesse. i read here that john landis was supposed to direct to bad he didn't i am quite sure it would have been a different movie altogether. i also noticed some discussion of a sequel "what if" well no one has noted the obvious it should be in american and here is my title "an american werewolf comes home" or in dc that would be fun all those political dogs need a good scare. you simply must see the original in it's new dvd transfer with dolby 5.1 sound and see both of these on an hdtv with upconvert turned on...nice!!!!

the title suggests that this movie is a sequel to "an american werewolf in london". none of the characters from the previous movie return and aren't even mentioned in this movie by name. so as a sequel, aawip fails, one would say.i dare to say the opposite.an american werewolf in paris is a charming, effective horror movie. it's one of the better werewolf films i have seen in a long time too. and i have seen quite my share, such as an american werewolf in london, the howling, wolfen, the wolfman and the underworld trilogy.the story tells of three americans visiting paris on a vacation. at the top of the eifel tower one of them saves a woman trying to commit suicide. what starts out as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that lurk in the city are revealed...i really liked the acting in this film. especially the two stars of the movie: the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her. they have good chemistry together. but the other two americans also play their roles nicely. i didn't really find anything annoying about the acting, so thumbs up for that! the effects on the werewolves are nice. it doesn't look too cheap or fake to me. of course, the opinions are divided about this subject. but let's just say that i wasn't disappointed.there's also a good amount of humor in this movie. there are some really funny scenes you will probably remember for a long time.so, to sum it up, an american werewolf in paris might not be a direct sequel to it's predecessor, but it's still an enjoyable movie. perfect for fans of werewolves! 7 out of 10 stars!

three american lads are backpacking their way around europe, challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and hot babe lays as they can, but andy seeks true love. he finds this during their bungee-jump attempt on the eiffel tower, when he comes across and breathtakingly saves a suicidal and heart-burstingly beautiful julie delpy. his attempts to find this girl and the secret he uncovers lead he and his friends into an fast paced adventure full of action, romance, gore, and inspired humor, without ever taking itself to seriously, or striving to be anything other than a wildly entertaining 90 minute ride. i have seen this film a number of times and found it a much more rewarding experience than the 'london' original, although both films are so different it is not fair to compare the two or even to consider this a sequel.

i have mixed emotions about this film, especially as it compares to its forerunner,"an american werewolf in london." that film had it's funny moments, it was still more of horror tale than anything else. this updated version, now set in paris, does not have that "edge" at all and simply isn't in the same class....but it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall it's still fun to watch. so, "werewolf purists" aside, most of whom think this film is pure garbage compared to the london version, i'll still give it decent marks since i don't care what others think. i liked it even though i agree "london" is better and i prefer that version, too. the first 30-40 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a "balloon" in a restaurant. it also introduces the lead female character, played by julie delpy. i don't see enough of this actress. she doesn't seem to make that many films, or least ones i hear about over here in america. this french actress has a face that is classic beauty, so the film got points for having her in it, and she looks great.when the horror starts, it can get scary and the special effects are good. i also liked the lack of profanity in this film, unlike the first one: no f-words and no lord's name in vain - amazing!however, there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me. the soundtrack is heavy metal which isn't appealing to a middle-aged guy like me, either. this film is geared a lot more toward 20-somethings, if that helps anyone.it's entertaining.....just don't expect it to live up to the first film.

to paraphrase thora birch: "i kind of like this movie. it's the exact opposite of everything i hate in a film".this obscure film was too low key and intelligent to get a theatrical release, any chance for success would have needed a costly promotional campaign. and a coming of age story where nothing spectacular happens - where instead the focus is on character development, has a limited target audience. whoever heard of a mature teen movie?but if you have an opportunity to see this or if you can part with a few bucks for the dvd, you could do a lot worse. "my teacher's wife" is nothing revolutionary but it has a lot going for it and holds up well to repeated viewings.jason london (as high school senior todd boomer) is the star and fits this character as well as his parts in "the man in the moon" and "dazed and confused". he is helped out by exceptional work from his supporting cast. tia carrere in the title role is a revelation (she can act) as todd's calculus tutor and love interest. christopher mcdonald as the teacher in a nice self-parodying performance. zak orth and alexondra lee as todd's best friends, and jeffrey tabor as his father. as someone commented earlier, this is a "mature" teen movie because the romantic relationships are universally unsuccessful-at least by traditional happy ending standards. even todd's parents are indifferent to each other, with his father panting after the title character and his mother (leslie lyles) literally on the telephone during her entire time on screen (a device that provides increasing comedy relief with each successive appearance). the london-carrere romance has unexpected charm and is far more believable than any other older woman storyline you are likely to find. but the real strength of the film is the evolving relationship of the three friends. there is no overwrought melodrama here, just three immature people who alternate between testing and trusting each other, subject to all the dynamics that three young people can bring to this kind of thing. they actually manage to pull off a "believable" three-person relationship, perhaps the first one in cinema history. then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

tia carrere was the reason i decided to watch this film, as neither the title, nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this film  which goes to show, me and everyone, that a dvd shouldn't be judged by it's cover.***spoilers*** the film felt like it was trundling along, not really going anywhere for the moment  the awkwardness of paul faber (zak orth) around girls being almost too embarrassing to watch, and the fringe on the otherwise attractive kirsten beck (as alexondra lee) being too school-girlish to watch. where those really fashionable in 1995?the relationship between vicky mueller (tia carrere) and todd boomer (jason london) was tantalising from the start of though! that first meeting across the lake  magical. what a beautiful coincidence they should meet again just as he has behaved like a complete moron ("boomer, with two o's as in moron") in front of alexondra. a shame really that we as the audience knew who vicky mueller really was. (well the title did give that away, wouldn't you think?)what really surprised me was the acting. especially in the scene where vicky gives todd a metal version of his alter ego (the dog character), in the little white jewellery box. the actors really managed to recreate that tingling sensation of a first kiss  point of no return for todd and vicky. a shame really that the film ends with focus on (after getting over todd's fathers harvard drive) his re-uniting with his friends. i could envision a whole new film  following vicky to new york  there must be a good art university there that todd could attend?!?nevertheless, a film that does just what we want hollywood to: entertain us for the duration of the film. did anyone else notice how none of the loves are happy ones in this film? todd's mother is slightly insane (on the phone 24/7), his dad doesn't find her attractive (any more?) todd's teacher obviously is disenchanted by his wife and vice versa  todd himself enters into a wonderfully erotic & daring relationship which, however nice it may be, would realistically be very difficult to maintain (age difference, maturity difference etc), and alexondra & zak do not get together because alexondra is not mature enough to handle a relationship (-> her reactions towards the condom, the cheating, zak's advances etc. are all very immature, and often involve running away), and zak himself, the poor guy  is too much of a best friend/like a brother-guy to pull even alexondra.mind you, good film though! i gave it an 8/10. brilliant performance by the actors - who bring the script to life.

as talk-shows go, larry king live is not bad, and since he occasionally gets good guests, it's a show to turn on once in awhile, but not compulsively. when bill maher, carl bernstein, a former president, or other substantive guests sit across from him, it's not too bad. other times, he tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal which contributes absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and tv stars. during the oj simpson trial, it seemed like every other guest on his show was related to the case. but is this really journalism? or the national enquirer on the tube? sometimes, it comes off a little bit like trash television--jerry springer in a sit down interview with phone calls instead of a live audience.on the other side, king's show is definitely much better than bill o'reilly whose show is nothing more than a rightest-political platform of the rush limbaugh variety. that said, larry king is not a bad interviewer, but alas, he is not a great one. king does not always come off like he completely comprehends when intellectual material is being presented, especially if it is by a scholar or historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics. always seems like the minute king can't quite deal with the issue at hand, that's when he turns to the phone calls, maybe hoping someone out in the country will have a better question than he has. he might interview someone like david gergen, but may not have read any of his books. sort of like the movie producer that never bothers to read the script.when it's an entertainment celebrity, no problem. he can come off like he's thoroughly knowledgeable since the material is not that substantive anyway. talking to elizabeth taylor about her relationship with richard burton is not exactly rocket science. and i notice he usually has seen the star's latest movie. watching a movie takes much less time and contemplation than reading a book. however, if it's the likes of john dean or bob woodward, king comes off a little like he didn't quite finish his homework. so off to the phones.if you are looking for real in-depth interviewing, terry gross of npr is probably the best interviewer in the united states. she reads and/or researches everything written by or about her guests beforehand and has a working knowledge of those areas. i don't see king quite doing that. granted, he probably has an audience 1000 times larger than terry gross, which may say more about the american audience than king. in short, larry is better than bill but not as good as terry.

i've been a fan of larry king's show for awhile, i think he does a terrific job overall and i don't think he ever 'wusses' out, as so many people seem to believe. he's a subtle scorpio, he gets his zings in when he needs to, just as he managed to do last night with paris hilton, during her first post-jail tv interview.the thing about this entire case that has really amazed me is that hilton is still apparently clueless about why judge sauer gave her what she believes was a too-harsh sentence (and what's more, actually made her serve it) . in all the time she was in jail, supposedly alone 23 hours a day in her cell, she never once, in her mind, rewound the events which led to her being given the sentence that judge sauer saw fit to impose on her. she never once realized that it just might have set off a major red flag when she (1) showed up late in court for the original hearing and (2) proceeded to inform him, when he asked her did she not know that her license had been suspended, did she not get the papers in the mail, that "i have people who read that sort of thing for me." all the time she was in her cell, she never came to the realization that this action (showing up late) and that statement -- and more importantly, the attitude - the utter cavalier disregard for the court system and the law in general and her driving privileges in particular that she displayed -- just might have made judge sauer (pardon the pun) go sour on her. last night, on king's show, after giving lip service to how she has been changed forever by her traumatic experience, how she has "learned" her lesson, she answered his question, "do you think you got a raw deal?" with a resounding yes. and during the course of the conversation (if you can call it that), she said more than once that she did not feel she deserved what had happened to her. king asked, gently, more than once, if she does not feel she creates the situations in her life that she "finds" herself in, to which she pretty much stared at him blankly. she basically, therefore, holds the conscious belief that she's been victimized in this situation; she does not understand how she herself caused it, that day in court, by her cavalier attitude with the judge. i feel this is very sad - tragic, even, considering what a huge "role model" hilton is to some people, and it renders anything she said last night about her so-called rehabilitated state into the realms of complete and utter cluelessness, contradiction and hypocrisy. during the course of the interview, hilton alluded to spending a lot of time in her cell reading the bible. at the end of the interview, king scored major points by asking her what her favorite bible passage was. she responded by groping perplexedly at her pathetic notes (completely superficial non-insights, which she had read on air as if she were nelson mandella or something) and finally grunting out, "i don't have a favorite passage." judge sauer, in my book, is a hero, and after last night, so is larry king, for subtly exposing hilton for what she truly is.

this is a very modest, very lovely movie with a great score by hoagy carmichael and frank loesser with a standout number, we're the couple in the castle, that is totally evocative of the period and harks back to penthouse serenade just as the opening premise (hoppity's coming) may well have inspired fred saidy and yip harburg's opening (woody's coming) in finian's rainbow six years later. i totally agree with those posters who have noted that were the name disney appended to this it would by now have achieved 'classic' status rather than have fallen into neglect. it's wonderfully inventive, never more so than when objects barely noticed in the 'real' world assume a much greater significance - both pro and con - in the insect world. actually it is a classic, albeit a minor one.

while disney have been the animation studio for the past 70 years, there have always been rivals to their supremacy. when this review was written in 2009, for example, companies like dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) warner brothers and ardman, were bringing out animated movies that could be said to challenge the disney dominance. back in the beginning, in that late '30s and early '40s heyday when disney was serving cinematic banquets like snow white, dumbo and fantasia, the competition was provided by brothers dave and max fleischer. despite releasing two very commendable films, they never quite cornered the market  many attribute their downfall to the commercial failure of mr bug goes to town, released the same week as the attack on pearl harbour (which gave the american public something more significant to think about than going to the cinema to watch a cartoon!) that this film has faded into relative obscurity is a travesty.in a patch of overgrown garden in the city a bunch of bugs are in dire danger. humans use the land as a shortcut, discarding litter and cigars, and other hazards, right on top of the bugs' homes as they go. honey-shop owner mr bumble (voiced by jack mercer) fears that the future is bleak, and wonders how he will ever be able to raise his daughter honey (voiced by pauline loth) in more secure surroundings. a highly unscrupulous creature, bagley c. beetle (voiced by tedd pierce), offers to provide her a safer place to live if she will accept his hand in marriage, but honey is much more interested in her childhood sweetheart, the perennially cheerful and optimistic hoppity (voiced by stan freed). hoppity believes that everything is about to be resolved for the better, but is left looking foolish when bagley beetle and his pair of comical sidekicks manipulate the crisis to their own devious end. only at the very end, as their patch becomes the foundation for a huge new skyscraper, do the bugs switch loyalty back to hoppity as they look to him to lead them a new, safe home away from the destructive influence of humans.what really works in this film is the delightful characterisation  all the bugs are cleverly developed and designed for maximum audience appeal. the bumbling villains swat the fly and smack the mosquito (hilarious names, if you stop to think about it) are particularly memorable. equally admirable is the storytelling drive  even the youngest of children can enjoy this story, while at the same time it skillfully conveys a message for older audiences about the way human carelessness can impact upon the survival of wildlife. time has inevitably dated some aspects of the film, and when viewing it the audience needs to accept (and forgive) these occasional signs of general age and wear. but on the whole mr bug goes to town is an accomplished, funny and very slickly presented animation with a worthy message to boot.

wow. i saw this movie and "up" on the same day within an hour of each other at different theaters. i saw "mr bug" first, and was then totally disappointed in "up"'s follow-up. what a beautiful and touching film! movies of the 1930s and 40s to us nowadays can be irking with their melodramatic acting and dialog, but as animation the same melodrama and groaning humor can be wonderful. and the soft "organic" lines of 30s drawing and the music just puts you in a nice comfortable mood and you can enjoy the show with all its little characters: ladybugs, grasshoppers, bees, snails, stinkbugs, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, crickets, and more each with all their own cute little (but not overbearing) idiosyncrasies. the interaction with the human world, from nemesis (cigar smokers, high-heel wearers, innocent kick-the-can playing kids) to the kind-hearted, and to the unknown destroyers, is realistic and fascinating. you care for the bugs, and dick and mary. the protagonist hoppity is not some perfect superman who comes to "set things right" but a starry-eyed optimist who leads everyone down the garden path (literally!), and every time you think it's going to end happily in 1930s style, along comes another roadblock...! i was on the edge of my seat much more than with "up." i walked out of the movie theater grinning and chuckling: something that hasn't happened in a long long long long time!

"ideas are dangerous." comment by one interviewee.dvd rating: b+ / 4 out of 5 / 8 out of 10 / worth the time.a great story for adults / or teen boaters but not for children. none of the stupid violent crime stuff so often mistaken by hollywood these days as "quality work." and, it can be used as a trainer film on what proper boating preparation is all about, or not about, prior to "sailing the seven seas." the movie starts out somewhat slowly to develop the story as most documentaries do, but as it draws the viewer into the saga, emotions begin to percolate in one's head! emotions include anger, sadness, and disbelief. the era: late 1960's.that solo sailing around the globe is dangerous is not surprising. what is surprising is all the twists that viewers wouldn't expect. its not your average group of guys in a sailing race! each boat was different as allowed by the race rules. each solo sailor had different levels of ability as allowed by the race rules. there were well known sailors among them and a few not so well known. one was considered a mystery man as nobody seemed to have any knowledge of his ability at all. each boat was allowed to depart at will so long as all were underway by a certain date. and this was, of course, prior to modern electronics that allow boaters to communicate with shore about vicious storms, etc.actual video and audio recordings are interspersed with interviews of family members and others involved. the mood of the interviewees is always somber despite the years that have passed.the main character, don, is the focus of attention & how his journey relates to those who he not only wanted to beat but, due to circumstances of his own creation, had to beat. he had to win. the story was about what that circumstance did to his life as he moved south west across the atlantic ocean over a years time alone on the water.do not fail to view the "special features" section of the dvd once the film is finished. the entire saga isn't fully understood w/o viewing the 'bonus' stuff.in the end, once you've watched everything on the dvd, you will likely just shake your head and exclaim, 'wow.' and keep in mind, that is why the story has remained alive for the last 40 years.spoiler: do not fail to view the "special features" section of the dvd once the film is finished. one sailor who was headed back to england after circumnavigating the globe decided on the fly that, no, he was going for another spin and the film records his spouse's opinions about that decision. the opposite story unfolds as another sailor wishes the race allowed two on board so he could take his wife along and their photos demonstrate a very warm union between them. the interview with an burley ex paratrooper who had actually rowed a boat across the atlantic with a friend prior to the solo sail race was incredibly funny as he described not even knowing how to sail and who thought the bad things happening to him were 'normal.' too many people think that setting sail in the open sea can be an romantic adventure without mishap. don't you be one!

note: this should probably be read only after watching the film.it is very rare to find a documentary or movie that focuses on the loser. deep water does just this, making it one of the most thought provoking films in a very long time. it does not provide us with a hero to look up to, but rather an anti-hero who forces us to look into ourselves.the film is about a group of men who attempt to sail around the globe, singlehandedly, and without stopping. only one makes it, several die, one decides not to return home, each of them on a psychological journey intriguing enough to merit entire films for themselves. yet the most interesting is donald crowhurst, or rather the way that he is portrayed by the filmmakers and our reactions to him as viewers.by any standards this man should be considered a despicable character, yet why is he depicted so heroically? why are we so sympathetic to him? from the beginning he made all of the wrong choices. he risked his family financially to get the boat, he left at a more dangerous time to get more publicity, he ignored all of the warnings despite his lack of experience, he chose to lie instead of admitting defeat, these choices snowball until the inevitable and final one: suicide. all for what? a place in history? a feeling of accomplishment? perhaps. what is important to consider is whether this mans situation was inevitable.each individual must ask himself if his natural human drive for fame and accomplishment would bring him to such recklessness, and i believe that examining your own reaction to crowhurst's story will offer at least some answer to that question.

i happened upon this by chance. i was at my friends house and he had just started watching it, so i sat down thinking we would shoot the breeze whilst this was playing in the background. however, within seconds i was immersed in this docu-drama, and we both spent the rest of the time completely focused on this and not saying a word to each other. i never knew the tale of the the first solo around the world yacht race, let alone the tragic events of one man's attempt against the odds, which set out to be his redemption for all of his misfortunes in life, but ultimately ends up becoming an example of them. having not known of the story, i did watch this with the same fervor as i imagine those who were reading about the race at the time it actually was happening, engulfed in what was taking place and eager for more information, hoping the lone amateur was going to pull it off against the odds and beat the pro's, which makes the shocking twists of the story all the more tragic, i felt like i was living the story.the story is told with great care, and the interviewees have clearly had time to reflect on the tragedy, which gives great insights, but is also contrasted nicely by the archive footage of interviews at the time of the tragedy, the recordings and photographs of the lone sailors is also excellently used, and the insights into the minds of the sailors and how solitude was affecting them was superb.i'm shocked that this story isn't more widely known or has been turned into a movie, but also thankful. thankful that we have this drama-documentary to tell the tale from those who knew the man, instead of some wishy-washy movie adaptation, and thankful that i caught this gem of a film by pure chance. it's a must see, whether you like documentaries or not.

river's edge is an extremely disturbing film written by acclaimed american screen writer neal jimenez.it is based on an actual event which happened at a time when most of american youngsters were trying to make sense of their lives.this is one of the most outstanding films made by american director tim hunter.much of film's attention is focused on a reckless murder committed by a feckless teenager.this unfortunate event sets in motion a whole range of questions about real motivations of youngsters in american society.those who saw this film during its initial release must have had vivid memories of great actor dennis hopper in a confused role as a sympathetic social outcast. matrix star keanu reeves also looks good as one of the teenagers before he reached star status.at a time when teen flicks are made without any kind of serious preparation,it is hoped that "river's edge" cannot simply be ignored as just another silly teen flick.it had massive impact on people who lived during turbulent times of the past when being an inhabitant of a sleepy town was akin to not having being born.for today's generation with their heady overdoses of internet props such as facebook,twitter and orkut,river's edge might appear to be outdated but its importance cannot be denied by any serious film admirer.

although i was hoping that i'd like it a little more, this was still certainly an impressive film. there were great performances by all the leads, and the story, while not what i'd call chilling, was still effective and it kept me interested. for me, the best part of this film was the look of the picture, for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well. i also thought that the low budget suited this movie, for i don't think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim. all things considered, it fell a little short of my expectations, but i'm still very glad that i finally sat down to watch this movie.

i finally saw this on video, after years of hearing about it. it is by no means a perfect movie, but it is oddly hypnotic - one of those rare, special films that creates its own world. ***spoilers*** first, the bad stuff. the scenes in burkewaite's class are excruciating. even if the subject is social studies, this guy is way over the top. his speeches are so overwrought they are laughable. and no teachers i ever had would grill their students like that, and tell the ones who protest to "shut up!". these scenes are brief, but they break the mood and pull the viewer out of the story. next, how the heck does layne just walk out of the police station near the end? also, what happened to samson's car after the first scene of him riding into town? he spends the rest of the film being chaffeured around by layne or feck. ***end spoilers*** ahhh, feck...this guy is great. dennis hopper effortlessly steals the movie. "check's in the mail", "i love company", "you're my friend" - every line is a classic. he gives feck an internal logic that makes the story work. incredibly, he actually makes the audience feel empathy for this guy, especially when samson talks about his (samson's) future.  by contrast, crispin glover is hard to take sometimes. yet the scenes of him driving around in the beetle are perfect - kids with cars in high school always have something to do, and buds to do it with. matt's low-key attitude makes a good foil for layne - their friendship is believable. glover's mannerisms are a little much, but he is consistent throughout. he drives the plot and exudes a sense of urgency that no one else does - just try to imagine this flick if layne were as much of a zombie as matt or samson - snoozefest! ***spoilers*** what makes "river's edge" unsettling is the fact that samson is not really evil, in the usual sense. he is kind of a boring guy who got sick of being taken for granted - in other words, he is like thousands of other boring guys. after he kills jamie, he starts to unravel, which creates some suspense as we wait to see when he will snap again. ***end spoilers***part of this movie's appeal is the way the action stays centered around the teens and their point of view. the parents are comic relief - clarissa's mom, tony's dad - or overwhelmed - matt's mom. this underlines how the kids hang together for the attention no one else gives them. it keeps the story focused on the relationships within the clique, and emphasizes that the only adult they can relate to is feck. "river's edge" is a textbook on alienation. it conveys how awkward, mysterious, and disconcerting adolescence is like no other film.

this film is so 1980's and that is what i like so much about it. it does an excellent job of conveying the feel of that odd decade. the reality that russian nukes could wipe you out at any time. reagan in the white house telling everybody that things were great, while more and more social programs were slashed. young people dropped out, but not as far as their parents of the 1960's did. young people still went to school, they just smoked so much dope that their sensetivities were all but dead. nothing effected them, not even the death of one of their classmates at the hands of one of their friends. how weird is it to realize that the murder was wrong, but you are not sure why. watching the characters deal with the crime is fascinating and telling of a very sick society. glover is great, keanu is great, hopper is incredible. one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen.

i didn't expect much from this movie, it was just one of those movies i thought i'd just watch because it was on television. i certainly underestimated this movie. it's about a guy who kills his girlfriend and brags to his friends. i was very happy with the acting, they had the characters played well. it was a particularly great scene when feck(dennis hopper) and john(daniel roebuck) are talking to each other about why john killed jamie. it's upsetting to hear how he explains that he wanted to feel control and thats why. but feck had loved the girl he had killed. feck felt remorse while john felt nothing, hell he was proud of what he'd done. it really makes you think about people. keanu reeves did a great job as matt, and ione skye was good. it's weird to see her as a valedictorian in 'say anything' and her as clarissa. every actor did great at .....acting. it was real nice for a change. it was a great movie and i would definitely say i recommend it.

warning - possible spoilers!'rock star' is one of the solid rock movies i have ever seen. the original idea of the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s, leading a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period. he is not only playing their music to the note, but also living the life of his idols. when his friends in the tribute band expel him, in search of some originality, the destiny plays him a good turn, and gets hired to replace the lead singer of the idols band. a dream came true? well, almost. while starting to live the life of the famous, including the drug and sex excesses of the rock scene of the 80s, he will also have to face the problems in relationship with his supportive girlfriend, and will be eventually need to answer questions about creativity and having a saying in the music of the band.i liked the film, one of the reasons being that it is one of the first times that the life and music of the hard metal rock bands is shown in a realistic manner. fans of the music genre will be satisfied by the soundtrack. the overall idea is original, and the issues of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are being rendered in a sensible and balanced manner. acting is quite good, with mark wahlberg better than in most of the other action flics i saw him lately, and jennifer aniston in tune with the nice-girl-who-knows-a-lot-about-life role. more problematic is the ending, which is quite conventional, and may disappoint. it looks like the main character after quiting the big and famous band has found his own creative path. however, in an ironical twist the music he is playing in the club at the end is the worst in the whole movie! 8/10 on my personal scale. worth seeing - however, expect exposure to a high dose of metal. if you do not like this kind of music, you may chose to avoid this film.

what to say about a movie like rock star? a lot actually! this is the type of movie that is almost tailer made for the critics to slam. it is also a movie i, as a major hard rock fan enjoyed-no-loved actually-while all the while being very consciously aware of its many flaws and that the movie, while a decent effort in some respects missed the chance it had to escape into greatness and become a rock movie classic. oh well....i loved this movie-and would see it again and again-but i know that's purely based on my own personal tastes-rock star is a movie that will appeal to anyone who has experienced elements of the rock or hard rock lifestyle and wants to go down the road to nostalgia. it was a great time for metal heads. and it's nice to have a movie that effectively captures that(long forgot by many non-rock fans.) time effectively, as i think that rock star has done. that is one of the film's strengths, the concert footage. you will feel like your right there with them and how could any hard rock fan not love that? as far as setting the atmosphere rock star gets a 10 of 10. it also gets a 10 of 10 for pure entertainment. if you want a movie to just let yourself go and free flow into some great memories of good times past, then this is the movie for you. it is also the reason why i loved this movie so.but it isn't a great movie. i understand that and were it my actual job to review movies professionally, i'd probably have to be a bit hard on this one. the problem with rock star is the character development.what is wrong with the character development is this, there isn't any. none. the movie has certain scenes-few and far between but they are there-that do touch on greatness:warning brief scene spoilers: 3 examples- 1)when izzy makes his debut on stage(including the fall he takes)2)the first "after show" party with emily(anniston and izzy.)3)backtracking a little-in the beginning when the original lead singer is casually dismissed(fired)-the whole "business as usual" tone sets the stage for what's to come. it's played very effectively.but the problem is, nothing ever does come. there is little to no character development of anyone in this movie, peoples' persona's are merely touched on, but never fully explored. i don't think that's the fault of the actors/actresses,particularly anniston who tries hard, they just are not given much to work with. it's just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the "formula" feel into true movie depth. rock star was so sugarcoated at times(including towards the end) it was almost ridiculous. and , though, those scenes i mentioned were outstanding and very believable, sadly much else in the movie wasn't.another reviewer mentioned the lack of buildup towards the end and i agree but there was actually a lack of buildup about anything. why does izzy leave at the end? because he misses his girlfriend and the band won't let him write songs? it tests the limits of believability. and, frankly the end was just corny. made no sense and had no reality to it at all.watching this, it's almost like watching a movie where the makers of it said: ok, this happens here and then this happens and then this etc etc etc. by the end it's no longer a movie about a boy who's dream came true, it's just another thickly formulated love story. and you wonder why so much detail is left out....i hope i'm not being to hard on rock star because i truly loved it-but not for the right reasons. i would have liked to love this as a great movie about the highs and lows of rock fame. instead i loved it for it's 80's period feel, the clothes, the hair, the lights, the life.... although many others loved it to, i suspect most are people who lived the life of a rock fan, like i did or some who play. i'd have liked to see the movie cross over and just be respected for being a good, well told movie, instead of a cliché. i think, one of the problems was the length. i myself, hate over long films but this was one that really should have been longer, if a movie is done really right, the length is not even felt-there is just to much to the story for it to be as short as it was-that's one reason why there doesn't seem to be much development of either the story or the human beings portrayed in the movie.so-to wind down-this is a movie you can greatly get into- but not a great movie. see it for fun. see it for entertainment. see it to go back to that great, great space in time when metal wasn't just a part of life, it was life-and for those non rock fans-see it to get a little glimpse into a life that meant and still means so much to so many of us.

mark walhberg in a great role, idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs, imitating him to perfection, and dressing like him. when the opportunity comes for him to take over his "idol's" role in the band, he jumps at the opportunity. however the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be... and relationships can change .... this movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it. overall a really good movie with great performances from all the cast as well as the two leads, mark walhberg and jennifer aniston. it did make me feel sad, especially when emily, (jennifer aniston), met up with chris in seattle and saw the depths to what he had sunk. if anybody ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle, although glamourous for a while, is very lonely and ultimately not what you may want.

if you like the 80's rock, you should definitely see this movie! i've only seen it recently and completely fell in love with it!overall, the movie is very entertaining, provides you with a great load of rock tunes and not a single second of the movie do i find boring! it was a great idea that some of the real-life musicians were in this, doing what they do best. i was happy to see zakk, as well as blas elias, they all delivered solid performances. i tend to agree with a lot of people saying that the first half of the movie was much better than the second one, specially in the terms of the script.that could have been worked on a bit better, but not a major biggie. one thing that did bother me a bit was jennifer aniston's performance. i thought she wasn't the right person for this role,i just couldn't see her as a rock star girlfriend.but as the movie goes on, you somehow realize that she did a good job with this.there is a certain amount of honesty and sincerity she delivers that just doesn't live you cold. to summarize, a good and a funny movie, that doesn't go deep into characters but provides you with a good fun, a sense of nostalgia and of course the mighty vocals by jeff scott soto and mike matijevic!

for those of you who've wondered what an art-house monster movie might be like, wonder no more. the daimajin trilogy, circa 1966, was just such a series. more period samurai epics than anything else, these three movies just also happen to feature one of the most (literally) monstrous deux et machinas ever. there's not a single facet of these gems that is unpolished, from the scenario(s) to the performances to the filmmaker's craftsmanship. even the special effects are handled with well-above-average skill, and are integrated (in most instances) almost seamlessly into the movie(s). if you're a gojira fan or a fan of samurai movies or one of us who just likes a good movie regardless of genre, i highly recommend the daimajin trilogy.

ruthless evil warlord samanosuke (superbly played to the hateful hilt by yutaro gomi) cruelly mistreats the peaceful residents of a small village. the giant stone statue majin eventually comes to life to destroy samanosuke and his wicked minions. director kimiyoshi yasudo and screenwriter tetsuro yoshida give the compelling story all the power and simplicity of an ancient age-old legendary folktale: there's a very strong sense of an ancient time and faraway remote place (it's specifically set in feudal japan), the good guys are noble and appealing while the villains are truly nasty and detestable, the occasional stirring swordfights are staged with considerable skill and gusto, the special effects are fine and impressive, the serious tone and steady pace never falter for a minute, and majin's last reel rampage of savage destruction is extremely lively, exciting, and more than a little scary. moreover, the fantastic elements of the narrative are given substantial credibility by being firmly grounded in a throughly believable dark, harsh and gritty world. this film earns bonus points for depicting majin as more of a brutal and frightening force of angry vengeance instead of a pure spirit of absolute good. veteran composer akira ifukube supplies a typically rich, robust and rousing score. fujio morita's sharp, moody cinematography likewise hits the bull's eye. the capable cast all give admirably sound and sincere performances, with especially praiseworthy work by jun fujimaki as the valiant, protective kogenta and tatsuo endo as mean henchman gunjuro. highly recommended.

with its rerelease by adv films, i've had a chance to watch "the giant majin" for the first time without the deep cuts and unkind words of a late night horror chiller theaters. guess what? it's a pretty damn good movie!the sets are authentic, the acting in subdued and believable, and the giant majin is stately, powerful, and unstopable. i loved the subtle fantasy touches (the enchanted wood, luck charm, etc), and the potrayal of the god as a little less than 'good'.this movie is begging for a remake in the new century!

this film is absolute cinematic genius. it has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance. the effects are nothing but stunning and the story will keep you hanging off your chair right the way through the movie. jack long plays the part of abbot white exceptionally well, he provides an immensely thrilling portrayal of absolute evil. if your a kung fu fan or just an action movie enthusiast this film is an excellent choice for anyone who is lucky enough to find a copy. for any big kung fu fans this movie provides a compelling insight into the world of shaolin. this film is definitely 10/10 quality and should be considered as one of the greatest eastern movies of all time.

i cannot understand why this 1971 hollywood production is currently only available through an australian video company,but such is the unfortunate obscurity of this peter sellers classic(leonard maltin's movie guide continues to grant it the same bomb review they gave it in the 1970's).with so many scene stealers on display,sellers comes through with what may perhaps be his most hilarious role.it all begins with his discovery of a patient who expired at 11:15am,but sellers argues that the corpse is still living due to the fact that the new day doesn't start until noon! the final straw for the beleaguered hospital commissioner comes in that very room,the do not disturb sign still on the door; once he exits the room(handkerchief holding his nose),there is a brief conversation with the doctor with him- doctor:"we can't save them all! that man was at least 85! commissioner: "how old was he when he died,63?" harold gould plays an inept surgeon who shuts his eyes when the knife digs in,richard lenz(whose "pompous ass" reporter in "the shootist" was booted in the rear by john wayne)plays the patient who exposes the fraud(he only came in for a chest x-ray,until they discovered he owns a house).also in the cast on screen(and supplying some excellent country-flavored music)is keith allison,former guitarist for paul revere and the raiders,who also worked with michael nesmith on a few monkees recordings(and co-wrote "auntie's municipal court" with nesmith on 1968's "the birds,the bees,and the monkees").alas,there is some missing footage from this print,including a topless sequence with uschi digard near the end,also a scene with actress kathleen freeman(who wants to use green stamps to finance her operation),who gets locked by sellers in his office,never to be seen again(in the uncut version,he returns to his office to find that she has written in large letters on the wall "unfair prick" ; his response? "you misspelled price!").

there's a good running bit about the price tag of a silk negligee. the bimbo in the office shows off the bargain she got for $22 (closeup of tag). later, mary astor finds the tag in the boss's bedroom (proof that bimbo slept with him). still later, mary astor is about to have an affair with ricardo cortez, looks at the price tag of her silk negligee ($14) and is reminded of how disgusted she was about the bimbo, as well as the fact that she's spent $8 less than the "most obvious" woman she's ever met. it sounds an obvious morality turn, but it was well done. the film would be stronger if robert ames' character had been played by a more powerful actor (he's too low-key for a self-made salesman and he spends most of the film with his face turned away from the camera), and if ricardo cortez had been given more to do than smile ironically. both male leads are bland and forgettable, and are hindered by the pancake male makeup so popular in this film's era. however, the mary astor character is interesting, appealing and believable. behind closed doors is well worth seeing.

i tivo'd this on turner classic just because it was pre-code and sounded interesting. when i got around to watching, i noticed that the "critique" gave it one and a half stars on a four-star scale. i started watching with trepidation -- even old movies can be bad movies -- but i quickly got engaged in the story and mary astor's performance as the business brains behind a simple salesman's rise to success. not a truly great movie -- too predictable -- but certainly better than advertised. and i would have liked to have seen more of ricardo cortez as the man who appreciates mary but won't give up his wealthy wife. i'd recommend giving it a look just to appreciate astor and what a long way we've come, baby.

terrific little film that stars mary astor as a go-getter who works her way up as a struggling paper company, but when the owner has to sell for health reasons, she comes up with a scheme for the employees to buy the company with a jerk salesman (robert ames) as the "front" even though she is the brains.of course he becomes a big success and she becomes his executive secretary, basically still running everything and teaching him class. she loves the dope, but he never catches on as he fools around with a string of bimbos. she is chased by a married but separated man, ricardo cortez, who isn't free. but when a society gal catches ames, everything goes to hell.astor is just wonderful as the too-smart woman who almost makes a huge mistake after she loses her man. ames is good as the jerk (but what does she see in him?), and cortez is good but doesn't have much to do. kitty kelly is good as the sidekick, dolores. charles sellon is the original owner, cather dale owen is the society babe, and edna murphy is funny as daisy.worth a look.

this is a pretty clever, well-acted version of the "modern" 30s woman's fairytale romance. in this case, she helps the man she loves become head of the company while serving as his secretary and eventually wins his love from a scheming social butterfly. interestingly, her business sense is shown as subtly parallel to her homemaking prowess, and the ladies of the office are depicted as the "powers behind the throne." lifted way above the average by mrs. astor's intelligent performance.

is this a good movie? no, certainly not. but for jolie lovers it's must-have. her non-polished acting and semi-nudity scene will please her fans for ages to come. the current rating however (3.2) is too low. the movie might lack a good storyline, and isn't a great sf-movie altogether but the acting is good enough (and like mentioned before, jolie's acting is nice and raw), the movie is shot very direct, with a lot of close-ups. the scenery is bizarre. and last but not least, leaving van damme out was a very good choice. presumably, non of the jolie lovers would like to see her having sex with him. this movie has all the potential of becoming a cult movie.

this was a pretty good movie that was overall done quite well. the idea about mercy (won't spoil) was original also. i think angelina did a good job as one of her first movies. the only things i frowned upon were some of the corny fight scenes (won't spoil either). i liked the first movie and i liked this one as well. 7/10

i caught this movie late night on tv, and was expecting a low-budget campy "masterpiece", i was surprised with a pretty decent movie. angelina jolie's unique acting capabilities (or should i say lack thereof?) make her perfect as an android, and the other actors, while terribly average, are at least not terrible.there is a plot; a fairly intricate plot at that, involving conspiracies and the lengths a couple (one human, one android) will go to pursue their illegal romance, with a "big brother"-type figure and android assassin thrown in the mix. the production and sets, also, were much better than i expected. i haven't seen the original cyborg, so i can't really compare it to much else; granted this film is no blade runner, but as a late-night, futuristic guilty pleasure, its worth a watch.

this sci-fi great fortunately has little to do with the first one. elias koteas,jack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets naked.billy drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.

i was just looking at the 100 bottom movies according to imdb users seeing if there was anything to review that i haven't yet and i found this little screen gem. one of those occasions when you see a movie ranked as one of the worst and you just have to be one of the few that actually likes it. darn, well i guess i will get ridiculed and spat upon here, but for me this was a pretty good flick when i saw it. it has been awhile however, i remember it used to come on hbo late at night and i watched it two or three times and i haven't seen it really since and i would love to watch it again now knowing jolie was in it. the story follows a cyborg and a guy trying to escape the clutches of this corporation and some bounty hunters after them. i think that is basically all there is to it, throw in a few scenes with jack palance and we have our movie. some good action here and there, and some blood and violence as well. there is also a love story at play as well as the female cyborg and the guy who trained her to fight kind of fall in love with each other. the dialog sometimes becomes rather bad at times and it is by far not a top notch film, but for a b-movie it is really good. i don't know if it was a theatrical release though because it does not seem high quality enough for that, but it does make for one of the better direct to videos if it was one of those.

being an israeli jew of naturally sarcastic nature as well as a lover of different and independent cinema, it always gives me pleasure to see a film that takes a view on the holocaust that's sensitive and respectful while also being original and unusual. while i haven't read the book  or, for that matter, heard of its existence prior to watching the film  and therefore cannot, like some other reviewers, comment on how they stack up in comparison, everything is illuminated gave me great pleasure, and i can certainly comment on that.to label everything is illuminated a holocaust film would be to do it great injustice, even though it is undeniably about the holocaust. so would labeling it as a comedy or a travel film, although it's about a journey and is as exceptionally funny as it is moving. everything is illuminated is about jonathan safran foer  played to minimalist perfection by elijah wood, in the most impressive dramatic performance i've seen him in yet, with a poker face that shows nothing and reveals all  a young american jew, and an obsessive collector of family heirlooms and historical artifacts, who travels to the ukraine on a journey to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the nazis. it's also about alex, his tour guide through the ukraine, and alex's grandfather. what's fascinating about these characters is that in the beginning of the film they look like comic relief to balance out the melancholy nature of wood's character; but both alex and his grandfather go through fascinating changes throughout the film, and turn out to be at least as important as jonathan. in fact, boris leskin's as the grumpy, self-declared blind grandfather turns out to be the finest dramatic performance in the film.aside from the surreal nature of the film and the characters, the beautiful mix of original acoustic music and russian folk music, the sensitive cinematography and the chilling contrast between the beauty of the landscapes and the horrors of history, what made everything is illuminated a powerful and moving experience for me was the fact that from alex and his grandfather we get a very different and original viewpoint on this painful subject; several excellent films, such as the grey zone and downfall, have already given us the point of view of the lower-rank nazis who are presented as human beings who aren't necessarily fully aware of the moral implications of their actions but are caught up in the reality of the war. everything is illuminated presents a point of view rarely treated before: alex's point of view is that of a young man who was born many years after the war, who sees it as hardly more than cold historical fact, who finds himself having to face up to the horrors his own people  and maybe his own family as well  were capable of. the change in alex's attitude  and his grandfather's  towards jonathan, towards the holocaust, and towards the jewish people in general, makes the film a fascinating and original study in character development.everything is illuminated is a terrific directorial debut for actor liev schreiber, and one of the most original and unique films of 2005. it's a highly recommended viewing experience, especially or anyone interested in the holocaust and world war ii.

let me start by saying that liev has gained a ton of respect from me after seeing his directorial debut "everything is illuminated". anyone who has read the book knows how saturated the story is with nonsensical and hilarious vocabulary by alex along with countless flashback scenes and crazy dreamlike sequences. liev took all of this and made it work. the movie itself is great - the soundtrack, the performances, the cinematography - it all works. there is a lot of story missing about the town and its inhabitants, but there's only so much you can do with an indie, so this part of it didn't bother me too much. it's just disappointing that not a lot of people will see this movie or even know that it exists because of the lack of promotion that came with it. i didn't even know it was in theatres. i didn't know when the dvd came out. you'd think that since frodo baggins was one of the main characters, somebody wouldve at least released a commercial for it. i had to see the trailer on my "paradise now" dvd (released on dvd in the spring of '06) to even know that it had a "fall of 2005" theatrical release date. haha - sad really.anyhow, if you stumble across this review somehow because one of your friends read the book and loved it or saw the movie and are recommending that you see it - take my advice and watch it. it's a very good experience.8 out of 10.

excellence seems to come rare in hollwood today. many consider just two out of the year's best picture nominees to display sense to the movie industry. and in 'everything is illuminated,' the mark is hit directly.the film initiates its brilliance with the beautiful setting-the-scene entry. from the beginning, you receive a sense of warmth and true family connections and relations between one and another. and also, the cast is introduced perfectly. for elijah wood's character, jonathon, his sensibility is expressed through holding his dying grandmother's hand. and for the character entitled alex, it is easy to see his life in his perspective - the true ukrainian rock star. with the cast illuminated at first, the story slowly eases into our minds as jonathon decides to venture to ukraine to meet the woman believed to save his grandfather, thus the entire family. and from there, the story movies slowly, yet kept at a fast pace from the contrast of tear-dripping drama and laugh-out-loud humor included in scene-by-scene, every scene.although the movie itself is rather awarding, there are several complaints from other sources commenting about liev schrieber's inaccurate adaptation of the jonathon safron foer novel. personally, i have never read the novel. but any movie, especially this movie in particular should not be graded on whether the storyboard of the film matches the storyline of the book, but rather how the major concepts from the novel were expressed and exploited through the film. just because it may be far-fetched from the novel does not mean that this film is no longer a must-see - it still is.throughout the film, new information inundates the audience's mind very slowly. some of these thoughts are never answered; and in fact, the second half of the movie refocuses its entire topic and reason of travel through ukraine onto something different, yet rather similar to the original intentions of this film. the film does however leave you on a satisfied note - yet to the weak-hearted souls, a tear may be dropped. and throughout the film. to the saneful people with common sense of humor may just have to laugh from alex and john's fun and ongoing conversations.i would recommend this film to several different types of people: to those whom enjoy movies that share the genre drama-comedy, for those who have an interest in family connections, and to those whom have an interest in holocaustic subjects. and to those insane people who find slapstick as hilarious comedy, this movie is not for you. and for you whom think that this is a seriously funny and absolutely ingeniously funny film, you are wrong; this film shares comedic moments and dramatic sequences. and to those whom judge a movie based on their likeliness with its corresponding novel, you may or may not enjoy this film, but this film should be taken for much more than whether or not it was close to the book.all in all, 'everything is illuminated' is an ingenious piece of work that will enlighten anyones' hearts.

i went to see this because i have some friends in the ukraine. but the film moved me beyond what i expected by turning out to be a perfect blend of belly holding laughs (alex's strange use of english) situational comedy and heaviness bordering on depressing. i loved the range. it made me want to jump in to an old car and hit the road for the ukraine. alex (hutz) plays his guide part perfectly and provides a great counterpoint to elijah woods' poker faced earnestness. the film shows the positive side of humanity when ppl of differing cultures can bond and do the right thing when they feel the sincerity of the situation, even when they went into it with preconceived notions and prejudices, and how this can open up doorways into deeply buried memories. there is a lot in this film.

"everything is illuminated" is like viewing a fine piece of museum quality artwork. it absolutely inundates the emotions through a very broad spectrum. jonathan safran foer is played with candor by elijah wood. he is in search of his paternal heritage in the ukraine. his travels bring him in contact with alex, played very well and with extreme humor by eugene hutz. his grandfather is the most emotional tie to this film and he is aptly portrayed by boris leskin. if one finds little humor in the human characters in this cinema, then one has only to turn to mikke, a real dog who is called sammy davis jr. jr. by alex and his grandfather. they also call him the "seeing eye bitch". the cinematography is spectacular. the colors are a very important part of the patchwork of the film. it is a film worth the time and emotional investment.

the movie "everything is illuminated" comes from first-time writer-director liev schreiber, adapting jonathan safran foer's first novel. the book was ambitious and sprawling, its magical-realist elements and vivid use of language seemingly impossible to represent on screen. the movie, wisely, attempts less. while the end result is not as wildly original as the novel, it's still an accomplished movie about a strange eastern european road trip, or, as one of the characters would have it, "a very rigid search."that character is alex (eugene hutz), a young ukrainian man who loves american pop culture but can't seem to get the english language straight. nevertheless, his grandfather (russian actor boris leskin), who runs a tour company catering to american jews, convinces him to serve as a translator for jonathan (elijah wood). jonathan is investigating his family history, and specifically trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the nazis. more than one family secret gets revealed during their quest.the movie's jonathan (not to be confused with the author of the novel) is a semi- kleptomaniacal weirdo who steals his own grandmother's dentures to add to his collection of "family things". wood's quiet, wide-eyed, earnest manner works very well in this role. hutz makes an impressive debut as the loose-limbed, easygoing alex. his malapropisms are hilarious, but he is also able to pull off the character's growing self-awareness. the dog mikki is very funny as the demented sammy davis jr. jr., and one of the few movie dogs i've ever seen that isn't cloyingly cute and precocious."everything is illuminated" eventually puts the holocaust on a human scale, asking us to remember it not as a general event, but as millions of specific, small tragedies. reminiscent of a european movie, it also ponders the effect of past events on present-day young people like jonathan and alex. with its original perspective, strong performances and some very striking visuals, "everything is illuminated" is great work for a first-timer, and hopefully schreiber will continue to direct movies.

good job.that's how i would describe this animated scooby-doo adventure.this is so far the best of the animated scooby movies i have seen.i liked the story.i thought it had some depth to to it.the movie is also well paced.it doesn't get boring for a minute.it also has an interesting group of characters(besides scooby and shaggy and the gang,of course)plus,the movie was a real blast.i has a lot of fun watching it.i also liked the great scottish music.it was very catchy and infectious.naturally,we know that scooby and the gamg will solve the mystery,but it's still fun getting to that point.the animation is also pretty good for this movie.i would love it if they did a 3d animation scooby adventure,but we'll just have to wait and see.for me,scooby-doo and the loch ness monster is a 7/10

scooby doo and the monster of mexico was no doubt the weakest of the modern scooby doo animated features. loch ness monster is a considerable improvement.this time the gang head off to scotland to see the highland games and visit blake castle, daphne's ancestral home. and wouldn't you know, the castle happens to be in the 'quaint' fishing village of drumnadrochit, on the shores of loch ness.during their stay they meet a few interesting folks. first there is fiona pembrooke, a scientist who has drowned all of her money into finding the loch ness monster.sir ian locksley, the boss of the national heritage museum of scotland, he is staunch non-believer of nessie.the haggarts, the own a cozy inn on the shores of the loch. the sons are a couple of local jokers, always into mischief.del chilman, a wild, paranoid hippie dude who is convinced the monster is out there and will stop at nothing on find her.and finally, duncan macgubbin, the dock master who has seen nessie too many times to count.most of these characters are stereotypes, which gets a bit annoying as this is teaching younger audiences a load of crap and giving the wrong impression. however if you can immune yourself to it you'll be alright. being from scotland i can't help but wince at the awfully mimicked scottish accents. fact: we don't sound like that.soon enough nessie, looking rather more demonic than 'usual', shows up and causes havoc. looks like the gang have another mystery on their hands. the usual chase scenes, clues and shaggy's wacky disguises follow. there are plenty of laughs. the animation is splendid, with some atmospheric scenes and locations. and the plot a lot better than monster of mexico.the only bad thing this time around is the music. i miss louis febre's scoring and the songs here are pretty rotten too. where are the hex girls when you need 'em?the region 2 dvd is in crystal clear 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen (the region 1 ain't) with dolby 5.0 sound. some okay extras are included. definitely worth getting.

cool flick. enjoyable to watch. hope to see more from fred carpenter soon. i really like the location setting with all the new york references. it was interesting the way it all unfolds in the end. the suspense factor was effective and the acting, though kept simple, was also effective in portraying the characters. there are a bunch of neat little tricks incorporated into this film that make all the better. i think the supporting actress did a great job in her role. the casting and directing in this film seem to be sewn together seamlessly and the quality of the shooting is quite impressive. the movie is not without its soft moments either, which gives it a nice sense of balance.

i am a talent manager. i have been for 15 years now. i have discovered some wonderful talent. they have been in movies, commericals, braodway and television. in my opinion eddie monroe was cast wonderful. i love seeing the ability of real people. not just a name. the actors in this movie were very natural and believable. i was very entertained by this film. i love a movie with a few twists. i also enjoy when at the end of the movie the puzzle is solved. i still would like to know what happened to the large sum of the money.(when you see the flick you will understand what i am saying.) the mobsters all look real ???? i would like to see this film on the big screen. the footage was shot really well. the scenery of new york was the new york that i know. have a happy 2006 and may this movie make it to the awards.

i have seen a few of fred carpenter's movies on showtime, pay per view and video/dvd and i enjoyed most of these films especially with a few beers, (carpenter knows how to entertain)"eddie monroe" and "murdered innocence" are my favorites. i recently viewed a promo dvd of "eddie monroe" and everything from the cast to the storyline and directing all worked smoothly. (doug brown's music score was sensational.) i enjoyed seeing frank sivero ("goodfellas", "new york, new york" and "the wedding singer"), he is an amazing and very underrated actor.but i especially liked the performance of paul vario who played uncle benny, i looked up his acting credits on the imdb and i found out this was his first starring role. where has this guy been! give fred carpenter credit for discovering great new talent, it's only a matter of time you'll be seeing this guy costarring with pacino and deniro. as i mentioned carpenter knows how to entertain and when your working with a limited budget it is amazing what carpenter can produce.(i read the vent magazine interview and carpenter has never made a movie for more than $400,000.00 dollars.) before i watched "eddie monroe" i saw "rocky balboa" and "the good shepherd" both great films. "eddie monroe" took me on a ride to a surprised ending because of a very good script, good performances from the entire cast(craig morris is a movie star waiting to happen and the lead actress jessica tsunis was hot!) great cinematography, direction and doug brown's music score. as i stated i recently seen "rocky balboa" and "the good shepherd", if i were to write a comment about those two movies i would be saying some of the same things i have stated about "eddie monroe", the only thing those two very good films don't have in common with "eddie monroe", they didn't cost a few hundred grand. great movie and i didn't even drink a beer.

one of my favorites non-mgm musicals, it's a classic!> rita hayworth is in top form, her beauty leaps out of the screen. gene kelly shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph. phil silvers is the perfect second bananas, and eve arden injects this movie with a lot of class. the structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why, in this era where major broadway shows come from the movies, cover girl hasn't been adapted to theatre.

in brooklyn, the nightclub dancer rusty parker (rita hayworth) has a simple but happy life dancing in the mcguire's, owned by her boyfriend danny (gene kelly). rusty, danny and genius (phil silvers) have a ritual on friday nights: they order oysters in a bar, trying to find a pearl. the life of rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the vanity magazine. she is invited to work in a huge theater in broadway, whose owner proposes her. she loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style, missing the love of danny and her old friends. 'cover girl' is a delightful romantic comedy, very naive and having magnificent parts, such as the beauty and talented rita hayworth dancing, singing and acting; gene kelly, specially in two scenes, dancing with himself and with rusty and genius on the street; the songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectaculars. danny, the character of gene kelly, is almost nasty with his chauvinist behavior. rita hayworth surprised me with her talent: i found her amazing in 'gilda', but she is stunning in 'cover girl'. in accordance with the information on the cover of the vhs, 'cover girl' was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot, giving continuity to the story, instead of just being 'thrown' in the movie. my sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent gene kelly festival and they loved 'cover girl', therefore i dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations. my vote is nine.title (brazil): 'modelos' ('models')

rita hayworth lights up the screen in this fun, fancy and delightful musical starring gene kelly. rita plays nightclub dancer rusty parker who has dreams to be a successful broadway star. unfortunately, her career is getting no where in danny mcguire's night club. when one of her fellow dancers says she's going to enter a cover girl contest, she decides to follow her dreams and enters. she reminds the publisher of her grandma, who he was deeply in love with many years ago. but when she finds this success, her boyfriend is not happy about it.i had never seen rita before this, and i am so glad i did! she has such a scene presence and is a very good actress. there are some good numbers in here, not the best of any musical but they are melodic and good to listen to. one thing i didn't like was gene kelly's character. he should have supported his girlfriend! but anyway, that's perhaps the only criticism i have about this movie. cover girl is a glorious, fluffy film - perfect escapism. not everyone's ideal movie, but a wonderful movie nonetheless, due to rita hayworth's star power. great movie, truly impressed.

i really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it. rita hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous. although a musical, i thought rita hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well. as far as her dancing, i think she was excellent. even betty grable pretty much endorsed rita's dancing in this film as she commented that rita danced rings around her own dancing and let's face it, betty grable was an excellent dancer. the cinematography and vivid colors are also noted. rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but she's also in love with her mentor played by gene kelly. does she leave kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love and broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever? you'll have to watch the film to find out!

a fantastic musical starring gene kelly and rita hayworth. he owns a nightclub where she dances. she's no star yet, but she gets a big break when she's chosen as a cover girl for vanity, whose owner was actually in love with her grandmother. when he sees the resemblance, he picks her right away for a contest his maganzine is running. hayworth's newfound fame at first works wonders for kelly's club, but her star rises so quickly and so high up that his grasp on her begins to falter. this isn't the most original of plots, but the two leads really make it work. it also helps that the screenplay is great. kelly's not yet at his peak, especially his peak as an actor. his dancing, however, wow. hayworth is the star, but kelly claims the film's most memorable moment as he dances passionately with his own reflection. it's obviously a take-off of fred astaire's shadow dancing in swing time, but i think kelly one-ups it, which is hardly believable. in fact, this has got to be the most amazing dance sequence in film history, save perhaps the finale of an american in paris several years later. the rest of the songs are also excellent, and the musical numbers are even better. too bad rita didn't sing her own songs (well, she may have a couple of them, as her singing voice seemed to be different sometimes). her dancing is wonderful, as is the rest of her acting. it's hard not to love her in anything. she's really one of the few truly beautiful women from the classic era. not plastic like many of them; no, you can really see the warmth in that woman. her smile is so disarming. phil silvers has the role as kelly's best friend, and he is also very funny. the trio of kelly-hayworth-silvers is obviously the kernel which became the kelly-reynolds-o'connor trio in singin' in the rain eight years afterwards. one of the biggest musical numbers in the film seems almost completely pilfered with the "good morning" number in singin'. i do think singin' in the rain is the better film, as cover girl is a little rough around the edges. this roughness, though, just adds to the charm. there are aspects of this film that beat singin' in the rain, and even an american in paris. for instance, the central relationship is more emotionally involving. instead of the dominant older man chasing the little girl (leslie caron and debbie reynolds were just teenagers, after all), we have a very nice relationship with two people who seem more like equals. there is no chasing around - an aspect that does unfortunately turn a lot of the best musicals a little sour, you have to admit. kelly and hayworth are a couple from the start, and when that begins to fray, i really felt it. 9/10.

this has got to be one of the better post-astaire musicals made by columbia. produced by arthur schwartz and directed by vet charles vidor, this picture really put gene kelly on the map and cemented rita hayworth's reputation as cinema's premier female dance partner. she plays a bit of a dual role here since she performs contemporary 1940s numbers with gene and co-star phil silvers, but also puts her in the role of her grandmother, a nightclub performer in the late 19th centry.the music should also be singled out because this was i believe the last project that the legendary jerome kern (most famous today for "old man river" and "smoke gets in your eyes") worked on, and his lyricist was the equally legendary ira gershwin. they supplied a score that is full of charm and characterization. the music for the historical sequences is especially noteworthy because it's so perfectly styled in the early 20th century idiom that was kern's original period. it's a bit like picking up a record from one of your favorite bands from the 1970s and hearing them do a song in the original style of that time.the story is pretty inconsequential, which is fine with me because this film is as close an approximation as you will ever be likely to see of the 1930s/40s golden age of broadway musical comedy style on film. even the 1940s war propaganda aspects of the film's music give it extra charm as the talented trio sing "make way for tomorrow" and even humorously poke fun at america's enemies and use period slang such as referring to "gremlins".probably the most memorable performance in the film is kelly's dance to the "alter-ego dance", which found him arguing with and then dancing with himself as a metaphorical image of the battle of the conscience. this prefigures much of his later work and also stands an effective and memorable scene in and of itself.fans will want to seek this out for various reasons -- kelly fans will see this as a rare chance to see him outside of the confines of mgm with a different set of co-stars and music superior to his usual mgm material. hayworth fans will want to see rita in glorious color at the peak of her fame and ability. and fans of classic broadway musicals will definitely want to hear kern's final score and marvel at the quality of gershwin's lyrics and the compatibility of their styles. this is a definite gem in the crown of columbia's musical program.

rita hayworth is right there where she should be - as a "cover girl" in this 1944 technicolor film also starring gene kelly, phil silvers, eve arden, lee bowman, and otto kruger. rita plays a beautiful showgirl, rusty, working at a small club owned by the man she loves, danny (kelly). each friday they go out for oysters with genius (silvers), the club comedian. they all hate oysters, but they're looking for a pearl. when they find one, all three of them will have good luck, they believe.rusty auditions and wins the role of cover girl for a magazine - she starts off ahead of the other contestants because the magazine owner (kruger) sees a resemblance between rusty and the girl he once loved, who turns out to be rusty's grandmother. once she becomes the cover girl, the world opens up for her and her dreams of appearing on broadway come true. danny wants her to have her success, but at the same time realizes he's lost her."cover girl" has exuberant dance numbers and songs by jerome kern, with rita dubbed by martha mears. rita is at her best playing both rusty in the present and her grandmother in the past. for such a sexy, desirable, gorgeous woman, she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of domineering men. none of this ever showed on screen, nor did the fact that she didn't want to be a movie star. she is one of the true goddesses and brought everything she did to life. gene kelly is in a serious role here, but gets plenty of chances to dance and sing. phil silvers is very amiable and funny as the in-house comic and best friend.this is a very good movie with no dull spots. the only problem i had is the idea that rusty has to choose between a successful career and the man she loves. when supermodel jinx falkenberg, who plays herself in the film, speaks of getting married, she's warned by her boss not to, that she's too necessary to the modeling business. we're not told if rusty continues with her career or goes back to work at danny's - but all signs seemed to point toward the brooklyn club. why couldn't she have had both? nevertheless, you can't beat "cover girl" for top entertainment, beautiful color, lovely music, great energy, fine performances, and its most fabulous asset, the glorious rita hayworth.

this is one of the best musicals of the 1940s. the glorious technicolor shows off rita hayworth's beauty and spectacular hair. she should have made more movies in color, but then columbia was hardly in a position to splash out money for technicolor spectaculars.rita is a wow as rusty parker - she more than keeps up with gene in some of the most sparkling numbers ever. she also looked beautiful in turn of the century gowns, so she was given a chance to play her own grandmother.the film opens with "the show must go on" - it looks great to me - but danny mcguire (gene kelly) is not impressed. his motto is work, work, work!!! one of the dancers, maurine (lesley brookes) is determined to better herself and is going to audition for vanity's golden wedding cover girl competition. rusty just happens to find herself at the auditions as well. in a very funny scene maurine has just had a so so audition and seeing rusty, gives her a few tips on how to impress the judges!!! "don't be shy and demure - chatter and sparkle". rusty does so with gusto!!!they decide on maurine and go to the show to see her but john coudair (otto kruger) sees rusty - she reminds him of someone from his past. cornelia (eve arden) is still having nightmares over rusty's audition. "whose complaining" features genius (phil silvers) and the dancers, dressed up as working girls - (rusty is a cabbie).john is remembering a long lost love (rusty's grandmother, maribelle hicks) the first time he saw her singing "a sure thing" - set at the races. meanwhile danny, rusty and genius are looking for pearls at their local diner. they then launch into the happiest song of the 1940s (in my opinion) - "make way for tomorrow"."put me to the test" is a spirited song and dance number featuring danny and rusty. in the meantime rusty has been chosen cover girl and danny mcguires' is the place to be seen. lee bowman appears as danny's romantic rival and puts a damper on things. lee bowman is probably the most boring leading man ever - so danny never needs to worry.rusty (dubbed by martha mears) sings "long ago and far away" and it is danced beautifully by danny and rusty. the gowns that rita wears are stunning. travis banton and gwen wakeling designed them. danny wants the best for rusty but is afraid he will lose her. gene kelly is also fantastic in the "alter ego" number where he dances with himself."poor john" is another look back to the turn of the century - it was written in 1906 and is an extremely funny song poking fun at rich relations - hayworth looks gorgeous in an amazingly quaint outfit. look for al norman in both "poor john" and "a sure thing". he was an amazing eccentric dancer, who appeared in several early musicals, including "king of jazz" and "paramount on parade". he was easy to spot.the "cover girl" dance is just wonderful. rita was so talented - beautiful and a great dancer. after a bevy of beautiful models parade through covers of america's top magazines, rusty bursts through in a beautiful gold gown dancing down a ramp to the very catchy "cover girl" song. gosh i just love this movie!!!!highly recommended.

this is a very enjoyable, fluffy, glamorous musical from the 40's. 'cover girl' made rita hayworth (formerly the dark-haired latin senorita margarita cansino) into a bona-fide, all-american star. it confirmed gene kelly's amazing talent as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. it epitomises the exuberance and colour of the musical genre.rita hayworth is great as rusty parker- it is her picture, and her presence is always at the forefront. her singing is dubbed, but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with kelly. i think that rita was highly underrated as an actress- she plays every scene superbly here. gene choreographed the dance sequences (he was basically given almost complete creative freedom here), and his 'alter ego' dance number is amazing. such artistry. the stand-out tunes are 'make way for tomorrow', 'put me to the test', and, of course, 'long ago and far away'. the plot is rather thin, yet it does have a moral. it's about the perils of quick fame and fast money, and how any happiness with only these factors will ultimately be doomed. this will cheer you up, lift you up to your feet and make you laugh.that said, 'cover girl' is not the greatest musical ever produced- it has a number of flaws that must be addressed. one can say that a little bit of phil silvers goes a long way. his character gets tedious rather quickly. however, i was impressed with his dancing ability and how he was able to keep up with gene and rita. another major problem is that too many songs are just not that great. the 'cover girl' number looks fantastic, but i'm not a fan of the lyrics or the singing. 'poor tom' is a huge downer. i think it's one of the worst numbers i've heard in a 40's-50's musical yet. it stinks. the grandmother sub-plot borders on being ridiculous. but that's only my opinion. others may like these elements.still, apart from it's faults it's a very, very good film, much better than most of the product churned out today. the dancing and singing is sublime, the production values are excellent, and it's mood is infectious.8/10.

this is definitely an outstanding 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of charles vidor. rita hayworth, (rusty parker),"charlie chan in egypt", sang and danced with gene kelly,(danny mcguire), "anchors away", danny mcguire owned a night club in brooklyn, n.y. and was in love with rusty parker who was a dancer in his club along with phil silvers,(genius),"coney island", who was the comedian in this picture and also worked and dance together with danny, rusty. otto kruger, (john coudair),"duel in the sun" played the role as a promoter of a cover girl magazine and decided rusty parker was going to be his top model. jerome kern's music is heard through out the entire picture and the song, "long ago & far away" is the theme music for this musical. this film was nominated for many awards and was a big hit at the box office during ww ii which kept peoples minds off of the war that was going on at the time. rita hayworth and gene kelly were instant hits and their career's exploded on the silver screen for many many years. great musical and a film you will not want to miss, this is truly a great classic film. enjoy

rita hayworth as rusty parker is the cover girl du jour--she's one of the dancing girls in danny mcguire's club, the most special one according to danny (gene kelly) and pretty much anyone who comes across her. take for example, vanity magazine magnate john coudair (otto kruger): enchanted by rusty's resemblance to her grandmother maribelle (also played by hayworth in flashbacks), whom he wooed devotedly when he fell in love with her, he tries to relive his youth by fixing what he thinks went wrong between himself and maribelle. he doesn't believe that danny could give rusty happiness, or everything she should be entitled to--he even gets danny believing this himself. when rusty shoots to fame as vanity's 'cover girl', danny drives her away into the ready and waiting arms of noel wheaton (lee bowman). so what happens when danny returns to town with his sidekick genius (phil silvers) in tow, only to discover that rusty is marrying wheaton?as a musical, cover girl benefits from the beautiful score and songs written by jerome kern and ira gershwin, including the oscar-nominated 'long ago and far away' (possibly one of the most gorgeous ballads ever written and beautifully, sweetly sung as a duet by hayworth and kelly), maribelle's number 'sure thing' (the more lacklustre 'poor john' isn't a kern/gershwin collaboration) and 'put me to the test'. the dancing, of course, is top-notch, since gene kelly had more than just a hand in the choreography. it shows in the simplest of dances, for example his dance with hayworth to 'put me to the test', or the joyfully exuberant 'make way for tomorrow' number (performed by the trio of danny, rusty and genius)... which foreshadows the reaction gene's character has to the police cop in the title number in singin' in the rain. kelly especially scored a technological and artistic coup with the 'alter-ego' dance. like its successors in anchors aweigh and an american in paris (jerry the mouse and the 16-minute ballet respectively), this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity kelly brought to the modern film musical: wanting to use the film medium to present dances that couldn't be showcased on a stage, and years before cgi, kelly insisted on dancing with the one person who could possibly match him in talent and style--himself. the number is hardly five minutes long, but it (and kelly's genius) still takes one's breath away, even sixty years down the line. this is the reason i watched cover girl, and if nothing else, this dance is truly worth it.you can tell that a great deal of money was lavished onto cover girl and rita hayworth--not that she doesn't deserve it. witness the scene when rusty hits broadway--the large screen showcasing all the different cover girls gives way to a staggeringly large stage rigged for rusty's entrance. hayworth is indeed one of the most effortlessly beautiful girls on show in the film, and she dances with a style and grace that is almost worthy of kelly. (very few of kelly's co-stars have that honour.) she is hilarious in some scenes, for example her drunk scene when john and wheaton come to get her from joe's.for some reason, however, her performance still lacks the spark of greatness which would help cover girl overcome its general curse of mediocrity. that curse is only lifted whenever gene kelly is on the screen (dancing or no), or when eve arden as john's long-suffering secretary 'stonewall' sidles by with another cutting comment or clever observation. since the film, in the end, belongs to hayworth, neither kelly nor arden can save it as a whole. this isn't to say that the film is bad--it isn't. it's enjoyable, with great songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to look at. but it's just not quite a classic. the dancing is classic though--so watch cover girl for that, and you won't regret it.

"cover girl" is the best musical rita hayworth ever made. ms. hayworth will always be remembered for "gilda", however, the next movie would be "cover girl". the story is great. it is about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes it big in show business. she does it without the help of her talented dancer/director boyfriend (gene kelly). mr. kelly is given the chance to choreograph the musical numbers. the dances are spectacular. it is fun to see phil silvers, a comic, do the musical numbers with ms. hayworth and mr. kelly. the supporting cast is perfect. lee bowman is given a chance to be an interesting third wheel, the other boyfriend.

a good story about rusty parker (rita hayworth) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would have to leave the small dinner theater where she works with danny (gene kelly) and genius (phil silvers). rusty is in love with danny. all three are good friends and every friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl (they never eat them). the story line provides numerous opportunities for songs and dancing. the movie has two questions that rusty must answer: is fame all that it is cracked up to be? and is less really more if you are happy? answering those questions makes the movie. the movie also does a good job of showcasing the talents that all three principals had. never a dull moment!

it took a loan out film to columbia for gene kelly's home studio mgm to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films. cover girl also became rita hayworth's signature film for the gis and their pinup fantasies during world war ii.kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in brooklyn where rita is a featured dancer and phil silvers the comic. of course kelly does a bit of hoofing himself there.hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire otto kruger when it turns out that kruger had loved and lost hayworth's grandmother. in some flashback sequences from the gaslight era, hayworth also plays her own grandmother with jess barker playing the young kruger. you might remember jess barker was the husband of that other legendary screen redhead, susan hayward.broadway producer lee bowman also is attracted to hayward, but he's not interested in nostalgia. he wants her for his ziegfeld follies revue and in fact the biggest number of cover girl is the title song of the film. it's nicely done in follies style.hayworth also gets to sing a sure thing in a gaslight era number and in the only song in the show not written by jerome kern and ira gershwin, hayworth also does an old english music hall number poor john. when i say sing, as everyone knows rita mouths words. singing here is done by nan wynn.the biggest hit of the show is long ago and far away which is introduced by gene kelly. it was one of the biggest hits of the world war ii era and one of the biggest sellers jerome kern ever wrote. it happens in fact to be a favorite of an aunt of mine who with my uncle will be celebrating 60 years of marriage this september. long ago and far away was nominated for best song, but lost to swinging on a star.what really sets cover girl apart and what makes it a milestone film for gene kelly is the two numbers put me to the test and the alter ego number. harry cohn decided to do what louis b. mayer had refused at mgm, to give kelly creative control of his own material. kelly later said the alter ego number was one of the hardest things he ever attempted in his career. in it he dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and intricate. in fact after one more loan out film, christmas holiday at universal, louis b. mayer never loaned out gene kelly for the rest of the time he was at mgm. and he did get creative control from then on.with that dazzling technicolor cinematography and rita's red hair and gene kelly's boundless creativity, cover girl was and is a classic and will forever be so.

when i saw this film, it reminded me of all the greatest dreams i had (mostly filled with robots)i can relate to eledore's problems and i have a similarity to shiro, and this is a great film to watch (if you're a goth who is bitter and eccentric like me!). all in all, watch it before it's out of print!

i just re-watched 08th ms gundam for the 2nd time. it is so much better than gundam wing. i can't wait to get the dvd and see what was edited out of the series. this is great to see the gundams actually move about clumsily through the land. somebody really thought over writing this move script.see this today,.

the 08th ms team features two hopeful romantics from different sides of the conflict. aina, the zeon officer, and shiro, the federal forces' new pilot, meet in a battle in space, throughout the 12 episode series (and one "movie") the two debate their love for each other while trying to come to grips with the war that surrounds them. it features a romeo and juliet romance and unbeatable animation. by far one of the best to hit american shores. suit up!

this gundam series only follows gundam 0083 stardust memory. the story takes place during the same time line as the original gundam in the year u.c. 0079 the time of the one year war, but the mobile suits are designed as new models are and are as a result look more articulate. the hero of the story is a young lt. shiro amada, who may lack any real combat experience but makes up for it with creativity and effort.his life get complicated when he meets aina sahalin a jion ace pilot (the enemy), the to end up falling in love and begin to change their attitudes about the war around them. the other cast of characters in the story are not there for background either, every one in this story has a history to them.there is also another ace mobile suit pilot in this series that can be added into the pantheon of ace mobile suit pilots. right up there with char aznable and anavel gato is norris packard, not the top villain in this series, but his presence give the 8th mobile suit team a hard fight. 3 of them against norris and his single ms-07b gouf custom mobile suit.in conclusion this gundam along with stardust memory is a must see!!

i watched love life on holiday, when it was filmed at a film festival in florida. it was a lovely surprise to find a british film that wasn't derivative or exploitive. a beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm the pants of audiences prepared to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the film. the transitions between scenes i found a bit distracting, but as whole i think love life is a winner, a ruby in the dust. one for all the family. a pleasant change to see a british film for teen audiences that isn't littered with four letter words. try and see it.

wow! why aren't more british movies like this. great rights of passage money with a big heart and some stand out performances. the comedy is quirky and original and the kid is really great. one to hunt down and watch. look out for it! ten out of ten.

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart. it is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent. nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.

this episode is not incoherent like another person said. the source agreed to help because he was not going to keep his word, if you pay attention... he says after she (phoebe) agrees to stay down there in hell, "get rid of her and balthazor so i don't have to worry about them in the future"... and also, he didn't let cole warn the sisters like phoebe asked in exchange of accepting the deal, that's why prue died, because she got hit harder than piper and on the head, and there was no phoebe to call for leo this time, and in the past leo said that she almost got herself killed. pay more attention next time! and there is not a "to be continued..." after this episode. it is the ending of season 3, and on season 4 they can't show anything from prue because she owns the rights of it "prue", so the producers would have to pay her for whatever they show. this is the last episode she is in!

piper, prue and phoebe bring dr. griffiths to the manor in order to try and save him from the source's personal assassin, shax. whilst phoebe looks in the book of shadows for a spell to vanquish shax, prue and piper are attacked by shax and chase him into the street. unbeknownst to prue and piper, they were filmed by a news reporter and her cameraman using their powers and broadcasted live on national television. with phoebe in the underworld, prue, piper, and leo must find a way to reverse the damage done. leo goes down to phoebe, and tells her that the charmed ones have been exposed as witches. on the surface, piper is shot by a manic witch-wannabe, and prue has to take her to the hospital. the problem here is that the crowds are blocking the driveway. so prue has to use her magic on the crowd, and they go to the hospital. piper is pronounced dead, and a swat team moves in. leo learns of piper's death, and goes down to tell phoebe. cole is asked to ask the source to reset time, and the source agrees; only if phoebe turns to the dark side. phoebe agrees, but the deal will shatter them. up on the surface, prue and piper are battling shax. prue shouts out for phoebe, who unbeknownst to them is in the underworld. shax throws piper and prue through a wall, and dr. griffiths out of a window. prue is not pronounced dead until the season 4 premiere episode, "charmed again, part one"."all hell breaks loose" is a gripping episode, and it made me sit on the edge of my seat. sad that prue's dead, but happy that there will be five more seasons of charmed. my vote; 10 out of 10. excellent

right the hospital scene with holly and shannon was done brilliantly it starts off with piper on a gurney looking very badly injured, the docs race her into a resuscitation room & they move her from the gurney onto a bed and prue holds her hand from that point on it is obvious that piper is having a lot of trouble breathing and her lungs are failing, as she turns to beg of prue to not leave her side she gaps "don't go i love you and then her pulse drops and she goes into cardiac arrest & the monitor shows a clear flat line & the nurses go into full out trauma mode & bring in a defibrillator prue steps back from the bed in horror as the doctors desperately try to shock her dying sisters heart but there is no response and she is tragically pronounced dead well great scene well done girls

i'm not going to ramble on about it but i'm just going to make it brief. basically for those who don't know how prue actually died........... the first time round the demonic assassin comes hit piper and prue with an energy ball they fly through the wall blood everywhere. phoebe the third sister comes down the stairs, says the spell which send him away but not vanquished.(needs the power of three)leo comes heals them both and so on. they get exposed along the line and the only way the can be saved is for a demon named tempus to turn back time. the only way he can do that is is phoebe stays in the underworld. she agrees, tempus turns back time. it now around 7:00 in the morning again. demon comes strucks piper and prue with energy ball. they fly through wall again. but this time phoebe isn't there to say the spell to fend demon off. demon kills doctor. doctor flies through window. he is dead. demon goes in a whirl wing type thing and glass on the doors shatter which is a great effect bye the way and there is and airy sound. thats where it ends. now.......... what the whole world doesn't know if they didn't pay attention to the next episode. although what i'm about to say wasn't shown its what happens trust me................ because this time there was no phoebe to call for leo this time he arrives later. piper survives because her injuries wern't as fatal as prue's and leo heals her first before prue so by that time prue is already dead. there mystery solved. ps calling for prue with a spell should have worked!!! and she should have made a surprise appearance in the last ever episode.ok i did ramble on

it's just one of those films, you're either love it or hate it, my girlfriend and me loved it, told my brother to rent it and he hated it, said it was too flashy and colloquial, then again he only usually goes to see big action movies, so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed. there were some great new talent (i'd never heard of the leads before anyway)? des brady (the directors brother?) was especially good. playing a right dick at the start i thought he never would redeem himself but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created and by the end i was really routing for him. a very surprising film with a whole lot of heart, if you can live without a body count and explosions then this one is very original. yashimo. brixton in the uk.

this episode of charmed changed everything! the show is about to end it's third season, and all hell is breaking loose in this episode. the charmed ones bring an innocent named dr. griffiths to the manor the protect him from shax, the sources assassin. when shax attacks, he blasts in as a tornado and then corporealizes into his demon skin. he blasts prue threw a wall which totally knocks her out and practically kills her. then blasts piper threw what is left of the wall. phoebe comes from the attic and says the vanquishing spell before shax came kill the doctor. but being the power of one, it just wounds him.leo comes to heal the other sisters and prue wants to find shax and destroy him for real. phoebe, meanwhile is in the underworld trying to find cole.when prue and piper go out into the street to find the demon, the demon finds them. after their battle, the witches realize that a camera caught everything! when they get back to manor trying to battle the media and after they vanquished shax, a a witch gone kookoo shoots piper. prue uses her telekinesis to move people out of the way so she can get to the hospital. but they get their to late and piper dies. and just when prue is about to get shot, time is rewound to where they bring dr. griffiths to the manor. shax blows in and blasts prue and piper. but phoebe is still in the underworld so shax kills the doctor and blasts out of the manor. when leo finally comes, he can't heal prue. prue is dead and so is the power of three. for now. personally. this episode was sad. prue was the strongset of all of them. i would love to have her power of telekinesis. i really don't think phoebe should of went to the underworld because if she didn't, shax wouldn't have killed prue. but paige brings the power of three together again and i'm happy with the show's progress

prue and piper bring dr. griffiths to their home to save him from the sauce's assassin shax. while phoebe looks in the book of shadow how to vanquish the demon, prue and piper fight and chase shax on the streets to destroy him. however, they are filmed and exposed live in the television news as witches. they become national sensation with a crowd in front of their house. phoebe trusts on cole and goes to the underworld with leo to ask him to summon tempus and revert time while a fanatic woman shots piper, who dies. the source proposes phoebe to stay with him and in return he would save her sister. phoebe accepts the deal, and the time is reverted to the moment shax is attacking prue, piper and dr. griffits."all hell breaks loose" is a good but incoherent episode. with piper dead and the power of three destroyed, why should the source revert time to save her? but this dramatic show is certainly one of the best of the third season and let the viewers anxiously waiting for the next episode. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "voltando no tempo" ("back in time")

i watched this episode a lot of times because i didn't get how prue died. this is what happened. prue, piper, and phoebe try and save their innocent,a doctor, because shax wants to kill him. phoebe goes upstairs to look in the book of shadows while prue and piper are protecting their innocent. shax appears while phoebe is still upstairs, so shax throw an energy ball at the doctor but prue pushes him out of the way and prue get hit in the chest with it and smashes against the wall, same with piper. so phoebe comes downstairs and says the spell, since it was only phoebe who said it and not the power of three shax only got wounded. phoebes calls leo to heal piper and prue. so leo heals them. phoebe went into the underworld to find cole, meanwhile prue and piper are looking for shax in the streets. piper and prue see shax and piper uses her power to blow up shax, meanwhile a new reporter got it all on tape. so its all over the new about the three powerful halliwell sisters, meanwhile phoebe doesn't know anything because she is still in the underworld. there's repoters and people all over the halliwell house. then a maniac comes in the house and says "can i be part of your coven?" and prue says "no this is our house get out of here!" and prue uses her powers to throw her out. as the maniac come out of the house crying saying "there mean witches". the maniac gets so mad that she shoots piper right through the stomach. prue get in her car and trays to go to the hospital but people won't let her through ,so prue uses her powers to move people out of the way, making people wanna kill her more. they got to the hospital but piper didn't make it. meanwhile phoebe is in the underworld.phoebe finds out that they have been exposed, so phoebe asks cole to ask the source if he can reverse time.the source says he will only reverse time if phoebe promises to stay here in the underworld, so cole told phoebe what the source told him. phoebe says "what would make him think i would make a deal like that?" and then cole says, "so you can save one of your sisters lives." leo goes to the hospital to find out the piper really is dead so he tells phoebe that its true. then phoebe agrees to stay only if cole will go back to warn piper and prue about the exposer and death of piper. back at the hospital swat is about the shoot prue, but the second before they do time is rewound back when they were at the manor with the doctor but this time phoebe wasn't there to call leo to heal prue and piper, so the doctor get throw in the wall too. the doctor died and so did prue. but this is what i didn't get, if piper was throw against the wall too how come only prue died? why did they not show leo come and heal piper and leo trying to heal prue? if you know the answer please e-mail me at angelpuss924@yahoo.com ps. i miss prue but i like paige too and i'm glad the show continued

having seen only once and in the dawn hours, i can't seem to forget this haunting film. a mix of mystery, suspense, and heartbreaking romance it reminds me of vertigo.the actors, though not that well known are good especially joan hackett in one of her best performances.you believe in her, in her love,in her newfound quest for freedom brought by her love, and in the end in her overwhelming pain.the plot is ingenious and compelling and does not stretch credibility. the direction and technical stuff certainly could be better but they do not compromise the overall effect. and it has one message: don't let revenge blind you, you can became its last victim.a real pity it has not been remade, but perhaps it is a period piece better left alone.

this movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best made-for-tv movie mysteries i've ever seen. the acting is superb. i've seen it twice and still am puzzled at some parts. i'd love to have a copy so i can play certain parts over and over again. i am interested in buying a copy of this movie, but cannot find it anywhere.i am wondering if if anyone has any suggestions how to find it? i've tried e-bay, amazon.com, internet searches, and am completely frustrated. i've not seen it on turner classic movies, nor on american movie classics and i have even put out fliers in our community asking if anyone has a copy.

i was a 20 year old college student living with the folks when i first saw this, and i've never forgotten it. i'm a huge joan hackett fan, and this film was perfect for her remarkable talent. i'm so glad to see that so many other people have such a fond memory of seeing this. naturally, it's not available on any media! it would be perfect to show on lifetime, but because of its age, they won't. you never see anything there before the mid-eighties. i can still remember what made me watch it when it was first run: rex reed reviewed it in the new york daily news, and he said that it was like a throwback to the great hollywood films of the forties, and had it been made then, the hackett and grimes parts would have been played by stanwyck and crawford. think about that! p.s. so sad that joan hackett left us so tragically young.

i remember seeing this movie 34 years ago and it was full of suspense and twists. it grabs you at the beginning and keeps you guessing throughout the whole movie. i have thought about this movie for the past several years and have checked in video stores to see if it's available, but was never able to find it or anyone who had even heard of it. i think this type of movie is timeless, and i know it would be enjoyed by a whole new generation of movie watchers. i hope this gets on video soon as it would be fun to see if it has the same impact on me as it did back in the early 70's.it's very rare that a tv movie can make that much of an impression, but this was did and still does after so many years.

i have never forgot this movie. all these years and it has remained in my life. i have looked for this movie on so many sites and stores. if anyone ever reads this and has a copy i will pay you for a copy of it or please let me know where i could find one. this is a movie that should be a classic romance known as well as my other favorite, somewhere in time. it was truly brilliant. if the right actors would remake this film and give it the patience it needs, to be the right acting, it could be a block buster.a love story as powerful as this should be around for all lovers to see. i remember how sad i was at the ending and it really came as a shock. i believe with all my heart that johnny really loved the woman and she him. this was one terrific movie and it is a shame that it is not available for us to purchase. please contact me at shawe49@aol.com - i want to give my thanks to a wonderful lady that responded to my message almost a year later. she had a copy of the movie and was so kind to send it to me. she is a great fan of this movie as i am. with her help, there have been 3 happy ladies to receive these dvds'. she is waiting for the book that it is based on. i am checking with my local library for it, titled 'mrs maitlands affair, by margarett lynn. i am sure it is great also. many thanks to julie for her graciousness and friendship. i am your friend always,/ sharon

roy thinnes and joan hackett are superb in this 1970 melodrama. the lush settings, the haunting music, and plot twists make it a truly interesting film. i had seen it when it first came out on tv. once more it aired when i had a vcr, but i did not have a chance to tape it. would love it on vhs if someone has a copy. apart from the suspense (which is worked in beautifully) i feel the story is unique, and is pretty much true to the book, mrs. maitland's affair by margaret lynn. i would say that it was one of the greatly overlooked best films of the 1970's out of movies made for tv. i have given the film a number #10 rating, because it is done with so much originality. there is a true pathos and air of romance which has the viewer sympathizing with the culprit.

i first saw this movie at least thirty years ago, and it remains one of my all-time faves! it's a classic - the intriguing plot, great characters, suspense and shocking twist ending (all set against the backdrop of the gorgeous monterey/big sur coast) never get old. roy thinnes portrays johnny brant, a captivating character that grows more mysterious as his true identity unfolds. the acting is great and believable; viewers get caught up in the web that develops between the workaholic husband, disenchanted wife and the alluring stranger (thinnes as brant). i have searched for a copy to buy for years - i guess tv movies don't get released to video, unfortunately. great movie, see it if you can find it.

this movie has a twist that caught me off-guard. it made me go over the scenes in my mind to see if there were any clues along the way. loved the gorgeous roy thinnes and joan hackett's skillful acting. the beautiful, haunting music stays with me as well as the intriguing story.

some tv programs continue into embarrassment (my beloved 'x-files' comes to mind.) i've been a fan of dennis farina since 'crime story,' another late, lamented show. 'buddy faro' never had a chance. the series had a good premise and great actors. it's really, really a shame.

i agree with all aforementioned comments. this show was a delight to watch. funny, witty, terrific acting and zany sets. it's always a thrill to find a show that is smartly written, assumes the audience has brains and displays subtle humor. i would spend good, hard-earned cash money to see it again on dvd. and as long as we're requesting smart series that never got a chance...how about dvd releases of maximum bob (another well written, odd duck show with a delightful cast of characters.) and add to the list...middle ages or frank's place. there has to a way to release these shows out of the vaults and into the hands of devoted fans and new audiences.

for some reason, some shows just fail...some deservedly, some not... buddy faro was a clever show with interesting characters and dark humor that was enjoyable to watch...maybe it was never intended to be a big hit, but it had a "quirkiness" about it that made it enjoyable... that being said it appears i may have been the only one watching....dennis farina and frank whaley were casted perfectly in their respective roles...production quality and writing were great and vegas was the perfect backdrop... hopefully the first and only season will be released on dvd as i believe it deserves some notoriety... maybe at least make it on tv land.... cheers

chris penn is hilarious as the all-time stoner brother of jeff spicoli. this movie is great because it was a lot more real and funnier than fast times at ridgemont high. casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all eddie van halen which went on to become songs on ou812 and unlawful carnal knowledge. this movie is one of the great stoner film heroes with cheech and chong. fast times was more depressing than funny. abortions, friends cheating on friends, jerking off in bathrooms, bad jobs, and failing school. someone must hate the eighties to like ridgemont more than the wild life. the film even had great cameos like the maker of city limits michelle schocked in the liquor store or ben stein in his first role in the sunny's surplus store.

this movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is 80's entertainment. oh don't get me wrong, most of the music back then sucked. i only ever liked the metal bands from the 80s. bands that had some balls. forget that whiny keyboard crap and all that 'life is horrible and i want to die' garbage. but the movies from the 80's are the best. they were all about nonsense and just having a good time. this movie exemplifies that! party! get naked! get laid! woooooohooooo!

at the time of this writing (january 25, 2006), i am saddened to hear of the passing within the past few hours of chris penn. other than footloose, the wild life is the film that i remember chris most from.i still remember in the film, with slight fondness, of chris' wrestling character and teammates sitting in their favourite restaurant with a huge plate of french fries in front of them, drowned in an entire bottle of ketchup.anyhow, my comment is in regards to the title track sung by bananarama. after these many years, i still remember the rumour (canadian spelling -- lol) that bananarama was called in at the very very last moment to compose the track for the film and that they wrote the song on the plane bound to the recording studio to record the song and just after they recorded the song they went to shoot the low cost video for their title track. i heard that this entire process (from start to finish) took 4 hours to do! if this is true, then they truly are worthy of being the most successful female band of all time.anyhow this is just a rumour i had heard back in the day and still remember a generation later. perhaps anyone who reads this can comment and clarify. thanks.

this movie was really funny. the people that were expecting to see an oscar worthy comedy, should get over themselves. this was a fun movie to see with interesting and funny characters, plot lines, dialog quotes and catch phrases. i rate a movie a 10 if i have bought the dvd, or in this case, the videotape, and have watched it many times, and in this case, still laugh out loud. i have about 12 movies in my collection with a rating of 10 and about half don't have anything do do with the oscars. again, this was just a fun, light-hearted movie. i hope this comes out on dvd. i highly suggest checking this movie out, if you are in the mood for a wacky comedy.

_the wild life_ has an obvious resemblance to _fast times at ridgemont high_, and _the wild life_ comes up short.------------ some other stan wrote the above comment. of course the wild life is no ridgemont. ridgemont is the quintessential 80s flica. however, the wild life is enjoyable if you're not whiny about mindless movies being mindless movies (especially when you know it's supposed to be a mindless movie in the first place). the little latino from scarface is in this movie and he's straight disrespectful ("i got visa...masterrrrr charrrrge!!") the colonel also makes an appearance ("lawsuit..."). rip the colonel 1931-1997.this movie is no worse than a 6 in comparison to other genres, btw. it is no worse than a 7 in terms of other 80s teen comedies at that. it does very much have the feel of a cameron crowe movie. only staniels gave it a 5.

fast times it ain't. but check this movie out, it has a heart. pour yourself a drink and enjoy. it's loaded with a slew of just-beginning stars. sherilyn fenn has her first on-screen credited cameo. chris penn, lea thompson, eric stotz, jenny wright, rick moranis, etc.--they all look so young. oh and if you look closely the cop's wife is nancy wilson from the rock band heart.

i watched this film in a singapore theatre yesterday (4 february, 2006)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through.ms aparna sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds.we have had hollywood movies on this subject such as "one flew over the cuckoo's nest" where jack nicholson carried away the honours. since then research has helped provide more insights into the problem and clearing some misconceptions about treatment. in "... cuckoo's nest," for example shock therapy has been portrayed as barbaric, but in "15 ..." the point has been made that it is not as bad as it has been made out to be.the other misconception is that abuse in childhood is a cause for schizophrenia. but scholars such as dr. e. fuller torrey have emphasised that studies have shown that childhood schizophrenia is a brain disease and is thought to have some genetic roots.it is now established that schizophrenia can be treated like any clinical ailment and its advance can be checked if detected early. even in fairly advanced stages regular medication and counselling can be effective.the same understanding shown by ms sen is evident in the way the actors play out their parts. in keeping with the gravity of the theme, the acting is controlled throughout with ms konkana sen-sharma's evocative silences and eyes mirroring the helpless confusion of a disturbed mind speaking louder than some of the rantings we are used to in most of the movies that have included mentally challenged characters.like me most of the audience in the theatre appeared confused at the abrupt ending. it leaves lot of questions hanging in terms of the plot.has meethi's search ended? why is she not found in no. 15? were children actually playing when meethi strode past the gates with her eyes sparkling with recognition? can anyone sort out this jigsaw puzzle?

comeundone, i love you! i could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. my family has not seen this movie yet, but i know them too well; they will hate it. but this time, i watched it alone and i found that it affected me greatly. although the movie is long in length, i was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. i initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.but like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality. instead, it challenges it and the viewer to think strongly about what the word "normal" means. it also gives you the insight to personally think about what the ending means, i can say that i loved how it turned out and i'm happy for mithi.

i resisted watching 15 park avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.once in a while, movies like 15 park avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.the movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. aparna sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. the impeccable character development, "just right" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...i have a renewed respect for konkana sen sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic mithi. she beats expectation yet again after page-3 and mr.& mrs.iyer. prof. anjali's role is very well developed and shabana does full justice to the character. rahul bose, shefali chaya, waheeda rehman add incredible flavor to the movie.i define "shower moments" as thoughts of scenes from a movie that you ponder over in your shower endlessly, till your wife/girlfriend/mom bangs at the door. 15pa delivers many "shower moments" especially the conversation between anjali and her mother where the mother is cautious when talking to anjali about her thoughts. it immediately brings out anjali's personality to the audience.the end is a very bold statement by the director; probably too westernized for the indian audience; yet delivers the elements to promote the movie from a "good" to a "great" status.

our family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. the theme was well handled by the director with great performances from shabana azmi, konkana sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. the climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called "good". we are still trying to understand what was the director trying to convey? were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? a better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship. this however should not take away credit that is due to konkana and shabana azmi for relating so well with the characters!

...as valuable as king tut's tomb! (ok, maybe not that valuable, but worth hunting down if you can). i notice no one has commented on this movie for some years, and i hope a fresh post will spark some new comments. this is a film that i remembered only snippets of from childhood, and only saw recently when i tired of waiting for fox to honour its own past, and hunted down the korean dvd (in english, but with unremovable korean subtitles). i won't go through another long plot description - suffice to say that seeing it for the first time in its proper widescreen format left me agape at the vistas and the scope of the film. the matte paintings still hold up, and the palace sets are truly breathtaking. but it is the smaller scale details that lend this film its depth and richness, offering a glimpse into the lifestyles of egypt's poor as well as its elite. the bazaars, hovels, docks, embalming houses, and taverns are as fascinating as pharaoh's throne room. while errors abound on the large scale (most notably the dynastic succession), the details are more meticulously researched than the vast majority of hollywood's films. visually, it's not without its flaws - the interiors are often too overly lit and colourful to blend seamlessly with the exteriors. nevertheless, this is a movie that should be credited for being as audacious in the small as it is in the large. tedious? in parts, absolutely. overacted? underacted? yes, both - though 'understated' might be a more apt description. too long? absolutely not. i wished they had spent more time with sinuhe's experiences in the house of death, and among the hittites, and less with his 'romance' with nefer, though. historically inaccurate? yes, that too, but so was shakespeare. nobody chastises him for it. i appreciate historical accuracy as much as the next guy, but ultimately it has to be remembered that cinema is theater, not a history lesson.

based on mika waltari's book,this second cinemascope movie ever made is full of rich color,beautiful music and panoramic spectacle.the plot sometimes gets muddled in contrite wording,but all in all it has a strong social content:man is ruled by his emotions,and that every action has an equal consequence.but to truly enjoy this film,first see the movie,then read the book.although different,it sheds light on a whole lot of things that were not seen on the screen,and gives breath to some more of the depth of sinuhe.

this is not what one would term a happy tale. the titled leading character (edmund purdom as the egyptian) does not get the gal - although he does (?) evidently get the 'last' word, the otherwise principal tragic figure (michael wilding as the politically myopic pharaoh) ends up tragically, and the wrong guy  even if it is victor mature, winds up winning-all the marbles. peter ustinov possibly had gotten the best part (kafka) and arguably may have stolen some if not most of the movie except for top-billed jean simmons as the somewhat brighter-thanaverage barmaid (merit) whom just possibly has more on the ball  intellectually and spiritually, than all of the rest of them put together.the brooding and pessimistic sinuhe the physician (that's purdom) is portrayed as a dark, cynical, tortured soul whom spends the entire plot  his lifetime, seeking the meaning of 'life.' (btw, and to paraphrase john lennon, 'life' is what happens while you're making other plans.) pardon the lack of philosophical depth in the prior parenthetic comment, but eventually the plot unfolds to reveal just that ! and speaking philosophically, as if things aren't morose and negative enough, john carradine (as the un-named grave robber) pops-up in a cameo role in the middle of the flick espousing that 'life' basically is meaningless and is only worth living as a poor alternative to the eventual ultimate disappointment.so here we are over 200 words in and i haven't really had a kind word, so why the heck did i rate it so high ? well there is a lot of shakespherian tragedy and bunch of moral worth in it. there's ethical contrasts, true friendships, true & unrequited (almost) love, and - despite limitations of 50s production capabilities, it is very well (sound) staged, pleasing both the eye and ear, and very well/evenly paced . the acting is, for the most part, uniformly very good  given it's a 50s costume drama, and the interactions are believable right down to the characters' fatal flaws - which abound, and in that doing justice to the best of greek tragedy.there is some redemption, sinuhe does discover and embrace his son  played by tommy retigg whom, despite ustinov's best efforts, really needed lassie to pull it off. a couple of other 'misguided' souls get their just desserts  the 'foreign' fleshpot nefer (bella darvi)  apparently in egypt on a carnal exploitation work-study visa, whom earlier cruelly even mercilessly spurned sinuhe -\and\- the dyke'ish princess baketamon (gene tierney as pharoah wilding's sister) whom knew a deep dark secret about sinuhe's ancestry, and then tried to use it to set him against his friend, her brother the pharaoh  nice people, huh.purdom's performance is actually something to behold. he carries off the dirge well enough that somewhere before the end of the pix you want to smack him across the puss, grab him by the lapels, and say "look dummy pull yourself together, the glass ain't half empty it's half full !" and then finding that you're personally disappointed in horemheb - truly sinuhe's best friend, (victor mature as pharoah's top soldier) for himself having that flaw in his character that prevents him succeeding at doing something positive.i wonder if the secret to the whole movie is that it very quickly achieves and then sustains the necessary "suspension of disbelief" and early on gets you understanding and worrying about the characters, caring to the point that you really feel sorry for them and their missed chances at happiness; a happiness that otherwise wasn't all that far from their grasp.can't understand why this one isn't already out on dvd and hope that gets corrected soon.

i'll start off right at the beginning by saying "i like this movie." it's sweeping, it's grand, it's gripping and it's fun. sinhue the physician,sits in front of his small stone hut writing his memoirs. and what a story it is! taken from a river and reared by an elderly couple who doted on him, he becomes a physician to the poor. he befriends horemheb who sees glory while sinhue sees healing. and both run into the future pharaoh anknaten (forgive my spellings), who endures an epileptic fit.and this pharaoh has another "flaw": he believes in one god instead of a pantheon of gods. back then, this was totally revolutionary. sinhue and horemheb grow up. one night, sinhue sees a woman who makes him lose his senses. he gives up his practice, sells his parents' home and even their tombs just to spend a night with her. does he? i won't tell. meanwhile, merit, a tavern maid played with sweet simplicity belying strength by jean simmons, falls in love with sinhue. she falls under his spell and under the spell of the belief in one god.victor mature overacts perfectly as horemheb. edmond purdom is sincere as sinhue the lost physician (does he find redemption? stay tuned). even bela darvi, the woman who steals sinhue's heart isn't as bad as everyone has said. the fact that she was daryl f. zanuck's mistress had nothing to do with the casting - right? yeah, right...still, she wasn't that bad _ i've seen worse. i think she did better in "the egyptian" than many of today's young actresses have done in anything. i said it before and i'll say it again -- i like this movie. i recommend it. it makes you think despite some hammy acting. have fun with this movie; it's worth it.

hello all! i went to this movie without any expectation though i knew maniratnam would've given an excellent film! i was stunned!! the backdrop is the struggle between the tamils settled in sri lanka and the government. the story is about how an young girl amudha who lives with her foster parents at chennai, india leaves to sri lanka in search of her real mother. the high points of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and ofcourse, the cinematography, editing and all other technical details. full marks to the cast and crew. i have to mention about the cinematography as it brings out the war in such a way that you feel yourself being there. excellent work! though the war sequences reminded me of saving private ryan, such a work was never attempted on indian screen. overall the movie is great! and hats off to mr.maniratnam.mani ratnam has once again proved that he is a director who can take indian cinema to great heights! i would love to watch this film again and again. an excellent film and a must see.

to tell you the truth, i do not speak tamil, and i did not understand the film. my good tamil friend, kaneswaran kumarswamypillai (wow, what a long name), explained every thing to me. what a great movie!!! after watching this movie, i felt i should have watched many more movies from tollywood (tamil film industry). the war scenes were amazing, camera work excellent, and plot beautiful. the actress "simran", what a beauty. give her an award for best looking someone. ding, ding, ding, come on i smell a oscar winner. i didnt understand the songs, but they were excellent. mani ratnam is a great director, and i hope his next film was a success.

you don't have to be a tamilian to appreciate this gem of a movie.i don't know a word of tamil and saw this movie only because a friend had recommended it to me.understanding a movie without knowing the language is quite tough but i could make out the story because the lead actors (and actresses)emoted really well.and the little girl was really cute (she wasn't irritating like child actors in most hindi movies).the story is really touching and hats off to mr. ratnam for trying something different.the relationship between the parents and their children are shown quite realistically.(i could identify with the characters in the movie).it was alltogether a movie that will remain in my heart forever and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to my friends.also the songs are just out of this world!they were beautifully and meaningfully picturised.if only i could understand the right meaning of the lyrics:(

i think this is one of the best tamil movies i've seen in a while. i love the fact that it doesn't revolve around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly. the cast did a great job and i especially congratulate the litte girl. she was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother. best of all are the songs, beautiful music and moving lyrics. there are some great songs in this move ya'll! especially 'kannathil mutthamittal' and 'velai pookal'. great songs, both of them. i highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and some great acting (and superb songs! ). cheers simran.

when i stepped into the theater, i thought this was going to be a great movie. and i was not disappointed one bit. wow! this movie is brilliant! the emotions felt through out the whole movie are extraordinary! great acting by madhavan and simran. beautiful music by a.r. rahman. this might most probably be the best tamil movie i've seen in ages. mani ratnam has yet again proved that he is the best in making meaningful and heartfelt movies.this movie is basically about a young girl (p.s. keerthana) who is in search of her biological mother (nandita das) who abandoned her in a refugee camp to fight for her country just like her husband (j.d. chakravathy). a young novelist (madhavan) finds out about this young girl's story and decides to write a story about her. he and his wife (simran) decide to adopt this young child but one day she finds out that they are not her real parents and decides to search for her biological mother.this movie really screams excellent. the way mani ratnam presented the movie is magnificent. my rating - 10/10

this is an incredible movie that begins slowly. it leads you along in thinking of it as a typical maudlin family drama. then, in the second half, there is a plot twist that utterly transforms this into a profound tale of global scope.if you are unaccustomed to films from india, with song and dance routines seemingly grafted on for no reason, stick with this movie. especially beginning with the second half, you will find this movie an amazing experience.*********** minor spoiler here ************* i have but one complaint with the movie. the dialog at the end (between amudha and mds) seemed very weak and missed the opportunity to bring in the war as a force that transforms people's lives. it was implied all along, but there should have been something about the importance of the struggle for mds.

one more classic performance by maniratnam and his team. they can be proud to show this movie at all film festivals for it has got everything that needs to name it as an "all time classic". the war and its impacts in sri lanka through the eyes of a ten year old girl is the movie all about but the scenes and circumstances will surely be not the one that you will expect. madhavan no wonder he is one of the best actors in the country who can always add beauty and unique identity for the role he plays, and it needs real daringness to act as a father for three kids when he is considered as a dream boy with a glamorous personality in the industry. music by ar rahman makes the movie a special one for those who love melodies. above all the story and the way it is told makes it as the best movie in the recent times.

mani is back wit a rathnam(gem) he manages to capture the mental trauma of a small girl searching 4 her mother they way he goes about showing the problems-in ceylon is a treat.. .. tis movie is a must watch.the musical score does enhance the viewing pleasure.. rahman a find of rathnam has given some great tunes the lyrics r apt 4 the movie the locations used for the movie are very good and makes viewing pleasant the movie starts of in a light manner moves over to capture the feelings of the girl finally goes on o shed light into the life of people in war torn places across the world this is yet another classic from manirathnam

i finally snagged a copy of kannathil muthamittal through netflix and spent new yera's eve watching an amazing drama unfold. it began with shyama (a winsome nandita das) getting married to dhileepan in the backwaters of sri lanka and then a war takes over their romance. shyama has to flee to india and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child. several years later we see amudha, a playful well-loved child (p. s. keerthana), who is the darling (or burden) of teachers, parents and fellow schoolmates alike, in a very how to solve a problem like maria sequence. on her birthday she is told by her parents thiru (madhavan) and indra (simran) that she is not their biological child, she was adopted. this tilts her confident love-filled world and she constantly dwells on why her birth mother left her. several attempts at truancy later the adoptive parents take her to sri lanka to try to find her birth mother. the country is torn asunder by a raging civil war and the trio are inevitably caught up in the mess. but this also leads to their meeting the new shyama - one who finally is confronted by amudha and asked why she abandoned her daughter.the story of a child who has to grapple with the fact that she was abandoned at birth, her obsessive drive to reconnect with her birth mother, the unconditional love of the adoptive parents, the demons that drive the birth mother, the normalcy of chennai and the horrors of terrorism ravaged sri lanka - mani ratnam made a masterful film that blended many ingredients into a saga that is soul stirring. ar rahman's music beautifully complements the magical and the poignant moments in the film. the film has excellent performances from madhavan, nandita das, simran and an absolute stunner role as amudha - the abandoned one - done by the child artiste p. s. keerthana. this performance won her a national award.the cinematography is visual poetry - each frame is beautifully crafted and breathtakingly shot. i am intrigued by the connection mani ratnam has with terrorism, love and obsessions. i think his exploration of these subjects is absolutely outstanding. mahadevan's character was quite unique - his passion and idealism did not make him selfish, rather was well matched with how much he cared for the little girl. his one liners were hilarious. the mother played by simran was also quite multi-dimensional - she was idealistic, loved the adopted daughter but also worried about her biological kids. the shock, angst, and obsession of the child amudha was outstandingly portrayed by p. s. keerthana. her wide accusing eyes did most of the talking. in fact the enigmatic characters were those of nandita das, and her husband. perhaps mani deliberately made them mysterious so as to not give us overt ideas of why they were the way they were - the enigma of why a terrorist becomes what he or she becomes. it also kept him from being judgmental - this was another conflict in which he took no sides but merely reported while showing the human tragedy.kannathil muthamittal is visual poetry and a soul stirring drama - i rarely weep in the movies, but this one left me moist eyed and a little heartsick. this is a beautiful film - a treasure and a keeper if you can find a copy; beg borrow or steal one today and watch the film!

the trailer goes nowhere near and only scratches the surface of the film and rightly so too, not because it has that obligation to keep its real narrative under wraps, but because what actually transpires, will provoke entirely different lines of questioning, some of which are frustratingly not answered in the film, leaving you to your own devices to interpret the series of events. which of course means plenty of material for an after-show discussion.metaphorically, the box refers to how us humans tend to subconsciously hole ourselves into situations or things in everyday life, and how our enclosed thoughts tend to see things from a certain perspective, seldom out of the box. there's a speech made near the end by one of the characters that will leave you pondering over this fact, which governs the basis of the entire film, and even threading on existentialism, where our bodies are mere vessels for the soul, and from cradle to the grave we put ourselves in more boxes in a way of life fashion.what i disliked about the film, is how it tried to sound intelligent through the frequent name dropping of covert government agencies like the cia and nsa, as though there's something overtly clandestine about these agencies that we should be aware of. they serve little purpose other than to put every action and every person under scrutiny, that nobody can be trusted, wrecking havoc in a sense to both the characters and the audience as we try to keep up with trust issues to aid in the interpretation of the narrative. having it set in 1976, against a nasa backdrop of manned space missions, and in langley, virginia, also provided that heightened sense of wary that will sap your energies as you sit through it patiently.based upon the short story button, button written by richard matheson and made into an episode of the twilight zone, the story follows the lewis family, where husband arthur (james marsden) works at nasa and develops a prosthetic foot for his teacher wife norma (cameron diaz), and you'd think it's all happy family with their son walter (sam oz stone), until one day a mysterious man called arlington steward (frank langella in a two-face inspired facial effect) whom we are preempted of in the opening, comes knocking and giving them a deal or no deal button in a box. plunge the button and they'll get a million bucks (we're talking in dollar terms of the 70s here) although a stranger out there will die. if they don't, well the deal's got an expiry date.the story would dictate a deal be made, which of course sparks off a mysterious sequence of events that unfold, with even more shady characters (who nosebleed) appearing, some whom are inexplicably zombie like, apparently all under the influence, or employment, or arlington steward. whether or not steward is death, a clandestine government employee, a messenger from god or a representative of aliens after an anal probe, remains unanswered, so whichever way you look at it, it's as if he's delivering something expected, just begging that mankind will shake off its innate greed so that his work can be cut short and to return to wherever he came from.if you need a little distraction from the disparate scenes which make up the narrative, the production sets and art direction are gorgeous in recreating the 70s look, as you try to figure out the mystery of the consequences that stem from a result of not fully understanding the fine print. it's full circle this examination of human nature, of our greed for immediate gratification, manifesting its result in longer term pain, confusion and further choices that we'll make based on real sacrifices. nifty special effects come into play as well, though it just leaves more room open as to the genre of the film.so is it horror, science fiction, or a mystery thriller? it's everything rolled into one actually, together with a sprinkling of the philosophical. just don't go expecting a straight narrative film with clean and easy answers at the end  this is like an x-files episode on steroids.

the box is one of the strangest movies i have ever seen. to explain my experience, let me use this word picture: imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but twilight zone reruns. the resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your iv. the dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.summary: a man shows up at the door of a couple. he gives them a box with a button on it. press the button, they will get a million dollars in cash and a person they don't know will die. i'll try not to spoil anything, but from there things devolve into a plot so intertwined and complex and purely original that it will make you question your sanity. but hey, most of us have been sane for a while now, and change is good.pros: amazing storyline, overall good acting, not a slow moment once it gets going. it asks questions of human morality that are rarely, if ever asked in popular culture. this movie is deep, it has meaning. its not summer blockbuster special effects fluff (not that there's anything wrong with that); this movie had a relatively low budget and it showed in some places. but i think it is perhaps that very thing that makes me like it so much.cons: the first twenty minutes, before it gets going, are really quite slow. at the end of the movie, you will be so confused that you just have to sit down and think for a good half hour. i can guarantee that this movie will not get rave reviews from your peers or most critics; it is far too strange and there aren't explosions every three seconds. in fact there are no explosions of any kind in this movie (besides your brain popping from trying to understand exactly what the heck just happened). personally i don't think this is a bad thing, but many will.rating: easily a 9/10. i have never had an experience like watching this movie. the only reason i can't give it a 10/10 is that it is just too wrapped up in itself. there are several large things left unexplained at the end that are still bugging me as i sit here writing this. but overall, this is the best experience i have had in a movie theater in quite a long time. but be warned, you will not like this movie if you can't sit back, turn on your suspension of disbelief to about 150%, and prepare your brain to do some impressive acrobatics.visit www.thestuffblag.com for more reviews

the director of kannathil muthamittal directed the first indian film i had seen "dil se" which led me down the path of buying well over 122 hindi dvds in thecourse of four months. i can say i understood the total attraction, i wassomehow confused as to why the film would stop for "music videos". it was an excellent movie, i didn't know what to make of the dancing and the femalevocals were a bit shrill for my western ears, but somehow i found ar rahmen's score hypnotic. i bought the soundtrack the following day and then lagan, kuch kuch hota hai and k3g the following week and with the exception of "ichi thekiller" a few other korean films , i can't be bothered to watch much else. kind of strange for someone who has only watched a strict diet of hong kong, horrorand action/science fiction films for the past 30 years.but i should get back to kannathil muthamittal, it is one of the mani ratman's latest efforts and i laughed, cried, got totally mad, terrified and most of all i didn't feel manipulated. the acting was superb, the photography was beautiful, i think you could stop the movie at any given time and would notice that any give frame would be worthy of painting. the music fit the movie perfectly and after thecredits rolled, i wanted to watch again... so i did.it would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you may miss the pleasure of watching the events unfold and the characters develop. this is what great film is all about! i stood and applauded in my home theater when it was over!my wife is watching now, and i can't wait for her reaction, i can't expect it will be anything less than mine.

this movie was astonishing how good it was! the plot is extraordinary, and the acting spectacular. at first i thought this wasn't going to be that great because of a summary, but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie, it struck me that i was dead wrong. i literally cried about four or five times in this movie, and despite this, i must've watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week! no, the song scenes were not as awesome as they could've been, but the plot is what really gets you. american or asain, i would recommend this to anyone--and i have now. i guarantee that after seeing this one, you'll get the best out of it, and its plot. i hope you feel the same, and write a rave review too!

i had always heard about this great mini-series, but viewed it for the first time this week, july of 2007. i can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. the story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the civil war. i cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's. many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life. the costumes and sets were gorgeous! i thoroughly enjoyed watching both parts i and ii. part iii is a disappointment.

i own the miniseries on dvd because i love this story so much. this is one of the best period pieces on the civil war that i have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war. the costumes are great, the story lines are great, i love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives. there is a great balance of good and evil. some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch. every time something more despicable than the last happens i curse the tv as if they can hear me. i love how this miniseries makes me feel engaged in it's drama. i would advise however not to watch the third movie in the dvd series. it's a let down compared to the first two movies and most of the original characters do not return. i don't wish to remember how the third movie ended, i prefer to live with the thoughts of the ending in the second movie. it makes me happy.

i watched this series on tv in 1990 and absolutely loved it (i was nine years old). i bought the first dvd box about six month ago and got the second a couple of days ago (thanks to my dear husband). gosh...it was hard to get any sleep with all the thoughts in my head...what was gonna happen to madeline and george etc. slave issues and civil war has always fascinated me (a 25 year old finn).i advise to read slaves in the family by edward ball for those who want to take a peek in the past and try to understand what really happened.i'm not sure if i want to see heaven and hell after so many people have told here that it wasn't really that good.

i absolutely adored this movie as a child and still do as an adult. to say that is even an understatement. my sister, brother and i watched it one year at our grandparents' house during christmas vacation. they had taped it from tv. our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. not so! we became mesmerized. they could not have unglued us if they tried. it became a cherished yearly tradition. we loved everything about it: the time, the romance, the battle scenes, the villains etc.come on, who can resist hating that psycho bent with his constant sir!? classic! moreover, who can resist cheering wildly when justin falls off the balcony?! what a triumphant moment! i always had a special place in my heart for orry and madelaine. they were so romantic. the theme song alone can get me to tear up a little. this movie is incredibly moving and i challenge anyone to stick with it until the very end. it's worth it!!

i saw this movie when i was a lot younger but it captured me. i loved orry and george's relationship so much. i was so enraptured in orry and madenline's love story. i am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. i especially liked it when he first met her. i just wish he had more time with her and their baby. so you know in book three i was so hurt that he died. i didn't really understand that because they had little time together. i just loved patrick in this movie. i just bought all three books together and i can't stop watching them. my 12 year old son is stuck on it. he likes the fighting in the war. i cry every time. i wish i could meet patrick and madeline in person! it was a wonderful movie and cast!

i was 13 when this mini-series (and its sequel north and south, book ii) first aired. i had already been captivated by the personal interest stories in/around our american civil war, which is what interested me in watching this made-for-tv program.i loved it. and now i'm 29 years old and i only love it more. it is full of history, beautiful costuming, real-life characters woven in and out of the lives of fictional characters, all of whom you come to care deeply about. there is intrigue, love, loyalty, betrayal, family, extended family, lust, battles, victory, defeat and reconstruction.even though i had the full set of episodes on tapes i recorded back when it originally aired, i purchased the full set of both n&s and n&s ii from columbia house some years ago when they became available. once every few years i'll take a whole weekend and watch all the installments back to back - and am sad when the last episode rolls to an end, because i find myself wanting to continue watching the story of the lives of these characters.i cannot recommend this mini-series more highly.

this was the one movie to see about the civi war. my aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the justin and madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. the script was genuine, and accurate. the costumes were tastefully done, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. i dearly love patrick swayze and james ried. they were the best 2 choices, and it even had a great supporting cast. the civil war is my favorite thing in american history, and i love movies about it. i have seen quite a few, and this movie and it's sequal north and south book 2 took the cake. if you haven't seen it, rent it. as soon as possible. it's quite an eduation.

a story about love and hate, tragedy and happiness, and most of all, friendship set in the very interesting time of the american civil war.gets you interested in history, gets you emotionally involved and makes you feverishly wait for the next episode.moreover, the casting was splendid. many superstars appear in short cameos, the leading roles are played by a big array of talented mimes - kirstie alley and terri garber should be mentioned here - this is simply a superb example for a tv production as it should be.not to forget the sheer loveliness of wendy kilbourne portraying constance :-)

i am a history teacher and overall i was pleased with the movie. my teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.the battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. lloyd bridges as jefferson davis and hal holbrook as abraham lincoln stand out. we all thought phillip casnoff as bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. we all thought charles stole the show from orry and george.we will enjoy the movie again!

"north & south" the television mini-series is to the 80's what "rich man, poor man" (the first-ever tv mini-series) was to the 70's.it's a fabulous adaptation of the first classic novel in the trilogy from author john jakes. the story itself covers the two decades leading up to the years of the election of president abraham lincoln and the imminent proclamation of the civil war - north versus south. the intertwining stories evolve around the families of the hazards (the 'north' in the title) and the mains and their two central figures of george and orry who form a friendship whilst embarking on their west point training in 1842."north & south" is a wonderful historic timeline and as i have grown older (and wiser!) it very much interests me to learn about the contrasting attitudes to such controversial aspects as 'slavery' and 'abolitionists', and how these attitudes originated.the series also portrays some great characterisation development as we get to know about the friends and enemies in george and orry's lives, and also the women that stole their hearts as young men. this aspect of the story also uncovers a romantic tale that is set to the turbulent backdrop of the american civil war."north & south", along with "rich man, poor man" is overshadowed by 1977's "roots" as the greatest mini-series of all-time. however, it does come a close second/third and also shares the same kind of timeline and themes as "roots". but, don't let this one get away, even if it's just to see the great scenery, costumes, and brilliant all-star cast including gene kelly, johnny cash, elizabeth taylor, james stewart, olivia de havilland, lesley-anne down et al. the series is beautifully crafted and is firmly tied to actual historic events and it's a pity the emmys and golden globes didn't honour a lot more of the actors and actresses for their portrayals. patrick swayze and james read, the two virtual unknown lead actors at the time, turn in compelling performances as orry main and george hazard respectively. however, it's kirstie alley's riveting performance as george's 'abolitionist' sister virgilia that steals the show many times. plus, terri garber, david carradine and philip casnoff as elkanah bent are the delicious villains of the piece you just love to hate."north & south" books 1 & 2 are now available on two dvd sets.

of all the seasons and episodes of the twilight zone, after seeing all the great, mind boggling, thought provoking stories, this one stands on top. that's right. this story, this one entitled the hunt tops the large number of the finest scripts in television history.true, there are no interplanetary space flights, no inexplicable cracks in time. there is no living nightmare, no sudden changes of setting. there is seemingly nothing out of the ordinary for our protagonist to deal with.the main character, played by veteran character actor arthur hunnicut, sets out from his cabin in the hills, accompanied by his faithful hound, to hunt raccoon. because the raccoon is a predominantly nocturnal animal hunt is by moonlight.the man and dog soon encounter a large raccoon, who hops on the dog's back and attempts to drown the hound in a pond. the man jumps in to help his dog. there is a sort of almost black-out, after which the pair are seen on the shore, in a lying, almost sleep like position.calling his dog by name, (rip, i think) the old man sets off to return home. when he arrives, he finds the wife weeping and unresponsive to his conversation. he also observes visitors coming and going to his house, paying respects and giving words to console his wife.still seeming puzzled at the strange reception and goings on around the home cabin, the man and rip take off on a long walk down the road, where he remarks out loud that he did not remember such a long fence in these parts. he eventually comes upon a rather large fellow, dressed in garb similar to his-overalls, hat, work shirt. they are at a gate, which leads to an area where a lot of smoke is freely rising up. the gate keeper is overly eager in his persuasive pitch in trying to get the man to enter. rip sounds displeasure. the gate man tells the old man that he may enter, but the dog would have to remain outside, offering to watch the animal for him. the man will have none of it and the two continue on their way down the path.after a little more hiking they come upon a second gated entrance where the gate keeper recognizes the man and welcomes him. when the old man reports what has happened down the road, telling him of how the guy at the other gate tried to separate the man and dog, and added, "with no dogs allowed, that must be a hell of a place!" the 2nd gate keeper stated that he was right! "that's exactly what it is!" our family had lost our 1st dog, lady-a mixed lab, in october of 1981. about 6 months later, as good fortune would have it, the wife(deanna) and myself along with our 2 daughters (jennifer 9 and michelle 6) viewed this episode on tv, wgn tv, channel 9 chicago. well, it all made perfect sense to us at that time.we're certain that anyone who has had that relationship with a family dog, would agree. the episode still brings a condition of watery eyes to this now 60 year old writer.

a warmly sentimental tale from the author of the waltons. were someone to pitch the material to me, i would probably reject it as too maudlin. but the dramatization here manages a tear without the expected embarrassment. no one in the 1950's was better at lovable hayseeds than arthur hunnicutt. his appeal here is put to consummate use as a mountain man doggedly faithful to a loyal hunting hound. their fates are tied together as inseparably as any human bond. good. i see a subtle environmental message here. all critters go to heaven, because how can we condemn any poor devil that merely follows instinct in order to stay alive. there is no deceit in the kingdom of animals, and yet how cruelly we often treat them. an oddly satisfying episode that confirms this important message.

red dust is both well acted and well made but what the movie is about i think will bore many viewers as it did to me. there was a film that was out earlier called "in my country" with sam jackson and it was not that well received and both films were about nearly the same exact thing, i do think red dust was better because of the more interesting performances especially by future oscar winner chiwton ejofor but the plot is just to lacking, it starts off pretty strong but then the film hits the viewers with countless un-interesting court room sessions, this could have been a great film if the writing was not so lacking. but see if for the performances.

we saw this film in toronto at the film festival last year. it was a truly moving experience. i had heard of the truth and reconcilliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. this film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts, understand the events from the points of view of others involved, and grieve together. archbishop tutu and the others involved in developing the t & r process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions. seeing this film gave me hope for the human race. if we can do t & r, we just might not destroy ourselves. people will look back at t and r as the first step out of human adolescence and toward maturity.as a film, of course there were flaws. i did not notice any major problems in acting, directing, or writing - but for the first time in years i was totally lost in a film, so perhaps i did not notice.see this film. the audience in toronto would not give up the stage for the next film, we had so many questions and comments for the stars and director. tom hooper, jamie bartlett, and chiwetel ejiofor went outside to the sidewalk to continue the conversation. people came by just to shake their hands and thank them for the film. it moved us all.

police officer dirk hendricks (jamie bartlett) files an amnesty application alex mpondo (chiwetel ejiofor).a member of the south african parliament who cant remember the torture he once endured as a captive political activist.south african born attorney sarah barcant (hilary swank), meanwhile, returns to her homeland to represent mpondo.as well as steve sizela, mpondo's friend who was arrested along with him, and never heard from again.this film is one of the best films to come out about the south african regime of aparthied, in the past.everybody should watch it.

i saw the messiah:- the first killings and i thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes i have seen, ever. it was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, i cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. jamie draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is jez clifton, the cop. to be able to do that, well, i certainly wouldn't be able to do it, well not without cracking anyway. i really do love and care for jamie draven with all of my heart and i always will, until the end of time, i think that jamie is the sweetest, cutest, sexiest guy in the world. i absolutely love jamie in ultimate force also because he looks god damn sexy in the blacks that he wore. i love jamie love paula draven-x-

messiah was compulsive viewing from start to finish. the story centred on apparently random murders of men in london in various gruesome ways. dci red metcalfe (ken stott)has to find the truth which, to his surprise, is a little closer to home than he might think.gripping drama and ken stott was brilliant. hopefully we have not seen the last of dci red metcalfe.

obviously inspired by se7en and sometimes even more gruesome; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). great script and acting (i was especially impressed by ken stott and there were no weak points in te cast). good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. one of the best thrillers i've seen since years. although it was scheduled on bbc in three parts i watched messiah on video in one take. one point of critic; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.

i saw messiah 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of seven but it`s still compelling . much of my praise has to do with ken stott`s performance as dci red metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . it`d be easy for stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way . likewise the murders are very shocking but - unlike the sequel where the murders are carried out onscreen in a rather ott manner - there`s actually little violence shown .my only criticisms are that the red herring was too obviously a red herring which meant i wasn`t taken in by the shock twist ( and you would probably see the shock twist coming so i won`t bother with a spoiler alert ) and that when the real murderer was revealed it seemed both slightly far fetched and caused a few plot holes to appear in the story . if i remember correctly the sequel had similar problems once the murderer was revealed so maybe it`d be a good idea not to make messiah 3

having read the other comment about this superb piece of tv drama i felt compelled to balance things a little. if you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be british, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. ken stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including edward woodward and art malik. recommended. (in response to the earlier comments, although i accept that 'red' would not 'normally' drive away from a hit and run, he had just witnessed his brother arrested for murder, and i am fairly sure he does not see the boy move.)

i have to say when it comes to book to movie adaptations the bbc rarely lets me down. now regarding this mini-series. i love the starling novel, it's by far the best murder/mystery i've ever read. the mini-series, it defiantly made my day when i saw it. the primary story was kept near perfectly intact. the characters match the ones to the novel very well, the personalities and mannerisms were spot on for red and jez. i thought duncan was done very well as was kate, eric came off as too much of a simplistic character, he had a little more depth in the book, but they also altered his sub-story so that may have had to deal with it. of course there are changes, but most are cosmetic, but some i found disappointment in, the sub-story with eric murder charge was changed and that changed the whole dynamic between red and eric for the movie, and they cut out the triathalon training jez was doing. some of the other events in the book are changed to be viewer friendly. over all if you liked the book, you will like this, if you like the mini-series, then you'll love the book. i must say, this is the most accurate book to movie adaptation i've seen.

a labor of love. each frame is picture perfect and grabs you. then the sheer emotion and story-telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. the director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. you are a part of the emotional ride of the characters. i have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing. the remarkable story-telling transcends nationality and language and i felt i was a part of the drama unfolding before me. the casting is as perfect as one can get. vijay raaz, camille and benoit each hold their own. i strongly recommend this film to everyone who appreciates good cinema. i can't wait for the commercial release of this movie.

i saw this film at the seattle international film festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and indian ex-pats. the film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film. the direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. while the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack. the soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers. if you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out hari om for inspiration. it was not disclosed in the q & a, but i imagine hollywood could take a lesson in budget film-making by learning from this director.

have you ever wondered what its like to feel free? i am sure that each one of us know the meaning of freedom and never seriously think of using it to our advantage. hari om shows the audience what freedom actually means. in this film freedom is described in the form of style represented by isa's discovery of india. isa discovers her inner true love when she is in a rickshaw journey with mr. hari om. she looks at life differently and portrays freedom that every woman restricts in herself when she is in a relationship.this film is definitely "worth a watch", and i saw this the first time in dubai international film festival (diff), and i left the cinema hall with complete satisfaction."watch it"!

i have watched my fair bit of bollywood films when growing up - you know the typical plot boy meets girl, girl rejects boys, dakus (bad guys) take away girl, boy rescues girl by killing hundreds of dhakus and they happily get married (of course i've omitted an hour of musical style numbers).. well going into watch hari om, i was expecting another typical bollywood style movie; however, to my delight it turned out to be atypical and indeed quite comical. bharatbala's hari om is what could be labeled as one of those 'off beat' indian films such as the ever popular south asian hits as monsoon wedding, east is east or bend it like beckham.being of south asian decent and having watched various classic bollywood films, there was much humour and sub-dialogs which could be picked up that reminded me of the fun and charming side of indian culture (e.g., the various indo-pop numbers which were actually remade by nitin soni or the witty indian slangs that were used). hari om can be enjoyed by all south asians, and is also entertaining for those not accustom to the indian humor as the characters and plot caters to all audiences. in a cocunutshell, the movie is of auto-rickshaw driver (aka 'four-wheeler' for those of you who have traveled to india know) played by vija raaz (from monsoon wedding) who gets himself involved with a crook and ends up owing him quite a bit of money. to avoid selling his four-wheeler, 'madhuri', he escapes serendipitously with 'madhuri' and a very charismatic and lovely woman from france, isa (camille natta), who herself is escaping the boredom of her boyfriend benoit (jean marie lamour who was in swimming pool). the movie is of their journey traveling across the beautiful landscape of rajasthan  the land of love stories; through the humour you see the two main actors trying to find out who they are really are.what made the night most memorable was having the director, executive producer, main editor and even the mother of ms. natta present at the screening. after speaking with bharatbala (who actually has a zoology background) many interesting tidbits of the film were uncovered including: having the film finished only 10 days prior to the toronto international film festival and taking only 45 days to shoot, and having only five actors in the play (the rest were all first time real actors). arriving home i realized two things from the movie - that there is always a human connection between any one of us despite our differences and secondly, as the director had put it 'everybody has a love story'. its a must see for everyone!

the film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. i am the first one to agree that victor fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. i also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. so what? if it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? does every film have to make sense? does every film have to be perfect? no. a person could get razed admitting that they love this film. again, so what? it's got lovable characters, it's well shot, the acting is mostly good, it never becomes too maudlin or dramatic, it's quirky. look at how many people love i dream of jeannie. is it perfect? heck no! and while this is very different, i say check it out and you'll be in a good mood after you see it.

i absolutely love this film and have seen it many times. i taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on channel four but my tape is severely worn now and i would love a new copy of it.i have e-mailed film four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as i know hasn't been repeated since the 80's. i have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated. the performances are superb. the film has everything. its funny,sad,disturbing,exciting and totally takes you back to school days. it is extremely well paced and grips you from start to end. the scene in the shower room is particularly horrific. i also cannot hear the song badge by cream and not think of this film. this film deserves to be seen by a much larger audience as it is superb. channel four please show again or release on video or dvd.

what a surprise. a basic copycat of the comedy classic 'the nutty professor' only naughtier. funny guy tim thomerson (who steals the show as blinkin in robin hood-men in tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive dr. jekyll and the sex crazed hyde. the one scene that is really funny is when dr. lanyon (mark blankfield) catches jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: "how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter." jekyll replies, "but sir, i'm going ahead with the operation."lanyon replies back, "oh. well in that case fu** your brains out!!!"

the "all i have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..." scene was a riot. i also guffawed at the scene in the bar where hyde snorted the horse radish and flipped the bird to the japanese guy and said "pearl harbor buddy". i think my iq is higher than 115, but i'm not sure because i can't count that high.funny thing, this 10 line requirement. seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long, not too short. i hope i don't make it to 1,000 words before i get to line 10.i'm still two lines short. pardon me while i think and drink, or drink and think. it depends on whether my hands are faster than my mind. good, i think i've made it to the 10 line limit. thanks for reading!

mark blankfield (from the old late night tv show "fridays")plays dr. daniel jekyll, a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. this was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. this is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's also not above doing it all again & running through hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains. there's a few subplots like jekyll's fiancée, who is the daughter of the head doctor at our lady of suffering and pain, jekyll's employer. and there's tim thomerson as a plastic surgeon with seemingly few "real" parts and a taste for men, and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of howard hughes, and who is going to make several people rich with a complete set of organ transplants, including testicles. yeah, the humor is raunchy and silly, and overall the whole thing is fairly tasteless, but if you're not above a quick wallow in the gutter, you'll probably like it just fine. now available on dvd too, for the first time! woohoo! 7 out of 10.

"pearl harbor, buddy." this movie is brilliant! sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. i'm one that goes for silliness, much like "dumb and dumber", "airplane" and "wet hot american summer" and i have to say this easily ranks up there. movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece! when watching this, you will easily find over 20 quotes from it that you will find yourself quoting after-wards... and after to watch it again you'll find even more!

in the first transformation scene, what is the music? i've heard it was "the greeks don't get no freeks". is that right? i really liked that sound. i also liked the "hyde's got nothing to hide" in the final scenes. truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. madam woo-woo's place was reminiscent of some places i have visited myself. ivy venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. she looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit. mark blankfield reminds one of gene wilder in some ways. bess armstrong was beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time.

i love this movie a lot. i must get this on dvd. i have 2 vhs copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. i'm forever amazed that blankfield did almost nothing afterward. he made both dr. jeckle and mr. hyde totally believable.the movie is plagued by it's low budget. (one atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on, "siskel & ebert".) but, there are a thousand jokes, sight gags to subtle references, that more than compensate. i often find myself quoting lines (or, singing, "i've got nothing to hide") and, from time to time, completely describe a scene which matches some conversation. there are, at least, six scenes which are among my all time favorite comedy bits.viewers with no history of cocaine use may miss a lot of gags."here, take it." * visual of driving while waving butt out the window.* "i said, 'is this seat taken?'" "nice burn!" visual of chaps, headdress, jockstrap, & swim fins. * "yeah. i'm right handed." * "me! me!" says the woman trying to sell 'nads. * "bernie's going to love these." * "that's my feet, jack." says the black feet. * "why should we tell you?"... "she's at the supermarket!" * "ivy!" on supermarket pa. * loading whole shopping cart into ambulance. * etc.

some said that this was a nose candy glorification flick, but short of the original dr. hyde's concoction, no drug has yet been developed that can provide this effect. if viagra was the slime mold stage, that white sparkling powder is the stephen hawking evolutionary rung (or at least the pharmacist idiot savant branch). this reality show is really about the sacred cows of medicine, seen as was the emperor without clothes. few of us want to question the health field; both because most of us would not have lived to our current age had we been born before "modern medicine", and because our subconscious hopes that we will continue to live on if we have faith in the helping professions. so the geniuses who produced this movie made jokes out of those calcutta bessy's, giving us the sugar that allows us to swallow the modern institution of medicine. the timing was right, and many were able to see the business side of the healing companies behind the curtain of oz. a decade before, when george c. scott ranted through the movie the hospital, my wife and i were sitting in the packed premiere in oklahoma city. just as in jekyll & hyde's remake, we were almost unable to keep from falling out of our seat, and laughed and howled uncontrollably for the duration. the hundreds of other audience members were deadly silent. they were shocked that doctors, nurses, & the hospital institution were being mocked. it was as if the pope, billy graham, and gandhi were were sitting in the animal house, beer stained tee shirts and all, competing to see who could tell the funniest god knock-knock jokes between belches. had the hospital been a slapstick comedy rather than a satire, they might have been able to see what was being shown to them. unfortunately they were like republicans at a screening of michael moore's 9/11. perhaps smaller golden parachutes would have been given to the corrupt medical corporation leaders, health insurance companies would have had a tougher time denying medical care, and health providers would have been demystified earlier, if george c. scott had tap danced in a tutu while delivering his terrible truths. but--forget everything i just said. watch the movie, be consciously made as happy and joyful and full of laughter as the best ever saturday night live skit, and let the subconscious soak in the documentary of the underlying reality. just don't blame me when "got to got to got to got to" becomes one of your sayings, or when "hyde's got nothing to hide" occupies that portion of your brain now paralyzed by "its a small world after all". or when you start calling your local hospital our lady of pain and suffering instead of our lady of eternal construction. even oklahomans were changing their favorite terrible boss wishbone winner entreaty from "piss on him and leave him for dead", to "body in a pit, you in it....." the smell of death...it's gone! chicken sushi! mary. mary. maryeeeeeeeeeeeee!

it took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on dvd (and my vcr is not worth hooking up again). i guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks. but i found a decent bootleg on ebay and i must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded. it is a slap stick spoof in the vein of "airplane." i must say that when i watched it on showtime or spotlight growing up in the 80s, i enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then, than i do now. but it's definitely worth watching just to see what they(i.e., movie makers) were able to get away with before the "just say no" hypocrites unleashed their propaganda. sing..."we are all on drugs" hahaha it's a silly film and worth the $10 i paid off of ebay to get it on dvd just don't even think about comparing it to the original - that's just plain stupid. what are you high?

coming from the "druggie" generation, i thought this movie was hilarious. it definitely brought jekyll & hyde up-to-date, so to speak. my husband and i laughed all the way through it. would love to have the movie in my collection. i told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. they aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. it's been so long since i've seen it i can't remember but a few things. i would have to say the funniest part was when dr. jekyll dozed off on his lab table and inhaled the straw, while snoring, then snorted up the powdered drug he had invented. funniest thing i'd ever seen in a movie.

who are the people that star in this thing? never heard of them!! but this is one of the funniest comedies i have run across. it should win the putz puller prize for parody. the absurd starts with dr. jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend.he is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. pay attention to the hospital pa system in the background; rather like the system in mash. the final scene with hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years. oh... and the "busty nurse" is cassandra peterson, who went on to become elvira, mistress of the dark. if you liked the mel brooks classic movies (blazing saddles, etc.), i suspect you'd like this one.damn shame you can't get it on dvd anywhere.it's available on dvd now !!!!! good thing dvds don't wear out from use !!!!!

better than it has any right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the american box office. at times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, jekyll and hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, laden with drug and sexual humor, reminding one at one time or another of everything from the woody allen of "everything you always wanted to know about sex" to the mel brooks of "the producers", saturday night live to monty python, carlin to cheech and chong. watch it, listen carefully because some of the jokes go by really quickly, and remember a time when comedy was allowed to be offensively hilarious.

uproarious no-brainer comedy in which comedian mark blankfield portrays jekyll as an uptight doctor deeply committed to his research. once he's snorted his experimental formula, he's turned into the scenery-devouring hyde, causing no end of problems for everybody around him.i was pleasantly surprised by this one. it has a truly insane, madcap approach; it's full steam ahead with one outrageously stupid yet undeniably hilarious joke after another. funny lines and sight gags are in abundance; blankfield plays each role for all it's worth. one highlight has hyde bursting into song; "hyde's got nothing to hyde" is quite catchy and even now i can still hear it in my head. the climax even goes so far as to spoof old b & w horror films.the supporting cast is quite spirited as well, with bess armstrong as the ditzy fiancée mary, krista errickson as the spunky ivy, and tim thomerson as flamboyant fellow doctor knute lanyon. i do wish more could have been done with thomersons' character, as i'm a fan of the man, but it's always nice to see him in something.a large array of familiar faces parade before the camera: cassandra "elvira" peterson, peter brocco, liz sheridan, george wendt, michael ensign, john dennis johnston, art la fleur, lin shaye, and george chakiris in a cameo as himself.it goes without saying that if you prefer highbrow, intelligent comedy, you'd better avoid this one at all costs. but for those who enjoy a zany, politically incorrect, gleefully raunchy good time, this just might do the trick.one of the best bits is saved for last.8/10

a mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. as i've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're way lame..... classic lines such as (parapharsed) "i've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times i do it. you're a nurse, what can you give me for it?" nurse replies "all i have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..." great sound track.the classic "hyde's got nothing to hide". stays surprisingly close to the original plot - not that the original stays in the way of a joke..... haven't met anyone with an iq over 115 that doesn't find it hysterical.

this is one of those rare comedies where try as you might, you can't help but giggle, chortle, guffaw and yes, even laugh out loud. the lead actor's performance as hyde is pure manic genius. see if you can keep a straight face when he does his transformation. good luck. :) on the downside there are times when the movie does bog down. it seemed longer than its 90 minutes.

so it's not an award winner, so what? have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? "the villain" and this one could top the list.my husband says that "jekyll and hyde together again" is one of those movies that if "you've been there and done that" you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. i think the whole film is just fun. nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, howard hughes.... there are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate. to say that the film doesn't follow the book would be true, but then a lot of really good films take liberties with the published word also. i recommend this movie to all the old "stoners" among us. we may be smarter now, but we will still recognize and laugh at many folks we knew (ourselves?) back in the old days.

so it's a little dated now, it's almost 30 yrs old. amazingly enough i have this on beta tape and it still plays just fine. if it came to dvd i'd snap it up in a heartbeat.the drug humor is not appreciated nowadays as it was back then. then it wasn't as 'harmful'. much like driving without airbags, seat belts and child seats. i can remember my father crying he was laughing so hard watching this. i had coworkers in the 90's who'd seen it and i could bust them up by getting on the intercom and saying "iiiiiiiivvvvyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy".great lines, great spoof of the original, and funny to me anyway even three decades later!

i loved this movie. mark blankfield was perfect for this role. more classic sci/fie/horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. a no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. can we expect more? let's hope so. i would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. mel brookes made some remakes of classic films.he made some very strong contributions. a picture of dorian gray would be a good suggestion. i hope some producer or director can get into the idea and bring us new comedy to our screens. we are needing a good insurgence of comedy to keep our level of laughter higher than ever before. a good comedy fix.

i first seen this movie in the early 80s and we used to have it on betamax. as we all know, betamax went the way of the 8-trak tape, sigh, it really had nice picture quality too. anyways, i'm glad i found this movie again, i've been searching for it for more than 10 years! this movie falls into the category of movies like airplane: continuous jokes, oneliners, funny actions (bodylanguage). mark blankfield is absolutely hilarious. his transformation from the shy dr. daniel jekyll into the sex-crazed partyanimal mr. hyde is unforgettable, complete with goldtooth, chesthair and goldchains. the part i loved best was when he hijacked the car from this poor guy and then drove to madam woo woo's. totally psychedelic experience without the drugs! if you need laugh therapy this is the movie to do it. when i first seen it, i had tears in my eyes and my belly was hurting from constantly laughing. this is a movie i could watch over and over again. i highly recommend it.

this is sweet. the actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays elvira mistress of the dark. another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of roy munsin in king pin. this is most glorious story ever to be told. it should sell more copies than the bible. my parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater. the movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it. the lady who gave the go ahead (friend of the family) was let go by the theater. i was 3 years old. i have burned through 4 copies on vhs and finally had it converted to dvd. it's beautiful.

mark blankfield played jekyll and hyde.michael mcguire was the dad.tim thomerson was the plastic surgeon.did you even see this movie? i doubt it!blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on fridays. thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. if i ever find this movie on dvd i will definitely buy it. i recorded this movie off of hbo back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. one of the funniest takes on the jekyll & hyde theme ever.of course. with all the cocaine references in this movie, it'd be panned as being way too politically incorrect today, as would cheech and chong. too bad, because it is funny, funny, funny!

this film was one of three that were later combined by chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title "the chaplin review".this was an odd film in some ways because later in life, chaplin was anti-war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood. this film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the us efforts in wwi. it's truly odd to see charlie as the "super soldier" who single-handedly captures 13 germans, casually and coolly shoots several germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the kaiser himself! truly, this was a major departure for the little tramp, though it was, at the same time, very very entertaining and funny. the film is exceptionally well-paced, well made and i'm sure did a lot to bolster support at home for our troops (too bad it was such a pointless and costly war).

chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918, a doughboy who can not seem to get the marching down straight. he spends time "over there" in world war one trenches. several gags stand out: limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. the cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when chaplin and his mates are washed out of their bunks by flooding are highlights. chaplin ends up capturing several german soldiers single-handed, and he spanks the german commander for refusing a cigarette. when asked how he did it, chaplin replies that he surrounded them. chaplin hides behind enemy lines as a tree of all things, and those scenes are very very funny. he escapes to a bombed house where he meets up with a french girl played by edna purviance. he's tracked down by german soldiers, escapes from them again, and purviance is arrested for assisting him. chaplin is able to pull a fast one by bopping a soldier and using the soldier's uniform. he ends up saving purviance of course and capturing the kaiser in the process. along the way, chaplin employs some sight gags and slapstick in turning back the german soldiers. with this film, chaplin explored the location possibilities in filming while maintaining the audience's attention for closer to feature length time, something his contract with the mutual film corporation disallowed him. the film also allowed him to poke fun at the enemy, something he would again do to greater effect in the great dictator. *** of 4 stars.

pretty funny stuff. charlie was still working towards his peak when he made this rather daring short about soldiers in the trenches of world war one. daring because, after all, the war was still going on and this was a comedy about a serious business.the gags are amusing without being either hilarious or tear jerking. one successful scene follows another, as chaplin and his comrades try to sleep in a bunker that is knee deep in water. (that's where we got the term "trench foot" from.) probably the most ludicrous episode has chaplin disguised as a tree and foiling any number of german soldiers as they try to execute an allied soldier caught behind the lines. edna purviance, chaplin's main squeeze at the time, is a woman who cooperates with the americans and is saved from execution too.chaplin would go on to do funnier and more ambitious things but this is better than most of his shorts during this early period.

chaplin enters the trenches of wwi in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. the rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. he's in france for one thing: to fight the germans, something he does with unbelievable success.it almost seems like an extended ego trip for chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.

fantastic chaplin movie with many memorable moments as charlie joins the army to fight in ww 1.at first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line. that's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight!next thing you know he's in france in a trench. hilarious scenes here include a starving charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder.when charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring. this is such a funny part! i can't really describe it, just watch the movie. when charlie wakes up his legs feel numb so he tries to 'wake them up'. it had me rolling on the floor when it turns out his second leg still feels numb... while charlie actually rubs his roommate's foot!the movie then turns a bit grim, as charlie shoots a couple of germans from his trench (although it's done in a very funny way) and him personating as a tree to get close to the enemy, saving a friend of his from a death squad.last part is him getting a french girl in trouble by hiding in her house. he then has to save her and while doing so he captures the german kaiser as well. to do so he impersonates a german kolonel or something. i love it when charlie is asked something in german and he's like nein nein nein. the soldier looks at him in a funny way so charlie changes his mind: ja ja ja! the kaiser gets captured and charlie is the hero... but then he wakes up again in bootcamp, it was just a sweet dream!charlie did one of those 'dream-sequences' before (the bank comes to mind) but who cares, this movie was so funny it had me laughing all the way. chaplin also has something to say with this movie (as his later work became more of a social comment to several mishaps in the world) and is explained best in the last sentence of the movie: 'peace on earth, good will to all mankind.'in short: a charlie classic, very funny, timeless. 9/10.

i described woody allen's manhattan as perfect to someone the other day, and she thought that it was an odd way to describe a movie...i have seen only a handful of movies that i would call perfect. manhattan is one, mccabe & ms. miller by robert altman is another and once upon a time in the west by sergio leone is also another film that i think achieves perfection. there are a few others, but aside from the fact that i find no faults in the three i mentioned, i must also admit that all three directors are acquired tastes.if there is one film that i could stand behind and bet the house that anyone i would show it to would find it flawless it's shoulder arms.city lights, the great dictator, the gold rush and even the pawnshop are 10's but not only did chaplin do everything right in this film, everything he did is hilarious and touching to a level beyond explanation.

charles chaplin's 'shoulder arms' of 1918 was his longest film to date, though, at just over 45 minutes in length, it was not quite a feature film. with world war one just drawing to a close, many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and chaplin was no exception. and so the lovable tramp went to war! the film begins with the tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills, including marching and gun-slinging, much to the disgust of his drill sergeant. the tramp then finds himself in the trenches, faced with a more formidable foe, though the germans eventually turn out of be infinitely more incompetent than even he. the uproarious moment when the tramp declares that he single-handedly captured thirteen german soldiers by "surrounding them" had me in stitches.there are plenty of other great moments in this film. chaplin awaking to find his sleeping barracks underwater and being unable to literally find his own feet is hilarious, as is his ingenious use of a tube from a record player to sleep beneath the surface.however, the most memorable scenes in the film undoubtedly involve chaplin skulking behind enemy lines disguised as a tree. the reactions of the bumbling german soldiers, unknowingly just metres from a sworn enemy, as they are single-handedly disabled one-by-one are highly amusing, especially when one soldier grapples an axe with the intention of cutting down a tree for firewood.this is a very enjoyable film, and one of the best of chaplin's pre-1920 efforts. highly recommended.

this film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918. in fact, it is now more available with two other medium sized silent chaplin features (a dog's life, and the pilgrim) that chaplin re-released in the 1950s. in it's day shoulder arms was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. it still is very funny (chaplin in disguise as a tree, spying on the germans, is so ridiculous it's hysterical), but it suffers from being set in it's own age. charlie's dealing with world war i, a hideous conflict that killed 20 million people, but not the worst war (horrible to say) of the 20th century. chaplin would live to see that war too, and would spoof it's main architects in the great dictator. but the latter is more accessible to modern audiences because that movie is a talking picture. also, hitler as a target seems more important to audiences in 2008 than kaiser wilhelm ii and his general staff.shoulder arms was to take us through the drafting of the tramp, his training, his getting use to trench warfare, and his actual fighting against the "huns" on the western front. much of this is now gone - one segment (when albert austin is a doctor examining chaplin in his office at the draft center) is still in existence and was shown completely in the documentary unknown chaplin. this is unfortunate, because the film is now roughly forty five minutes long, and there seems to be gaps that these scenes filled out. what remains is first rate but one leaves wanting more...and feeling a trifle cheated.sydney chaplin and henry bergman do well in supporting parts, especially sydney as wilhelm. he had done it before in a short with charlie for the sale of bonds, giving a militaristic speech before being clobbered by the tramp with a huge hammer labeled "war bonds"). here we see the tramp succeed in capturing wilhelm and the general staff at the conclusion. it was only topped by stan and ollie capturing the german army with a tank and barbed wire in pack up your troubles.the funny thing is that chaplin actually had a major crisis as a result of his wartime activities. he was not a naturalized american - not in 1917 or in 1952, when attorney general mcgranery publicly announced that chaplin could not return to the u.s. because he was an enemy alien (chaplin and his family were in europe on a trip - in anger charlie settled in switzerland for the rest of his life, except when he made a countess from hong kong and when he went to hollywood for his special career "oscar" in the 1970s). because he was not an american he could not be drafted by the u.s. so he sold (with douglas fairbanks sr. and mary pickford) u. s. war bonds. but in great britain tens of thousands had perished in world war one battlefields, and the public there was upset at chaplin, who they considered a "slacker" and a coward. chaplin eventually did overcome this, but remnants of the resentment followed him until he died. this does not detract from the success of shoulder arms as a film, but it does suggest why chaplin did not do another modern war film until 1940, and a worthier target.

i saw this movie on late night tv out of buffalo about 30 years ago and i'm dying to see it again one more time before i... well.. you know. the interaction between the main characters after the tiger (eli wallach) "captures" his prey (anne jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. charles nelson reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. how many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end? this film reminds us that we are all in that same struggle regardless of class, race, sex or religion. and who can forget the scene of the suburban homeowner on his hands and knees attacking those few tiny weeds that have dared to appear overnight on his perfectly manicure lawn!

while i rather enjoyed this movie, i'll tell you right now that my mother wouldn't. it's out there. really warped little dark comedy that reads like a fairy tale gone awry. >neat treat with all the cameos too. if you want something "different", look no further.

(some spoilers included:)although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly here. to quote from encyclopedia britannica's, surreal means:"fantastic or incongruous imagery": one needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read james kincaid; but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, he'd surely protest, "no way!" what fantasies and incongruities the film offers mostly appear within the first fifteen minutes. thereafter we get more iterations of the same, in an ever-cruder and more squalid progression that, far from incongruous, soon proves predictable. not that it were, on the other hand, literally believable-- but it were unfair to tax motorama in particular with this flaw, any plausible suspension of disbelief having fallen precipitously on the typical film-maker's and viewer's scale of values ever since "raiders of the lost ark" became a blockbuster."hallucinatory": how do we know what a hallucination is if part of having one is not knowing that we are having one? at any rate, some people know that they enjoy "hallucinogenic drugs"-- but if motorama typifies the result of doing so, then i'm at a loss as to why anyone would take them more than once. there is, of course, the occasional bad trip. the movie must be one of those, pun and all."juxtaposition of words that was startling": how many times can a ten-year-old startle you by uttering "oh, my god!" when he likes something, or "damn!" when he doesn't? these two interjections are about par for the course with this script. sadly, any sense of the surreal in what passes for dialogue could only reveal, in direct proportion, one's naivete regarding the speech patterns of the rising american generation."a world completely defined and minutely depicted but that makes no rational sense:" motorama's world indeed makes no sense, but it is about as completely defined as a cartoon in an elementary school newspaper. the numerous guest stars in the cast all have cameo roles even less intelligent than our little hero who exclaims "damn!" in the blink of an eyelash but needs several seconds to concoct the lamest lie. and even *his* character, despite appearing in nearly every scene, gets no significant development. here's scant reward for any viewer who sympathizes, as i must, enough to wish to know him better and understand 'where he's coming from.' one vaguely senses a far better story and protagonist struggling to get out."fully recognizable, realistically painted images are removed from their normal contexts and reassembled within an ambiguous, paradoxical, or shocking framework." no, we see a succession of stereotypical and ever more dilapidated billboards, filling stations, greasy-spoon eateries, cheap hotels, and their lowlife habitues along country highways, exactly where they stereotypically belong."largely responsible for perpetuating... the traditional emphasis on content." there is little content, moment-to-moment, in motorama.to sum up: picture british millionaires dressed as clowns or pirates on the way to a posh costume party, sitting serene and mute as cautious chauffeurs inch their rolls-royces like fragile skiffs through a roiling sea of desperate humanity, chinese who implore them through the windows and smear the glass with blood. or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques, limousines like those above now rusting, and white pianos tinkled by ghosts. into this detritus wander an exhausted boy and an ailing woman to whom he clings as mother-figure becoming girl-friend, who fall asleep side by side on the grass. he is awakened-- on the feast of the transfiguration, "white and glistering" day 1945-- by a brilliant flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun. finding that his consort has become a corpse, he first believes that he has witnessed her soul going up to heaven. later he explains only a little less innocently, 'i learned a new word today: atom-bomb. it's like god taking a photograph.' now, *there* are just two samples of cinematic surrealism, surrealism whose ironies ripple out far enough to invade its film's very title: empire of the sun. if you seek surreal, *please* don't miss it. alas, however hard he treads on the accelerator to race his chariot through and beyond the desert, no scenes so exquisitely strange, rich, subtle, or gorgeous await motorama's poor little gus in his quest.none of the above necessarily constitutes a thumbs-down on this film. though somewhat disappointed, i can't dismiss it, in view of the respectability of another genre that it does exemplify-- one influenced, to be sure, by surrealism, but also by expressionism, existentialism, and franz kafka's pessimism amidst omnipotent power structures. let's try on for size: theater of the absurd.turning to e.b.'s article on this style, i am amazed by how, to the extent that theater of the absurd is a valid artistic style, the above objections to motorama vanish like a puff of smoke. i'm tempted to quote the entire text as support of the identification.theater of the absurd attempts to show "that the human situation is essentially absurd, devoid of purpose... humankind is left feeling hopeless, bewildered, and anxious.": having instantaneously achieved his purpose of getting away from a depressing home life among bickering parents, gus finds himself purposeless until he drives past a glittering billboard reading "motorama" and decides to win the lottery that it promises. as others have already revealed, this ambition proves illusory: although the game "never expires", the sponsoring corporation has no intention that anyone should ever win, and has ways to trick, confuse, and leave crestfallen any aspirant to the reward. he, like others, is ultimately disappointed in his dream."absurdist playwrights, therefore, did away with most of the logical structure of traditional theatre. there is little dramatic action as conventionally understood; however frantically the characters perform, their busyness serves to underscore the fact that nothing happens to change their existence... a timeless, circular quality emerges." "language in an absurdist play is full of... repetitions... repeating the obvious until it sounds like nonsense." underneath a sometimes "dazzling comic surface," we find "an underlying message of metaphysical distress." gus's obsession with a silly game, his inane language, the plot device wherein he divines a bleak future and/or returns to an earlier moment and takes a different but still bleak turn-- so much fits now. while an admirer of the surreal would do better with some films, anyway, of spielberg, admirers of motorama as it really is should find fellow-travelers-- not instead but addition-- in the works of beckett, ionesco, and genet.but one can't quite stop here. after his disillusionment with the game, gus returns to "phil" (i.e., love), the first attendant he had met and the one person who had treated him decently, although he had also scolded him-- at a service station advertising "be full-filled!". under phil's tutelage he learns a life of waiting for cars. we might note here that the absurdist playwright beckett had entitled his most famous play "waiting for godot," and that for godot we should read "god." god is one of phil's preoccupations, too. furthermore, as the indirect result of his previous encounter with gus, phil is badly maimed and goes about in a cast with his arms straight out horizontally. in the last scene, gus, now phil's protege, says that he wants to hear music. we hear none, but we see phil wiggling his fingers at the end of his outstretched arm, beckoning gus closer, and gus responds. the end.finally, on to an author whom i happen to be reading currently, the anglican theologian william stringfellow. if this rebel-lawyer is not acknowledged as an architect or undergirder of liberation theology, which is more a roman catholic than an anglican movement, perhaps he should be. police brutality and corporate greed are a cliche in cinema and literature, including motorama, but stringfellow supports and illuminates such sentiments with impressive warrants from scripture, tradition, and reason.his most significant work is an expose of the earthly activities of those fallen angels whom the bible refers to as principalities and powers. principalities, wrote stringfellow, are behind all of our popular three i's: images, institutions, and ideologies. all of these commend themselves to our worship by making false promises. the more deeply involved with an image, an institution, or an ideology any person becomes, the more his own personhood becomes "depleted" and be becomes a slave to them. promising power, control, and immortality, they inexorably deliver helplessness, chaos, and death. as essentially fallen, defeated powers, they can do no more than that. yet they beguile humans with that "dominion over the earth" promised by god in the book of genesis, while in fact no one of us controls an image, an institution, or an ideology bent inevitably on its own hegemony and self-preservation. they take on lives of their own. "dominion" happens to be a mistranslation: a more accurate rendering of the hebrew would be "stewardship." but this is a quibble beside a more fundamental problem: most of us neglect to notice that god had delegated this power to adam *before* the fall. we have no reason to assume that we, his descendents, still exercise it now: on the contrary, it should be obvious that demonic forces have stolen it from us.one might add two observations of c.s. lewis: first, that "man's conquest of nature" is a mere illusion, and a ruse to cover the fact that one is really talking about the conquest of some men by other men with nature as the instrument; and secondly, contrary to popular belief, satan is no kind of good-time charlie. he may dangle out pleasures at first, but he is very niggardly with them and will withdraw them from any human firmly in his thrall, perhaps leaving his prey sitting in front of the fire feeling miserably sorry for himself and seething with resentment.now, applying these insights to motorama, we seem them mirrored remarkably in gus's experience. he is, if not nice, at least a pretty little boy prior to falling victim to the motorama game. the first signs advertising it glisten glamorously. the longer he continues, however, and the deeper he journeys towards the sponsoring corporation's headquarters, the more shabby they become. he's lonely, meeting no one else who plays the game. the stations giving out the cards have either fallen into ruins or are staffed by zombies. the people he does meet along the way are more and more ugly, deceitful, and hostile. (the fact that the principalities answer to a common dictator does not mean that they can abide one another). gus's humanity is leached out of him as he becomes not only totally self-centered and oblivious to the needs of others but partially blinded... disfigured... prematurely aged while infantile in the literal sense of linguistically challenged. eventually even his precious mustang is taken from him in a crash, and he must continue in a dead man's wreck. yet at long last, having done everything he thought was expected, he presents himself to the principality in its proud tower to receive his prize. using the biblical power to confuse wielded by those who have built such monuments to their own vanity, its agents evade him, disappoint, insult, and finally throw him from the top floor. he falls long and hard, landing, finally in a body of water. in other words, in classic symbolism, he dies. he has met the inevitable bad end of anyone who has put his faith in such a deceiver.but this fate proves to be only a warning look into a mutable future. he repents and returns to phil, and upon seeing him performs the very first generous, selfless act we have seen from him for almost an hour and a half: noting that phil is now handicapped and hardly able to insert a hose into a gas tank, he asks, "can i help you with that?" then, seeing the "help wanted" sign, he decides to apply for the job, explaining to the motorist with whom he was hitch-hiking that he reckons he'll get out here, because it doesn't look like too bad a place to work.this interpretation is conjectural, of course, and it may surprise or even outrage the film's "cult classic" aficionados who see quite different points in it.if motorama isn't quite my cup of tea, i'm at least convinced now that it's hardly the worst film ever made.

this has got to be one of the most magnificent things i've ever seen on film. i don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters. this film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. the packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. look at the roadmap, for one thing! and where else in america can you see a ten year old kid swear as much as this one does and then get his eye ripped out by pervert the rival of pulp fiction's zed? and that food inspector scene is the best! the amount of well known to vaguely recognized actors in this film is one of the best things about it: soon, much sooner than you realize, you too will find yourself saying, "is that meat loaf? is that drew barrymore? is that the holideck doctor from star trek: voyager? is that flea? is that the sawmill owner from twin peaks gassing squirrels with car exhaust? and isn't this guy from the new rob zombie movie? he looks an awful lot like shrek." i think my favorite scene is at the very end, with phil in a full body cast. i mean, please, why aren't more movies like this shown in airplanes? this director hardly has anything else to his name higher than return to salem's lot, but he displays true stumbling man-child genius in this creation! if you're an intellectual looking for something to p**s away your evening on, i highly suggest this film for satisfaction. this movie's plot is all too ridiculous, but imagine it taken out of context: *boy arm wrestling an over aggressive meat loaf, who seems hell bent on taking out his anger at not being accepted into guns n roses, looks over his shoulder and sees the doctor from voyager enter the bar* can you imagine what any half brained channel surfer active through the last six years would think of seeing that? now imagine if you actually cared about meat loaf or voyager to begin with! or imagine if you're a flea fan. rocky horror picture show fans, this film contains notable music, mind you, but its soundtrack is more plasticine than mad max 3. what does that entail for you? this is the retarded, inverted mongoloid cousin-sister-mother-puppy of the rocky horror picture show. how about when gus' sleeve flies back onto his arm in an act of cable-access special effects quality mastercraft? when i saw this film, it was on the suggestion of my cousin who had watched half of it in a fit of half-aware childhood in the early half of the nineties and who has since been haunted by vague memories of it, i myself had not slept in three days. it made me laugh! of course, it's also an anxiety movie. the music doesn't encourage the suspense but it eventually gets to the point where it's been fully established that the american censorship committee has obviously missed this film entirely and absolutely anything can happen in it and probably will any time gus turns a corner or the view so much as changes camera angles. i found myself obsessing over the possibility of those cards flying out his window at any second. watch this movie. awesome!

although this film never attained commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. the story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. therefore, anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed; it is not intended to be "realistic." it is, however, intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail. in addition, the symbolic representations are left open for interpretation, which can be said of much great artwork. don't be fooled by the cover (if you happen to rent or buy this film)-- the movie is not what it might seem to be on the surface.

the first time i saw this movie, i just thought "what the hell?" a 10-year-old kid driving around bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called motorama! hell yeah! i enjoyed this movie a lot!jordan christopher-michael is a brilliant young actor! it's a shame he stopped act. he interprets very well his character gus on the movie.gus loses an eye, got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with flea, drew barrymore and meat loaf! want more? ok, don't even try to understand the story, but why this movie needs one!? just open your mind and let gus drive you into this journey."motorama gus, you won motorama"

motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as bagdad cafe or repo man (which more or less takes place in the desert). it also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric trail of characters) of writer joseph minion's comedy, 'after hours.' in a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, gus (played well by jordan christopher michael), a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents. it begins as a trip through salvation (which is apparent in the scenes with john diehl), but once he becomes hooked on a scratch-off game called motorama, he becomes easily tainted by temptation and looses his childish innocence. he travels from one crazy fictional state to another concocting ways of getting motorama cards from participating gas stations, just enough so that he might spell out the prize winning word m-o-t-o-r-a-m-a and be eligible for the $500 million cash prize.along the way, he is embattled with dozens of strange characters such as flea who plays a high strung busboy, meatloaf who plays a crazy biker, and mary woronov and sandy baron (a seinfeld regular) as two violent kidnappers. the dvd rerelease can be very deceptive, as have previous attempts to sell this film to the non-cult market first with taglines comparing it to home alone and thelma & louise. the newest calling it a love story with the tagline implying that the film is about jordan michael christopher on an adventure to meet the girl of his dreams...which, despite the size of her picture on the dvd cover, is actually only about a 1 second cameo by drew barrymore as the fantasy girl that gus dreams about. why didn't they just market it for what it was? thought it may seem totally bizarre on first viewing, it is actually a well-designed narrative. motorama is great material for fans of strange b-grade comedies. this was quite an interesting story, and particularly because of the strength of its lead actor--jordan michael christopher (who unfortunately has few other screen credits of note)--and the clever metaphor inherent in the plot. hopefully its re-release on dvd will make it an easier find for cult fans.

this movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. if you're anything like me, and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. one of the funniest parts is when gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like hansel and gretel then he and his wife go home with them. the soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: "inspection officer -- here!" and the lines to follow will stay in my mind forever probably. when i have shown this movie to my friends, they usually say "what was that?!?" so if you're in the mood for one of those types of movies, yippee! this movie is so oop it's not funny anymore, so probably the easiest way to get it would be online auctioning. the first time i saw it was from a rental.

i loved this movie, i saw it when i was about 8 years old and almost seven years later, this evening i got to see it again. i really thought it had an interesting idea, they only thing that upset me was the ending which i felt was a cop out. 'round here it's hard to find this movie and i was lucky enough to have seen it on bravo. i also expected to see more drew barrymore in here too!

this is an entertaining surreal road movie. it was written by joseph minion, who also wrote after hours, martin scorsese's excellent surreal film. the film follows the adventures of a ten-year-old kid named gus, who drives a red ford mustang across some fictional states with names like tristana (a tribute to luis buñuel's film, perhaps?), essex & south lyndon, in search of eight elusive motorama game cards from various chimera company gas stations. the film has a surreal feel to it because a lot of the things are unusual, like the money for instance, which is like blank paper with numbers on.most of the characters are nasty to gus on his trip. they tattoo him, punch him, but this doesn't stop the kid on his relentless quest. some oddball actors like david lynch incumbent jack nance, meat loaf & flea also make appearances. jack nance plays a motel owner, who when he first meets gus tells him, "if you see any squirrels, give them to me". this is a movie where a man and his wife abandon their young children because the man owes gus $100; and a mother encourages her son to raise his voice louder while speaking rudely. if you're a fan of twin peaks and surreal movies, you'll like this. an odd little gem of a movie.

this is a great, dark, offbeat little film, a modern day adaptation of the quest for the holy grail myth. it's a sleeper if there ever was one. i saw it on cable some years ago and taped it. i've loaned it to many of my friends and everyone loved it.

don't even try to figure out the logic of this story. but do ride along with 10-year-old gus on the most bizarre road trip ever witnessed. more weird characters and implausible situations than a twin peaks reunion! nothing makes sense, yet it's impossible to stop watching motorama! now, where can i find that 'r'????

little gus is a ten year old delinquent. he runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road-trip. reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him, so he creates a device to help him. his goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called motorama. he has to find all eight letters in order to spell m-o-t-o-r-a-m-a. dark laughter follows as it turns into the road-trip from hell. he runs into some deranged lynch like characters. most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that god will see it. later gus gets a tattoo and an eye-patch for his injured eye. he becomes one of the most rebellious bad-ass 10 year olds you may ever witness on screen. this is no kid's flick! look for cameos by jack nance, flea and drew berrymore. be warned although drew is on the front cover, she only appears in the film in a dream sequence for a couple seconds. also the film gets confusing towards the end reaching david lynch territory, you may want to watch it a couple times. "motorama" was written by joseph minion, most well known for his screenplays for "after hours" and "vampire's kiss" so enjoy this depraved surreal road-trip of fun!

let's start from this point: this is not a movie intended for the common audience. utterly bizarre, somehow incomprehensible, totally unpredictable, it just keep you stoned watching at the screen trying to figure out what will happen next. if that by itself doesn't make you agree it is an excellent movie, then go back to your "family" movies and forget about motorama. it has material to be considered a cult movie, it can be placed in the same category with movies that win awards in cannes or other intellectual film festivals, but, sadly, hollywood already let if fall in oblivion, simply because it is not commercial. the performance of young jordan christopher michael may not be oscar material, but he gives the right touch to the story. even the genre is difficult to describe; it is not a comedy in the proper sense, you don't know if you are supposed to laugh at the strange situations in which gus gets involved. it is more like an impossible adventure that some kids may wish to have, but don't let them watch it either... it is not a movie for kids. so, if you like disney movies or are looking for a "home alone" style, this one is definitively not for you. but if you enjoy reading edgar alan poe or the works of tim burton, then you will like motorama. so, jump in your red mustang, get a tattoo spelling "tora" and cruise strangeland with gus. i'd like that...

as with so many modern us films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let that go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell.we are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. beau bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub beau's nose. d'onofrio finds his rather surface bubba lifestyle cramped by having to look after his 'blessed' baby brother, joey, and is itching to escape the shackles of this dead hick town. their boss's business is closing down (much against his will) because of a lack of new customers and he is haunted by memories of his father as he builds up the tension towards his own attempt at self-destruction.joey, who had seemed to personify the curse on their lives, is lost at sea - believed drowned - in a freak accident. his miraculous restoration to them by the portuguese trawlermen whose boat they had just built and launched (perhaps symbolic of an angelic crew), is the sign they've been waiting for and they all decide to give life one last throw of the dice.there is a beautiful brooding mood throughout this work which excelled in holding our attention as brilliantly as 'the shipping news'. there are other parallels with the later work, too, which lead one to suspect a touch of a remake. i like 'signs of life' for its simpler, less contrived story and star performances from actors working at their craft rather than to be noticed as stars.

i saw this movie on pbs the first time. then i bought the video and watched it countless times. every time i watch it, i can get something else out of it. it's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good, but now the world is changing. but you don't have to be older to hold onto the past, even the young characters, like charlotte don't want things to change. the overall tone and mood is excellent. the cast is outstanding with all-stars like kathy bates, beau bridges and arthur kennedy. and its fun to see the upcoming stars before they hit more recognizable feature films, like kevin j. o'connor (the mummy) and vincent d'onofrio (men in black and law & order: criminal intent-one of my favorite shows). its just one of those movies that stays with you.

it's not real flashy, but this movie does a great job of developing a large cast of characters, and letting you know their hopes and desires, while still managing to be both funny and bittersweet. a very sweet movie. fun, also, to see vincent d'onofrio and mary-louise parker so early in their careers.

i first saw "signs of life" on pbs as an american playhouse presentation. it's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with terrific performances by michael lewis as joey and vincent d'onofrio as his brother, daryl. arthur kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. the rest of the cast which includes beau bridges, kathy bates and mary-louise parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.the direction is subtle and effective. i've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it. a beautiful piece of filmmaking.

it's showtime! showtime is simply a bump in eddie murphy and robert deniro's careers. it's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards, especially not robert's. showtime is directed by tom dey and features some small roles from guys like william shatner and mos def.showtime is about two very different cops, mitch preston (deniro) and trey sellars (murphy). one takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat. they are both after the same felons behind a huge caper of televisions, vcrs, etc. they then cross paths and a tv station wants a new reality tv show so they fight crime while they are on tv. mitch hates the publicity while trey loves it with his line, "it's showtime!" their tv antics and methods are shown on tv and they are the new "cops" show. the fun begins.overall, showtime is a fun action comedy. a good film but not quite up to the actors' expectations and standards. however, it's rolls along as it treads and parodies reality tv shows. a good break from shows like cops. truly at the end, just a guilty pleasure.my rating: 7/10eliason a.

this is actually great fun. i really enjoyed it, even though it wasn't that original at all, robert de niro and eddie murphy were great together!. all the characters are cool, and the story is pretty good, plus robert de niro and eddie murphy are simply amazing in this!. rene russo is excellent in her role, and there are plenty of laughs to be had throughout (especially when deniro spoofs clint eastwood and danny glover's lines), plus the finale is just great. yes it's just another run of the mil "buddy buddy" cop film, but it works due to the fantastic chemistry between de niro and murphy!, plus it had some great car chase scenes as well!. it's nothing that great really, however i found it to be great fun, and a perfect way to pass the time!,however the main villain was very weak and wasn't very good at all. this is far from being the best "buddy "buddy" cop film, however it's still a very entertaining one, and i thought it was pretty well made and written as well!, plus the ending was quite funny!. this is actually great fun, i really enjoyed it, even though it wasn't that original at all, robrt de niro and eddie murphy were great together, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is very good!. tom dey does a very good job here with great camera work, cool angles and keeping the film at a fast pace. the acting is a lot of fun!. robert deniro is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is hilarious, very likable, had fantastic chemistry with eddie murhpy did his usual awesome stuff, pulled some really funny faces, seemed to be enjoying himself,had some funny lines, and had a really cool character! (de niro rules!!!!!!!). eddie murphy is also amazing here, he is hilarious, like de niro did his usual funny stuff, obviously loved being in front of the camera, and while he can do this stuff in his sleep he was still a lot of fun to watch! (murphy rules!!!!). rene russo is fantastic here!, she had a cool character, and while she didn't have much to do, she added a lot of screen presence, and made her character interesting always, she was just great! (russo rules!!!!). william shatner is funny here surprisingly and didn't overdo it, and brought some good laughs into the film. the main villain is ok, but kind of weak and rather bland, still he did what he had to do adequately. rest of the cast do fine. overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5

robert deniro and eddie murphy, what a team. while rene russo, william shanter, and that guy from the everyday video are alongside for the ride. this is a funny and a great movie. not only is it that, but it's a good buddy flick.tom dey (shanghai noon) directs this hell of a movie. from start to finish, it was a masterpiece. no slapstick humor here. but good old time laughs. making fun of all other cop flicks (to name a few lethal weapon, beverly hills cop, fifteen minutes, and etc...)if you want to see a movie, see this one. you'll love it. it has a wonderful cast and crew. so, get off your a** from watching "cops" and watch "showtime" for a cop film. and remember, they'll be protrolling your neighbor at um...um...oh! at friday nights at 8:00 (man, everyone says i'm a bad writer).

showtime is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. the plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. but i laughed. a lot. credit goes to the inspired pairing of de niro and murphy. they have great chemistry. murphy delivers the one-liners, de niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. this movie will get a rush hour-like reception from the critics. don't listen to them. if you're a fan of de niro or murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.

dad (78) and i (46) both had a good time watching the flick today. for a guy primarily known for serious roles, de niro is a heckuva comic actor. of course, it helps to have his past film images to play against. consider that one of those roles, 15 minutes, was a cop having to deal with the interference of the mass media, and you have an interesting set of compare/contrast performances.murphy plays another of his axel foley sort of characters. shatner plays a burlesque of himself, a parallel world self who was best known for tj hooker and not star trek.it's interesting to watch how the film comments on the contrasts between the reality of police work and its fictional counterparts in tv and film. shatner lectures on the proper means of sliding across a car hood; de niro points out holsters scratch the hood finish. ironically, as the film progresses, de niro's character begins to incorporate the illusions of tv-cop reality into the real world case he's working.the film draws its inspiration from a gamut of sources, so one could make the comment it is derivative. well, so what? satire needs to derive its humor in order to exist. and besides, the film does have quirky moments of originality. for example, i'm reasonably sure the method of the villain's death has never been done before. one quibble about the reality of the weapons involved-- shouldn't those guns have had some kind of recoil? in order to penetrate steel, those bullets had to have enough inertia to penetrate. and any bullet's highest level of inertia is at the moment of firing. so.... firing a volley of these tank-killer bullets should have driven the shooters back onto their butts. oh, what the heck... it's a satire. maybe the guns' lack of recoil is itself a satire on the b-f-guns used so casually in thrillers. 

as many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot isn't exactly stellar, the movie doesn't move anyone, and certainly this won't warrant any award (outside of blockbusters' perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.eddie murphy and robert de niro team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that i really enjoyed. russo and shatner played their small parts well as well. man, i hope in the future my wife ages as well as miss renee has.moving along, this "buddy" cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time. the movie is enjoyable enough to avoid the wait for video/dvd release and instead to go ahead and check it out.eddie murphy is at his usual top-form and is downright enjoyable to watch. de niro has molded into this type of role perfectly.i really enjoyed this movie and think that any true movie fan in need for a good movie or just a good laugh will really enjoy showtime.top performance: murphy. hilarious. enough said. directing job: nice. nice action scenes, used murphy and de niro together like a charm, russo fed off in a nice supporting job.my rating: 7 out 10. it's not going to move you or anything...but it's an extremely enjoyable movie.it's showtime...was a great success.

"showtime" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what i expected months ago when i first heard about eddie murphy and robert di niro teaming up for a comedy. overall, it was pretty good! as "real life" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but duh--- this is a comedy. also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a schwartzenegger movie, i found it a bit tiresome and overdone. 9/11 sensibilities aside, for myself, all that pyro-techno hyper-effect stuff had been getting really old these past few years. it seemed a lame substitute for characterization, story, and engaging emotions. i hope the lesser quantity of it in "showtime" is an indicator of a trend in hollywood. a trend downwards, of less use of the silly, less use of the exploding building.di niro and murphy are two of my favorites. their screen presence and charisma-- and even their character depth-- have been "a joy to behold" for many years. that can't be dismissed here--- they are engaging actors, and entertaining and appealing in this movie. i can't put my finger on it, but perhaps the explosions, the excessive fx, and all of that diminished the final product??? perhaps, or perhaps it was something else, or a combination of factors that gives one the sense that the movie didn't achieve its highest potential. whatever it was, "showtime" was entertaining-- i probably will buy the dvd when it comes out-- but i had the vibe that it nonetheless wasn't all it could have been. at least not all i had hoped for.very good movie, but not a great movie. i gave it an 8 out of 10.

i'm not going to go into too much depth, but showtime was a pretty funny movie. there wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that i can remember), but it had it's moments. the cast is pretty good, robert de niro is good as usual and eddie murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. rene russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. there were two characters in the story that i liked that they didn't explain much at all. the first one was trey sellars' (eddie murphy's) buddy at the gym played by ken campbell. i supposed he was just a friend of trey's, but i wanted to know more about him. the other character that i liked was mitch preston's (robert de niro's) fellow cop/partner played by nestor serrano. i guess he was just another cop working with mitch preston, but i wanted to know if he was his partner or what not. i think maybe i'm putting too much thought into a movie, i mean after all, it's a comedy...who cares about the characters? i guess i do though. i was really pleased to see this was directed by tom dey, who also directed shanghai noon. ever since i saw that movie i was looking forward to his next work. i think he did a pretty good job with this film, and i again look forward to his next work.all in all, it was a good movie, but i wouldn't recommend paying full price for a ticket unless you're a die-hard robert de niro/eddie murphy/rene russo fan. it was worth seeing in the theater, but not for full price, i'd recommend seeing it at matinee price. also, here's some movie trivia for ya. the guy who played the camera man, played by judah friedlander is the guy in the music video "everyday" by dave matthews band. he was also the clerk in "meet the parents", also starring robert de niro. ...and on top of that he also played derek zoolander's brother in "zoolander" (both zoolander and meet the parents star ben stiller). just some useless trivia for ya.i hope you enjoy the film. thanks for reading,-chris

"showtime" is a funny film starring funnymen robert deniro (meet the parents,a bronx tale) and eddie murphy (shrek, dr. dolittle). the story is this: in the beginning of the movie detective mitch (robert deniro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. when the cops arrive, tray(eddie murphy)a cop, tries to arrest mitch not knowing he's a cop. during this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer chase ritz. she is so excited about their adventures together, she decides to make a tv show called "showtime" starring tray (the cop) and mitch (the detective). but that's just the funny part. the rest is strictly suspense and action. there is a foreign man who is selling and making extremely dangerous guns. while playing lapd on the show and doing it in real life, deniro and murphy have quite an adventure in this story. on a scale of 1-10, i give it a seven or 8.

at one time `buddy cop' movies ruled the box office. it seemed that every summer flocks of beverly hills cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. not any more. lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. the drought has eased a bit recently with the release of showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.mitch preston is a dedicated cop. he's not a dirty harry type by any means. he's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his dutieslike, say, a t.v. cameraman. mitch deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and so falls into the clutches of chase renzi, a producer looking for a killer hook for her `reality t.v.' cop show. she thinks that mitch will give her the `edgy' boost it needs to be a hit but feels he may be too unlikable to carry the whole show by himself. enter trey sellars, a patrolman-cum-actor who's watched way too many police story re-runs. of course mitch and trey mix like oil and water and much merry mayhem ensues.we know that mitch and trey are bound to become best buddies by the end of the movie. that's the way buddy-cop movies are suppose to work. in fact, it has to be said that showtime rarely deviates from the time-honored clichés as writ by lethal weapon and tango & cash. there's a high tech mcguffin to get the ball rolling (in this case an automatic rifle that fires rounds big enough to stop tanks.) there's a slick foreign baddy with an accent of undetermined origin. there are chases, shootouts and explosions. we all know this going in and we have a pretty fair idea how it's all going to turn out. you know what? there's nothing wrong with that. yes, we know the well-worn bases are going to be touched but the fun here is the trip, not the destination. showtime doesn't strain to be original. instead its energies are funneled into its characters and humorous situations. as a result, showtime does a competent job with the action sequences but really shines in its comedy.robert de niro is dryly funny as mitch. in the past i've thought de niro to be a cold and unexpressive actor given horribly to mugging when called upon to do comedy. lately, though, he's grown on me. he seems to be injecting more humanity into his roles. eddie murphy is hilarious as trey. the best way to describe his performance is that trey is what murphy would be if murphy weren't so talented and hadn't hit the big time. rene russo has a droll time playing motor-mouthed show biz shark chase renzi. she stalks through the movie chasing high nielson ratings with awe-inspiring determination. in her zeal she re-vamps mitch's life to make it more camera friendly. she even calls upon t. j. hooker himself, william shatner, to show mitch how be a more `authentic' cop. shatner is funny, playing himself precisely as we expect him to be, loud, oblivious and slightly obnoxious.i have to admit i was really looking forward to showtime and i wasn't disappointed. ten years ago this movie would have been a guaranteed hit. today it's doing moderate business at best. that's a pity because showtime is a whole lot of fun.

contains spoiler the movie is a good action/comedy but i don't know if the director cut too many parts but it seems that the bad guy die too fast. the end of the movie come, the bad guy dies and that's it.the special effects are good and i don't regret paying to see it at the theatre.

despite of all the negative criticism i really enjoyed this movie. i am not saying this lightly. i love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home dvd collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are ok, a few i do not like at all). and, to all those with criticisms: this is a comedy. i simply love this movie. it is light, funny, and very restful. i am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but i love it. the comedic talents of eddie murphy and robert deniro are tapped (fully - for this type of movie). do not compare it to other movies with these star actors, simply enjoy it. the cast is great and, i believe, that the purpose of this movie was fully accomplished. if you want a really "easy-going" and very restful night - watch this movie. deniro and murphy simply had fun making this movie, so should we (watching it). and, please, do not be so negative. do not expect godfather performance or meet the parents from deniro, do not expect comedy blockbusters performance from murphy... it is a completely different genre, and it made me relax after a hard day work. your sides may not split from laughter, but it is still very funny.

i've read a lot of reviews about showtime on imdb and many seem to miss the mark. i've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical "buddy" film. de niro is in no way murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. in fact, part of the comedy of this film is de niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.murphy really shines in this one. he is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. he is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. de niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid. i thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice. rene russo is also great as the tv producer. of course, she loves everything murphy does and tries so hard (along with murhpy) to get deniro going too.a lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with william shatner, reprising his role as tj hooker to train murhpy & de niro how to "act" like cops. but, my favorite scene involves murphy in the "confessional" hoping he could get a wesly snipes-like cop to team up with instead of de niro. man, that was hilarious! comedies often depend on your personal tastes. sure you could poke holes in the plot, most often you can with a comedy. i was psyched to see the pairing of murphy and de niro...i think it brought out the best in murphy, which was nice to see him at the top of his game again. i can only imagine it was a great honor for murphy to be paired with the great de niro. rating 8 of 10 stars.

it's exactly what i expected from it. relaxing, humorous and entertaining. the acting couple was awesome, as well as the scene selection. i personally recommend this. it's kind of the movie that can be seen by whole family at the same time without anyone feeling uncomfortable or getting bored. this cute movie will make you smile, and laugh too. and the action scenes are tasty. classics of modern american comedy. and very well done.

if you've seen the trailer for this movie, you pretty much know what to expect, because what you see here is what you get. and even if you haven't seen the previews, it won't take you long to pick up on what you're in for-- specifically, a good time and plenty of laughs-- from this clever satire of `reality tv' shows and `buddy cop' movies, `showtime,' directed by tom dey, starring robert de niro and eddie murphy.	mitch preston (de niro) is a detective with the l.a.p.d., and he's good at what he does; but working a case one night, things suddenly go south when another cop, trey sellars (murphy), inadvertently intervenes, a television news crew shows up and mitch loses his cool, which results in a lawsuit by the television station that's going to cost the department some big bucks. except that they may be able to get around it, thanks to chase renzi (rene russo), who works for the station and likes what she sees in mitch-- enough to pitch an idea to her boss for a `reality' cop show, that would feature none other than mitch preston, whom chase sees as a real life `dirty harry.'	her boss likes the idea and gives chase the green light. now all she has to do is convince mitch to participate, which shouldn't be too hard, since the station has agreed to drop the lawsuit if he will do the show. but mitch is a cop, not an actor, and he wants nothing to do with any of it-- that is until he has a heart-to-heart with his boss, captain winship (frankie faison), who puts mitch's future into succinct perspective for him. and just like that, the show is on. oh, yes, there's one more thing; for the show, mitch is going to need a partner. and who do you suppose they're going to come up with for that? let's put it this way: trey sellars is more than one of the usual suspects.	this is dey's second film as a director, his first being `shanghai noon,'-- also a comedy-- and he's definitely showing a penchant for the genre. from the opening frames he establishes a pace that keeps the story moving right along, and he allows his stars to make the most of their respective talents and personal strengths, including their impeccable timing. with stars like de niro and murphy, dey, of course, had a leg up on this project to begin with, but he's the one who keeps it on track, demonstrating that he knows what works, achieving just the right blend of physical comedy and action, and employing the subtleties of the dialogue to great effect. 	there isn't a more natural actor in the business than de niro, and he steps into mitch's skin like he was born to it. and after years of doing hard-edge, cutting drama (in which he turned in one remarkable performance after another), with such films as `analyze this,' `meet the parents' and now this one, he has firmly established his proficiency for doing comedy, as well. mitch is not an especially complex character; he is, in fact, something of an `ordinary' guy, but therein lies the challenge for the actor-- to make him believable, to make him seem like the guy who could be your neighbor and just another member of the community. and on all counts, de niro succeeds. he's mitch, the guy you run into at the grocery store or the bank, or say `good morning' to on your way to work; who likes to watch the game on tv and has a life, just like you and me, who happens to make his living by being a cop. it's the character mitch has to be to make this film work, because it makes the `ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances' angle credible. it's one of those role-- and work-- that is often wrongly dismissed out-of-hand, because it looks so easy; and, of course, this is what makes de niro so exceptional-- he does make it look easy, and he does it with facility.	as trey sellars, eddie murphy turns in a winning performance, as well, and it's a role that fits him like the proverbial glove. trey is a cop, but also an aspiring actor-- and a bad one-- and it gives murphy the opportunity to play on the over-exuberant side of his personality (reigned in enough by dey, however, to keep him from soaring over-the-top into jim carrey territory), which works perfectly for this character and this film. from his melodramatic take on a part during an audition, to his throwing out of one-liners-- delivered by looking directly into the camera (which as far as he's concerned isn't even there) while filming the `reality' show-- murphy's a riot. and he has a chemistry with de niro that really clicks (which is not unexpected, as this is another of de niro's many talents; his ability to connect with and bring out the best in his co-stars, all of whom-- evidence will support-- are better at their craft after having worked with him, including the likes of meryl streep, christopher walken and ed harris, just to name a few). most importantly, this is a part that allows murphy to excel at what he does best, and he certainly makes the most of it.	russo makes the most of her role as chase, too, a character who isn't much of a stretch artistically, but whom she presents delightfully, with a strong, believable performance. and william shatner (playing himself) absolutely steals a couple of scenes as the director of the show.	the supporting cast includes drena de niro (annie), pedro damian (vargas) and james roday (camera man). well crafted and delivered, `showtime' is a comedy that's exactly what it is meant to be: pure entertainment that provides plenty of laughs and a pleasant couple of hours that will have you chuckling for some time after. it's the magic of the movies. 8/10.   

this is a funny movie. the bob & eddie show feel of it could lead to a sequel but i doubt it will make enough money. deniro proves he can be a great straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of cgi animals and rodents. rene russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. this was worth seeing in the theater. we needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end. do not leave at the start of the credits!at least a 7.

i went to see this movie not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the teaming of robert de niro and eddie murphy. it was a fast paced movie and the hour and a half went by fast. this one certainly won't win any academy awards but it was a change of pace for mr. de niro. he is good in comedy. overall i enjoyed it.

i don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. the thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. this is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. the three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former tv cop, brought in by russo's character to coach the cops on how to be "tv cops." those are by far the funniest scenes. if you want to be entertained and just sit back for a laugh, then watch this movie.

i cannot understand why so many people did not like this film. robert de niro was on top of his game, delivering his lines with such aplomb, one has to believe this is his everyday demeanor. granted, the film seemed to take on many buddy-film conventions while trying to make fun of the concept, it goes without saying this film was genuinely funny. from the police dog, to the fact eddie murphy didn't annoy the heck out of me, this film is a real keeper. rene russo also evened out the rest of the cast perfectly, establishing her role so it does not interfere with the budding relationship between de niro and murphy.

several stowaways get on a russian ship bound for france. they were going to get off there and make new lives for themselves. after being discovered by the first mate and his henchmen, they were held captive. then things got very bad for them. good show based on a true story.

i was watching an nfl game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the hbo type channels. i missed the beginning but when i started watching deadly voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. you will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your la-z-boy throughout this one. if you get the chance take the time to watch it. every once in a while i think about having the cable company take off my movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them. happy holidays to all from cape cod !!!

i absolutely hate the idea of made for television films . for me tvms usually involve jane seymour or jaclyn smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying of a difficult to treat disease all done in such a sugary manner that the audience doesn`t need tissues it needs insulin . so when deadly voyage a made for tv film by the bbc and hbo based on a true story i vaguely remembered from a couple of years previously turned up on the tv schedules i sat down waiting to be bored senseless . i was surprised.no strike that last sentence , i wasn`t surprised i was shocked . here is a tvm that grips you tighter than a great white shark , in fact deadly voyage doesn`t deserve to be relegated to the tv schedules it should have been made and distributed by a top hollywood film company due its absolutely terrifying premise and what`s more it`s - unlike papillon and sleepers - completely true for those who don`t know the story !!!!! possible spoilers as to plot !!!!! sometime in the early 90s a bunch of africans stowed away on an ukrainian freight ship bound for france in order to work there. of course it was an attempt at illegal immigration but the crew of the freighter had already been fined for allowing illegal immigrants onto their ship from a previous journey and not wanting to get into anymore trouble with maritime and immigration authorities the crew murder the africans after discovering them hiding in the hold. all except one african , kingsley ofusu , who manages to escape from the firing squad but who must try and survive aboard the ship , but the problem is the crew are hunting him and france is still several days voyage away .just typing the above paragraph reminds of how good deadly voyage is . what a remarkable story , and once again it is - unlike many stories that claim to be - totally true . it`s very well written , directed and acted , especially by sean pertwee ( why isn`t that guy a big name star ? ) , and most of all it`s a tense claustrophobic disturbing thriller that i can still remember vividly six years after seeing it for the one and only time . i look forward to seeing again .but you`ve got to ask yourself how can a tvm be better than most of the hollywood action blockbusters that came out round about the same time ? oh hold on , i`ve just had a disturbing thought about jerry bruickhiemer doing a remake with tony scott directing and with denzil washington playing kingsley , brad pitt playing pertwee`s role , massive artistic licence taken with events etc. let`s keep deadly voyage a superlative tvm rather than a poor blockbuster

this searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious african nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families by stowing away on an outbound ship. they think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in new york to send for their families. unfortunately for them, the ship that they select is a rundown russian freighter which has already been heavily fined at a previous port for harboring stowaways. the captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line. the group of blacks begin their harrowing voyage in the cargo hold and are eventually discovered, forced out of hiding and murdered by the ruthless mate (an outstanding performance by sean pertwee.) a few (convincingly terrified leader omar epps among them) manage to temporarily escape and are mercilessly pursued through the ship with their lives forfeit if they are caught. altogether a riveting film which will have audiences biting their nails and gritting their teeth wondering how such dire events could take place in modern civilization.

if you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization, there is an excellent book called "outlaw seas" or "the outlaw sea", and it describes, in story after story, how these things do happen. the lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons. one, many of the world's freighters are of questionable registry (nationality) and it's difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners don't have an office in a real country. two, many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries. the crews are often (like illegal immigrant workers) threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices. three, there is often a language barrier, not only between the officers and the crew, but also between the crew members themselves. the crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence. four, once committing an illegal act, the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint. anyway, it's fascinating reading.horrifying story, excellent movie. does anyone else notice how hbo seems to make the best and most important movies? hollywood has trouble releasing enough oscar worthy movies in any given year, so that several of the top 5 contenders usually come from britain. jerry bruckheimer = the end of quality cinema.i loved the thoroughly evil performance by sean pertwee. i also, as usual, loved omar epps.

as an ex merchant seaman i was really interested in this movie : i personally have been involved in a stowaway search on leaving kingston jamaica where one person was found. we managed to get him ashore though as we were in territorial limits. on another ship i was on the stowaway was found and we could not land him anywhere due to passport/nationality issues. in fact he stayed on for a year as an almost "honorary" crew member and worked for his keep. africa is notorious for stowaway pickups. there is a great scene in the beginning of the film when the bulk carrier enters the african port : her size dwarfing all. the crew pop ashore for a little intercourse and inebriation. so far normal. the drama starts when the stowaways enter the vast cavernous holds of the ship. joss ackland is brilliant as the captain with a drink problem being harassed by his nemesis suchet right on form as the companys representative on board. the stowaway search is classic but we did not have guns. i question the use of guns in this film. this ship seemed to have a vast armoury. in my experience guns at sea are severely restricted due to customs regulations., also having a dog on board was odd.anti rabies laws especially in europe restrict carrying of animal severely. anyway pertwee is brilliant as the embittered mate. the horror which follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable : the grim metallic background of the ships holds and a feeling that there is no where to hide adds to the drama.some of the freighters crew are not into the murder and those who get involved are gradually sucked in to a world of violence from which there is no escape.the chase through the ship especially the engine room scenes are "edge on the seat" : the feeling of extreme claustrophobia abounds. the feeling of metal pressing in and death being only a gun barrel away. the film is brutal : my girlfriend had to give up watching it during the shooting and beating scenes. while this goes on suchet in the comfort of his well appointed cabin gets drunk unaware of the mayhem 3 decks below. its a tense film, flawed in parts but the real message is that we can all get sucked into violence like this. slowly and surely. think of the train drivers who took jews to auschwitz, the clerks who worked out those train timetable. i always remember someone who had visited dachau concentration camp at the end of the war and he said that one of the s.s. guards had put a bird-table outside the camp crematorium. this film is like that : ordinary people suddenly finding themselves in a world of unstoppable violence!

i taped the morrison murders on lifetime movie network and i watched the morrison murders on lifetime, lifetime movie network and on courttv. jonathan scarfe and john corbett did a great job of playing luke and walker morrison. i am glad that walker got his brother luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother bobby. i enjoy watching true stories on lifetime, lifetime movie network and on courttv. the morrison murders is a good movie to watch. next time the morrison murders is on lifetime, lifetime movienetwork or courttv i am going to watch the morrrison murders again because my favorite actor john corbbett is in the morrison murders. i give the morrison murders a ten because it is a good movie about walker who tries to find out who killed his parents and his brother bobby and at the end walker discovers it was his brother luke who murdered his parents and his brother bobby.

even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of black sabbath have not lost a thing. in this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including "n.i.b.", "war pigs", and "paranoid".also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. the comments of ozzy, tony iommi, geezer butler, and bill ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.a must-see for all sabbath and ozzy fans.

this film biography of early rock and roll star buddy holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for gary busey. the movie's highlights are busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings holly songs. he brings such energy to the performances that holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. busey's infectious toothy grin lights up the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved.the film follows holly's career from growing up in lubbock, texas, to stardom and new york and his untimely death in a plane crash. one thing i found interesting, if true, was buddy's driving ambition--he had great plans to go beyond recording and performance to producing. as young as he was he was already establishing himself as a shrewd businessman and definitely wanted to take things to a higher level. we will never know if he would have ultimately catapulted his early success into a business brand like the rolling stones.the lyrics of many of holly's songs are pretty adolescent; read the lyrics for "peggy sue" or "oh boy!" and you will see what i mean. maybe to a great extent this explains his popularity with adolescent audiences, but his instrumentation and stage performances surely account for his influence on groups to follow--both the rolling stones and the beatles have acknowledged his importance.clearly some liberties were taken for dramatic effect. for example, i doubt that holly ever punched out a producer in nashville or that the audience at new york's apollo theater was so immediately responsive as to be wildly dancing in the aisles. if you are interested in getting closer to the truth, see the documentary "the real buddy holly story" (1985) that is produced and hosted by a very relaxed and engaging paul mccartney. this contains interviews with holly's family, friends, and band-mates (holly's musical brothers are not even mentioned in "the buddy holly story"). members of other bands like keith richards and don everly also offer opinions and stories and there is footage of old holly performances. the mccartney production can stand on its own, but it makes an excellent companion piece to "the buddy holly story" and perhaps should be required viewing for anyone who watches the fictionalized story.

first, i'm a huge buddy holly fan. i grew up knowing who he was, and i knew all about that fateful plane ride that extinguished three incredibly bright flames just like that. but i had never truly listened to his music. i had heard much of it, yes, but not until i sat down with the intention of getting something out of it did i truly come to see the real buddy holly. and let me tell you that my world is a different one now because of him.because of this adoration for such an incredible man, i bought the buddy holly story without ever seeing it previously. i'm torn on my views of this film. perhaps it's because buddy feels so alive to me that i just couldn't bear seeing gary busey in this role. i'll admit that he did a nice job acting, but his singing sounded so forced. it seemed to me as if he knew he didn't sound a bit like buddy himself and therefore was using far too much energy to make an attempt at a similar sound. in some parts of the film, he succeeded. but others.. ouch.the movie spanned a period of several years, but i feel that portraying this time span could have been handled much better. i had a difficult time distinguishing at what point in buddy's life certain events were happening. i also had a serious problem with some of the historical inaccuracies. i think the worst one was the portrayal of the crickets. i understand how their real names couldn't be used, and how for simplification there were only two of them in the movie.. and maybe this was a good thing. because the film's background vocals were cringe-worthy, and i disliked the way they were portrayed as a hindrance to buddy's career. something else that really made no difference to the film but irked me was gary busey's teeth. they wore me out! buddy holly had much better teeth. i don't know why i noticed it.. but i did.i'll end this review on what i felt was the best part of the movie: buddy's last performance. his final phone call to maria, the big bopper's performance, bringing him and richie valens to the stage, followed by the still frame ending. it startled even me, and i feel that it effectively shows the audience how at one moment buddy holly was so alive and energetic, and that his flame was snuffed out in the blink of an eye. it was a beautiful way to portray this horrible tragedy i think.good movie, despite the obvious problems.. 7/10.some obvious flaws, could use some work... but not bad.

i saw this (video 2000) years ago and would love to see it on dvd. a good film, but i would have loved it even more if it had included the legacy of the beatles and the hollies etc.i also don't know exactly how true the story is - were some changes made to dramatize the story? i was only 3 when buddy crashed, and didn't wake up to his music until the late 70's. much later i found out our family moved into our new house on - yes, february 3rd, 1959.well ehelhell little things you say and do... his songs will always be remembered - always...

it occurred to me while the final scene of the movie froze to reveal the scant detail of buddy holly's death that there are still people alive today who were at that venue in clearlake, iowa who remember it vividly. that has to be a haunting memory, lent even more poignancy by the lyrics of "american pie", as it pays tribute to the day the music died. the world lost some tremendous talent that day, lives cut short way before their prime, and one can only wonder what might have been if the trio of musicians who perished that day had survived to create an even greater musical legacy.i watched the film today some thirty years after it's original theatrical release. thirty years, i have some trouble wrapping my mind around that. i had forgotten a lot of it, while remembering some of the little things, like the cricket in the wall who became immortalized with the band's name. but most of all, i remember the music. it's hard just to sit there and not begin tapping to the beat of "oh boy" or "that'll be the day", and one has to wonder just where the threat to our morals might have actually come from with those tunes. i'm with buddy on that score at least, how could they be jungle rhythms if he came up with them? funny how each successive decade brought it's own threat to the fabric of society - the beatles, motown, disco and a whole host of other musical forms. we're still listening and dancing to the beat, so i guess they couldn't have been all that bad.there was another takeaway from the film i had forgotten about. this is where i learned to bang a phone on the table when the person on the other end wasn't seeing things my way. i've done that a number of times over the years, but by now had forgotten the source. well, i should be good for another thirty years or so now.you certainly have to give gary busey credit for his portrayal of buddy holly. seeing him today, one could never imagine him as the slimmed down rocker with the horn rimmed glasses, but it was a tour de force characterization and performance that earned busey an oscar nod. don stroud and charles martin smith are competent as buddy's band members, though their characters take a back seat to much of the story. i enjoyed the subtle ways that other musical legends were segued into the picture, names like sam cooke and king curtis, without ever dwelling on their presence. i'll always be a fan and follower of music from the fifties and sixties - 'oldies' they call them now. i guess that makes me a bit of an oldie too, but you can't replace the experience of growing up with the music history that now makes it to the big screen. which only goes to reinforce the idea that i'll keep on enjoying the music until, well, the day i die.

this film is an impressionistic, poetic take on the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating. these are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to america in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, that poor, illiterate sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the united states. they have some fantastic, unrealistic notions about the united states which are disseminated on the trip over. one is that the rivers run with milk, an image which is depicted in the movie to poetic, impressionistic effect. the film is devoid of sound and the silence seems to reflect the uneasiness of the ignorance the locals have about life in america, or if not ignorance of it, a vision significantly colored with superstition and fantasy. that said, the movie depicts with jolting realism, the boat ride to the united states and the intake process which arrivals at ellis island had to undergo. the boat ride is imagined as rather dull which surely it was much of the time. the quarters in which the incoming residents sleep is depicted as extremely crowded with beds spaced four or five inches from one another and lacking much light, which it was surely the case below deck. again, the film is not supplemented with undue music or excessively bright lighting and the effect is to create a fairly realistic imagining of what it was truly like for people emigrating to the united states. the villagers may not be worldly, but they are quite reasonable, and the interaction with the eldest of the emigrants, fortunata (aurora quattrocchi) with the immigration officer who insists on particular results, are quite bittersweet inasmuch as they are not diluted or softened for the benefit of a syrupy conclusion and one sees the melding of the realism of sicily with the extensive regulations which guide life in the united states.the immigrants and their story are very interesting and the combination of cold-eyed realism and the magical fantasy of peoples' imaginations make for a persuasive vision of the beliefs held by sicilians, or any people, with little formal education moving to the united states. the acting is similarly barebones; it is not at all demonstrative or showy, but seems the more realistic for it. that said, all the main performers, in particular salvatore mancuso (vincenzo amato), the clear leader of the group is excellent. while never smiling, his character's actions speak much louder and it is clear that (thankfully) the other members of the group, his two sons and the above mentioned elder fortunata, the boys' grandmother, have faith in his leadership abilities and respect his clear leadership. amato imbues his character with great decency and forthrightness and it is a testament to his abilities that his character appears so capable and confident while his character betrays very little emotion. one oddness of the film is a chance encounter with a mysterious englishwoman (the excellent and fittingly mysterious charlotte gainsbourg) who speaks italian and, during the entire film, we wonder why she is going to the united states or what connection she has to the otherwise unanimously sicilian emigrant group. at the end, this is finally revealed and the revelation is done typically realistically and does not seem particularly melodramatic or showy. the film is directed by emmanuel crialese who has a firm grasp on the realistic, if sometimes superstitious world view his characters inhabit and presents it competently and confidently. it is in fact fantastically confident given how awkwardly the realism and superstition might have combined in the film. it is a worthy examination of the immigrant experience.

i just had the opportunity to see 'nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the u.s. as 'the golden door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from sicially to the u.s. in the early days of the 20th century. it also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of homeland security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land. the (mostly) italian cast, with a few exceptions works well. this is a quiet,understated film that is lovely to look at (the occasional,but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure),while the screenplay is well written. this is a film for those who are sick & tired of mindless escapism from hollywood that serves little more than to sell popcorn (not that i have any burning issues with popcorn,mind you!---i actually love the stuff). you would do wise to seek out nuovomondo/the golden door (or whatever it's being titled in your area).

the golden door (nuovomondo) is for this viewer the finest film of the year to date. it is a masterpiece of concept, writing, directing, acting and cinematography. more importantly, this radiantly beautiful film is a much needed reflective mirror for us to view the history of immigration of 'foreigners' into america at a time when the very mention of the word 'borders' is a political fuse. writer/director emanuele crialese has given us not only a deeply moving story, he has also provided a touchstone for viewers to re-visit the history of each of our origins: with the exception of the native americans, we all entered america as 'foreigners' at some point in our histories, and it is humbling to view this film with that fact in mind.the film opens in turn of the century sicily as poverty stricken widower salvatore mancuso (vincenzo amato) and his brother angelo (francesco casisa) climb a rocky hill to present their tokens to the cross to ask for a sign as to whether they should continue to struggle for existence on the island or go to america, the land of dreams. mancuso's deaf mute son pietro (filippo pucillo) runs to the top of the hill with postcards he has found with images of america (money growing on trees, fruits and vegetables larger than people, etc), and salvatore accepts this as the sign that he should move his family to america. after convincing his reluctant mother fortunata (aurora quattrocchi) and his sisters rita (federica de cola) and rosa (isabella ragonese) to make the trip, he sells his only possessions (two donkeys, goats, and rabbits) and the man with the boat arranges their trip, giving the family shoes, appropriate clothing, and instructions to board an ocean liner as third class passengers. as the mancuso family prepares to board they are asked for a photograph, and as they pose behind a painted set, an englishwoman lucy/luce (charlotte gainsbourg) walks into the photo as though she were part of this peasant family. lucy cannot board the boat for america without male escort.the voyage begins and luce in her gentle way identifies with the mancuso family, finally solidifying her safe passage by proposing to salvatore to marry her 'for convenience, not for love' when they arrive in america. through a violent storm and living conditions that are appalling poor, the multitude of third class passengers survive, bond, and eventually arrive at ellis island, believing their dream of america has been fulfilled. but everyone must pass harsh physical tests, de-lousing, and even intelligence testing to determine if they can enter america: the officials let them know that america does not want genetically inferior people entering the new world! each woman must be selected by a man to marry on ellis island before they are allowed admission. the manner in which the mancuso family remains united until a somewhat surprising ending is the closing of the tale.few of us understand the strict rules and harsh treatment immigrants face (or at least faced at the turn of the century) on ellis island, and if we do we have elected to submerge that information. the golden door presents the case for immigrants' struggles in a manner that not only touches our hearts but also challenges our acceptance of current immigration legislation. but all political issues aside, the golden door is first and foremost a film of enormous beauty, exquisite photography, deeply felt performances by a huge cast, and a very sensitively written and directed story. the is a film that deserves wide distribution, a movie that is a must see for everyone. highly recommended. grady harp

this is christmas time! a nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the italian cinema. it was something like 30-40 years that the italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. this is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. and finally this is also a big production for italian standards of the time. in this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition. real poetry, real humor, real tenderness, real drama, real beauty. no rhetoric, no easy surreal shortcuts, no typical touristic tornatore-like picturing, no over acting, no director autoreferentialism. there is also a cool use of two heartbreaking nina simone's songs, whose music, i reckon has never been used in a proper way for a score. so if this will not be a real reviveing for the italian cinema it is an extraordinary evolution for emanuele crialese after his 'respiro' another definitive beautiful film. 'nuovomondo' is not to be missed, it is that kind of 'medicine film' helpful to enjoy movie-making, movie watching, helpful to enjoy and understand life. francesco cabras

enhanced by the expressive cinematography of agnes godard (beau travail), golden door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in sicily to ellis island in new york at the turn of the century. it is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by emanuele crialese (respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents. crialese's "magical, mystery tour" came about as a result of his visit to the museum on ellis island, the looks on the faces of the immigrants depicted in photographs he saw, and his research into the harsh policies and procedures used during the admission of immigrants.guided by letters he read of immigrants sent to relatives who remained at home, crialese identifies with those impoverished immigrants who were able to see the positive side of things beyond their ordeal. to salvatore mancuso (vincenzo amato) and his older son angelo (francesco casisa), america is a distant dream that they know nothing about. after climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the saints for a sign, they are rewarded when they are shown post cards by salvatore's younger son, pietro (filippo pucillo), a deaf mute, that depict the new world as a land where they can bathe in rivers of milk, sit under a money tree, or harvest giant onions and carrots.after disposing of their animals in exchange for shoes and suits, salvatore, his two sons, and his elderly mother fortunata (aurora quattrocchi) set out on their adventure with more hope than trepidation but the equation soon shifts the other way. as they board the boat and settle into their crowded third-class steerage compartments, the most-talked about scene in the film takes place. using an overhead camera that shows masses of people standing, as the ship pulls away, the frame is divided into those aboard the ship and those waving goodbye from the dock and the way they are separated implies they are being torn asunder from everything familiar.aboard the ship is a mysterious english woman named lucy (charlotte gainsbourg). crialese does not reveal her past or the reason she is traveling to america but she seems to stand for the onset of the modern world they are entering. though they eye each other cautiously, lucy becomes interested in salvatore and asks him to marry her in order to allow her to enter the country. the voyage is treacherous with a violent storm buffeting the ship. shot in almost complete darkness, passengers in steerage are tossed against the side of the boat and, afterward, bodies lie tangled and twisted on the floor as if in a macabre totentanz. the rite of passage through immigration processing at ellis island does not become any easier and crialese attacks the way illiterate peasants, in the name of preserving "civilized" society, are forced to put puzzles together, perform mathematical tasks, and undergo humiliating medical examinations to prove they are "fit".a marriage brokering ceremony feels like an auction block and the young women look despondent when they are matched with overweight middle-aged men. this is the only way they can enter the "golden door", however, since single women are rejected unless they have partners, ostensibly to prevent the threat of prostitution. through the fog the immigrant's can barely see the land of milk and honey and there is no statue of liberty asking for the tired and the poor, the humbled masses yearning to breathe free. in their imagination, however, the river is still flowing, waiting for them to jump in. though the ending is ambiguous and one door opens on to a blank wall, another door symbolizes a rebirth of the soul and the passage we must all take from the old world to the new.

emanuele crialese did a fantastic job with one of those films that linger in the back of your mind for years. it was respiro (see comments and synopsis here in imdb).now, carrying the magnificent young talents he had for the first time on screen then, he takes the audience into a dark void. a literal plunge into dangerous waters. the subject is migration. in this case, from italy to the new world (the name of the film). a big deal calling it for its american release "the golden door".the story of a family that leaves everything and risks the rest -that is, their lives, for a dream.i hate to spoil the show telling the story, so i'll dwell a bit in the work crialese and all his team did so brilliantly.first of all, choosing to stick to what he knows: direct sound as much as possible. this means, the whole film. the textures, the pain, the nuances of reality are always mingled with the smells, the heat or the cold, the sweat and the blood, life and death, as vibrantly as it is in real life.the squeaks of bent metal and grinding wood, the infamous drone of the wind and the ominous sounds of big engines and ship horns are among the points that make this film so involving.cinematography is in the hands of a french couturier. the symbolism of light is present from the very first shot (again, almost the very first shot from respiro) and pervades throughout the film with intimacy and a terrible sense of desperation. the subdued tones and the very gray and grim depictions of people suffering the cramped and filthy boat they sail to hope is mesmerising.light is used sparsely, almost to discover every character in the dark. the beauty of every shot, and every scene is accentuated by the period costumes and the perfectly selected physical features of the actors.again, as he usually does, vincenzo amato is definitely on his own. he plays the father of two sons (the same actors who were fifteen and twelve and now are nineteen and sixteen) with all the power he always conveys to his very complex characters.charlotte gainsbourg is so-so. i guess she's never achieved again the perfection she reached in the cement garden and in her very first film: l'effrontée.maybe it's just that she seems a bit awkward in her role.the locations and sets are harsh and compelling, almost playing a character on their own.maybe the most remarkable character is the one played by filippo pucillo, the mute younger son. the contrast here with his first role is complete. then, he played a supercharged kid that was as relentless as anything around him. now, his character is all expression. and just that: no words at all. his eyes tell the whole story with sublime power.maybe this is one of those films that will not be very well received in the states. it's absolutely italian in everything. it's so italian that most of the time, the language is one of the many dialects that is much older than italian itself. in the usa this film may be a bit too much for americans because of the subject. but anyone who remembers the story of their families when they arrived in the states, will see this films with awe.and, again, the minimalism that goes hand in hand with crialese's ideas is back with a closing scene in the water. only this time it goes from underwater photography to aerial.all in all, another great and very well told story from this filmmaker that only this year (2006) has collected 6 prizes and was nominated for the golden lion. not a small deed!

i never thought i'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning kenji miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, i'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the galactic railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--miyazawa wrote a children's book called night on the galactic railroad). however, this glimpse inside the mind of a writer who "sketched poetry and fairy tales from his imagination" is very intelligent, creative, entertaining, and emotionally powerful.all this despite the fact that everyone is animated as animals (like in many of miyazawa's stories).some of the visuals are truly astounding, especially considering that it was a made for tv movie. seriously, some of them (like the sequence with birds trailing blue light) rival parts of fantasia. however, i still can't stand computer animation when it is mixed with cel animation. the cgi trains are horribly obvious--even more so than the anastasia train.8/10

spirit and chaos is an artistic biopic of miyazawa kenji, a japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. the film captures and interprets his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination.the film integrated excerpts of miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. his relationships with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom. miyazawa's selfless compassion for the farmers in his village, his sister and other unfortunate people can serve as a lesson to us all. furthermore, miyazawa's devotion to science was also nicely portrayed. in a time when western ideas were still met with skepticism, especially in provincial towns like the one where miyazawa grew up, he understands its usefulness in helping his fellow villagers and is inspired by its elegance. the way the film presented moments of artistic passion and disappointment in the writer were truly intense and well interpreted.i felt that the cgi integrated into the film, while groundbreaking an innovative, clashed with the more organic animation. it could be argued that this was intentional to represent conflict within the main character, but i found it rather unaesthetic. i also wish that the film had discussed miyazawa's buddhist influence, but it worked fine without it. i though this film was very well done. i give it a 9/10, with the one point being deducted for the cgi. otherwise the animation, plot and dialog were all wonderful and heartfelt. i haven't seen any other films by kawamori shoji, but after seeing this one i will be sure to give them a chance.

i've commented once on this chucky great, but i had to do it again to say some things about the film, when i first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. the film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because i cherish chucky. the other horror villains are referenced with great coolness!!! and the gore was shockingly great! the scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful! that was a great gore scene!!!!! and the ending was so bizarre and shocking it made me s*%@ my pants. the idea of having the seed of chucky was very, very bizarre and shocking! when i left the theater i just loved it and i could'nt believe it was real. the bizarre and different qualities of this child's play installment for some reason made me mark it as the jason goes to hell of the child's play series. it just had that intensely shocking, bizarre and different quality that reminded me of jason goes to hell. a sure ***** out of *****. here's how i rank the series : 1,4,2,3. i loved it but not quite as much as tom holland's original child's play classic. i can't wait for seed of chucky! bring it on!

the movie doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)!this film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. it knows it sucks, and because of that, it's far and away the best of the "child's play" series. it plays up the "stoopid humor" angle so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing at it, but with it. and, trust me, the whole time you're laughing, it's laughing back atcha.

i would say 'bride of chucky' is a "return to greatness" but the series was never really great. very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and i think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. and it contains the best subtitle/tagline: "chucky gets lucky." so he does, in the role of jennifer tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as jeri ryan did for 'star trek: voyager.' tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for chucky. and as much as i liked her in the feature, she can't get all the credit: the props (watch the first 1-2 minutes for horror-homages), the writing, the inside jokes (again, the opening + pinhead) and chucky lines were great ("in fact, if (this) were a movie, it would take 3-4 sequels just to do it justice," among others.) mercifully, chucky and the series has given up on andy the "hide the soul" quest, and just settled for a new way out of his body. he teams up with his ex (tilly) whom he transfers into a "bride" doll and a couple of bonnie & clyde teens (really, heigl?) to regain this pendant buried with chucky's human corpse. this is for any chucky fan, 1980s slasher-horror fans or even to those who's never seen any of the previous 'child's play' films. it's funny, dark, harmless, gory  but not over the top and despite tilly's literal 20 minutes of screen time, it's always great to see her. after all, you barely see her play poker anymore. (side note: of course, i picked up on the superman reference  hackensack, nj.)

sexy murderess tiffany (jennifer tilly) still yearns for a life of wedded bliss with ex-boyfriend, crazed killer charles 'chucky' lee ray. after getting her hands on the mutilated good guy doll that last played host to his spirit, and doing a spot of repair work, she conducts a satanic ritual that returns his life to the toy.unfortunately for poor tiff, the reanimated maniac shows no interest in marriage, and so she traps him in a cage, with a bride doll for company. eventually, a rather angry chucky (voiced by brad dourif) escapes his confines, electrocutes tiffany in the bath, and traps her soul in his 'bride' as retribution.realising that they are now both in the same predicament, the plastic pair put their differences aside and decide to head for hackensack, new jersey, where they can lay their hands on the magical amulet that can relocate their spirits into human hosts. tricking trailer park hunk jesse (nick stabile) and his tasty girlfriend jade (katherine heigl) into taking them to their destination, the psycho dolls embark on a murderous rampage, with their unwitting companions copping the blame.although the idea of a kid's doll being possessed by the spirit of a mass murderer has always been rather comical, it wasn't until the fourth film in the child's play series that the makers fully embraced the sheer lunacy of the premise, opting to plays things much more for laughs than for scares (although there is still plenty of ott splatter for us gore-hounds to enjoy).talented hong kong director ronny yu oversees proceedings, deftly translating the witty tongue-in-cheek script into a slick and thoroughly enjoyable cinematic ride. similarly, the excellent cast handle the camp material perfectly, with stabile and heigl making a likable couple, but smoking hot tilly stealing the show as blonde, buxom, pouting, pvc-mini-skirted temptress tiffany. kevin yagher's impressively expressive doll effects also go a long way to making the film such a success.overall, this film is unlikely to find many fans amongst 'serious' horror aficionados, but those who enjoy the odd spot of mindless popcorn entertainment, full of twisted, black humour, crazy death scenes, and magnificent cleavages should have a blast.

i especially liked the ending of this movie--i really felt what the characters must have felt, which i think is a mark of good directing. i was tickled with how the new hire at the record store turned out--great character development there, even though his "role" would probably be considered minor.i was also impressed that the entire film, while dark in its subject matter, was free from gratuitous nudity, profanity, and violence. sadness, sexuality, and darkness can all be communicated (often better) by what is left unsaid, but it seems that this is often unique to really "classy" films and actors. kudos to the film-maker for that.

where do we go from here? that is the overriding question of this film. and make no mistake, 'mainly etc.', the 2003 effort from director john jansen, asks far more questions than it answers, but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this one.much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies, and i'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you'll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery. however, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer. questions are raised  everything from the mundane to the profound  but jansen skillfully forces his audience to examine and answer these questions ourselves, with little to no help from the characters.side 1 opens with an increasingly complex and beautifully orchestrated arrangement of non-linear segments to introduce us to the main characters. we meet them on the morning of april 8, 1994  the day kurt cobain committed suicide. and it is the death of cobain, and the journey to his wake two days later in seattle, that serve as the backdrop for the film. in exploring cobain's life, music, and death, the characters attempt - with varying degrees of success - to understand and come to terms with their own lives.there are some aspects of the film that are what you might expect from a low-budget indie film: the performances range from decidedly mediocre to outstanding, with the strongest performances coming from jessica scott (holly) and noel wood (daniel); some of the dialogue is admittedly a bit stiff, but never completely strays into the unreal; and there are some minor sound problems, particularly once we get on the road, that make it difficult at times to follow the action on screen.but despite its shortcomings, 'mainly etc.' is a solid, deeply affecting piece of cinema. amid moments of haunting poignancy, laugh-out-loud humor, and intimate turmoil, jansen deftly weaves all of the character threads together and illuminates their own struggles while at the same time making them accessible and engaging for us. and because we can see reflections of ourselves in one or more of these characters, we can identify with the questions and issues they're struggling with, and we're able to look back and remember where we were on that day in 1994 when for many people the world changed.while jansen takes credit for the writing, editing, and direction of the film, kudos must be given to his photography as well. with an uncanny eye and amazing ability to capture and draw us into each of the characters' worlds, jansen managed to produce shot after shot after shot that stuck with me long after the credits rolled.and no review of this film would be complete without a nod to the amazing soundtrack. the music in this film is used to amazing effect; at times subtly underscoring the action, at other times taking center stage, but never getting in the way or deteriorating into kitschy music video. the soundtrack plays like the ultimate greatest hits, though i suspect that label would probably not sit very well with the director.the new double dvd archive edition offers some deleted scenes, trailers, music videos, and a cobain documentary. the deleted scenes offer some insight into the making of the film through alternate opening and closing sequences, and it's certainly a treat to have the rare and beautiful raining kind video. the cobain documentary is fine, if a bit worse for wear, and certainly more extensive documentaries are available for the hardcore fans. conspicuously absent is a director commentary, and i can't help but wonder if jansen has plans to re-release this at some point with that tasty tidbit attached.suffice to say that the next time you're looking for a strong piece of work from a talented filmmaker, i recommend you get on board.

as an english teacher, i appreciate films that do more than tell a story. good films, like good literature, cause one to think, reflect and predict. this film made me do all three. mr. jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. i also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or felonious as other films i have seen. the acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other. excellent soundtrack, with songs you don't hear on the radio. it is a reconciling with life/spontaneous road trip film that deserves more than just a second glance.

i saw this film at a small screening. even though it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie. it's april 8, 1994, each of the characters are in their "mid 20's" and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn of nirvana singer kurt cobain's suicide. they quickly get inspiration to travel from san francisco to seattle and attend the cobain vigil. it's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes. highlights include: a visit to jimi hendirx's grave, kurt cobain's original childhood home and a campfire sing along. an honest an original piece of work.

great show! about time a reality tv show comes along that closes generation gaps. contestants range in ages, some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. and others, looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them. grease has truly become an american icon. grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to. "you're the one that we want" is sure to gain even more grease followers. the only thing i wish there had been more of is character history, then again it is kind of nice to leave some of it to the nostalgic imagination of the 50's. cant wait to watch the next show...and then on broadway!!!

i love the tv contest. hate to see it end. there are so many talented contestants. it's a shame that only 2 will be picked. i love watching the judges also. at times they are as entertaining as the contestants. i have been watching the show faithfully every sunday night. wouldn't miss it for the world. it's the best reality show that's ever been on television. good luck to all the contestants, though i have already chosen the two who i would like to see play danny and sandy on broadway. i am anxious to see if my decisions are correct. i am not aware of how long the contest will go on until a danny and sandy are chosen but i will keep watching until the end.

this show really is the broadway american idol. it has singing, the british guy, a guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman.of course it is different because there is a sing-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). i gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that i know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. the first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home. i know they want to find the right danny and sandy, but america should have the power to decide who does home. there's really no point to the sing-off. the person with the lowest number of votes usually goes home anyway. another things i'd change is to see them actually act on the show. what's broadway without the acting? the last thing that need to be changed is the song the eliminated people sing at the end. the eliminated danny always sings the same song and the eliminated sandy always sings the same song as they exit. since they sing it every week those songs eventually get annoying.i admit to not being a fan of the movie, grease, but for some reason i am hooked. this show is very underrated. it has so many memorable performances and moments.

as a local performer, i thought that "grease" showcased what broadway producers are looking for and it highlighted a small bit of the acting population. although my favorites did not win (but came in second), i enjoyed comparing myself to them and seeing what i liked and where i could improve as a performer.they brought in olivia newton-john because she is the obvious link between the broadway production and television audiences.they sang songs from the movie ("hopelessly devoted," et al) because these songs will be included in the new production.i agree with the earlier comment made that the b'way cast looks so much older, but you must bear in mind that these are people who have been on broadway and worked their tails off to be there. if the entire cast was green and fresh then i believe that would have compromised the casting process by which producers choose their talent.

i just saw this film and i recommend it. it has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good. a very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love. tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering. emily watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything. i won't say more because it is better for you have to enter the story as it unfolds.

my husband and i watched this last night...it was wonderful....for once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending. it moved along very quickly and the acting was superb.. i adore tom wilkinson anyway. he has never made a bad movie as far as i'm concerned. the above description of his acting hits the nail on the head... the facial expressions are incredible. even the picturesque scenery is awesome. we have just finished watched all of the prime suspect series and i am convinced that the british have a way of capturing the audience. there is no doubt that i would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get a few hours of thorough entertainment.

i have to admit i have a particular penchant for the humor and story telling style of british movies, though not all of course, succeed.this film made me think, and left me in the end with a quiet smile on my face. its about character development and relationships, truth and lies, and whether love is sometimes simply not enough. some very nicely understated acting from all the participants, especially the two leads, tom wilkinson and emily watson.there was a lot of fuss made about gosford park, but with this piece i feel fellowes has actually produced a better movie, though it has not been a mainstream release.an intelligent mature story about real people who are undeniably flawed, but also capable of acts of genuine graciousness.

fellowe's drama about a couple's marriage which is threatened by a younger third party which interests the wife of the house (watson). wilkinson plays the role very well as the troubled husband who cant control his wife's cheating, and deals with the issue. i also like rupert everett a lot in his role as william bule, the man that watson has the affair with. although i think emily watson is a great actress, i had a bit of a problem with the way her character was written, did not make her too likable (i know a cheater is not supposed to be likable, but some of her actions and things she did had no reasoning behind them). the screenplay was perhaps the weak part of this drama, although fellowes' direction was good and the performances were also quite good. this film is better than unfaithful, but not a masterpiece by any means. ---imdb rating: 6.7, my rating: 8/10

those who dislike this film seem to think that a loved one somehow 'belongs' to them and must be discarded if they go off with someone else. fortunately, human nature is much deeper than that; loving someone deeply inevitably brings suffering - though if we are fortunate only on their death.this film is true in setting, atmosphere and dialogue to nigel balchin's original novel ('a way through the wood'), and by pinpointing a seemingly irreconcilable dilemma captures the quiet desperation that lies behind many seemingly idyllic lives (and the depiction of english upper class country life is very accurate).i loved the film and hope it will appear soon as an uk-compatible dvd

i really liked this movie.everyone has something to be blamed for, everyone is real. no paperboard heroes or cold, omnipotent, know-all characters.i read many others viewers here complaining about anne morality and about james will to maintain his love for her, despite her cheating on him, but i don't agree.i found anne (emily watson) absolutely wonderful and i felt love for her.she was a heavily repressed woman, her actions were not planned: once she started to break free she was in confusion and did many errors. but so it's in real life, when you gain freedom you are likely to do errors (expecially at the start point).was she a little too ungrateful? maybe. but we must remember that she is running with her feet for the first time. she knows that james after all is a good man, maybe a little too stiff, serious and work centered; but she also feels the urge to live the life as herself.is she to blame more than him? i think no.but the turn happening into their lives generates some changes.james instead of letting his wife go out of his life (as other viewers suggested as the right choice) bites the bullet and waits, hoping for the better. he starts to understand that what he superficially though was ok (his marriage) in reality was a control game played by him on his wife.this is not a story with characters having over-emotional and precarious nature (i.e. the usual clichè latin american or italian jealous guys), this is a story of men and women that use both heart and brain.it can be very painful but if you really love a person (women or man) and if you are not a terribly unstable nature, you are likely to forgive his/her cheating and let him/her go. unless you are a jealous, prehistoric, crime-of-passion inclined, possessive and mentally instable individual.a really good movie. the last scene, when james - despite all the things happened before - goes with anne to the train station is really moving: she is free and he understood what freedom means for a person.guido

i gave it a seven only because the acting is good. and of course by that i mean wilkinson. the other two principals were "decent". but the characters themselves...what on earth was so bad about the character wilkinson played (james manning)? i didn't see him behaving like the martinet emily watson accused him of being. bill bule, on the other hand, was an insufferable jerk who i was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise. who was i kidding? tom wilkinson isn't paul bettany after all. so what on earth did emily watson's (anne) character see in him???? she herself admitted he was pretty much a piece of offal in his treatment of her. why would she even want to be in the same town as him, to say nothing of the same "room".i noticed some other reviews, one person said she "cried" at the end, to witness james' tragedy. ??? what tragedy? what, you mean losing an imbecile who finds someone like bill bule amusing???!!! give us a break.

how on earth can people give this movie a low rating. unbelievable. the performances of wilkinson and watson are so full of merit that i can only imagine that these detractors were weaned on blockbusters and porn. (if this sounds bad-tempered, it's because i just wiped my original 400-worder just now) i was so impressed by tom wilkinson. all hail the guy. this is a performance of considerable subtlety and massive skill. his development as an actor from the full monty to this masterpiece of a performance is amazing; one of the best things to happen in film-making in the last ten years.emily watson is somewhat less commanding, due to that glint in her eye that says 'see me? this cheeky woman, here? you can't guess what i'm going to do next because i don't know either!' it seems to be something she can't help showing us in every role, but still, she's an actor of terrific ability and presence. she is very sexy here, as she needs to be, and fair play to her for this: this is a screen quality that normally, for me, she doesn't have in previous films.as you might expect, rupert everett, required to play an upper-class late-30 something who could give tutorials at phd level in how not to give a toss about heading to hell on account of total selfishness, delivers. he is so thin here, throughout the movie, however, i'm worried for him. linda bassett's housekeeper is also excellent: a smallish role but with a major plot twist to deliver, she makes you ponder how much talent we have in britain in terms of character acting. i want to see more of her.the narrative arc is fine; it's an interesting enough plot, given that no-one in film-making seems to be trying to convince joe public that there's nothing new under the sun, though it does stray towards 40s melodrama in the last 'reel.' but never mind that - this is a terrific 80 minutes worth of anyone who has half-a-brain's money. congrats to julian fellowes on his first directorial effort: o how we need more films of substance like this. he shows a lot of skill in terms of adapting the original novel, telling a story with much effectiveness and subtlety. and congrats too on conjuring an immense display of the film actor's art from mr tom wilkinson. what a geezer.t.

there are so many more complexities to the plot of this wonderful thought provoking movie than just infidelity and cover-up of responsibility for the accident. i was struck by the initial seeming goodness of husband wilkinson who wanted the driver, when he thought it was everett, disclosed to the police, and the change of heart (and morals) when he learned it was his wife. as well, was he indeed good, and/or was he attempting to redeem self by allowing her to go with rupert. then, things switchedand she decided the right ting to do was admit that she hit him. most importantly the theme of redemption (for the accident - for the infidelity - in her own odd, flawed way)is strongest in watson's sickbed care for everett. i believe that is why she undertook that effort.this seems to be a common theme in modern british novels: brideshead revisited, the end of the affair come to mind. love it.

another great tom wilkinson performance punctuates "separate lies," a 2005 film also starring emily watson, linda bassett and rupert everett. directed by julian fellowes, it's the story of a married couple, james and ann manning where the husband (wilkinson) believes he and his wife (watson) are happy together. an accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around. it is a hit and run that killed their maid maggie's bassett) husband. james becomes suspicious of a neighbor, bill bule (everett) when he sees some damage on his car. he confronts bule, who admits he did it and promises to go to the police the next day. when james arrives home, ann is angry that he is making such a big deal out of it and states that she was driving the car. of course, james then isn't so eager to rush to the police. she suggests that they call bule and tell him their decision. "oh, f___ bule," james says. "well, that's just it," ann says. "i am f___ing bule." james' devastation is just the beginning in this well-crafted drama. without giving the plot away, this is a good example of how gender switching changes a story. example of what i mean: susan smith drives her car into a lake and her children drown. she gets life in prison. what if the father had done it? the chair. you'd be surprised how often the outcome would be different. the same is true here - if it had been james having the affair and doing the subsequent activities, viewers might feel differently about the story. if ann were in james' place, it would be shattering. as it is, it's tremendously sad.tom wilkinson is heartbreaking as a man blindsided by the woman he adores, and emily watson does a beautiful job as ann, who, once she frees herself from her lies - her involvement in the accident and the happy marriage - knows what she has to do. rupert everett as bule is very effective - indolent, uppity and ultimately in need. everyone here is very civilized in their dealings with one another, and no one is all good or all bad.there are separate lies - james that his marriage is happy, ann's as listed above - and there is one uniting lie - the accident, about which all parties keep quiet. it's enough for ann that maggie knows. in the end, all must deal with the separate lies that the single lie uncovered.brilliant film.

years ago when i first read john irving's the world according to garp, i was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom i had contact didn't like the book when i loved it. i began to understand that it was an age and experience thing. i experienced somewhat of a déjà vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. fully enjoying separate lies is surely an age and experience thing.in this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he a successful lawyer - she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer. they have a townhouse in london and a home in the country. all's well until there enters the "villain" in the guise of the son of the richest man in the village. this guy appears to be a cad from the word, "go." he is disdainful of everyone and everything including his own children. in the traditional form of nice guys finishing last, the lawyer's wife engages in an affair with the bounder. you see the lawyer really is a nice guy but with the marriage killing trait of an organized perfectionist. even though he truly loves her, he is boring his wife to death. the bad boy is far more exciting.all of this is entangled with the hit-and-run death of a man in the village in which all the facts point to the cad being the driver of the vehicle.it's easy to determine that this movie doesn't build to a happy ending, however, it does lead to a very satisfying ending in that the man and his wife learn and grow from their experiences and probably will be able to conduct their personal lives in a more successful manner.three excellent actors play the main characters in this film, and it is there performances that make the whole thing a pleasure to watch. tom wilkinson is perfect as the husband. his portrayal shows us a kind man who has so much control over his emotions that he has lost touch with the world. emily watson shows us a woman who has become so trapped in the role of perfect wife that she has almost lost her knowledge of passion. that passion is reborn by the character deftly played by rupert everett.if you have reached that point in life in which you understand that everyone has feet of clay and that everyone - even with the gifts of intelligence and opportunities - makes many many wrong decisions, then you will probably enjoy watching these excellent actors creating the lives of three such people. this is a beautifully acted and directed adult film about realistic adults.

i consider this a breathtaking but deceptive film because it seems so simple and straightforward: a vietnam survivor tells his harrowing tale and some of the story is reenacted on location. reviewers sometimes even claim that herzog's presence in the film is minimal, but how wrong they are. we know that all documentaries are "mediated" to some extent and this one has herzog's subtle hand all over it, most notably in the stunning music, the unbelievably expert selection of archival footage, and the management of cascading images. the evocative power of this film is astounding, starting with its title, the opening title card from the book of "revelation," and the initial voice-over. this is a movie that one can watch repeatedly with increasing wonder, not a simple commodity that is gulped down with one's favorite beverage on the way to the evening news. this is one of those movies that can resonate with you for a lifetime.

(some spoilers) early 1930's educational movie about the horrors of contracting a social disease and the consequences that come along with it: blindness madness loss of ones abilities to function as well as infecting other people with it, even one's unborn children, and finally death. "damaged lives" is far ahead of it's times in educating it's viewers about the dangers venereal deasise. viewed now over 70 years after it's release back in 1933 is as good, if not better, then the many films about that subject made back in the 1940's 1950's and even 1960's.donald bradley, lyman williams, is a top executive of a major shipping company who's been going study with his girlfriend joan, diane sinclair, for some time. both are finally planing to get married and raise a family. out at a party one evening donald meets elsie cooper, charlotte merriam, and together they have one drink too many and before you know it end up spending the night together in elsie's home. thinking nothing of his one night stand with elsie donald later marries his long time love joan and they both plan to have a child, or so they thought. at the office donald get a panicked call from elsie telling him to come over to her place right away about something very important. rushing over donald finds out, to his horror, that elsie has a sexual infection that she got from her boyfriend nat, harry myers, and that she may have given it to donald, and he in turn may have infected his wife joan. telling elsie that she's wrong about him being infected and that she should seek medical attention elsie shoots herself as donald is just about to leave. getting over elsie's tragic death donald gets another surprise later when his doctor dr. bill hill, jason robards sr, comes over to his office telling him to immediately come with him to the hospital to talk to infectious disease specialist dr. vincent leonard, murray kinnell, about his wife joan who's just been admitted there. the terrible truth about donald and his wife joan hits him like a bolt out of the blue and leaves him speechless, just like it did joan earlier. both have been infected and the infection is the dreaded and unspeakable,back in the 1930's, infection called venereal disease. told by dr. leonard that it would take some two years of treatment for both donald and joan to be completely cured it leaves joan in a state of dangerous suicidal thoughts. later in the film joan, feeling that she has nothing to live for, closes all the windows in her and donald's apartment and turns on the gas stove, full blast, in order to kill herself and donald who was asleep at the time. honest film about the ravages of venereal disease and the damage that it does to those who are infected by it, both psychically as well as mentally, and how it could be cured if given immediate medical care instead of hiding it from one's doctor and keeping it hidden, for fear of shame and embarrassment, until it's too late.

yes, this movie was just hilarious and the acting was top notch from the whole cast. except shelley winters german accent wasn't that great but then that doesn't matter as she is hardly in the film. so if you're a fan of hers beware! the two main stars of this film are laurence harvey and julie harris. now before this film, i'd only see miss harris in east of eden with james dean and i own an audio tape of the glass menagerie that she did on stage with monty clift and jessica tandy, so i wasn't sure how she'd be in this role and boy, did she impress me. how hammy was she? i love ham! ;-) mr. harvey, he tickled my fancy! i am now a full time laurence harvey fan! that hair!!! *cackles* omg! it's almost like burt lancasters, that crazy messy look, it doesn't get better than that. he is young and so innocent in this film. see it now! it's definitely in my top ten! :) i am so glad i found a copy that is all mine! unfortunately this movie is out of print and very hard to find on video. :(btw, watch out for the hospital hotel room scene!!!!! it's one of the best parts! or when mr. harvey has convinced himself he's ill and he's trying to get his knee to kick, you know how doctors do with that little rubber hammer ;-) well he does it himself and his leg kicks and it kicks the table *squeals* check out the look on his face, so innocent!!!! i can't describe it but to all those people who say he couldn't act very well and other cockamamie comments, see this film and you will see what a great actor he really was. you'll be bowled over! if you aren't, then i'm afraid there is nothing i can do for you, you're hopeless. ;-)

turning isherwood's somewhat dark and utterly brilliant novel into light comedic romp could easily have been a recipe for disaster, but somewhow it wasn't . the story moves at a zanily rapid pace and the black and white imagery is gorgeous, as are harvey and harris as they ham their way through a wacky weimar berlin. fun!

this british film version of the stage play i am a camera is based on christopher isherwood's "berlin stories." this is the source material for the famous musical cabaret.julie harris, a major stage actress of her day, reprises her 1951 tony award winning role as sally bowles. she's a far cry from the liza minnelli character but the basic "sally" is all here despite the various film codes that would have blocked this story from being filmed in hollywood. harris is perhaps stagy but she's also quite good as the madcap and maddening sally. her singing number is obviously dubbed (by marlene dietrich no less) although harris apparently sings for herself in other moments.laurence harvey (with the very ugly hair) plays isherwood with zero charm and can't even make the character interesting. shelley winters does little with the role of natalia (marian winters won a supporting tony for the play), and anton diffring is ok as fritz. ron randell plays the caddish clive but seems a tad loud. lee seidl is funny as the landlady.yet despite the overall staginess and cheap look, harris takes center stage and she is amazing. this film was released the same year as east of eden in which harris gives a glowing performance as abra. comparing the two performances gives a good look at the talent miss harris possesses. these two characters couldn't be more unalike. harris' sally preens and prances about and growls out a very lascivious laugh. she also acts circles around the boring harvey.without the music and with a familiar storyline, many viewers may find little here to recommend this film, but it's a great chance to see the great julie harris repeating what was probably a very shocking role in 1951.

i have just seen this delightful classic again after many years, the next to last film directed by henry cornelius, who died three years later at the age of only 45 (the same age at which the film's male star larry harvey was also to die in 1973). three future directors were in the crew: jack clayton (associate producer), guy green (cinematographer), and clive donner (editor). this film is based upon the autobiographical story 'goodbye to berlin' by the well-known british author christopher isherwood, which was first turned into a play by john van druten, then made into this film, then turned into a musical, 'cabaret', and finally filmed as 'cabaret', which brought the amazing liza minelli to world attention, with her voice which can shatter a glass at the distance of a mile. isherwood appears as a character in the film under his own name. he was gay, but in those days that was illegal and could land him in prison, so he disguises his proclivities under the description of being what he calls 'a confirmed bachelor'. this is the key to his platonic relationship with the wildly eccentric, wacky, promiscuous, ever-cheerful and thoroughly unique character whom he calls sally bowles. the portrait of sally bowles in this film is a tour-de-force by the young julie harris, who sweeps every scene into a magical and captivating web of sparkling personal charm. what a vehicle for an actress with plenty of charm of her own! it is one of the great cinematic performances of the 1950s. isherwood is played to perfection by the young lawrence harvey, in a finely-judged performance which never allows the comedy to go over the edge, and even the moments of farce bordering on slapstick remain somehow 'almost believable'. larry is so funny at portraying a wimpish hypochondriac. what an irony, considering the total lack of hypochondria shown by his bravery and stoicism in the last year of his life as he died from terminal stomach cancer and behaved with such dignity and lack of complaint. i knew him well in the last three years or so, and he was a generous, warm, and modest person. he adored his little girl domino, now alas also tragically dead.this film was his finest early performance, to be followed by his spectacular work in 'room at the top' (1959), 'summer and smoke' (1961) and 'the manchurian candidate' (1962). larry was often undervalued in his lifetime because he was too handsome, was often cast as a cad, and glamour boys are not always accepted as good actors, but many of the finest actresses played opposite him, and they were in no doubt of his abilities, and he was a strong lead in many of the most important films of his time. if he had lived beyond middle age, he would have gone from strength to strength and become a 'grand old man' of the screen. sitting in his house in hampstead one day, he gave me a glass of his usual white wine from a huge barrel which he had brought from some foreign cellar. i said he always gave me such delicious wine, what was it? he proudly answered that it was a sancerre which he had chosen himself at the vineyard in france and had shipped over specially. he then added with extreme wistfulness: 'you know, i've been waiting for four years for someone to comment on it and ask me what it is, and you are the first person who has ever done so.' what mattered to him was to be recognised for having taste in wine,and his more glamorous friends had denied him that satisfaction. in this film, anton diffring gives a touching early performance as an earnest young man (later he was to have to play nazi officers far too much, poor fellow), and the young shelley winters plays a rich german jewish girl, in her usual noisy but effective manner, but it was not too difficult, as she was a noisy jewish girl herself anyway. this film has such an air of joie de vivre about it, that it is pure delight.

hindsight is a wonderful thing. much reviled when it first appeared, (inspiring the famous review 'me no leica'), this precursor of "cabaret" can now be looked at in comparison and it's not half bad. it's certainly no classic but it has its own wayward charm, (the film version of "cabaret" follows this plot whereas the stage version changed the plot somewhat). one should, of course, resist the temptation to snicker when laurence harvey's christopher isherwood, (it keeps the original author's real name; god knows what isherwood thought of it), describes himself as 'a confirmed bachelor' and while harvey is an utterly inadequate 'hero', (he's virtually asexual), and shelly winters woefully miscast as fraulien landauer, (the part marisa berenson played in "cabaret"), julie harris is a perfectly marvellous sally, (it's a lovely piece of comic acting), and anton diffring is first-rate as fritz, the german-jew in love with shelly's character. of course, if "cabaret" had never come along you might ask yourself would this ever have seen the light of day again. that it has been revived may not quite be cause for celebration but it's perfectly acceptable all the same.

george carlin is probably my favorite comedian. i have seen so many of his specials and even had the opportunity to see him perform live. he had a certain cynicism that always appealed to me. his last 2 specials (life is worth losing especially and complaints and grievances) have lacked a certain spirit and content. george appeared overweight, old and tired (not to mention coming out of rehab). "i said not to mention it"! anyway. life is worth losing was especially tragic as he was overweight, disgruntled, coming off of rehab (there we go again...) and extremely unfunny. if there was a way to feel sorry for a comedian without heckling him off stage, george achieved it with life is worth losing. it is as if the new millennium and post 9/11 america was trampling george's spirit. the bs had become too large to manage.the comeback is partially successful with it's bad for ya! this special is the transmutation completed. george is no longer trying to rekindle his glory days. he is in full acceptance of his age, being old and dealing with the looming prospects of death. he has accepted being a crusty old sob and is relishing in it. this is better than his previous specials, yet far from jammin' in new york. it is a little tragic. his observations are not cutting edge anymore and seem more andy rooney than lenny bruce. george isn't george anymore. he is no longer criticizing us but is the man in the high castle pointing out how things were and how dissimilar modern life is. this is an improvement over the previous two specials, but george does not, as of yet, recoup his old glory (if ever). he has been reduced from critical social and political stinging commentary to mostly personal peeves. when he goes political, he still has something to say. it is heavily derived (especially if you have seen any of his previous work), but it still works somehow, as opposed to his random rantings which lack a certain relevance outside of the baby boom generation. the last 25 minutes is the best this special has to offer.for now i will worship the sun and pray to joe pesci that george can recreate himself as a cutting edge septuagenarian. it's a 50/50 chance. life seems to have become more tedious for george and his "art" is now his life. this is a step in the right direction from his previous 2 specials, but is far from his old self. where does he go from here? he may never recoup but maybe he can further metamorphosing/refine this new ornery old man routine. heres to hoping for 7 more words you can't say on tv or at least a windmill he can handle.

for those of you who like stand-up comedians you must have heard about george carlin. he is really one of the best comedians alive so you must know him.but he died already, god rest him in peace. or hell. he didn't believe too much in religion so he might as well chose hell to live eternity. haha, just joking, don't take it serious!it's bad for ya!, it's one of the latest works of george carlin, before his death--believe me, one of his best works, a must for any fan and an almost best-of of all george carlin's jokes. it's not a best-of... but it's really amusing.it has less political and religious jokes. it's only to have a great time!editing is very good. it's not a concert, so, it shouldn't have quick changing of shots... the slow fading to other shot was well done. fading is the best option in terms of editing!

my brother got me hooked on carlin back in the 70s. i always loved his observational humor. that is, looking at every day things and finding the humor in it, like asking the question,"have you ever tried to throw away an old waste basket? you can't do it! they keep bringing back to you!" and asking questions like why is the word kill more acceptable then the "f" word, while making prefect sense with the discussion.however, during the 90s his stuff was less funny, and more angry. what he seemed to be doing was holding a mirror to society's face and say 'take a look!' at this point, his shows were less of a comedy show, and more of a gripe session. but in all fairness he always made a tremendous amount of sense. he really made you think.here was carlin old and new. he starts out about the fun one could have by getting old, and later slamming the the state of the world. again making perfect sense.this was his best since "jammin' in new york", and as it turns out his last.i think what 'the shootist' was to john wayne, or 'a prairie home companion' to robert altman, 'it's bad for ya' is to george carlin. a fond farewell to a true great icon. love him, or hate him, i think he will be remembered.

this is unfortunately carlin's last recorded hbo concert, from a series that lasted over 30 years. though this may not be his "best" work, it is excellent, funny, and thought provoking. this recording is also a bit different from most of his other concerts that it is a bit lengthier than most of his other concerts.throughout his long, prolific, and influential career, carlin has moved from the more observational humor and fart jokes, towards a more 'humanitarian' viewpoint of society and culture. his focus on the english language and euphemisms increased throughout the years, and culminates in this performance. though, i would argue that his audio book "when will jesus bring the pork chops?" best displays his vast wit with regards to language, euphemisms, and the breakdown of our values. it's bad for ya is quite indicative of his long transformation from a comedian to a writer.if you are offended by foul language or the disparagement of the church, you will probably not like any of carlin's stand up material. however, if you enjoy being mentally stimulated and can tolerate the language and blasphemy, you would probably greatly enjoy this concert.

mr. carlin left our common forum in june of 2008, shortly after going to the hospital for pains in the chest (he had a history of heart trouble). the media, and comics everywhere covered the loss more than i or he would have ever expected ... but, he was the grandfather of observational comedy.this recording was his last production and contains a large section dedicated to the topic of death and the prospects of life thereafter. filming of the project occurred shortly after his seventieth birthday, which he was happy to have attained (observed?). i have followed carlin's career from the days of fuzzy black and white television, and enjoyed his topical record albums.it is a privilege for any carlin fan to at least see (if not own a copy) of this particular show. he was still fast moving, and with great timing, even at 70! as he would say,,, he is not "smiling down from heaven on you". if he's doing anything at all it's not taking harp lessons; perhaps he's looking up!!!

it's bad for ya really showcases more of george carlin's talents. he really is still as sharp as a tack. it is a shame that we lost him this past year, but his comedy will forever live on. this stand-up special is literally one of the funniest i have ever heard a comedian perform. even though he is making fun of small children, it just makes you laugh the way he says some of the stuff. it is true that carlin can literally make something that seems unfunny and turn it into one of the funniest things you have ever and will ever hear. i really enjoyed this stand-up particularly from carlin and recommend that those that liked this check out more of george carlin's stand-up.

it might be a stretch saying this as a die-hard carlin fan, but the material, both written and as performed, in it's bad for ya is some of the best late-era material yet. at 70 carlin bounces back from the level of despair (and some of the stumbles in the act itself) from life is worth losing to a special that is firmly structured but loose and playful- or as much as the "old f***" can get- and is continuously, ceaselessly, funny. and funny as in reminiscent of what some of us had going on when watching back in town or 'diseased' the first time. the material, even if sounding at times a tinge of the previously done (i.e. the whole bit on children in school and camp like the children segment in diseased), is always fresh and with such a sting of truth to everything that it scalds the mind while (here goes) tickling the funny bone.going from the topic of death (how long to wait to scratch off a name from the book? six weeks, unless if on the computer scheduler), the facets of communication, looking down from heaven, spots of god (naturally), kids, and just troublesome gestures involving hats in religion and if people really have "rights" make up the bulk of the special, centered around the premise that what's bad for you, plain and simple, is bs. total, complete bs, which as we also learn (or if you've really learned it you're like the kid waiting at the street corner for a week following dropped off not-quite randomly by the parent) holds the country together. carlin isn't necessarily angry though, even if disdain seems to spout out at most turns, even just to observe how horrifying children's teeth coming in look. it's skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything is not going to be "fine".what it comes down to is this: carlin is to dirty, witty, cautionary stand-up comedy what yoda is to jedis everywhere, which is a small spark of hope via crystal clear wisdom in a world where it's pretty damn hard to get any. at the least, we get classic gc - outrageous lines and bits from the man's 13th (or is it 14th) comedy special, including as far as an eyebrow-raising observation on people who play mozart music during a birth!

i can't say i enjoyed this as much as "the big lebowski" or "raising arizona," and felt a little slighted, but "o brother" is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens' brisk, twisted sense of creativity. the dvd edition contains the featurette, and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques. that surprised me! of course, this movie is not the best example (and i'm only saying this in comparison) and it wasn't worthy of any oscars (many feel it was robbed), but maybe it depends on the appeal. though i enjoyed the coens' previous work, i've never been a fan of old westerns or "the dukes of hazzard" or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn. i guess that's why i didn't feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie, seeing that it revolves around southern folk. for all those from the south who are reading this, i don't mean to offend any of your people! i'm sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like "a bronx tale." when you live in the city all your life, it's hard to get accustomed to films of this nature. but all apologies aside, i found the characters fun and quirky. i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly, and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing. tim blake nelson was also good. of course, george clooney--who i assume is not the best at feigning accents, judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for "the perfect storm"--naturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent. his performance was good, though. you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter (in a short but sweet role) and john goodman (also on screen for a short time, but steals every minute of it).though i don't normally dig country music, i liked the title song "a man of constant sorrow." the dvd also contains the music video for that song. overall, i found the film entertaining and original, but it doesn't have that in-your-face quality that the coens have shown to us in the past. it's a slighter effort, but a good one. i still suggest you check it out. my score: 7 (out of 10)

this movie was sooooooo good! it was hilarious! there are so many jokes that you can just watch the movie over and over and not get tired of it. john turturro and tim blake nelson were awesome as pete hogwallop and delmar! i love those guys! i love the adventures they went on, too. i definitely recommend this movie.also, the music in this movie is terrific! i love singing along with all of the songs!

it takes a rare movie to get better each time you see it. o brother does that and then some. the first time i saw it, i have to admit i had never seen anything like it. then i wanted to see it again, and now i'm up to double digits with this great movie, the coen brothers' finest movie they've ever done, with fargo and hudsucker proxy coming in a tight second and third for me.george clooney gives the performance of his career playing ulysses everett mcgee, a fast-talking know-it-all escaped convict who really doesn't know that much at all. tim blake nelson and john turturro are the perfect sidekicks for clooney, particularly nelson and his portrayal of delmar, a loyal albeit uneducated fellow escapee. john goodman is my favorite bit character as big dan, perfect. it reminds me of his part in raising arizona, he's just a perfect actor for this role. coen brothers' favorites holly hunter and charles durning also provide memorable performances. joel and ethan coen are masters of their trade. it's not like they try to win academy awards every time they make a film, they just try and tell a story that they want to tell, and it's entertaining. it's a loose adaptation of the odyssey, and i mean loose for all of you homer fanatics. it's just great.the most amazing part of this movie though is the coloring. i've watched how they got the dusty feel to the movie and i am still in awe just thinking about it. the coloring does become an important part of the movie. great great movie.

it started off weird, the middle was weird, and the ending was weird, but i really, really liked it. a modern day version of homer's odyessy but that is really irrelevant. interesting story and casting. clooney was great and i applaud him for taking on such an adverterous role - so unlike anything he has done or ever will do again. lots of surprise stars - why isn't holly hunter in more. do something different tonight and watch this really different and unexpected flick.

after seeing the 'oh so acclaimed' fargo and thinking it was nothing more than average, i was wandering if it would be a good idea to rent another coen 'masterpiece'. this time i was much less disappointed than i was with fargo and i must say that most of the credit for that goes to the good jokes and the good acting of george clooney. well done mr. clooney, make more of these and less 'perfect stormish' movies. you can act and you showed it here.7 out of 10

this has got to be the best movie i've seen. you definately have to watch it more than once to find all of the humor and twists. i'm no fan of george clooney, but he shines here. the real performance comes from tim blake nelson and john turturro as pete and delmar. one of the few movies that i own.

'o brother, where art thou' is a gleeful retelling of homer's 'odyssey', set in 1930s mississippi and rampant with splendid quirkiness that is the trademark of the brothers coen. three hapless convicts make their escape to find treasure--and more than their share of adventure--in this delightful film. george clooney is in fine, ingenuous form as the chatty, amiable leader of the trio; but the real acting kudos go to john turturro and tim blake nelson as his goofy but lovable cohorts, dubbed the 'soggy bottom boys' by clooney's character after they receive baptism by full immersion in a river. the three cut a record under that homespun nom-de-plume for the cash, and unwittingly become overnight sensations with veritable 'rock star' status. the film is accompanied by enough music and songs to almost qualify it as a musical. and there are some incredible feats of film-making here: the scene at the kkk rally is a real doozy, and is so similar to the scene when dorothy's friends rescue her from the witch's castle in 'the wizard of oz' that it almost amounts to cinematic plagiarism. and what an amazing work of plagiarism it is! without giving away the ending, i must say the climax of the movie is one of the most breathtaking sequences put to film in recent memory (on a par with the spectacular finale of 'magnolia', another one of my favorites). 'o brother' is a must-see, a perfect 10!

the coen's strike again. i had no presuppositions going in and i was amazed at the bizarre telling of a good-bad guy story. although clooney is easily replaceable in this, his cornball style is welcome. turturro and nelson are dead ringers. and i loved "i am a man of constant sorrow" as performed by the "soggy bottom boys". catchy tune...8 of 10

i've seen just about all of the coen brothers' films now, and i have to say this is one of their better films. i wouldn't dare say it's better than "the big lebowski", but it was very good in it's own right.i thought the story was very interesting and hilarious at times. i loved all the characters, especially tim blake nelson (delmar) and john turturro's (pete).there really isn't anything bad i can say about this movie, but this movie isn't for everyone. it might be safe to say that if you liked the other coen brothers' films, then you'll hopefully like this one too. and if you liked what you saw in the trailer, i think you'll like the film, but don't hold me to it.anyhow, i hope that you like(d) the film as much as i do. thanks for reading,-chris

great movie, great actors, great soundtrack! i loved it! settings are perfect, dialogues, situations, storyline... all together mixed to give this masterpiece! clooney and turturro are magnificent and the soggy bottom boys are simply charming and contagious with their music! :)

this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous. one of the actors is george clooney and i'm not a fan but this roll is not bad. another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack (the man of constant sorrow). i recommand this movie to everybody. greetings bart

they loved him up and turned him into a horny toad! god, that gets to me every time.this is a great movie. memorable lines, from "thank god your momma died given birth; she'da seen ya she'da died of shame" to "i don't understand, big dan." great scenes, from the opening train scene (laughed so hard i cried) to the bluegrass.watch it. it's good, it's great, it's funny, and it's based on a famous story. worth your while, believe me. don't watch this if you have a weak bladder, for you will definitely wet your pants laughing.

i have no read the novel on which "the kite runner" is based. my wife and daughter, who did, thought the movie fell a long way short of the book, and i'm prepared to take their word for it. but, on its own, the movie is good -- not great but good. how accurately does it portray the havoc created by the soviet invasion of afghanistan? how convincingly does it show the intolerant taliban regime that followed? i'd rate it c+ on the first and b+ on the second. the human story, the afghan-american who returned to the country to rescue the son of his childhood playmate, is well done but it is on this count particularly that i'm told the book was far more convincing than the movie. the most exciting part of the film, however -- the kite contests in kabul and, later, a mini-contest in california -- cannot have been equaled by the book. i'd wager money on that.

i was one of the few who went out of my way to see this in the theater. i've thought about it frequently ever since. after two dvd viewings i'm glad to say it held up perfectly. like any great comedy, i laughed more on each viewing, both in anticipation of gags, but also after catching things missed before. mike judge does very well with creating insanely comedic characters and fitting them into their world so they make sense. in office space, the environment make the characters believable. idiocracy's future gives him liberty to write unbelievably dumb characters and make them work. i'll be waiting to see if they release a better dvd with some actual features before buying it. but this movie deserves the support on dvd not offered to it at the theater.

i recommend idiocracy to everyone. luke wilson is very funny, the movie is insightful and made me laugh so hard i had tears running down my face several times. until the end, when i took a breath and realized just how close we are to mr. judge's vision of tomorrow.keep an eye out for a cameo by the guy from the mac commercials (justin long)as dr. lexus. i found his performance oscar-worthy, especially considering what oscars have been handed out for in the recent past...besides, he's cute.in short, idiocracy is a fatally funny glimpse into a possible future where people are named after product brand names (the president's middle name is mountain dew), hospital visits cost $5 billion dollars, there are mountains of garbage because no one is smart enough to figure out what to do with it all, and nobody cares about anything but money. all because only stupid people are breeding. sounds familiar to me, somehow. oh, yeah; it's what i think of when i see professional wrestling...seriously, watch this movie. it's a good laugh and it will make you think.

this movie deserved better. mike judge's satirical wit brought to light something too many in this country are trying to deny... we're getting dumber as a society.could the 24-hour-a-day anna nicole coverage be any more proof? mike judge paints a frightening future, where the dumb survive and thrive. makes you stop and think, and laugh. can you look at the world and not ask are we getting dumber? are we being overtaking by the human trash as well as our own trash? (beware of landslides).the movie is really funny. i'd tell you more of the plot but i don't want to spoil it.so why release this film with zero promotion? could it be that the stupid are already taking over?

i like money! i stumbled on this brilliant film in a local video store last week. wasn't sure what to expect. brought it home, set up the player and then my journey in to stupidity began. the first viewing i did a lot of chuckling, no laughing out loud really. it wasn't until the second viewing the movie really started to take a hold on me and the humor was that much funnier. it reminded me of austin powers, first viewing it was all right, then the real fun began telling people about it, just talking about each scene and the set up. i'm making all my friends watch this movie, everyone i know. this movie may very well be one of the most accurate "future" movies ever made. this movie is more then just 84 minutes of entertainment, it's a warning to the future of our civilization. mike judge, the fantastic mind who brought us office space has brought us a vision of life in the automated future. luke wilson's dead pan humor as "average" joe enhanced the movie that much more. watch this movie then once you're done, read more! write more! think more! for the futures sake if not for your own!

this movie is funny and sad enough i think that it is kinda true. if you love office space then you will love this movie because it is another mike judge hit, but it is nothing like office space. i told every one to see this movie. i only wish that it would have been in more theaters so it would have gotten the recognition it deserved. i love this movie and would love to see more from mike judge. luke wilson is also what makes this movie what it is. i am so glad that i will not be alive in the year 2505, because if this movie turns out to be true we are all in for a lot of trouble. i just hope more people see this movie because i know that they will fall in love with it too.

never had i seen such a powerful true story movie. i discovered a city, a country, a lost revolution and even a nobel prize winner thanks to this masterpiece of cinema.if you haven't seen this movie, you can't say you've seen anything .a great lesson of courage, humility and life.i haven't seen anything as good since.t.e. saturday, january 9th, 1999

after reading about this documentary, i rented it and watched it with my teenage children. it was amazingly well-balanced, showing each side's perspective and leaving many questions unanswered. this is as it should be. i don't watch a documentary to be told what to think. i watch it to learn and to draw my own conclusions.afterward, we took a trip to waco and visited the branch davidians at the site of the conflagration. this was a potent lesson in seeing for yourself. and it drove home the basic underlying honesty behind "waco: the rules of engagement." if you just open your eyes and look, the facts can speak for themselves.

many people remember the waco standoff that occurred a long time ago. what most people probably have ingrained in their minds is the "cult leader" david koresh and the images of the compound burning to the ground after a long standoff. a lot of people have the belief that koresh was some kind of madman who thought he was god. he was accused of being a child molester and was credited for the breakdown and deaths of his followers. furthermore, many people feel the cult committed mass suicide when the fbi stormed mount carmel center and when the building was burning. most people feel the cult was at fault for not agreeing with the fbi on reasonable terms. most people feel the cult was brainwashed by koresh and followed along with everything that he said. nothing could be farther from the truth, because of strong evidence after the nightmare was over, and this one-of -a- kind documentary pretty much proves it!! this documentary is one of the most balanced examinations at the situation that occurred. it is much more thorough and highly detailed than anything most people have received in the mainstream media. to the shock of many people, this documentary will reveal that is was the atf, the fbi, and the higher levels of the united states government who were the ones who were unjust, cruel, and deceptive, and not david koresh and his followers. what korseh and davidians were doing was just protecting their constitutional rights, and the higher powers completely violated and raped those rights. the aft had no grounds to storm the compound; it was the aft that shot first and they shot from the helicopters from above at unarmed men, women, and children!! what is even more shocking is the actions of the fbi when they entered the mount carmel. watch it for yourselves and you will develop and new perspective on the u.s. government. there is infrared footage that clearly shows the fbi was shooting with machine guns at the men, women, and children in the burning compound. it will make your blood boil. it will make you really angry. it will make you wonder as to what kind of people run this country. finally, it will make you wonder as to what you are being told on the news every night is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. this video is frightening and i highly recommend it if one can find it. this documentary does not need to be purchased; it can be watched for free on google video!

if you value your freedom!i first got seriously interested in the branch davidian debacle after reading an article in uk journal "the fortean times." wanting to learn more, i rented this documentary and after watching it, i was stunned at what i saw. this film peaked my interest in the subject and i have read several books on the subject since then. this film is a must see for people who only know the facts as reported in the so called "mainstream" media. the baldfaced lies, double talk, and contradictory statements made by officials and politicians shown in this film will make you think twice about calling people who question the governments actions in this fiasco "nuts" "loonies" and "kooks." whats scary is that i know some people who consider themselves open minded "intellectuals" and freedom loving "liberals" who are still convinced that the government did the right thing at waco and refuse to watch this film or read any of the books on the subject. they continue to insist its not worth their time because its all propaganda from gun loving, clinton hating, religious fanatic,right wing anarchist nuts. one publication from an organization comprised of many so called "great minds" that claims to be dedicated to promoting "reason","common sense" and "rationalism" condemned the film claiming it would poison peoples minds and strongly suggested this film should be suppressed. they even hinted the davidians had it coming. i won't mention its name since i'm a coward. if you are one of those reading this (of course you probably would not be reading this anyway), i can only say its a shame you won't open your mind.

excellent documentary that still manages to shock and enlighten. unfortunately, times haven't changed much since this was made and it is thus an important piece for all freedom-conscious americans to see.

i watched a made for television film about the destruction at waco, texas. it was obviously heavily slanted toward the claim that david koresh was a murderous, child raping cult leader hell-bent on killing as many cops as he wanted and taking his people to the heavens on a blood stained stairway.the film was little more than propaganda further detailing what we had already read in the newspapers. i am more and more sure of that since i watched the great documentary waco: the rules of engagment. not that every assertion made in this film should be taken as god's truth, but it tells the whole story rather than regurgitating only what law enforcement decided to tell.for those who have forgot, koresh was the spiritual leader of the religious movement named the branch davidians. charges of drug use, kidnapping, illegal weapon ownership, and statutory rape (among others i'm sure) raised the suspicions of the local police, then later federal law enforcement. while attempting to serve a search warrant, the atf (bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms) and the clan participated in a shoot out that left deceased and wounded on both sides.it was then that the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) got involved. communications between the two were spirited but eventually broke down. the fbi prepared for an invasion by assaulting the building with flash-bang grenades and gas. when the building burnt to the ground killing many within, including koresh, the fbi refused to admit responsibility saying the "cult" inside must have set it on fire themselves. this hearkened images of jim jones and other violent religious organizations.the picture puts on many masks to tell its story. it begins with a sampling of the congressional hearings, perhaps the "truth," as far as the record is concerned anyway. what is eye-opening is how partisan the politicians remained even in a difficult and serious situation as this. the democrats were concerned in nothing more than defending every single action taken by law enforcement. it was the republicans that seemed open to the other side.it is impossible to relate all of the new information and analysis provided by this documentary. additionally, a list would take away from the film opening up as it goes along. one example would be the heart-breaking fact that children died within the compound. the filmmakers probably side more with the davidians in general but stay relatively open to either side. in this instance the feds seem at fault for mishandling a situation that involves innocent children. but on the other hand the parents also need to shoulder some of the blame for leaving their kids in this harmful situation when they could have released them to any number of local authorities.probably the most damning new information comes late in the film and involves the fbi's claim they did not fire upon the building. this is left up to interpretation, and i will not reveal any more than to say it is disturbing and shocking what can and cannot be told.the federal officers are not held in a critical or corrupt light any more than koresh. the largest condemnation seems to be leveled on the media, unwilling to tell both sides of a story. this element seems prevalent in recent documentaries, duly so i believe. it is time for the media to return to telling news stories and leave this relentless pursuit of what will draw the biggest audience and ratings.it is hard to mess up a documentary. in most cases switching on a camera and editing together interesting pieces of life is common and tells a terrific story. what few can do is shed such new light on a subject that the way you think about it is forever altered. waco is that kind of film. ***.5 out of ****

when i began watching i thought i was watching some pro-koresh amateur documentary. however, i had never seen 3/4 of the footage they used. they interviewed people saying that the fbi/atf instigated all these things, which sounded so far fetched, but then followed in up with fbi video and testimony. i was amazed. the documentary followed up with the senate investigation after the fire, and after seeing the interview and video footage you will be shocked at how the senate and attorney general turn their backs on davidians basically to cover up the aggression by the fbi/atf. if you start watching this you must finish it. otherwise you will think it is propaganda of something like that.

the film someone had to make.waco: the rules of engagement dissects the evidence behind the standoff in waco, texas that led to the destruction of the branch davidian homestead and the alleged government cover-up.the first thing you need to know about this film: you will see brief but disturbing photos of the victims bodies. this is not done for shock value, but to illustrate points about the way they died, as if you were present at the coroner's inquest.the second thing you should know about this film: at two and a quarter hours, it's pretty ponderous - especially if you already followed the events closely at the time. if you are unaware of any of the events other than what was reported in the mass media, or if the only side of the story you are familiar with is the official government report, this may be essential viewing. if, on the other hand you want a more concise (albeit unapologetically one sided) version of events, you should see "waco: the big lie".in summary, this is pretty much the definitive documentary about this tragic event, and is very sobering, but as a work of film-making, could test your patience, especially if you have a short attention span. and it's at times superfluous for those who watched the cspan hearings and the 60 minutes reports.perhaps someday someone will make a documentary that covers some of the stranger aspects of this story, such as the bizarre chain of events that led up to the atf raid or the psychological warfare tactics the fbi used blasting rock music at the sect, and their charismatic leaders (all rock musicians themselves) picking up their instruments and turning their massive amplifiers outward to blast their own music right back at them.

waco: rules of engagement does a very good job of not drawing conclusions for its viewers. it simply presents interviews, footage from the standoff, footage of the congressional hearings, phone conversations, expert testimony, etc. and allows you to draw your own conclusion.i hardly intend to imply that the data presented here was done with 100% objectivity but it is very convincing. you won't like koresh any more after you see this than you did before, but i tend to think that you will come to believe, as i now do, there is much that we were not told about what happened before and during the standoff.

absolute must see documentary for anyone interested in getting to the bottom of this story. told with unflinching eye and with gripping style. if you think conspiracy theories are for paranoid disturbed people, this could change your mind. something for you feds too: a good model for government coverups! if you like your news all tidy and easy to consume this is not for you.

if you want to see real evidence of what a misguided and unchecked government can do to "un-popular" people, this movie provides it. read what some people are saying about the "patriot act" passed after 9/11 and then watch this movie. is it worth it? do we really want to give away our freedoms to these people? regardless of what you saw on tv, you are not fully informed until you watch this movie. i apologize for quoting another reviewer, but it needs repeating: roger ebert of siskel & ebert said, "what's interesting is if you're looking for people who are unbalanced zealots... you don't find them among the branch davidians, you find them among the fbi and the alcohol, tobacco, and firearms; those are the people in this movie who deserve to be feared, i think." i think every person responsible for 9/11 needs to be brought to justice, but i think the government has not shown a history of honoring it's duty to protect people's rights, and this movie proves it in dramatic fashion.

there have been many documentaries that i have seen in which it appeared that the law was on the wrong side of the fence - the thin blue line and paradise lost come to mind first and foremost. but this is the first film that had me seething with anger after i saw it. it seems blatantly clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at waco was at the very least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the fbi and afi, and at the very worst an act of murder. like most people, when the siege at waco was occurring i assumed that david koresh was a completely evil madman who was leading a violent cult. after seeing this, i think that koresh was more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the u.s. government through his eccentric actions. sure, there were lots of weapons at the branch davidian compound. but none of it was illegal. it was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound, all of them seeming to be very nice and harmless. and it was angering to see the callous testimony of the men in charge of the government forces on the waco site, the clueless testimony of janet reno, and the partisan defense of the attack on waco, a defense led by a few of the committee democrats. standing out most in my mind was ny representative and current u.s. senator from ny charles schumer. i voted for the man when i lived in ny state - i'm a democrat, pretty left-leaning too. after seeing his actions on this committee, i wish i could go back in time and vote for d'amato instead! for anyone remotely interested in the government, this is a very crucial film, a must see. i even think this should be shown in classes - it's that important.

after watching "waco: the rules of engagement" i was just sitting in disbelief of what i was witness to. a big cover up by the fbi, a massacre by gung-ho/trigger happy government agents? i clearly remember the waco standoff, i was 17 years old at the time and watched it all on cnn. i remembered reflecting about all the children as i watched the mount camel compound burn in april 1993. i remember feeling sorry for the children, but clearly felt that it was the fault of their evil leader david koresh and the other davidians. gazecki's film shows clearly and beyond doubt, even though it is biased, that the fbi lied over and over again. i think that this film was a big contributor to the reopening of a new investigation of the incident in 1999. the outcome of this new investigation was in some sense predictable, the judgement relied on fact that was just as grey as the facts that the davidians presented. i was very disappointed about the verdict, because as far as i know it didn't take into account all the lying, misinformation and evidence cover-up by the fbi and other officials. why have no one be prosecuted for hampering the work of the texas rangers investigators? why were they allowed to contaminate the crime scene and bulldoze the compound shortly after the incident? these are questions that i haven't been given answers to by the government. most importantly, what about the children? in this new investigation i haven't been informed about who was responsible for spraying the cs flammable tear-gas into a compound with many hazards for igniting this gas and i haven't found any answer to whether the children's muscles contracted due to the effects of the gas, while they were alive. if they did, i would surely think that the janet reno or who ever was in charge of the raid should be indicted for mass-homicide or manslaughter. the question that was raised by gazecki, but not mentioned is; was is a direct plan for the people in charge and their tanks to cut holes and burn the building down with intent? (a plan that would have been accomplished with 112% efficacy) or were the officials in charge so incompetent, that their were unaware of the consequence of their actions? both are equally frightening. even if the davidians set fire to the compound, the officials in charge surely provided them with the opportunity to do the job. if the officials in charge knew, as they claimed, that the davidians would set fire to the compound, why the f did the tanks cut all the holes in the building making it into a furnace and why didn't they have plans to deal with the fire that they knew would occur? dark questions that still won't go away the final and most relevant issue of this film, is the way that the davidians are demonized by the government through the media, who just feeds it in to the public. i clearly remember the resentment i felt for the evil davidians that i saw on cnn in 1993. now that i'm older i can see a clear line of communication coming out of the government every time they are gearing up for a massacre of civilians along with the intended targets. demonizing people with words like; "they have different unlawful values then us" "they don't enjoy freedom" and "they are a threat to our freedoms and way of life" makes them so much easier to kill

rules of engagement is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen. it is well constructed, superbly pieced together, and provides excellent footage to back up the assertions that it takes on. the movie's best quality is that it is not based on being sympathetic to the dividians as much as it enlightens the audience to the blatant governmental mistakes and lies that surrounded the entire situation. i'm left with feelings of disturbing anxiety and extreme anger over the way that the government handled and then covered up a tragedy of this magnitude. the cover up is what left me really fuming. it is one thing to make a mistake in an operation and admit guilt, but another to look the american people squarely in the eye and lie to them. i guess it shouldn't surprise me with the history of our beloved country that has seen the jfk assassination, the vietnam war, and other significant events that smell so bad of a cover up that you have to hold your nose every time you drive through washington d.c. the footage from an airplane with special heat sensing technology and the autopsies on some of the bodies clearly show that the fbi is lying to the public. one of the things that i try to stay aware of when watching a documentary such as this is that i am usually only receiving testimony from one point of view. but again, that is without a doubt one of the brilliant successes of rules of engagement. it presents its evidence in such a concluding fashion that even if you were presented with statements from the fbi how could you really believe them. i remember clearly when the standoff was taking place the way the media presented the dividians as this crazed group of cult rebels with david koresh, the self professed reborn jesus christ, as their leader. none of this was truly factual but rather story spun from bits and pieces of facts. they were simply standing up for there rights to bear arms and practice their religion as american citizens. if you were the atf and you wanted to search the compound is attacking the building with a unit of men who are armed with rifles and bullet proof suits the way to go about doing it? if you are the fbi why engage in psychological warfare and offer little in actual negotiation to help solve the situation? why pour gallons of harmful gas if you want to save children? why open large holes within the compound structure when you know the possibility of starting a fire? why lie about not firing weapons when it can be clearly shown on video? unless. unless you wanted to see the situation end up the way it did. the scene at the end when the dividians star of david flag blew off the flagpole into the fire and the atf's was shortly thereafter raised up was an emotional climatic scene that made my head shake in disgust and my stomach turn uncontrollably. the filmmaker william gazecki deserves one my highest congratulations. it takes a lot of guts to make a movie like this and i am sure there have been many repercussions from the government for it as well. because of people like him the public can be shown real truth rather than crap that gets filtered through a media that presents information that can hardly be considered genuine. when i think back to how i felt at the time toward the dividians because of the media's representation of david koresh and how i felt after seeing this movie it is truly amazing. it reminds me of the line from the bible of a man who was healed by jesus and asked by the elders how it happened "before i was blind but now i can see" he kept telling them. do yourself a favor and watch this movie. you may have to look for it but it is truly something special.

things that are only just now "news" were taken as a given in this shocking documentary. i fear that as the investigation proceeds, the producers of this film will be vindicated in spades.the producers show us the davidians, the government agents, the investigators, with all their faults and all their humanity. nothing any reviewer can say could approach the impact of watching and listening for yourself. pieces of evidence -- congressional testimony, 911 tapes, news footage, expert commentary, interviews, photos and home videos -- are seamlessly woven together and tell a disturbing tale. do not wait. see this film and tell your friends.

seven ups has been compared to bullitt for the chase scene, but does not come anywhere near matching bullitt. bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds. when mcqueen leaves the seedy hotel, gets into his mustang, which is parked under the embarcadero freeway (now torn down) and notices the charger sitting nearbye, you know you are about to see something spectacular. from that moment on, when mcqueen starts that car, begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed. adding to it is a terrific lalo schriffin if i remember correctly sound track. this goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing. that shot of mcqueen's mustang suddenly appearing in bill hickman's rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact. hickman's look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect. then of course, san francisco is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends. also, bullitt being filmed in the 60s when cars were still "hot" (mustang gt and dodge charger) made for a better set of wheels then two boring, smog device laden pontiacs in the 1970s seven ups. bill hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies. i saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the univeral lot when i was doing movie reviews for a paper. they gave it a good try in seven ups though with the chase scene. seven ups had a few "jumps" over little hills, (yawn) but of course they were not san francisco hills. the seven ups chase, where they are actually going fast, is longer than the go fast sequence in bullitt. but the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood off of roy schieders pontiac is the height of absurdity. strictly hollywood, i would say, except that it was filmed in new york.

a compact crime drama with a good amount of action. the unique nyc location shots adds to this tough little film.technically well done with good direction and acting. needless to say,the wild car chase that seems to begin in downtown, extends through the upper west side, washington heights, across the george washington bridge and into nj has to be one of the best ever on film.all around a fine flick that for me gets better with time.8 out of 10...easy

roy scheider is not steve mcqueen or clint eastwood but then who is? the seven-ups is one of the better cop movies, even today, and is second only to mcqueen's bullitt and the dirty harry series, which isn't bad company. there are three things that seem to make a good cop movie: believable script with great acting, great car chase scenes, and some heavy action. this movie has all three and the car chase scene is better than that in dirty harry. scheider plays the head of a group of cops out to get ny's bad guys sentenced to seven years or more; hence the name seven-ups. overall, not quite up to dirty harry or bullitt but far better than all of the cop movies made since the dirty harry series. 9/10.

this is a good enough movie and you probably won't be disappointed, but it again has roy scheider, right after he did "french connection", playing a cop with the name 'buddy'. they also use the same too-memorable wheelman from "bullitt". at first you'll think you've seen the car chase before if you have his face still in your memory. the car chase is a great one, but as in many car movie scenes, it has some technical and editing errors. check "puppet on a chain" and "french connection ii" for some other good, long, intense chases.

i recently got the seven-ups on video and i must say it was a very enjoyable movie. roy scheider and tony lo bianco are great as the cop and crook respectively and a young richard lynch is great as psycho henchman moon. the late bill hickman is pretty good as his associate bo and sets up a brilliant car chase sequence which will have you on the edge of your seats. the other three members of the seven-ups team are pretty bland but that's only to be expected.i'm glad that a lot of people on this site have supported this movie. i think it should be a film that should be released on dvd and not just forgotten. i certainly enjoyed every minute of it. the final scene between the two leads is excellent as the bad guy must face the consequences of his actions. the seven-ups does not disappoint.

how did they get that cinematic shot of the car colliding with the back end of the semi? and then roy sits up -- great! looks like the dvd is scheduled for may of 2006 - about time!! watch this on a large screen or film revival in a theater if possible in order to fully appreciate the full aspect ratio. my other favorites in this category are: original italian job with michael caine; bullit with steve mcqueen; to live and die in la with the csi guy when he was young; french connection with gene hackman; ronin with robert deniro; vanishing point with barry newman; enemy of the state with hackman again -- what are your favorites?

this film is a classic seventies cop flick that for some reason has been sadly overlooked. it is basically french connection meets bullit.roy scheider plays the head of an elite group of detectives, known as the "seven ups" one of their men is discovered during an undercover op and is killed.scheider and his team must find his killers. they become involved in a battle with the mob.the highlight of the film has to be the car chase, obviously included to cash in on the success of bullit. however, this car chase outshines bullitt due to its length, speed and sheer excitement.it's a breathtaking roller-coaster ride that ends rather unexpectedly and spectacularly. don't miss this little gem !!

the seven-ups is a good and engrossing film. it's packed with credible performances by scheider, labianco and an effective scary performance by richard lynch - although most of the characters are card-board cut-out tough guys. character development does not evolve at all on the screen. the only thing we know is the good guys are the good guys and the bad guys are bad. deviating from the crime story norm, the seven-ups manage to throw scheider and crew into the middle of a building plot in a unique writing twist. onsite locations of new york city and an excellent choreographed car chase highlight the film. the only downside of the film is the slightly confusing plot line in the beginning. they give the viewer little evidence that the men being kidnapped are mob related (until later in the film). had someone blindly started watching the film may be slightly confused on the story. otherwise, the seven-ups is a gritty, testosterone-filled enjoyable time.

he plays straight but with a quiet intensity that makes him one of the top cops in movie history. roy scheider stars in a poor man's french connection that has a little of the same gritty appeal. fc is a better movie, but i prefer watching this one because 1) i think scheider is great and this is his best movie, and 2) this has the best car chase ever, one that makes bullitt look like a cable production (thanks again to bill hickman, who actually plays the driver). it doesn't hurt that tony lobianco stops by (again) to play a baddie. please enjoy.

****spoilers**** buried under a mountain of medical bills and his funeral business not being able to dig him out from under them undertaker vito lucia, tony lo bianco, came up with a plan to make a load of cash with the help of his two crooked pals moon & bo, richard lynch & bill hickman. vito getting close with his boyhood friend buddy manucci, roy scheider, as a mob informer to win over buddy's trust and have him tell vito what's coming down on the streets of new york in regard to mob activities. buddy is a cop who works in a sub rosa unite of the nypd, the seven ups, that does things "their way" to clean up the streets of new york of criminals. vito gets information from buddy and makes it look to buddy that he's really giving him tips about the mob and what it's up too and uses that information to tip off his hoodlum associates, moon & bo, to rip the mobsters off of their weekly take as well as kidnap top mob loan sharks and hold them for ransom.everything is going well for vito & co. until the mob decides to retaliate and mistakenly grabs beats and kidnaps a member of the seven ups ansel, ken kercheval,who was working undercover thinking he was one of the hoods who was kidnapping and ripping them off. later ansel was accidentally killed by moon when he blasted out the trunk of the car that ansel was locked in thinking that there was a suitcase full or cash, ransom, in it.fast pace and exciting movie with that gritty and grimy photography of new york city that was so effective in the movie "the french connection" which also stars both roy scheider & tony lo bianco who are in this movie too. incredible car chase that started in downtown brooklyn and ended up in the wilds of new jersey some 15 to 20 miles away with buddy almost ending up decapitated for his heroic efforts. roy scheider who is not a big man is as tough and effective as any big action actor i can think off like clint eastwood would have been in the same movie. scheider reminds me a lot of, he even looks a bit like him, former welterweight and middleweight champion gene fullmer who beat the great sugar ray robinson for the middleweight championship back in 1957 and acts like him too in the movie : tough durable and destructive. tony lo bianco is very good as vito the undertaker the lowlife heel who plays off buddy and the mob to the point that leads to buddy's partner ansel getting killed. even though he's trash you can't in a way not help feeling sorry for vito since he only wants the money he gets from the ripped offed mobsters to pay his sick wife's rose's hospital and medical bills. even the fact that ansel was killed due to his actions vito never wanted anybody to get hurt but like they say when you play with fire you end up getting burned. in the end vito have a lot of explaining to do to the not so sympathetic and caring mobsters. the movie "the seven ups" has the late bill hickman doing the dangerous stunts with the car chases as well as act in the film. hickman was also the stunt man in both great movies that had him doing the driving on the roads streets and highways of new york city and san francisco "the french connection" and "bullitt".

i love the other reviews of this movie. they mirror my attitude. i am a 70's sort of guy, minus disco and "star wars" childishness. there was nothing great about this movie, except for a chase scene. that is why it was good, because it was tough, basic and economical. roy scheider carried the movie, which was based on the crew, the 7 ups, that backed up gene hackman in the "french connection". the people in it were believable and average, who burned themselves pouring coffee, showed fear in chase scene and almost lost it after a close call crash.maybe it would be easier to tell you what it lacked. there was no fancy weapons, just basic revolvers and crude sawed off shotguns. there was no tough guy philosophizing, ala tarantino. there was no kung fu or samurai nonsense and no fancy trick shooting either. there was no clever guy who carries out some complicated scheme based on hundreds of things going just the way he planned including everyone else's reactions. the criminals were bad guys but they didn't shoot people for the hell of it. as a matter of fact, there was a body count of just three. something that the average movie these days would pass in the opening credits. it could be a g movie today! no bus load of orphan school children were kidnapped nor were terrorists threatening to kill half of the city. there were no high tech hijinks, nor were the crimes themselves very moving or ingenious, the highest tech thing i saw was a touch tone att wall phone. it had no subplots or amusing character developments. also, no sex or women, except for one mobster's wife who did some screaming as the buddy our hero had her menaced.it was some little undertaker who exploited his connections with the local mob and the police to kidnap local mobsters for some easy payoffs. the undertakers. vito, was played by tony lo bianco who did a great job, as good as roy schneider, buddy the head of 7 ups cop, whom he informed and exploited. what ever happened to tony lo bianco, he seemed like a pacino shoe in, good looking and talented? what it did have was a great nyc backdrop to a simple crime story. locations that were bleak and dehumanizing without being a sociological study. it had a simple plot that involved this kidnapping scheme where one of buddy's cop got accidentally involved, literally accidentally dragged in then accidentally shot dead. since buddy and his 7 ups are a hot dogs unit, both the nypd brass and mobsters thought he was involved, since the kidnappers masqueraded as plain clothes cops to lure the mobsters into compliance. obviously the mobsters figured they had lawyers and rights to protect them from normal police. even the mobsters were plain, old and ugly, no godfather royalty or soprano hipness here.it is a good basic movie with a standout chase scene between two 70's d pontiacs. even the cars were plain and economical, not even a gto or a trans am, like the acting and the story. in the days of batman uber-hype or "24" levels of intensity doomsday scenarios, this movie reminds us that less is better. it should be shown to movie screen writers and directors as a caveat not to dazzle, amuse then ultimately insult us with stunts, gadgets and clown psychotic behavior galore.

it's got action and fantasy mixed all together what more do you want in an action movie? and it also has one of the best martial artists in the movie industry today, wesley snipes.so all in all this movie hasn't left anything out. and that's my comment of what i think is a classic beat em up movie.

not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series, i expected this film to merely accomplish the basic: introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics, present a plot, and end with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel. and that's exactly what this movie happens to deliver.however, unlike with most other comic book movies, i felt that this one did it with a bit of class. risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fight scenes, "blade" presents a very modern, believable and dismal world whose little nuances effectively managed to elicit a sense of dread--as minor as it may have been--from a viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in a story unless an emotional (i.e., sappy) aspect is concerned.yes, the movie has innumerable plotholes, and preposterously unrealistic situations such as a standard female doctor being astute enough to contrive what no one else has been able to for several thousand years. but when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie, and fight scenes with involving and exciting camera cuts and special effects such as this, what else matters? it may run a little long, but for what it sets out to do, "blade" stands out in sharp relief among most other movies in this genre.

in this film i prefer deacon frost. he's so sexy! i love his glacial eyes! i like stephen dorff and the vampires, so i went to see it. i hope to see a gothic film with him. "blade" it was very "about the future". if vampires had been real, i would be turned by frost!

blade is probably one of the best vampire/action movies ever made.it has it all:action,horror,blood.this movie is for action fans.it's either you like it a lot either you hate it and if you hate it ,it means you don't like action or vampires movies.wesley snipes takes his role seriously and he his the perfect guy for blade

great underrated movie great action good actors and a wonderful story line. wesley is verry good and the villain the bad guy is wonderful the girl plays a nice role and the comedy mixed with blakness!

i loved it. in fact, i watched it over and over and over, and i could watch it again. this movie doesn't get boring.the vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie. it's a job well done, great for today's generation.wesley snipes was born for this role. stephen dorff was an ideal vampire. arly jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has. donal logue provides great comical relief.this vampire movie is like no other. i can't wait for blade 2.

this is a great western story with outstanding veteran actors who made this film great entertainment to view and enjoy. glenn ford,(john parrish),"midway",'76 tries to play low key after having experienced battles in the war and plays the peace maker role for the time being. john parrish decides the town is entirely too rough and tough and goes to visit barbara stanwyck,(martha wilkison),"crime of passion",57, who is the wife of edward g. robinson,(lee wilkison),"the red house",'47. lee wilkison, offers john parrish fifteen thousand dollars for his ranch and john turns down the offer. lee wilkson decides to have his son, brian keith,(cole wilkison),"the wind & the lion",'75, change his mind in more ways than one. there are romantic scenes between may wynn,(caroline vail),"the caine mutiny",'54, and john parrish and some hot encounters with dianne foster(judith wilkison),"three hours to kill",'54, who hates her father lee. if you like edward g. robinson and glenn ford films, this is a film you will want to view and enjoy from beginning to end.

this film was brilliant! i absolutely loved it! wesley snipes was great for this role - and i'm sure blade 2 would be just as good.blade is by far one of my favorite action/horror movies out there! and if you havent seen it yet, and like vampires and blood (all that stuff) you should really rent it, because i assure you that you'll love it!

this was a very good 1950s western, one of the better ones i've seen in a decade which featured that genre on screen and on tv. it certainly had three big actors on the marquee: glenn ford, barbara stanwyck and edward g. robinson. it turns out that ford was the star of this film while the other two stars were in supporting roles. ford had the bulk of the dialog. he also was the "good guy" while robinson was the "bad guy" and stanwyck was twice as bad as robinson. she played the real heavy in this film and the character she played was a little too contradictory at times. ford handled his starring status very ably, as he usually did - especially in westerns. he played a nice guy who didn't want to fight, was a peaceful man......but if you pushed him.....look out!the story had a nice mixture of action and lulls, not overdoing either. it had an expansive western setting which was put to good use with the cineamascope widescreen. it also featured realistic people in a realistic setting. that credibility with the characters, especially the supporting players, was most impressive. the men way out-shined the women in this film, acting and character-wise. dianne foster and may wynn were weak - the only negatives of the production. it's easy to see why these two actresses never became stars.even though it is over 50 years old, this western is one you'd still find fast-enough moving to enjoy, no matter how old you are or what you're used to seeing. for classic film fans, this is almost a must with this cast and good story. highly recommended.

this is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small ranchers and farmers. it's certainly all been done before and since. but the violent men is something special.what makes it special is barbara stanwyck playing the role of vixen as she often did in her later films. she's married to the crippled edward g. robinson who's the cattle baron here, but robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent. no matter to barbara, whose needs are being met by her brother-in-law brian keith. that doesn't sit well with either dianne foster who is robinson and stanwyck's daughter, nor with lita milan who is keith's mexican girl friend.the infidelity subplot almost takes over the film, but glenn ford as the stalwart small rancher who is a civil war veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here. he's every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often. i almost expect those famous words from wild bill elliott to come out of ford's mouth, "i'm a peaceable man." would have been very applicable in the vioilent men.the fifties was the age of the adult western, themes were entering into horse operas that hadn't been explored before. the following year glenn ford would do another western, jubal, one of his best which also explores infidelity as a plot component.there's enough traditional western stuff in the violent men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well.

one type of western i greatly enjoy is when the apparently weak, which is reluctant to fight and answer the challenge of the strong, finally decides there is no other way. there is a great moment in this film when john parrish (glenn ford) goes into the saloon and decides to stand up to the gunfighter wade matlock. it is the type of scene that makes the audience applaud. in my opinion the violent men is a great western, i would rank it among the best. it makes great use of the wide screen, a spectacular scenery of the mountains. the women have a crucial part. caroline (may winn) is engaged to parrish, but you feel that she is only using him as a means of getting out of there and moving east. she wants him to sell the ranch no matter what price. martha (barbara stanwick), is tired of helping her crippled husband lee (edward g. robinson) but she will do anything to have an always bigger ranch and more power. meanwhile she is betraying her husband with his brother (brian keith). her daughter judith (diane foster) is seeing all that happens but feeling impotent to react because she does not want to hurt her father. parrish unites all the small farmers and uses the strategy he learned in the army to go against the anchor ranch. like he had warned lee, "don't make me fight because you won't like my way of fighting".

"the violent men" marked the finest collaboration of rudolph maté with glenn ford in an intensely satisfying drama of rugged primitive justice ford is john parrish, a former cavalry captain who is itching to get married and start a new life his fiancée caroline vail (may wynn) is desperate to move east, and to see him selling his spread to lee wilkison (edward g. robinson).parrish is not even much of a cattleman but he do understand that there is something big building up in the valley in the army, they used to call it 'enemy pressure.' first, cole wilkison (brian keith) comes back from texas to help his brother run anchor then a tough kid with a fancy gun (richard jaeckel) shows up on the wilkison payroll then all the small ranchers are forced out, getting the same kind of offers parrish saw himself either running like they did, or stand and fightbut can he easily deals with a man who sends six killers to shoot an old man in the back? can he easily argues with a man who started with a few acres of land and now owns practically the whole valley? all that grass and sand ever meant to the ex-confederate army officer the past three years it was a place to regain his health out of habit of taking advice, parrish affirms: "what happen in this valley is no concern of mine." and much to the disappointment of the remaining ranchers and farmers, who pressure him to stay on, he decides to accept wilkison's offer to fulfill the promise he made to his fiancéewhen lee's younger brother cole made the wrong move, trying to push parrish make up his mind by lynching one of his ranch hands, parrish got mad and warns the two brothers that he is going to stay and will fight them for the privilege of being let alone brian keith plays the traitorous brother who's behind the killing... he dreams to have position and respect in running one day anchor lee's ambitious wife martha (barbara stanwyck) secretly hates herself and her husband stanwyck plays the part of a loving wife who can't bear the touch of her husband's hands edward g. robinson is good enough as the anchor's crippled owner who promised the whole valley to his wife, unaware that she is having an affair with his younger brotherdianne foster is too sensitive as the unsociable adult daughter well aware of her mother's burdens "the violent men" uses the wide-screen technology to emphasize the scope and power of this harrowing action-drama, making it a perfect example of the genre's most enduring classics

i remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out, having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that i vowed to buy the video when it came out. while i won't go too far into dissecting this film, i will say that i gave it an 8/10, for all the reasons you can read in the other user's reviews.what i will say is this: the first 10 minutes of this film are incredible. it's as close to a textbook audience grabber as i've ever seen. i once put this movie on at a party, where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave. i just wanted to see what would happen if i showed them the first ten minutes.everyone, who watched the opening, stayed to the end.

this is one of those movies that i can watch again and again and not get tired of it. it is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever. i liked this one even more than x-men. in fact, this movie is sort of a cross between x-men and the matrix and it came out before either. wesley snipes does a great job with the character of blade. he is just not an emotionless super hero. also, this movie isn't sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating. sure comic books are for kids mainly, but i like a little more in my movies. let's face it, if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic. this comic book adaptation also has something that many don't. a good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy. let's face it, none of the batman movies had a very good ending fight.

this film is superb! wesley snipes plays blade the vampire hunter with pure class, he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make bruce lee proud. the movie is a fast paced, thrill ride of action and superb stunts. the first action scene and last are outstanding and wesley looks like a terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads. the script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too. wesley should have done more action films than he has, i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not streched as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all, only bruce willis, stallone and perhaps tom cruise (if he counts as an action star) come close. also aswell as wesley being quality, steven dorff is also very good as the bad guy. it was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to snipes should come across as menacing, but he does. overall the film is sharp, stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace.

interesting twist on the vampire yarn - fast, loud and moody. despite my initial fears kris k carries his part reasonably well and snipes aka blade provides a formidable physical presence. lots of blood, steel, silver, burning and exploding bodies provide an enjoyable :) 110 minute distraction. if you like the black look of the matrix then blade will appeal to you, blade even has a 'dodge the bullets' sequence.

for a brief moment. the opening scene with traci lords and thetechno bar is incredible. i'd probably follow her to my ultimate death too! best vampire movie of all time but with a twist. the fight scenes are awesome. wesley snipes displays an athleticism you dont get to see every day. and stephen dorff is impressive and very believable as an ambitious new recruit moving himself up the hierarchy by any means necessary. great flick 9/10. where's blade ii?

however closely the movie is to the comics, it doesn't matter. this movie radically moves away from the boredom of "interview with the vampire" (although it's acting was good) and slides in the wonderful action scenes. very convincing tale and interesting with surprisingly good acting from all. disadvantage - poor graphics. does it matter? nope.

in the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations, blade is by far one of the best realised, and most faithful (overall) to the source material.... given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in marvel's tomb of dracula, the writer took almost all of the characters and plot elements from the comic's history. while changes were inevitably made, the finer points of the film steamroll right over any criticisms. don't let any of you friends tell you different: blade is one fine film. if it feels too "comic booky" for you stanley kubrick snobs out there, it's because it's supposed to. deal with it, but don't dis it for it.

blade is a dark, gloomy, but significent vampire movie and is one of the best ones. a bit of gore, but nothing really that bad. wesley snipes played a strong role as he eliminates the vampires. not really like buffy, because thats too tame but blade delivers a decent plot and it's the kind of movie that you would probably like to watch on a dark stormy night....thats at best viewing!87%

overall, i give this film a decent 7.6. to start i'll say i love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen. if you read comics occasionally or simply watch dvd extras you'll see the blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film. among the changes, blade is now most importantly half vampire, therefore acquiring "all of their strengths, but none of their weaknesses." the credit for this goes obviously to david goyer, a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books. thanks to him blade has become a much more interesting character and i find him one of my favorite anti-heroes really. wesley snipes is born to play this role, although some would've probably pererred dezenel washington or will smith (lol). his acting here doesn't need to be exactly oscar winning per say considering the character but i'm glad he decids to play the daywalker in the two sequels. also starring is stephen dorff as our main villain and kris kristofferson as blade's alfred so to speak. the acting is good actually and the action keeps the plot going for sure. the opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts i've got to say. as much as like this movie there are few things that bother me which take away from this film ranking with something like "spider-man" or "x-men". stephen norrington had the villains portrayed in a way i didn't like so much honestly. their lines were so full of foul mouthed comedy it didn't really feel like a comic book film to me. plus "la magra" a bit disappointing as the final villain but the intense sword fight makes up for it i guess. not to mention a sense of extra non-realism: a black man in a leather coat with a sword beaing the #$%^ out of a cop in broad day light some how going unnoticed by the crowds walking by seemed kinda..well...dumb. moving away from a few of its flaws, the music by mark isham was great and fitted the film nicely. luckily all these problems are fixed and improved on in the stunning sequel, "blade 2".

'blade' would be an extremely above-average comic-book, vampire-hunter action/horror if it weren't for two minor flaws. #1 i loved seeing the all-but invincible blade/snipes do his slicing and dicing, but the whole "yes!" fist/punch was literally a letdown. #2 bad, no make that horrible, cgi  even for 1998 standards. this is mainly in the last third, but some sprinkled throughout. okay, despite those minor infractions, i really enjoyed this movie. all actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'matrix' rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior. so maybe 'the matrix' copied 'blade.' at any rate, it's a very movie for multiple genre-loving audiences: comic book geeks, action fanatics and horror/vampire lovers. so, we have blade, half-man/half-vampire, or "day-walker" and his accomplish, whisler (a la "batman and alfred") battling the undead who, apparently almost out number humans. who knew? in a rare act of humanity (blade's more of an antihero) our sword ninja/vamp rescues a newly infected (coincidentally) blood specialist/doctor. meanwhile, trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants (you guessed it) supreme power and needs blade somehow to obtain it. it's not the most original concept, if you read what i just wrote, but still highly enjoyable. you will want to see blade succeed, you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms. and you will know what's coming as this is the typical act 1-2-3 of a comic book introduction movie. still, watch this without trying to go too deep. such as vampire spf-1000 "suntan lotion"? really? what about the scalp? wouldn't that still burn? just like the money they burn for weapons? uh, okay, i am going too deep. once again, sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun ride.

when i was a kid i remembered this show but thought that now as an adult the show might be a bit dated. well yes it is but for me that makes the show more retro (and the musics very funky). this show is mostly well written. i do think its a travesty that this show was cancelled after one season especially when this show was more popular than the incredible hulk. i think fans should overlook the poor special effects and enjoy the stories. this next sentence contains spoilers: my favourite episode as a kid was when there were two spiderman that battle against each other interestingly a similar idea is concocted in spiderman 3 the movie. i liked the ideas in this tv show some will hate it. i believe stan lee wasn't a fan.

though, short lived "the amazing spider-man" was one of the best made for tv versions of a famed comic book hero. only "wonder woman" (lynda carter) (the best of the genre and "the incredible hulk" (bill bixby, lou ferrigno) were better."the amazing spider-man" outclasses the 1966-1968 "batman", because the high camp elements of the latter often ruin the adventure. "spider-man" outclasses all three television interpretations of "superman"- "lois and clark", "smallville", and of course the george reeves "superman" which brings up the rear."the amazing spider-man" was an action drama, during the late 1970's, the pre-cgi era, when stunts had to be performed by stunt men, not in the database of a computer. "spider-man" had its own very talented stuntman to perform the death defying daredevil acrobatics. his name was fred waugh, who donned the spidy suit for the action sequences. nicholas hammond, better known as one of julie andrew's children on the all-time movie classic "the sound of music" was spider-man during the dialogue scenes. hammond's spider-man also had his own secret identity as peter parker, similar to christopher reeve- superman/ clark kent, adam west-batman/bruce wayne, and of course lynda carter as wonder woman/ diana prince.it's unfortunate that the series only had thirteen episodes. because when the first episode hit the airwaves in november of 1977, the entire country was watching it on cbs that wednesday night. in all fairness, cbs should release this pilot episode as well as "the deadly dust", the "captive tower" etc. on dvd shortly. "spider-man" was short lived, but did have a cult following, and in my opinion was a heck of a lot better than the movie interpretation of the famed comic book hero starring toby mcguire.cbs might be hesitant to release these episodes for two reasons. (a) there might not be a broad market for them based on the lack of longevity of the series and a generation of children and young people who weren't born when the series originally aired in the 1970's. (b) one of the early "spider-man" episodes dealt with a terrorist with designs on the world trade center, which was attacked twice many years after this show went off the air, in 1993, and of course the devastating attack against this country on 9/11/01 in which the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost.however i don't think that it would be in bad taste to release this "spider-man" episode even if the show was adventure, derived from a comic book, and camp in nature. the live action "amazing spider-man" doesn't have a large following but it has a cult following. if and when cbs releases it out on dvd this cult following could be explained along with the episode in which spiderman saved the towers in 1978, but how in september of 2001 real life proved to be different from the movies. i like to follow the news, but i also like science fiction/fantasy. therefore i am eagerly awaiting the release of "the amazing spider-man on dvd".

continuing with the exclusive film programme about complicated relationships in some european courts, last night in the schloss theatre was shown "anna boleyn", a film directed by the great teutonic film director herr ernst lubitsch. the film depicts the terrible story of the queen consort of the british king henry viii. she was executed by her husband ( well, not exactly, the king ordered the executioners to do his dirty work) not to mention that this marriage caused an important political and religious historical event, the english reformation.the film stars dame henny porten, germany's first screen superstar during those early years and herr emil jannings, germany's fattest actor in that silent era. both play their characters in a suitable way; dame porten as an innocent aristocrat who becomes progressively interested in the power that the court offers her and herr jannings as the unscrupulous, whimsical and womanizing british monarch, a character very suitable for this german actor who overacts appropriately, given the extravagance and excessive personality of the character himself.in the early film period herr lubitsch was known for his outstanding costume films, colossal productions with big budgets ( "anna boleyn" cost about 8 million marks, a fortune even for this german count ) taking great care in magnificent decors as can be seen during the coronation procession in westminster abbey scene which employed 4.000 extras ( idle germans of that time were used, causing revolutionary workers to create a fuss when german president friedrich ebert visited the set during filming).besides the spectacle, one of the most important aspect of this and every film of herr lubitsch, even during his epic period, is the complex relationship between the main characters. we experience a game of different interests, double meanings, and the complicated art of flirting but what is treated lightly at first ends in tragedy. the importance of those historical facts is brought to bear in an effective way but lubitsch is really more interested in the changing relationship between henry viii and anna boleyn.and now, if you'll allow me, i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must take care that one of his fat and rich heiress doesn't lose her head for this teutonic aristocrat.herr graf ferdinand von galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/

nothing dull about this movie, which is held together by fully realized characters with some depth to them. even the hooded torturers have body language. jannings' performance is brilliant, all will, want and need. a henry viii as he must have been. henny porten is, maybe, nobler and purer than anne boleyn, but she plays the part as written: a victim caught in the jaws of a big (huge) baby.sparkuhl's cinematography is gorgeous in the restoration, the tints sensuous. lubitsch lets these characters breathe and reveal their corruption down to the tiniest of meannesses. he takes his time, which can try the patience of an audience accustomed to being carried away by action, but the time is worth spending. slow your heartbeat and watch this minor miracle of german silent film.

hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the chappelle show/charlie murphy, but also to the character daywalker). but i'll try to put all the things i liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything i didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read! let's start with the good things! the quote "strong bloody violence" (which is used by rating boards, to describe the content of a movie, does fit here very well. this is not a movie for kids! or for the faint of hearted! it has blade as a central character (wesley snipes is phenomenal) and a crazy enough story thread to hold/justify the action scenes! the original idea is also very engaging and intelligent. the action scenes are great here too.ok over to the things i didn't like. the overall story is too thin. it's enough as i've written above to hold the action scenes together, but there could be more. and a character like blade deserves more (imo). the drama therefor isn't the best ... also it's use of clichés doesn't help. some characters are underwritten ... that's that! :o)

silent historical drama based on the story of anne boleyn, newly arrived lady-in-waiting to the queen who catches the lustful eye of henry viii, bad-tempered king of england who loves to feast, drink, hunt, be entertained by his court jester, watch jousts, and chase around after young beauties who jump out of cakes and assorted attractive females around the castle. well, he's soon annulled his marriage, married anne, and telling her it is her holy duty to produce a male heir. she fails on that score and he soon has his eye on yet another lady-in-waiting. meanwhile, anne spends pretty much the entire film looking hesitant, perturbed, or downright ready to burst into tears. she just doesn't come across as a happy camper (or is it just bad acting?!).this film is a solid piece of entertainment, with an absorbing story that held my interest for two hours - plus i enjoyed seeing the very lavish medieval costuming featured here on a gorgeous sepia tinted print. emil jannings is quite striking and memorable in his well-done portrayal of king henry the eighth - he really seemed like he was henry the eighth. i am not so sure about the performance given by the actress who plays anne, seemed a bit over the top. the dvd of this film features an appropriate, nicely done piano score that perfectly suits this story. quite a good film.

this is a truly wonderful love story. i liked the songs, however even if you do not, you have to love the story. peter o'toole is at his best and petula clark is doing fine as well. i first saw this when i was about 13 and loved it then. now in my forties, i still enjoy it, probably even more. still makes me cry and laugh and feel good. it is a movie to watch only with a new age guy or by yourself as it is a chick flick. but whats wrong with that. need a little romance and maybe a little cry, try this movie.

30 years after the original film, "goodbye, mr. chips" was made over as a musical. peter o'toole and petula clarke starred in this wonderful remake of the beloved schoolteacher, chippington, who is referred to as chips by his beloved wife.o'toole was excellent here and received another oscar nomination. you have to wonder what peter o'toole has to do to win an oscar. he has lost the coveted award 8 times now. you also have to wonder that he lost in 1969 to john wayne for "true grit," which was really a testament to mr. wayne's long career and popularity. this year was also marked by great performances by richard burton, "anne of the thousand days," as well as dustin hoffman and jon voight for "midnight cowboy."surprised to see petula clarke cast as mrs. chippington. however, as this was a musical, a beautiful voice came well through and she did a nice piece of acting as well.who can forget the scene when chips carries on in the class despite the news that his beloved has been killed in a bombing. he never got to tell her the wonderful news of his pending promotion.the beautiful cinematography and music only enhanced a truly memorable experience.

peter o'toole gives a brilliant performance in this movie. i have seen the original version with robert donat and i much prefer peter o'toole's performance and the movie in general even though it is a musical. i've really never seen anything that mr. o'toole is in that i don't like. he is a brilliant actor, multi-talented, giving performances full of passion and depth. petula clark also gave a surprisingly good performance and was perfect for the part. it is an all-around heartwarming movie, full of tenderness and bittersweet fun. i will always remember (in para-phrase) the line where mr. chips regrets he has never given her children, and she replies, "of course you have, hundreds of them -- all boys." thank you for the opportunity to vote for this movie and to voice my opinion.

great story, great music. a heartwarming love story that's beautiful to watch and delightful to listen to. too bad there is no soundtrack cd.

great acting is best rewarded by pairing with a melodramatic script which truly elevates the human spirit. to all those minions who toil each and every day, take heart! your patience is virtuous. your forbearance and decency will evidence, in ways you will never anticipate. this is your great story. i do not believe you can watch through to the end without a wisp of moisture in that hardened eye. or, can you? for me, it would not be so... the story is relentless! the idealist, denied his due. will anyone speak up? ah! but you will need to see the show yourselves! observe the schoolmaster in his prime, without the notice and peerage the observer would certainly expect. and why does he continue so? yes! you must watch o'toole's performance for yourselves! i can only wish it were still 'in print' to purchase, then present to my friends as my evidence of respect for their faithful lives.

"chips" is an excellent blend of music, light comedy and drama with a picture perfect performance by peter o' toole and and effortless romantic supporting performance by petula clark. o' toole is able to show the shy, uncommunicative teacher that wishes so much to be loved by his students and is only able to express his love when he married katherine (clark). she brings him the world "what a lot of flowers" and he is forever changed. he becomes the beloved headmaster of brookfield through tragedy but knows he could only have achieved his goal through katherine's love. the songs (with the exception of the music hall number) are all "thought-songs" coming from character's emotions and thoughts and, the more you listen to them, the more beautiful they become - "walk through the world with me" and "you and i". o'toole's finest moment is the final speech he gives to the students (it was the reason for the oscar nomination). as a teacher, we question what "book" learning ever gets through - but, as chips says, we did teach them how to behave with each other and that is what really counts. beautifully filmed, perfectly orchestrated by john williams and one of the most moving films about love and how it can change you. "did i fill the world with love?" the boys sing their school song. by the end, chips realizes he was able to do it - but only cause catherine was there.

minor spoilers will follow.this movie is even more odd and unconventional than "songs from the second floor". there is no main character we follow around. there is no "plot" in the conventional way. there is no emphasis on an happy end. there is no crowdpleasing. in other words roy andersson is back with a vengeance. instead of falling back on convention and fixed formula roy andersson concentrates his film around an idea. i will not go into what that idea is, but even if you don't "get it" i promise that you will see the greatest visual depth ever put to film. the majestic scenes from "songs" pale in comparison here. a work of visual splendor.so be kind to your fellow man, because after all "we are the living", and only you and i have the power to change our lives. that is at least what i thought when i saw the final scene in the movie, with the inhumane bomber planes sweeping in over the city in the film to take our lives away. and of course don't forget to see this movie when it gets a limited release near you. this is one of those movies that actually have the power to make you a better person, like de sica's "bicycle thieves". a very warm and humanistic film.

roy anderson's film 'you, the living' comprises a series of fifty-odd sketches, snapshots and vignettes set in a swedish city. some characters are on screen for just a few second, whilst others appear in numerous scenes and are sometimes seen loitering in the background while another story unfolds. many scenes are drawn from the dreams, nightmares and fantasies of the strange but believable characters inhabiting this world. it is a fascinating approach: each of the scenes could be enjoyed in isolation, but together they contain a powerful portrait of what it is to be human.for the first half hour or so, 'you, the living' is gloriously funny. much of the humour centres on the members of a brass band, whose music practice infuriates the neighbours in their apartment block. the comic highlight, however, is provided by a dinner-party track gone horribly awry. after this hilarious introduction, however, the mood of the film darkens considerably. the dinner-party dream turns grim when the hapless protagonist is put on trial for his life, setting a mixed tone of absurdity and despair for the rest of the film.in the subsequent scenes, the unhappiness of the cast of characters becomes increasingly apparent. theirs is a world where people are unable to connect with one another, where talk of dreams, nightmares and fantasies is widespread, but where no person can be comforted, even when others reach out to help them. the despondent woman with the 'nobody loves me' refrain and the young girl with unrequited love for the rock guitarist, micke, are archetypal characters.the world of 'you, the living' is also blighted by selfishness. an elderly professor is called away the warmth of a vast banquet to answer a phone call from his impetuous money-grubbing son; a thief steals the wallet of a ruthless executive; an arrogant and impatient businessman insults a muslim barber and receives his comeuppance. in the film's bleakest moment, a woman in church recounts the long list of human sins as her fellow parishioners shuffle out at closing time.and yet, for all dark moments in this film, the shared refrain of 'tomorrow is another day' points to the ability of people to go on living in spite of many miseries. the soundtrack provided by benny anderson (of abba fame) seems inappropriately jovial at first but makes more and more sense as the film realises this human capacity to persevere.'you, the living' has an extraordinary visual style. the same washed-out, pale-green colours recur throughout, and there is nary a shadow in sight; this makes the characters appear exceptionally pallid and creates the sensation that human life is being laid bare for examination. almost every scene is captured in a static camera frame, as if these are photographs being brought to life. the few occasions where the camera does move are all the more extraordinary; the contrast between the life and movement of the great banquet form a startling contrast with the deadness of the cloakroom scene. in the most intense moments of longing and despair, the characters transfix the viewer by directly facing the camera  they know that they are being examined and have a few moments to pour out their hearts to us, the viewers.this is a wonderful, human film.

this film isn't supposed to be funny, but it made me laugh.it isn't designed to be sad, but my heart felt heavy through a number of the vignettes.it isn't written as action adventure, but my pulse raced more than once.just like life, this movie doesn't manipulate your emotions and tell you how to feel. it simply is, and you react.if you don't find it funny or sad or moving, i suspect that says more about you than the film.it amazing and refreshing to see a director so wholeheartedly celebrate that we are all human, and embrace that we are all trapped here, doing this "life" thing, over and over for as long as we must.tomorrow is another day.

i really didn't see this one coming. roy andersson had me pegged out, i am the perfect sucker for a static camera (long live king borowczyk!) and i was laughing hysterically for the first fifteen minutes of the film, he hit me straight between the eyes. you have to be a brilliant man to make self-pity hilarious. andersson reminds me of the third mate on the pequod in moby dick, flask, a man who took the whole of life to be a practical joke that the good lord himself is playing on us. and the web of egotism in this movie is truly hilarious.the level of satire is at fever pitch, you have one deluded self-pitying dreamer harp on about the cruelty of the world and then totally ignore a spiritual self-reflection crying out in agony. the very depths of egotism are plumbed. i really never thought it possible to go further than bergman's "the silence" in this respect. however the grotesqueness of the self-love and self-regard, by every single character in this film, is staggering. we are shown an existence where the talentless and the idle rail against a world they believe has been unjust towards them, they truly are legends in their own living rooms. the human beings in this film make self-deception and self-delusion a great artform! only one woman in the film appears to have any sort of understanding of what is going on. an old woman who refuses to leave a chapel, knelt down praying for the forgiveness of all mankind, her speech is the most electrifying condemnation of the modern world i have ever heard. she reveals through her prayers that what is wrong with the world is not to be fixed by mere tinkering, there are not a just a few faults, there is an abyss of corruption that can only be mended by immolation, and judgement day. watching this movie puts me in the mind of a naked monk, stood waist deep in a cold river at midnight screaming out a thousand kyrie eleisons for the sins of humanity. another grand jape is that it is clear that her prayers are futile, and in fact she is stopping everyone going home at closing time.this is not a film for the smug, no-one is spared, no idols are left on the altar, no one group of humans is harangued to the glory of another group. never has there been a greater more transcendent more astonishingly beautiful summation of our sins. it is a film for the end of the world, it is the grand jest, the great hideous practical joke of human life! from the catalogue of images it is too difficult to pick a favourite, i slapped my thigh and almost fell off my chair in the cinema, screaming with laughter as a man attempted to pull the tablecloth from under a set service. i won't spoil what happens, but the suspense builds up, and something truly unexpected occurs. it is probably the funniest thing i have ever seen in a cinema. i am quite reserved and i just couldn't control myself: that is the measure of the greatness of this film.the shooting of "you, the living" is impeccably formalist. we are shown the palette of an artist, dingy browns, yellows, greys, and sky blues set alive by the shock of luminous brass textures. there is never a tone out of place, it's like an hour and a half of symphonic whistlerian colour-meld. the obsession that must have gone into putting that colour scheme in place is extraordinary. and no shot is wasted, as with all great movies, there is not a spare inch of celluloid.perhaps the best film i've ever seen.

there is no plot. there are no central characters. there are no moving cameras or close-ups. in fact, this film does not follow any of the conventional storytelling techniques used by mainstream film. however, roy andersson's du levande is a remarkable piece of cinematic storytelling. it is a touching look at the human psyche.comprised of a series of vignettes, roy andersson gives us an intimate insight into what makes us all human. in perfectly framed static shots, added with the perfectly in tune, yet quirky, music, roy introduces us to a host of characters as they undertake their daily existence. some bordering on tragic, others hilarious, we are taken on a nordic journey like no other.it is a journey into the little things that make us human. instead of over-the-top storytelling or visual techniques, everything is stripped down to the bare minimum so that our sole focus is on the characters themselves. it focuses on the insignificant points of our lives that make us who we are; our dreams, our desperation. it's through this simple observation of others that we can accept who we are as individuals.the washed out colours and deathly-pale makeup of the characters only seems to emphasize their individual stories and remind us that unlike them, we are all alive. there is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel in this film, yet you walk out of the cinema with a sense of life. much more accessible than his earlier film, songs from the second floor, du levande, is a truly inspiring piece of cinema.

"with all the misery in the world, how can we not get drunk?"  miaa lovely aerial view of a major city turns ominous with the approach of a fleet of airplane bombers; an irate hairdresser reacting to a perceived racial slur cuts a road through a businessman's bushy hair; a man dreams of being dragged to an electric chair after a failed magic trick and a teacher breaks down in front of her grade school class because her husband called her a hag. these and about fifty other vignettes that run the gamut from the outright depressing to the wildly humorous to the joyously uplifting populate roy andersson's you, the living, his first feature since his critically acclaimed if commercially unsuccessful songs from the second floor.you, the living is filled with the same kind of imaginative set-pieces as songs, replete with black humor, surreal situations, and strange looking characters. though a bit overlong and less focused than his earlier work, what remains constant is andersson's unmistakable style with its stationary camera, sterile-looking backgrounds, and precise attention to detail. if there is a theme that ties the sketches together, it is that our time on earth is limited and "tomorrow's another day', so let's treat each other with kindness. along the way, we are entertained by tuba and drum music from the louisiana brass band, dinner guests at a banquet hall standing on their chairs singing a rousing song, and a house that turns into a moving train.the emotions range from the gloom of a daughter attempting to communicate with an alzheimer's patient to a young woman's ecstatic dream about marrying a handsome guitar-player named micke to the cheers of a crowd of onlookers. while there is no continuous narrative thread, the theme of greed and desperation appears in several sketches. the first of these threads features two corpulent individuals and their tiny dog sitting on a park bench, the woman bewailing the fact that no one understands or loves her, yet she blithely ignores the man's comforting and reassuring words.there is also a hefty admixture of irony. during what seems to be an executive luncheon, one man tells another on the phone that workers don't appreciate quality and how nice it is to appreciate money and the things that it can buy such as fine wine. when he is not looking, however, a man at an adjacent table calmly lifts his wallet from his jacket on the back of his chair. though andersson's cynicism is at times not very well hidden, you the living has an underlying humanism that shows compassion for the human condition. it is a cautionary tale that looks at the mess we humans have gotten ourselves into but suggests there is still time to turn it around, if we heed the warning of the poet goethe that opens the film, "be pleased then, you the living, in your delightfully warmed bed, before lethe's ice-cold wave will lick your escaping foot."

a short review without any spoilers follows.i saw this movie yesterday at the cannes film festival. my initial reaction is one of wonder and happiness. i'm so happy films like this are being made in our age of blockbusters. roy andersson's new movie "you, the living" is nothing less than a complete masterpiece. you, the living is composed by some 50 vignettes filmed with a static camera. i will not give away the content of the scenes here, because i hate when people spoil even the smallest details. but, yes, most of the scenes made the 1000 people in the claude debussy theatre absolutely baffled and amazed. when the film was over we applauded for several minutes, we had no other choice.so what's the score with "you, the living". hm, andersson isn't afraid to take on the heavy questions; history, guilt, gand the holocaust during ww2 are big subjects (and these themes work very well together).the images created are brilliant, the depth sometimes surpasses "songs from the second floor". well, sorry for this ranting, praising review. look out for the flying house in the beginning folks!10/10 stars - a masterpiece (i never throw this grade out).

this is a catastrophe movie set in london . starting multiple hurricane,superstorm and tornadoes on scotland are displaced towards east , downing england coast and later the south. after several hours of heavy rainful , the london barrier above thames is short from running over, and it paves the way for disaster. then a colossal tidal-wave travel relentless down east causing devastation and lives of millions of londoners are in danger. at the center of the story is a climatologist(tom courtenay) a climatologist who tries to save london from the effects of giant wave , trying to convince the authorities that the town dike was unsafe, furthermore a marine engineer (robert carlyle) and his ex-wife samantha(jessalyn gilsig) . they are trapped into the barrier and dropped to sea .meantime the secret government agency hq ruled by nash(joanne whalley) under direct orders of deputy minister(david suchet) attempt to control many displaced and avoid more dead, approximately 200.000. they have a little time to save london from total catastrophe.perfectly acceptable drama-disaster with alright acting. magnificent tom courtenay as a climatologist who predicts catastrophe and excellent robert carlyle and jessalyn gilsig as ex-matrimony rekindling their love. the movie packs impressive flood scenes brought to life by the breathtaking computer generator special effects, better than the classic of the 70s , such as 'earthquake, inferno towering' and similarly to 'armaguedon and day after tomorrow'. although isn't a clear denounce, we know that the flood is caused by the greenhouse effect and global warming which originates the ozone hole. the motion picture is well directed by tony mitchell. i would recommend this movie to people who like disaster movies. another adaptations about floods, are the following : 'flood(1976)'directed by earl bellamy with robert culp and barbara hershey; 'hard rain(1998)' directed by mikael salomon with morgan freeman and christian slater; ' flood : a river's rampage(1979)' directed by bruce pittman with richard thomas

i recently purchased this on dvd as i hadn't heard of it and like robert carlyle.obviously this movie is not going to have hollywood blockbuster special effects,in saying that though the special effects were decent enough,and the acting was fine also.i found the movie to be enjoyable and do not regret buying it at all,at almost 2 hours long it is just the right length for this type of movie.do not expect thrilling explosive action from beginning to end though,it is a fairly well balanced movie with a decent enough storyline!

the essence of this film falls on judgments by police officers who, fortunately ethical and moral men, act on situations within situations in a city with a super-abundance of violence and killing. good compound interacting story lines and above-average characterizations.

the details in the big trail were so incredible that i felt that the movie was made at the time it represents. i have never seen wagons that were so real! they were big, loaded with accessories, and even felt as though they had been filled with details under the canvas covers that was never meant to be seen. every speck of dirt, every scratch, every splinter was there. modern day computer technology could never recreate the scenes of the numerous wagons as they move across the land or circle to fend off indians. the wagons were all real, individual vehicles, each with its own real team of horses or oxen.the actors clothing could not have felt more genuine. with the exception of john wayne's buckskin outfit and marguerite churchill's nice dress, the clothes were very common looking, tattered, or dirty in an authentic looking way. many of the actors and actresses were born before electricity and indoor plumbing were common, and they must have felt comfortable with the surroundings. all the indians were real indians rather than white extras painted tan.women of the old west had to be sturdy because there was a lot of work. in every scene showing work done by the people of the wagon train, women are shown chopping wood, hauling logs, etc. this realism was so natural looking that it did not come across as a statement on the role of women of the day rather than a fact of survival.the plot of revenge and romance is played well. nothing is overstated or overplayed.something was lost along the way in the 1930's in hollywood. as much as i love the fake scenery and controlled environment of old movies, the big trail manages to feel real above all else. the more i see big budget movies of the silent era, the more i like them. i can think of few movies of the 1930's that i have seen that equal the grandeur of the best of the 1920's. if there were home movies made in the days of wagon trains, the big trail is what they would look like.

my giving this film a score of 8 is relative to other feature-length films from 1930. by the standards of films made just a few years later, this film might receive a score of only 6 or 7--mostly because the sound quality was so poor. now it is possible that the film sounded better and the fox movie channel did show a degraded print (it did have a lot of lines and scratches), but i assume the sound problem was always an issue. that's because sound in movies was still a novelty in 1930 and many of the hollywood talking pictures of 1930 sounded terrible--with background characters often drowning out the leads, characters huddled together to make sure they are picked up by the microphones or inconsistent quality (such as what was seen in the bishop murder case, hell's angels and other films of the day). this was all made much worse in the big trail because most of the film was shot outside--something unheard of at the time. quite an innovation but also something that really stretched the talents of the sound technicians! so, while the film was very hard to listen to, i realize that they had to start somewhere, so i can forgive this--especially since the outdoor scenes are breathtaking--a major innovation for 1930.the plot is rather similar to cimarron--a western that came out the following year and which captured the oscar for best picture. unfortunately, cimarron isn't all that great a film and i actually like the big trail more due to the scope of the film. while some might balk at the big trail's slow-moving pace, i saw it as a great history lesson about the hardships endured by those traveling west on wagon trains. plus, the whole thing just looked so beautiful, as director raoul walsh went to significant trouble to film on location and the big trail looks almost like a film version of some ansel adams prints.as for the acting, it was pretty good. this was a major break for young john wayne--as his previous screen appearances were, at best, minor and unremarkable. here, he was given the lead and did a dandy job--though he was obviously young and a little less "john wayne-ish" than he was in later films, as his screen persona was not yet firmly established. another interesting part was played by tyrone power ii (tyrone power's father). he looked nothing like his extremely handsome son and looked and sounded almost exactly like bluto from the popeye cartoons! he made very few sound films--dying just a year after making this film--so it's a rare opportunity to see and hear this once famous actor.overall, the film is well worth seeing despite some sound problems and a few overly long scenes here and there. for 1930, it was a remarkable achievement--more so than the much more famous and award-winning cimarron made the following year. much of the reason the big trail didn't win an oscar most likely was because all quiet on the western front came out the same year and it is truly one of the great films.

this movie is important to those of us interested in western history because it makes use of authentic techniques in its production.the scenes of the wagon train are particularly authentic; so far as i know, it contains the only scenes ever filmed illustrating the techniques for river crossings at a bluff. the horses and mules have to be lowered to the river level and the wagons let down by ropes and pulleys. the scene is such that i could watch it over and again just trying to get a feel for what a crossing was like...and the early travelers did it time and time again while crossing the country.melodrama aside, this picture is as authentic in dress and style as they come and worth watching for that alone.

i never expected such an old film to be as impressive as this 1930 western turned out to be. the scenes of the pioneers heading west in their covered wagons, encountering storms and mud, river crossings, indian attacks and every manner of trial and danger, are astonishing in their rugged believability. much of the film was shot outdoors, and the movie has a truly epic feel about it. the actors must have experienced much the same conditions as the original pioneers did, and the results are astounding. the wagons, the clothing, every single detail looks and feels right. the characters are simple but believable, with a straightforward story ,that travels like the wagon train to its destination.john wayne is slim and youthful in one of his first roles, as the scout leading the wagons, and he does a fine job as the idealistic young frontiersman. he's up against a marvelously scurvy trio of villains, including ian keith as a slick gambler, charles stevens as a mexican sidekick and tyrone power, senior, as the growly, bear-like trapper. power's bearded, snarling, larger than life portrayal is both comic and menacing. i keep picturing him with a bandanna, gold hoop earring and black eye patch, with a parrot on his shoulder, as he grunts and growls various threats and insults. his character could easily be transferred to a pirate ship with no difficulty at all. he nearly steals the whole picture.tully marshall is delightful as a wily old frontiersman who is wayne's best friend. the lovely marguerite churchill makes a spirited heroine, whose initial meeting with wayne is a hilarious mix-up, resulting in a long running courtship consisting of insults and feigned indifference on her part, to aw shucks persistence on his. the results are quite humorous and one is glad to see them finally get together at the end.the scenery is amazing, with the wagons crossing real prairies and having to be lowered by ropes down cliffs. indians who are clearly the genuine article, and not white actors in makeup, appear as both friends and foes, and are treated with dignity. wayne's character tells an admiring group of young boys that the indians are his friends, who taught him everything he knows about survival in the wilderness.the big trail is an uncomplicated tale told well by a talented cast and crew. it will probably appear naive to many modern viewers, but there is a quiet dignity about it that never lets it become corny. there is a great deal of intentional humor, including a rowdy rascal of a pioneer, who makes loud animal sounds from hiding , every time the smooth gambler ian keith tries to con the beautiful heroine into marrying him. his flowery speeches about the plantation he allegedly owns are interrupted by very realistic imitations of yowling cats and quacking ducks, causing the would be seducer to look around in annoyance for the unseen creatures.highly recommended, both for western fans and lovers of old movies in general. this is truly a classic film for the ages.

one of the myths of the early sound era is that they couldn't make westerns because they had trouble recording sound on location. in fact, it was the financial restrictions of the depression that temporarily killed off the genre, at least in the "a" budget bracket. however, in the period 1929-1931, before the economic downturn had really kicked in, the "a" western flourished, notable examples including the virginian, billy the kid and cimarron. the big trail was perhaps the biggest of them all  a gargantuan pioneer western shot in an early widescreen process appropriately titled grandeur. thanks to a recent dvd release we now get to see the widescreen version alongside the fullscreen that was shot simultaneously.the director was raoul walsh, a man for whom the spirit of adventure lay in vast outdoor vistas, and thus in many ways a perfect choice. he makes great use of the wider frame to show off the western landscape at its most breathtaking. very typical of walsh are a number of shots towards the beginning, such as the one where a woman is chopping firewood. most of the screen is tightly filled by the wagons and other clutter, but in one corner we see the wilderness stretching out invitingly. when the wagon train gets going, the open plain is gradually revealed to us, with wagons pulling away like stage curtains. these shots are not so effective in the fullscreen version, yet on the wider canvas walsh's expression of the outdoors was never better.but there's an unfortunate flipside to this. when it comes to dialogue scenes, walsh's tendency is to place the actors in the middle of the shot, as if they were in an imaginary fullscreen box. the extra width becomes just that  extra. it may seem logical at first, because it means that height-wise we see as much of the actors as we would in a fullscreen picture. however it makes the players look small and insignificant within the frame, while all the background business dominates the shot  and there is a lot of background business in the big trail. when widescreen formats re-emerged in the 1950s, many directors would make the same mistake, before eventually realising that in talkie scenes it is better to frame actors from around the chest up, losing some of their height but allowing them to fill the screen.it's a pity, because the big trail is a particularly well-balanced and finely scripted effort. the romance and revenge subplots are simple but well defined, and do not threaten to overbalance each other or the pioneer story. it could have been a great intimate epic, but it loses dramatic weight because every time characters start talking to each other we get distracted by herds of cattle, drifting wagons or whatever else is filling every spare inch of frame. still, walsh's sensitivity to deeply emotional romantic moments is still on display, and he manages to make the final scene effective and memorable. there are also some nice comedy touches, largely courtesy of "comical swede" el brendel.the big trail is also notable for being john wayne's first lead role. while wayne is another victim of the distant framing in dialogue scenes, we do at least see his strong physical presence and hear his warm but assertive vocal delivery. he betrays his lack of experience, but the potential is clearly there. sadly that potential wasn't widely realised at the time and he spent the rest of the decade slumming it in b-pictures before he finally hit stardom. also appearing in this picture is wayne's buddy (and later prolific character actor) ward bond. he's not credited, but you can spot him in a number of scenes, most prominently around the 80-minute mark where he is stood to tyrone power's left.the big trail is a glorious epic that manages to defeat itself as a drama. and it was this stupendous scale that would put the western (and widescreen) to bed for some time. and although the 40s and 50s are now regarded as the golden age of the western, it was by then a changed genre, with stories of individual adventure and heroism in an established west  no better or worse, but of a different form. the early talkie period was the end of an era in which westerns could be truly gigantic.

if one overlooks the technical problems of this early (1930) sound movie such as the sound quality and the occasional stiffness of john wayne, one will find this movie to be an epic that is more realistic than almost any movie made since. beginning at the missouri, a large caravan of conestoga wagons, people, and animals head west. the wagons are pulled down huge cliffs and cross a flooded river with considerable risk to the riders in the wagons. indians meet with wayne, and allow the train to pass through their land. later, indians gather west of the train to combat them. the wagons form a huge circle with horses and cattle in the circle, and fire their rifles creating with the circling indians a veil of smoke.when the battle ends, the dead are buried on the spot and the people and wagons depart. this scene is remarkable, as the camera stays with the dead as the living depart. it is unique in the way it links the viewer with the dead and separates the viewer from the living. the wagons encounter a major thunderstorm with torrential downpours and mud everywhere. they finally arrive at their destination near a redwood or sequoia forest in oregon. the film is done in 70 mm widescreen at about a 2.0:1 ratio (in 1930!).i haven't mentioned the plot because it is secondary to the scenic grandeur and the enormous amount of work involved in making this film. moviemakers will never work this hard again to make such a movie or any movie. given the technical limitations of the sound, the music is at times moving, such as when wayne leaves his girl to hunt down his friend's killers and at the end.while all the critics rave about the searchers and wayne's psychology, racism, short temper, and complex characters, the big trail gives us a story of simple people encountering extraordinary hardships. one of the best westerns i have seen.

as a veteran screen writing instructor at richland college in dallas and a former mgm screenwriter back in the days of decent films, i am thrilled to have accidentally clicked on channel 33 in dallas tonight and watched this enchanting film in which betty white is gorgeous and makes one yearn for the good old days of truly good movies before hollywood started banging out all this crap for the teenagers. if a producer is listening, i'd like to state that there are enough of us over 60's who will happily pay a buck to see a movie that has no guns, no killing, no special effects, no sex and violence and just a good touching tale of human relationships that leaves you with a good warm feeling, as this film did for me.

florence vidor stars as the daughter of a strict bible toting father who throws her out of the house when gossip taints her name. in the big city, she finds the dying wife of her own brother (the two had secretly married) and raises their child on her own. years later, she goes back home to confront her family.this old melodrama is heavily larded with fascinating feminist themes (circa 1921, but sounding remarkably modern). some of it is laid on with a trowel (as the father, theodore roberts gives his eyebrows a real workout), but it's well put together dramatically and lovingly composed and shot by cinematographer henry sharp.

vidor shines as judith, the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly patriarchal family. her brother, david, is so downtrodden by their father that it's a surprise he's able even to tie his shoes, rather than asking dad to do it for him.other reviewers have already outlined the plot, so i won't rehash it; i will, however, point out that nan, who is pregnant by david, is also married to him. this is not an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which would have been horrific by 1921 standards. the two are secretly married, but nan's father, having been paid by david's father, tears up their marriage certificate.nan's death scene, with judith in attendance, is a truly heart-rending experience, and highly charged with emotion. this scene alone is worth watching the movie for, but there's far more to the plot than that; why on earth aren't modern movies made with the same attention to the story?

"hail the woman" is one of the most moving films i have ever seen in my entire life. i watched it twice in a row and sobbed my eyes out.this silent film masterpiece deserves a much wider viewing audience; unfortunately the sole surviving print is so badly scratched that most people won't watch it all the way through, and they will miss the gem shining underneath the rough. this film could use a digital restoration, to help bring out its beauty, but i doubt it will get it from anyone, since its main theme is spiritual restoration before christ of the family unit, and this is not politically correct these days. however it remains a powerful theme for those whose hearts are hurting from the pain of broken family relationships.the cast is magnificent, especially florence vidor, who literally glows as judith, the daughter; ethereal madge bellamy as nan, the poor girl who gets pregnant and is cast aside; theodore roberts as the crotchety old domineering father who destroys everyone around him through pride; and handsome lloyd hughes, as the son david, afraid of his father, but really of life itself. this is a nice film to watch at christmas, especially. you will not regret being patient and viewing it in its entirety despite its deterioration.

i'm impressed that 'hail the woman' was made at all; released just one year after american women got the vote, this turgid drama makes an earnest plea against the sexual double standard which judges women's sexual behaviour more harshly than men's.slight spoilers ahead. a prologue, set in the plymouth colony in 1621, shows a pilgrim girl sentenced to the ducking stool for flirting with a boy; the boy is not penalised. now we come to flint hill, new hampshire in the present (1921). oliver beresford (theodore roberts) is a bombastic bible-thumper: what we call in britain and australia 'a god-botherer'. beresford is determined that his son david (lloyd hughes) become a preacher, regardless of how david feels about it. as for beresford's daughter judith ... well, beresford is confident that women aren't important enough to be anything more than wives and mothers. apparently, god told him this personally.david's evangelical career is compromised when he impregnates nan higgins, the stepdaughter of the local odd-jobs man. (tully marshall's character is identified in the credits solely as the 'odd jobs man', but a close-up of a cheque reveals his name to be jake higgins. the prejudices of 1921 require that he be merely nan's stepfather, not her biological parent.) to save his son from scandal, beresford buys off nan's stepfather with a cheque. nan goes off to the big city, to melt into oblivion as one more unwed mother.judith is naturally dismayed by the limitations imposed upon her by her gender. (or rather, by other people's perceptions of it.) she meets wyndham gray (excellent performance by edward martindel), an author who encourages her to transcend sexist stereotypes. but judith is informally engaged to local lout joe hurd, who won't put up with such nonsense. hurd is played by vernon dent, a burly performer now remembered solely for comedy roles (as a second banana to harry langdon, and as a villain in three stooges movies). he gives an excellent performance here, in a role outside his usual range. sadly, in real life dent spent his final years in poverty and total blindness due to diabetic retinopathy.eventually, judith ends up working at an orphanage. this being 1921, i expected the orphanage to be whites-only, so i was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to include one chinese boy. (and unpleasantly surprised when he's used as the butt for a racial joke.) the movie makes one odd error here. in a christmas sequence, we see the orphanage mistress reciting 'a visit from saint nicholas' ... but (in a dialogue title) she credits santa claus with six reindeer rather than eight. this is followed by a brief animation sequence, showing santa with six reindeer hitched to his sleigh. i assume that the animators (either by accident, or to save money) left out two reindeer, and the title card revised the poem to match the error.lloyd hughes was generally a bland and unimpressive actor. his most famous performance is his role in 'the lost world', where he's easily upstaged by a rampaging brontosaurus. for his climactic scene in 'hail the woman', hughes gives a memorable performance as he finally rebels against his father's tyranny. in his performance as the gospel-shouting father, theodore roberts has been accused of overacting to the point of making his role a caricature. i disagree: sadly, decades after this film was made, i continue to encounter 'holy' fools exactly like this man ... willing to destroy the lives of everyone around them, and firmly convinced they have god's authority to do so.in the central role of judith beresford, florence vidor gives a sensitive, realistic and intelligent performance. i normally dislike vidor, who tended to be cast in glamour roles but wasn't pretty enough to justify them. here, her character's physical appearance is less relevant than usual.this entire film is impressively directed by john griffith wray, a director who deserves to be much better known. sadly, wray died at the onset of the talkies era, in his mid-thirties: had he lived another ten years, he would surely have helmed several early sound classics. in 'hail the woman' there are several extremely beautiful screen compositions: i was especially impressed by a scene in the new england forest, when vidor and dent have a quarrel in front of an enormous uprooted tree. (i wonder where this was actually filmed.) 'hail the woman' deals with unpleasant subject matter, but it deserves to be much better known, and i'll rate this ambitious drama 9 out of 10.

i consider this movie as one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time. it has so much highly intelligent thoughts in it, that anybody who thinks the movie is awful did not get it and is not able to recognize really deep philosophical themes, which are in it (in all the 3 schneider movies) without a doubt. several universities in germany and throughout europe have made studies on schneider's way of seeing things. by the way, helge schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and on of the jazz-musicions in germany (maybe europe). he is mostly inspired by the great m.davis and t.monk. so if you do not like him, it is ok, but please do not try to convince others that he might be stupid, cheap, boring or not funny. because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you are willing to really look into the art of h.schneider you would have to "surrender".

helges best movie by far. very funny, very surrealistic. if bunuel made a movie starring buster keaton as krusty the clown it would look like this.brilliant performances by the cast we already know from other schneider movies, especially helmut körschgen as the sidekick of 00schneider. (andreas kunze who once more plays the wife in this one is a bit annoying though). and of course helge himself as nihil baxter is absolutely incredible.p.s: if this movie had a proper merchandising i would really like to buy a replica of that "holz ist" painting.

the phenomenon helge schneider defies easy description or quick categorization. yet, for the international audience not acquainted to him, one could say he's something like a crude mix of weird al yankovich and andy kaufman, adding a foible for jazz music and 70s outfits. while his stage performances already are eccentric, his movie works are simply hilariously outrageous."00 schneider" is, in my opinion, helge's best movie. he stars in the two leading roles - police detective "kommissar 00 schneider" and murderer-villain "nihil baxter", and also in a precious smaller role as physician "dr. hasenbein".in the opening scene, we see how modern-art-loving baxter accidentally kills the circus clown bratislav metulskie, from whom he has bought a malfunctioning used jaguar, when a beloved sculpture slips out of baxter's hands, fatally hitting metulskie. upon reading about the incident in the newspaper, 00 comes back from retirement to investigate the case with the support of his loyal sidekick, lt. koerschgen, who is played by an elderly actor bearing the same name. they pick up baxter's track quickly, and interrogate him at his weirdly decorated mansion (one of the movie's best scenes!), but initially fail to gather any proof. the story winds through many turns, with several scenes that don't always really contribute to the progress of the plot but are hilariously funny, such as a daydream by 00 (including the most unusual view on a running man's brief-clad crotch in movie history), a police-department party during which koerschgen gets into a row with the chief and has to be hospitalized, and a visit at the already mentioned dr. hasenbein's. baxter, then, is finally caught attempting to escape to rio de janeiro on a plane.always worth special mention is andreas kunze who in this case plays 00's wife, as he's usually appearing in drag performing women's roles in helge's movies.so all you folks out there looking for new laughs, i strongly recommend this movie. the catch? you have to understand german (as i doubt there's an english version around)...

the answer.....no, sadly not. though miller and the sweep has to be hailed as a most whimsical cinematic treat.the drama, suspense,romance and the unidentified crowd at the end all add to the films complex storyline which must have been too much for the audiences of 1898. a enlightening experience, one for all the family!

this is a bewildering, absurdist short. a miller, dressed in white, makes his way towards us from a windmill in a desolate landscape. although the image is pared down, there is an obvious logic here. however, he is stopped by the sweep, all in black because of his work. they start pummelling each other for no particular reason - did the snooty miller insult the sooty sweep? is this class war? whatever, he pelts his adversary with bags of grain which fly all over the fight, making redundant everything he had done prior to the fight, making redundant the windmill, so that all becomes as pointless as the fight. the miller's grain whitens the sweep's blackness - later westerns wouldn't be so subtle, heroes and villains being colour-coded. is there a racial tint here? if this wasn't marvellous enough, the fighters are chased off the screen by a crowd of people who came from nowhere, an appropriately kafkaesque ending to an odd story (or are they just the social conscience rising up against a fight that negates order and purpose?), and very unusual in the days of early silent cinema. this mix of comedy, surrealism, and the absurd is an obvious forerunner for buster keaton, while the windmill reminds us of one of the great thrillers, hitchcock's 'foreign correspondant'.

leland p. fitzgerald (ryan gosling) has committed an unspeakable crime, the stabbing of the retarded younger brother of his ex-girlfriend becky (jena malone). no one, least of all leland himself, can explain why he's done what he's done, whether the act was premeditated or spontaneous, done out of hatred or love.in the detention center, leland meets pearl madison (don cheadle), a onetime novel writer who sees in leland's case a second opportunity. but pearl also wants to understand leland's motivation and takes him under his wing as a confidante in the prison.the film jumps from the past to the present several times, often allowing the past to act as a context to the present, and vice versa. writer/director matthew ryan hodge shows how leland's crime - and the events leading up to it - affect the people in his life, from becky to her family to leland's mother (lena olin) and estranged father (kevin spacey) to allen (chris klein), a young man who is staying with becky's family after the death of his own mother.the chief asset in the movie is gosling, who is perfectly cast as the 15-year-old pseudopsychopath. like bartleby the scrivener, gosling's leland just exists; he shows little emotion during the film, but instead his expressions belie an ocean of guilt, sadness, love, and rage.each of the main actors offered perhaps their best work to date, save spacey (who's not exactly a novice). special praise is due to malone and klein, two young performers who are better known for lighthearted comedy fare than the heavy drama of this movie.another huge benefit in terms of the story is that none of the characters is flawless; none are heroes out to save the day. this is simply not a black-and-white movie.

don't let any reviews (critics, imdb users or mine) influence you seeing this movie. i read only the plot premise and became intrigued. after watching, this movie, in my opinion, is definitely worth seeing. it gives a perspective on life that many have probably not contemplated. its is not however, as leland himself says, a movie that "can be wrapped up in a neat package with a bow and everything." other user reviews on this website claim to have a psychological background and imply that the story is not feasible. quite obviously they missed the entire point of the movie, which is disappointing. to say the least.in short, it is a well acted, well directed movie. the story is not a feel good one, but i feel if you don't come away from the movie feeling good, you may just have missed something. to characterize it as "art house" is unfair, in my opinion, but as our society likes labels, this is probably the one that fits. if you find you know everything there is to know about the world... i'd suggest skipping this one. if you feel movies should be a form of escape "from the world"... you won't find it here. but if you do watch it... you just might find something in yourself.

leland fitzgerald (ryan gosling) is sent to jail for the murder of an autistic kid. when pressured with the question 'why?' he doesn't have an answer. while in jail he meets pearl (don cheadle), his teacher, who decides to take matters into his own hands and helps leland figure out why he did it. throughout this film we learn all about leland's troubled life, including his ex-girlfriend becky(jena malone), his famous father albert(kevin spacey)and his whole sad life. this film is matthew ryan hoge's second movie, and it is spectacular in nearly everyway. this is one movie which will leave you thinking in the end, and wondering about how it all works. the movie is quite dark, but if you can handle that then you will realize just how good a film it is.in this movie, there is no bad guy. there is no one you can blame for anything that happens. there's no stereotyping, and the audience does not try to prove leland guilty. instead, we sit back, relax, and watch this boy's life unfold throughout the corse of the movie. all the problems depicted in the story are very real. drug addiction, parental expectations, overwhelming sadness; they all exist in our world.ryan gosling gives one of the greatest performances of his career in this movie, as the depressed teenager leland. his father lives in europe and doesn't really care much about his son. the only person he loves is becky, but she has problems of her own. he knows exactly what he did, but as he says in the film, 'you want a why, but maybe there isn't one. maybe this is something that just happened.' there is a why, but we don't find out about it until the end. as you watch the movie, the audience finds themselves amazed that such a young person could know so much about the world. leland notices things that people tend to ignore. a particular thought-provoking scene which really affected me was during one of leland's conversations with pearl. pearl just cheated on his wife and when leland asks why, pearl replies that he's only human. then leland says something which never really occurs to anyone: "why do people only say that when they've done something wrong?"another fantastic acting job was provided by chris klein. in the film he plays allen harris, the boyfriend of becky's sister julie (michelle williams). although he is not one of the main characters, i found myself amazed at how deep his character was. you can relate to allen a lot. you know how much he cares for the pollard family. it's as if they were his own flesh and blood. by the end of the movie, you realize just how far he would go to help them. overall, this movie is a masterpiece which has been overlooked by quite a few people. if, however, you take the time to watch it, you will most likely see that everything i've mentioned above is true. and once you're finished watching it, you'll never look at the world the same way again.9.5/10

simply delightful claymation feature from nick park and company spoofing such film-greats as "king kong" and "the wolf man" has wallace and gromit as rabbit security finding it difficult to solve a major problem in their village..a giant were-rabbit is feasting lavishly on the vegetable crops of the citizens! what makes this even worse is that the great vegetable festival is about to commence and the citizens have all prepared dutifully to win the top of prize. what makes the situation even worse is wallace is the reason behind the whole vegetable-eating rampage..he was testing out a new invention regarding taking his brain waves in an attempt to brain wash captured rabbits into disliking vegetable crops. what occurs is catastrophic as some sort of hybrid were-rabbit is created in the process..and it has more to do with wallace than he could ever imagine. it'll be up to his loyal(..and startlingly intelligent)and fast-thinking dog gromit to save the day.this is a clever and imaginative effort from the crew behind other oscar winning claymation features starring wallace and gromit. seeing good ole-fashioned claymation is refreshing considering the cgi boom that has featured rather lackluster fare here recently as the industry spits out more and more mediocre product. here, we get a full feature with witty humor and some wild stunts featuring marvelous animation, not to mention gut-busting sight gags.

following on from the huge success of nick park and the aardman team with the wallace and gromit short animations we now have the first (hopefully of many) feature with the plasticine characters that so many love. the dvd of the movie has proved to be the most durable and best used of my two children's many christmas presents by a long way. the plot of the movie is straightforward enough but the beauty of the w & g films for me is the background gags. there are plenty of up front gags and slapstick for kids and adults to enjoy but the background is the killer for me. all in a classy addition to an already classy filmography for nick park etal and i would recommend fans and new watchers to see this film....often.

the first full-length film featuring the aardman characters wallace and gromit manages to bring in elements of all the previous half-hour show which aired on television.wallace runs a company to humanely capture rogue rabbits from people's vegetable gardens, and has the bright idea to try out his invention on the hapless bunnies once they're caught. of course, as in other wallace and gromit films, things don't quite work out as planned.similarly to a close shave, there's a love interest for wallace, in this case the village lady posh, and a big mean villain with a bullish dog. gromit is beautifully animated with a wide range of expressions making the character laugh out loud funny. and of course peter sallis provides the voice of wallace again and is a perfect fit.and as in a grand day out, cheese features heavily to great comedic effect as the film moves along.on the negative side this film is a little on the long side. there are great effects, and some pieces which make you sit up and watch, but perhaps this story would have worked better as another short subject rather than pushing it to feature-length.

have just seen this film, in australia on satellite. as i have been avoiding the news more so than usual over the last week coming from the us of a regarding gunmen, well to be absolutely blunt, this film is a prescient gem. a big bravo to all involved. i had only a small idea of what the film entailed as is most often the case for good effect and this certainly came up with cinematic goods. the setting of the scene is effective in the truest sense of the word, with all the hairy confronting subjects of today's world in relation to one's own faltering family, albeit suburb. the first forty minutes sets such a professional theater i was not ready for the out loud laughs when they came. although the cathartic moment built via comedy and character as the family and neighbors came together in an extraordinary way.all in all a foreseeing of who and what we are. a most meaningful film and a must see.please note the date of this review.

this film does not have the outstanding visuals that american beauty or the ice storm offered and because it was made after those films, it cannot be marked as very original either: the music, though subtly brilliant, sounds very much like that of american beauty. the story has some similarities with the ice storm in particular (as well as sigourney weaver). without intent perhaps, the film seems to try to recreate the success of the two aforementioned movies too much. at times, the story tends to stay a bit more shallow than it's bigger, more successful "brothers" by having too much going on, or by not delivering the most effective dialogs. here, the writing cannot measure with that of american beauty. but that can be said about most movies ever made, even the best and there is still a lot to like: said music score and (expectable, given the cast) effective performances. of note is emile hirsch who would shine a couple of years later in the outstanding "into the wild".overall i can recommend this film if you like suburban dramas though it's not the first one on a list of must-sees, which would be topped by: 1 american beauty 2 the ice storm 3 little children.after you've seen and liked those, check out this one.

"imaginary heroes" is a 2004 film starring sigourney weaver, jeff daniels, emile hirsch, michelle williams, and kip pardue.the story concerns a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the oldest child (pardue) commits suicide."ordinary people" has been mentioned often in relation to this film; it's sort of "ordinary people" with a role reversal. the mother in this case, sandy travis (weaver) is more accessible than the father, ben (daniels) who is clearly devastated and unable to cope. like "ordinary people," the younger son tim (hirsch) is the focus of the film.for me, the film was absorbing enough to keep watching but has a curious detachment about it. there were some wonderful interactions - mother and son, mother and neighbor, brother and sister (williams) and some good offbeat moments. what never clicked was ben being any part of that family or having any chemistry with sandy. this seems to have been the goal of director/writer dan harris. in one scene in a grocery store, the checkout kid assumes sandy is "about 30" and gives her his phone number. in almost the next scene, daniels asks sandy if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday. weaver was 55 when this film was made, actually probably 54, and looks phenomenal. so what is ben looking at? however, there's something askew about ben's complete detachment because the viewer doesn't really see how daniels ever was attached to that family.the end has a couple of twists and also some very touching scenes. everyone is very good, with weaver and hirsch being the standouts.there's not a tremendous amount of dialogue in this movie and lots of stares. the script could have been sharper. but "imaginary heroes" is a good effort.

another slice of darkness and denial hiding beneath the surface of american suburbia, imaginary heroes chronicles the lives of the travis family, all recovering following the suicide of their eldest son.the pair at the center of the film is mother and son sandy (sigourney weaver) and tim (emile hirsch), both acting out in different ways as a result of the death. while tim experiments with prescription medication and his own sexuality, sandy regresses to her former self, smoking marijuana and coming to terms with an old act of infidelity.the relationship between sandy and tim is explored well, especially when references are made to both of them being outcast from their own family: sandy due to her affair and tim, initially, due to always being in the shadow of his more successful older brother. considerably less time is allowed for sandy's husband ben (jeff daniels) who, in a devastating depiction of denial, orders sandy to make an additional plate of food for his dead son and place it in his old spot at the dinner table. michelle williams' older sister penny is underwritten and could easily be taken out of the film.despite its long runtime, imaginary heroes doesn't explore its many subplots as much as the individual stories deserve, while some of the movie's black comedy doesn't translate as well as writer/director dan harris may have liked. and the depiction of a disturbed family dynamic isn't depicted as strongly as the many other films out there with similar ideas. but despite some issues, the central performances from weaver and hirsch are stunning, and easily carry the film to its successfully subdued conclusion.rating: b-

as salinger's "a perfect day for bananafish" ends with the suicide of a prodigy, this movie opens with the death of the star high school swimmer legend, matt, who shoots himself in the head with a revolver after in the opening scene. but the death of matt travis serves as a key to unlock the door of another prodigy, his brother, tim who never in his life seriously bothered with the question, "what am i going to do?"when he finds his brother dead, his head broken like a dropped watermelon, the travis family starts vomiting out its secrets one by one. the film focuses on tim. he is a victim of bullying, domestic abuse, family alienation, heartbreak, issues of sexuality and friendship. tim reveals his wounds by physical bruises, but these are not the only injuries to his person, as we slowly come to realize, as the script painfully unveils the origins and outcome of tim scars. everyone who loves him hurts him. hirsch plays out the character quite well, revealing frame after frame in the visual expression of his body, a host of conflicting emotions inside the soul of a kid whom no one seems to listen to or know very well, unknowing and unaware of his depth of soul and prodigious talent. two siblings sharing a doobie, curled up on a red, spinnable playground saucer, tim asks penny, "what am i going to do with the rest of my life?" the scene is framed in a familiar, recurring image of the film: the comfortable playground where tim obviously feels at home, filmed from a bird's eye view, because with every character tim feels comfortable to share a part of himself, and we view these intimate moments he shares in the red, spinnable playground saucer, complete with childish graffiti carved in pencil, from above. after advising him curtly to pass the joint, penny tells him, "tim, well, the secret to the success of life is to find something you love. and you have to do that for the rest of your life  and you better hope to hell that you're good at it because if you're not then you'll probably fail." this simple line of advice from penny serves as the movie's central theme, the responsibility of talent and the possibility of failure. why does one person have a talent he cannot stand, like matt, who hated the attention his swimming fame brought, but no one notices tim's talent  no one  because no one bothers to ask him? not even us. the film makes us aware that we ourselves do not know tim as well as we thought we did when we first meet this handsome, sad, guy; in our intimate understanding of tim, as it progresses, we are reminded that not everyone is as they seem to be. this is the other side of the film, the failure of those who should  parents, friends, teachers  whoever  to notice and see the gifts of the people they claim to love. not even his mother sandy, played by sigourney weaver, sees tim's gift, despite her love for her son. weaver does a deft job of a middle-aged woman grappling with her own inner demons as she haphazardly tries to play the roles of domesticity and support. when tim is found to be bullied at school, she storms the boy's trailer, threatening his life, "you can tease, torture, punch, drive drunk with me, i can forgive you. hell i can understand it, i'm a good christian, you know, i can forgive and forget, but you mess with my kid and may god himself descend from heaven to protect you because as long as i live  and i will outlive you all  i will wake up and go to sleep at night just dreaming of ways to make your petty insignificant lives into hell on earth." after flicking a paper cup into the mother's face, she looks around the trailer, and looking at them both, the kid and his stunned mother, comments, "nice trailer" and leaves as quickly as she came. weaver scores in her ability to match gusto with visceral wit that is acid and witty. and tim's father, played by jeff daniels, is blind to who his son is, treating him like a stranger, not telling his family that he took time off from the office, spending his days in the city park, listless, a carved out soul, and sleeping in matt's bed, tucked in with his high school letter jacket. jeff daniels does a superb job of making us believe that he can be both a bastard and lovable because, we grow to see that even an inept father can show his love for his son. in an emotional scene, tim confronts his father. just when you think his dad is going to hit him, he grabs for him to embrace him. not letting him go, he tells tim, "i am your father and you're are my son and i'm here okay but you've gotta talk to me. i don't know how to do this by myself". it is here at this moment in the film that a father tells his son, you have to tell me what's going on inside of you, you have to tell me who you are; i want to know who you are. it is in this scene that the film reaches a cathartic moment, the visual movement from tim, angry and alone, to his father embracing him as he breaks downs and weeps, revealing the emotions hidden beneath his shell. tim experiences this moment of cleansing with his dad as a catharsis, especially when you consider the mistreatment, manipulation, disregard, violence and betrayal he has been dealt in the long year the film encompasses. i recommend this film.

it occurred to me while watching "imaginary heroes" that any screenwriter attempting to make a drama about family relationships should seriously consider killing off a kid or two in the opening reel as a way of getting his characters to open up and reveal themselves. there must be something to this storyline, for it seems as if every other family drama that comes down the pike uses this device in one form or another ("paradise" and "moonlight mile" are just two of the more recent examples that spring immediately to mind, although one could reach back to a golden oldie like "who's afraid of virginia woolf?" to make the point as well). it's not that the death of a child is an illegitimate subject for serious films to explore. far from it. it's just that, like any topic, it can be so overused that it becomes just another movie cliché, a convenient bit of narrative shorthand to get the ball rolling and to give the characters something to grapple with for the remainder of the time we get to spend with them.the latest such work is "imaginary heroes," a film that borrows heavily from what is one of the earliest and, perhaps, best known examples of the "family coping with the death of a child" genre, the academy award winning "ordinary people." like the characters in that earlier film, the travises seem, on the surface, to be the ideal suburban family, until, one fateful day, their oldest son, matt, who is the "golden boy" athlete and, thus, the apple of his father's eye, kills himself with no explanation (one minor difference is that the son in "ordinary people" dies as a result of an accident, not a suicide). it is matt's younger brother, tim, who winds up finding the body, and who assumes the role of protagonist in the film. each of the remaining family members copes with the tragedy in his or her own way. matt, who has always lived in the shadow of his older brother, becomes more and more estranged from the father who has virtually ignored him all his life and begins to turn to drugs for surcease. ben, the father, becomes swallowed up in feelings of remorse and guilt, turning away from both his job and his family. his wife, sandy, is the most complex character in the film, a free-spirited child of the '60's who feels oddly adrift in the role of mother and wife as she endures a basically loveless marriage in sterile suburbia. she spends most of her time after the tragedy trying to reconnect with her pot-smoking past.as written and directed by dan harris, "imaginary heroes" emerges as a wildly uneven film. for every scene that feels real and authentic, there is another that comes across as arbitrary and inauthentic. one sometimes has the sense that harris would like to cram every possible life situation he can think of into his screenplay, an admirable goal, perhaps, but one that makes the film unnecessarily melodramatic in the process. instead of identifying with the characters and being caught up in their plight, we often find ourselves thinking, "oh, come nowwhat next?" for teen suicide is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hot-button topics covered in this film; the screenplay also touches on drug and alcohol abuse, physical abuse, sexual identity conflict, life-threatening illness, even inadvertent gay incest. it is this "everything but the kitchen sink" mentality in the writing that robs the movie of much of the credibility it needs to really make us care.that is not to say that "imaginary heroes" is a bad or unrewarding film. much of what it has to say about familial relationships and values in the 21st century is insightful, original, pointed and profound. prime credit for its success goes to the actors, emile hirsch, sigourney weaver and jeff daniels, who deliver incisive, sensitive performances in their respective roles. it is they who triumph over the narrative excesses to stimulate our brains and touch our hearts. moreover, harris, in his direction, achieves an effectively melancholic tone throughout, but one that is frequently augmented by some badly-needed flashes of daring dark comedy."imaginary heroes" may appear unfocused and derivative at times, but its fine performances and subtle mood shifts make it a film worth watching.

the kinks warned about media heroes. outside the movies, most heroes are also "ordinary people." society demands some role playing, but what happens when that extends to the parent-child relationship? do some parents try to improve themselves through their children rather than vice versa? how do you provide a role-model but not a role? a brilliant swimmer who hates to swim; a brilliant musician who won't play. offbeat, funny (despite depiction of "serious" problems), very good multi-dimensional acting by everyone. lots of plot twists complement the emotional tension. celluloid heroes never feel any pain. i don't recall ever being disappointed in a sigourney weaver film (i even liked "the village"!).

it is hard to judge 'imaginary heroes' without referring to the fact that director and script writer dan harris is only 25. you can hardly believe seeing this film, which is not only a mature piece of work, professional and deep, but also with some of the defects of routine specific to older directors.the setting is the american suburb, too familiar from 'american beauty' or 'desperate housewives'. as in 'american beauty'the film turns around a suicide, but here it happens at the beginning of the movie, and we are left watching a mid-class family coping with the death of the gifted sportsman brother and son. emile hirsch plays the younger brother, sigourney weaver is the mother, both are excellent trying to cope with the loss, to find the reason and motivation to survive. harris drives his actors with a sure hand, and the first two sections of the film (there are four in total, as the seasons of the year) build a wonderful tension, with credible dilemmas and real questions. it is the second part of the film that disappoints slightly, it looks too tired and conventional, and i suspect that the producers may have interfered in the work of the young script-writer and director, trying to bring him closer to the hollywood convention. that's how this film fails to be a somber version of 'american beauty', with a different focus. i am sure however that we will hear a lot about dan harris in the coming years.

imaginary heroes is clearly the best film of the year. it was a complete and utter joy to watch. i was riveted. the whole audience up at the sunset five was riveted, when the film ended no one moved, spoke, nothing. i think this film is a perfect example of the of the power that drama has. especially in so much as it sets an example of the quality of drama/ work of this younger generation. there were moments in your film, many, like at least seven, where i was struck by such a great amount of beauty, emotional beauty, that i actually couldn't breathe for a while. and for a catharsis junkie like me, that's about the best censorial experience i could ask for. it is the result of powerful, masterful storytelling and direction. like heavyweight stuff, like burtolucci and those guys. each element of the film fit tightly together. there were no missteps at all. the cast was amazing. i have been a huge fan of emile's and ryan's for a long time, and i thought they have never been better. i was/am/will be continuously stunned by this film. and i promise i will drag every person i know to see it. it should be seen. it should win awards.

wow. when i went to this film at the toronto film festival i had no idea what i was in for. this movie takes you on an emotional roller-coaster in the best sense of the term. sigourney weaver was better than i've seen from her in years; emile hirsch was great and jeff daniels broke my heart. i can see how this won't be every person's cup of tea, as at times it deals with some pretty harsh things that can happen to a family. don't get me wrong -- it's really funny too -- at my screening the audience burst out in applause after laughing over and over again. i just think if you're open to examining your own life, imaginary heroes will sincerely touch you. i can't wait until it comes out in theaters.

this film is a powerful commentary on family life in north america today. the story is so well constructed, it almost feels like its happening across the street, right now! if you are connected with your family and community in any way, this film will grab you and transport you to the travis' home and not allow you to leave until the credits are done.our imaginary heroes, through a myriad of innocent circumstances, often unwittingly, lead us down a path of sorrow, confusion and isolation. the travis family, after a terrible tragedy, invite each of us; father, mother, brother and sister, into their respective lives to share their experience in a dynamic set of circumstances that just doesn't quit. we see all of the above and eventually the joy, in powerful performances by the major players and the rest of the cast, making this film a movie-goers absolute treasure.in a film so well done as this, it is usually difficult to to find something special, but sigourney weaver's portrayal of sandy travis was outstanding. i would be surprised if others didn't recognize it as such.clearly a 10. well done!

this film is chock-full of little surprises, many of them funny. the fact that it's written and directed by a 24-year old blows my mind. some of the scenes where the high school kids are using ecstasy made me very uncomfortable because i have a kid that age and i could picture her using it. as parent of a teen, i found the depictions of the parent-child interactions to be dead-on accurate.i enjoyed the film's many little jokes, and i enjoyed the fact that not everything made perfect sense and not all the issues were resolved by the end. to paraphrase mark twain, truth is stranger than fiction, because fiction is required to stick to that which is possible, while truth is not.this is a film which plays with the viewer, allowing us believe that people are what other people think they are, only to allow us later to realize that the folks we assumed were right were completely ignorant of the real situation. one of the film's strongest scenes, a scene about which we feel very relieved and sympathetic about what the character is doing, turns out to be based on a completely wrong assumption, and the character, while admirable, is totally wrong. it's very subtly done, i think. very realistic.i liked the score a lot -- i thought it really aided the film, really helped set the mood -- the film has a couple of screwball moments, and the background music helps establish that.the valedictorian speech is a hoot and a half -- got a big laugh! the movie is really in my head right now -- saw it this morning. will try to see it again, time allowing. tens are hard to come by, but a solid nine in my book.

saw this film when it was an entry in santa fe film festival. heavy film! depiction of a completely dysfunctional family taken to another level of the extreme, might have left me depressed to the extreme, had it not been for very funny sight gags and dialogue along the way which lightened the film's overall tone. the relatively "uplifting" ending gave hope for those affected by the initial tragedy. still, i did not walk out of the theatre ready to go to a fun party. the film stayed with me for several days.brought back memories of "ordinary people", but with humor mixed in with the tragedy. i thought the acting was excellent, especially by sigourney weaver and emile hirsh. how each character dealt with the tragedy was at times sad, self-defeating, but also at times hilarious. clever dialogue, and situations.

it's a shame that by garnering a restricted rating, perhaps the audience that would find this film the most useful won't likely see it.imaginary heroes follows the life of a teenager after his brothers' suicide. not, of course, the most original story in the world, however it does spend a great deal of time humanizing their parents, the 'imaginary heroes' that failed in their sons' eyes.for teenagers, who tend to put responsibility for their failures on their parents but yet refuse to accept any real responsibility on their own, the movie sends a powerful message, that in the end we all have our own troubles we need to deal with, and that we all make our own paths.but, unlike other movies that tend to urge youth independence, this one resolves the issues between parents and child, and they become a stronger unit for it. that the eldest child committed suicide is regrettable, but not overlooked later in the film, and the responsibility by all parties for the tragedy is thoroughly explained.although the subject matter has been covered before, it hasn't been covered quite this way -- the film pulls very little punches. now, why this earned it an r rating is confusing -- you're unlikely to get across to a teenager in this era without being realistic, but yet providing realism restricts that very audience.were my junior high-school class have been shown this film, two suicides may have been prevented. in this case, the censors seem to have exercised extremely poor judgment.8/10

this short was nominated for an academy award, losing to anna and bella. not since doctor strangelove has nuclear war been so hilarious! condie takes a situation and turns it on its ear and then gives it a spin for good measure. visual gags abound in condie's work and i always see something i missed before every time i watch this. on the world's greatest animation, well worth seeing for thisand many other shorts. recommended.

man am i stoked i can leave feedback for this 10 minutes romp. i love it.after not seeing it in years, i happened upon it the other day and watched it over and over.'stop shaking your eyes' and 'shake a rock and roll band' and 'stop sawing the table' are freaking classic lines.the art is delightfully raw. the dialog sparse and wonderful. just find it and love it. cannot recommend this enough.thank you high school art teacher mrs. kogan for showing us this over and over. thank you nfb for letting it be made. thank you mts for showing it (for free at the moment at least).i want a big snit t-shirt now. i'd love an animation cell, but at 440.00 a pop, that won't happen.find this flick, and watch it.

just went on youtube and finally watched this oscar-nominated animated short directed by richard condie. i had previously watched his funny getting started there. in this one, a couple are playing scrabble. the wife keeps shaking her eyes while her husband has nothing but e's on his side. the wife leaves for a while to vacuum her bed and bathtub(!) before catching her husband looking at her side. briefly before this, the husband catches a tv show called "sawing for teens" with the stars sawing something and the husband getting his own saw. that program gets interrupted by a special report of a nuclear war happening (the newsman is a skeleton here) as everyone panics outside though the husband fell asleep during this time and thinks a parade is going on as he and his wife continue arguing about the game...there's plenty of other bizarre things going on before the touching ending comes on. quite hilarious and well worth seeing for any animation buff out there. can't wait to see any more animated shorts from mr. condie...

this hugely entertaining short is considered one of the best shorts ever, and i certainly won't argue with that. even in a country where top-notch animated shorts are created with regularity, this film still manages to stand out. if you ever get the chance to view this film, please do so. it's only ten minutes long, and yet it contains a man who is obsessed with saws, a woman who vacuums the bathtub, and a nuclear war. what more could you want in a film?

this is a very strange little short film that initially didn't impress me. from a purely aesthetic point of view, the animation here certainly ain't pretty--though after a while you notice that the simple and silly drawings do possess a certain odd charm. that's probably because with the script as screwy as this one, the animation works.the film shows an older couple sitting at the table playing scrabble. at the same time they are fixated on this game or other bizarre pursuits (such as the husband's compulsion to saw things--even the chair and table)! and all of this stuff occurs as the television warns of pending atomic annihilation--armageddon is definitely here! naturally, the neighbors are screaming and running amok--during which time the couple obliviously continues with this idiotic game. heck, even their cat knows the end is coming as the couple begin bickering about who may or may not have cheated--leading to a very surreal ending indeed!! the film deserves kudos for both being unique as well as very funny. while it did not win the oscar, it was nominated for best animated short--which it richly deserved.

i have only seen this once--in 1986, at an "artsy" theater in minneapolis...but i remember it like i saw it a thousand times this morning. hilarious ("sawing for teens", playing scrabble with all "e" tiles), beautifully animated (taking off her eyes, shaking them back into position, then putting them back on), and poignant (the end of the world, the pettiness of a snit)...required viewing for the human race. calling this simply a cartoon is like calling the great gatsby nifty typing.

...the world may never know. (the film that did take the "best animated short" oscar that year, "anna and bella", is very good, but it's no "big snit". both are available on expanded entertainment's "world's greatest animation" compilation, in case you'd like to compare.)"snit" and its director, richard condie, have attracted so much attention that there's little for me to add. i'd like to note, however, that the film contains one of my very favorite single "shots" in an animated short, the one where the man opens the door to let the cat out. i don't want to give away the actual events depicted here, but the first time i saw the shot i was whipsawed from one mood to another, then seconds later to still another. that shot has never failed to affect me that way since. for this shot, and for the way condie builds up to that set of moments, "the big snit" deserves the tag of "masterpiece".

richard condie's utter maddness insanity cartoon 'the big snit', is a trip through qwerkyness, madness, hillarity, enjoyable backgrounds, melting characters, and a conclusion that nearly brings me to happy tears everytime i see it.this short i have seen over and over and over and i never tire of it (luckily having it on tape from a broadcast on tv)!! it never stops to make me burst out in laughter uncontrollably, and then reach down into the depths of my spirit, highlighting the greatness of the human condition. cause when someone says, 'come on, let's finish the game' everything is alright in the world and the troubles that we face everyday we suddenly realise are all petty fleeting things not to fight or worry about anymore. this film at first seems just like a simple exercise in cartoon slapstick humour, but it is far more than that. this film hits a greater sense of spiritual meaning with mankind in the wake when everything seems to be so bad and trivial. it is flawless... in every way. and damn funny too ;)rating 10 out of 10.

richard condie is a canadian marvel, and one that should be shared with the world. be it for gut-busting early work such as "getting started" and the oscar-nominated "snit" through "the apprentice" and the digitally made "la salla", condie is a treasured local hero. but no singular piece of work puts a stamp on his career quite like "the big snit". and did i mention it was nominated for an academy award? darn tootin'."the big snit", although clearly a dated message-bearer from the 1980s (the short revolves around cold war-esquire nuclear annihilation, but don't worry  it's hilarious as hell), carries with it a larger meaning, as is most of condie's work in an understated sort of way. while the planet scurries for cover from armageddon, a couple bickers over each others' annoying habits (in true condie fashion, he hacksaws the furniture while she shakes her eyes  literally). and don't forget to watch it again and again, 'cuz there's always something to look at. condie loads this fella up with countless visual gags and memorable catch-phrases.i strongly encourage this incredible piece of animation be tracked down. in canada it's usually spotted in a national film board video that includes other stellar shorts (including fellow winnipegger cordell barker's equally funny "the cat came back"). americans will just have to dig a little deeper, but keep at it  the reward is worth the toil.

this film is all about humans. this film stayed as my all time favorite short cartoon for years.isn't it the simplest things that make life so much more interesting?! we humans are so soft, compassionate, funny, caring to each other one moment -- we invent the most beautiful and amazing machines to kill as many people as possible with the least effort the next. in our short lives, we destroy our world, each other and often, our own lives, than spend the rest of our lives trying to fix what we've destroyed. sometimes, there is nothing left to fix!this film can entertain, educate and even help us realize what is wrong in our lives! life is short and can be even shorter! the ending is way too optimistic i am afraid.i love richard condie's mind and what he makes happen with it! enjoyh.k.

'the big snit' came into my life complete by accident and has left an indelible mark on my soul. a scar of love, destruction and pointlessness that will forever be a part of my life. this is tale of beautiful futility. we are helpless without each other. we are helpless against governmental wrong-doings. we are helpless as to the choices we all try to make when in love. deaf to the mutterings and goings on of an world outside the window. blind to an inevitable apocalypse. dumb of the hatred and greedy opinions of an over-indulgent society. this is a tale of personal commitment and triumphant love defeating the ideologies of war. their petty bickering is a sublime observation of human nature and of how love comes with it's pains and darkness everyone has some irritating aspect to their personality and this is observed by the makers in the most simplistic and fantastic way. we travel only a short distance with the two main characters but are left wanting to complete our own journeys with a some of their simple,loving, honest philosophy in tow. i am so very glad that i exist in this 'our time'. another 20 years either side of my birth date, and i would not have seen and felt.... ....the big snit. william white. sheffield.

this is a masterpiece. 'the big snit' is a crazy, weird, hilarious and eventually touching look at an old married couple and their quiet life, who argue over sawing and scrabble while a nuclear war rages on outside. everything in this great animated short stands out as memorable: the eye shaking of the wife, the vacuuming binge, the husband's saw fetish (keep an eye on those backgrounds!), the very verbal cat, the demented game show, the "informative" news anchor, the "beautiful" accordion serenade and the moving and memorable ending. i am so glad i found 'the big snit', which is hands down one of the greatest works of film ever produced.

if you are going to see this movie, by all means don't go into this movie with the expectation of this movie will be absolutely hilarious because you will be let down. yeah sure its funny at times but i would consider it a political thriller masqueraded as a comedy. the performances are very good especially by jeff goldblum as the head of the election company. even though he has limited screen time he makes a lasting impression. of course robin williams is excellent.laura linney is very good too what a surprise. she is one of the finest actresses in hollywood and one scene in particular shows this. this film makes you think. what if a comedian ran for president and actually won? would the country be better off or would the country shatter into a million pieces?

robin williams is a national treasure, specially when he cuts loose and puts aside his maudlin approach to drama. he manages to liven up the usual restrained pacing of barry levinson, and there are moments in this film when he truly shines.as the funny elected american president in "man of the year" williams recaptures the hilarity and outrageousness that used to be associated with him. what makes him so appealing is his humanity and likability. here is a man who can lash at his audience but truly loves them, too. his humour is like barbed wire, and yet it is cathartic. it is what makes him very appealing to the people in the film and in real life.laura linney is once again portraying an intelligent woman in distress. she is a fabulous and very talented performer, but i think she has boxed into a stereotype and unfortunately, it would have been more interesting to have a less recognizable performer in this case. walken pretty much walks through his thankless role, and the climatic scene in the snl skit barely floats above water.go in for a few hilarious moments, and those are priceless. enjoy williams and forget some of the deep moments that slow down this otherwise entertaining movie.

this was an interesting movie...half-comedy, half-political thriller. it had a lot of good elements, although it was a little predictable. robin williams stars as tom dobbs, a popular comedian with a hit show in which he gives political commentary. think daily show with john stuart. during the taping of one of his shows, a female in the audience tells him he should run for president. that, followed by a few jokes taken seriously, were all that was needed to get the ball rolling and start dobbs' political career. he runs independently, and opposes democrats and republicans equally. he is straightforward and honest, and becomes increasingly popular--but maybe not popular enough to actually win. he's clearly the underdog in this election. meanwhile, a corrupt software company has created a program to make voting much quicker and easier for the common people--but there is a glitch. the glitch is discovered by a young lady named elanor (linnley) who is appeased by the software developer with a lie that he fixed the glitch before the upcoming election. election day comes around, and lo and behold dobbs is declared the winner. (big surprise!) elanor knows that he is not really the president--he didn't win legitimately--she decides to tell the president...but complications arise. her company went as far as poisoning her in order to silence her. in addition to that, she quickly takes a liking to dobbs. the plot takes a few twists and turns, before reaching it's slightly predictable conclusion. but, it never got boring. robin was great as usual, and christopher walken often stole the show as dobbs' manager-turned-political-adviser and best friend. it's an entertaining film, and it has a good message. i recommend it if you're in the mood for dark satire, or something that makes you think. overall i give it a 7/10.

this movie reminds me of great movies that temporarily wake me up with the realization that the emperor is indeed naked. our election process is unclothed and dismal. my awareness is heightened and i want to see the world change. after a short while i am lulled back to my little complacency and "bubble life." in the best sense of film this work will ferment into an edible stew for me and like in "network" i want to be convicted to say'i'm as mad as hell, and i'm not going to take this anymore!' but to whom? my vigorous youthful idealism has been slowly reduced to concerned parent with quiet convictions or rather "beliefs." "man of the year" reveals how much i yearn for honest and sometimes humorous takes on our current political situation. dobbs' line " i did inhale because i thought 'what the hell,it's lit, it's in my hand, i'll inhale it.'" was refreshing or would've been when clinton was president. why can't politicians be honest and set that tone for debates? we people must realize how much veneer is being put forth as real? i am sick of this election process already,anyone else? let take off the veils and set an agenda for our elected officials and take them to task (not re-elect) when they continue with evasion and non-representation of citizenry. this movie can inspire us to increase our expectations of politicians that spew rhetoric. great film!

i went to see this thinking it would be a great comedy and a comeback for robin williams, but when i saw it i realized i had bee lied to by advertisers as this is more drama than comedy, although it has a few really good laughs in it. it felt like i was watching two movies. one was a funny romp with robin williams that should have been the whole basin for the movie anyway, but you also get a techno thriller movie with political angst in the middle. i really don't know how to classify this film. but i can tell you it was good and i did laugh, not as much as i had hoped, but at least williams is back in the right direction. see this but know before going it is not all comedy and is a little intense.

not every line in a comedy is funny. this movie takes a serious subject, the disenfranchisement of voters and holds it up to the light while telling jokes about it. it's the movie the daily show would have made if they wanted to turn it into a movie. i found robin williams to be much funnier in this movie than he was in rv. and while my wife and i share a few opposing political views, we were both doubled over in laughter for several parts of this movie. the script writers here could give fox news some lessons in fair and balanced. lewis black was okay for his part, but never really seemed to be able to bring out his particular brand of comedy for his role. christopher walken was also good, playing his fairly common subdued supporting role, pushing a story along.

robin williams shows his stand-up talents and boosts up his status as a comedian in this movie of "what's wrong-in american politics and how can hollywood try to make an influence without boring people". of course hollywood uses movies with hidden or not-so-hidden agendas. i think this movie is for people who likes stand-up and political discussion. and the trailers of this movie were for everybody just to make sure as many people as possible will see this. everybody knows hollywood is more liberal/democrat than the bush&co so they have to make these movies every now and then...but this one was perhaps too obvious, at least i thought so, for making any real change.still, great stand-up and fresh political issues and talks...i enjoyed it and thanks to imdb.com ratings i was positively surprised when i walked out from the movie theater, and yes, i laughed many times. sometimes you just have to let it go and forget all the seriousness....see this movie if you like good and clever stand-up or politics and you will not be offended by the several references of how things are not good right now. rent it if that doesn't match you.

this film is a great comedy drama. christopher walken is tremendous in his supporting role as manager, and his commentary will keep you laughing. robin williams plays a great role as a quick wit "jon stewart" and will amuse you if you are fans of comedy central. the show is good, because if the viewer has half-a-brain, they will see it as a very needed sub-cultural attack on the policies of the current republican government and a criticism on the american democratic process..., not to mention the means by which most politicians get elected.i was amused at the sub-plots and found the film to be very fast paced and entertaining, without any of the usual "oh-brother's" i would agree the film is less comedy than marketed, however, without question better than 90% of the garbage in theatres at present. just my thoughts...don

actually i'll admit i'm a political junkie, so this resonated with me, but the erratic nature of ms. green (yes i know what they did to her), but the ending was such a copout and totally inconsistent with the film itself.why can't barry l and crew just left us wondering what he was going to do? let us debate it.instead they have this "oh i'm not worthy" bullshit ending and it just shows that when the chips were down it's better to leave the table instead of doubling down. stop the disney ending and putting a bow on it. life isn't easy, they should have had the courage to give the main character some backbone.we had to listen to the rhetoric the entire movie... and then it turned sniveling and the stupid, inane behavior by ms. green (when the crap was out of her system) just made for a ridiculous near end of the movie that was icing on the cake.

this film was really different from what i had imagined but exceeded my expectations nevertheless. this film has the exactly right mixture of comedy, drama, political criticism and satire (not necessarily in that order). without being patronizing or wisenheimer it reveals the open and subtle problems of our capitalist democratic high technology society. it makes you laugh instantly and remain in thought afterwards. for those of you who liked "wag the dog" and wished to have humane and manlike politicians this film should definitely be the choice!"politicians are a lot like diapers: they should be changed frequently and for the same reasons."

over the years, i've come to be a fan of director/writer barry levinson and he didn't let me down with this very funny look at politics. popular tv comedian tom dobbs(robin williams)has enlightened the nation with his scathing jokes about the state of the country and elected politicians responsible. night after night, he has his fans rolling in the isles; then the question is proposed that dobbs run for president himself. his manager jack menken(christopher walken)says go for it. dobb's flippant truisms flames a grass-root movement that puts him on the ballot. comedian to president-elect. meanwhile, a young woman(laura linney)finds a flaw in the computer system that will count the ballots coast to coast. my favorite sequence is linney's meltdown in the coffee shop.williams is absolutely hysterical with his rapid quips. others of note in the cast: jeff goldblum, lewis black and rick roberts.

the movie is more of a mockumentary of corruption in the whole american system. the correlations of those who vote who do not matter is so proved in the machines that end of voting a comedian to the oval office. politicians are such a joke that we almost need a comic to represent us as we have been laughed at for years around the world. bushism's have become a way of life for americans and will be the only thing left after he leaves office none to soon. oddly the only person of honesty is someone not even elected to the position and tells the truth in the end. the story is very subtle and if you go to it for laughs, it ain't happening. leaves a lot for thought. overall i enjoyed it.

robin williams is a genius. one of the best comedians in the world. he really shows off in this one, cracking jokes left and right as the talk show comedian tom dobbs. from the previous this looked like it would be a side-splitting laugh fest. and it was funny. but there were a lot of serious parts in the movie that i was not expecting. i would describe it as a drama/comedy. but it's still worth the money to see, and i still found it to be almost everything that i expected. robin williams is at his best, along with the famous christopher walken. they play a very good team in this movie and i was actually shocked to see how well the two were able to work together. i recommend it to anyone who is looking for a light-hearted movie.

but george and gracie's are not among them. the movie is fun and the pool table scene with wc fields has to be among the funniest i have ever seen but gracie and george are more irritating than comical in their roles, partly from script deficiency and partly from their interpretation. i gave it a 7 out of 10 for the rest of the cast, wc is a treasure of comedic timing and energy in this one.

i watched six of a kind for w.c. fields - he's only in it for around 10 minutes and has one long scene, the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville, and several other great moments. the reamaining 55 minutes are also delightful, thankfully, mostly due to the hilarious charlie ruggles as the bumbling banker j. pinkham whinney. he is everyone's foil. he stutters and stumbles about to our pleasure. also, his comedy partner, mary boland plays his wife, flora. joining in the proceedings are george burns and gracie allen. boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end, but gracie and ruggles use up most of the picture. gracie's funny, quite, but she can also get tiring. and poor george burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat gracie all the time. i don't remember laughing at him once (although he has one great scene with ruggles, where ruggles tries desperately to get george to take gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while, and one with fields, where he asks fields to sell him a sweater; that bit is exclusively fields', though). the situation is constantly funny: the whinneys are going to drive to california, but to help them with expenses, george and gracie are recruited. 8/10.

three zany couples, all six of a kind, become entangled in a madcap search for stolen bank loot.this is a lively, hilarious comedy, with the six stars - charlie ruggles & mary boland, w. c. fields & alison skipworth, george burns & gracie allen - all heartily engaged in doing what they did best: getting laughs.ruggles & boland make another of their film appearances as husband & wife - this time rather more amorous than usual. they were a perfect team - she the strident lioness, he the nervous rabbit - and they dominate most of the screen time here. from beginning to end, they are a delight.burns & allen continue the patter they originated in vaudeville, perfected on radio & would eventually take to television, with george the perpetual straight man & gracie the eternal fool. at times in the film she tends to go a bit over the top, but it's difficult to dislike her. her heart was obviously made of solid gold.while skipworth is given rather short shrift - only fragments of her formidable personality flash through - fields is in his element as the disreputable sheriff of nuggetville, nevada. whether explaining how he got the nickname honest john' or skulking about at night looking for the missing moola, he is never less than wonderful. best of all, he gets to perform his entire classic pool routine, preserving it forever for a grateful posterity. finally, he executes the near miraculous - he gets gracie to shut up.paramount was so pleased with the success of six of a kind that they wanted to hurry the principle players into another comedy. only fields demurred. he felt he had now arrived at the point where he no longer needed to share a movie with other celebrity comics. the studio finally agreed and began preparation of fields' first solo starring feature, you're telling me (1934).

that was one of the lines in a trailer about this film and for once the publicists did not exaggerate. all six of the featured players here are on the screen 99% of the time, so they have to be good.it's always fascinating how certain plot premises can be worked for either highballing comedy to a deadly serious situation. mary boland of the ditzy and charlie ruggles of the henpecked play their usual characters who are planning to motor all the way to california. to share expenses they advertise for someone to share the ride. they get burns and allen and a monster of a dog. that same premise was a deadly serious one several generations later in kalifornia.of course if you're traveling with gracie allen you know you're going to be going absolutely nuts trying to figure her monty pythonesque reasoning about the whole world. and if that ain't enough you get to run into w.c. fields, part time sheriff and full time pool hustler who's living in sin with alison skipworth. but back then we didn't delve into such things.a real classic comedy from the thirties, not to be missed.

it is not always certain that by mixing comedians together you will produce laughter. the comics involved have to actually like or admire each other, or be willing to put up with each other's crankiness. go west with the marx brothers had buster keaton write the script as a gag man. groucho did not think too highly of keaton's ideas, and embarrassed him at a script meeting. and though some of keaton's gems still appear in the finished film (such as the gun that turns into a brush that turns into a gun) the film was one of the weakest the marx brothers ever made.a better film, but also affected by dueling comic egos, was w.c. fields and mae west in my little chickadee, which jettisoned the script for a series of duels of one liners between the leads. but the one liners were equally funny, so the film remains a success.but six of a kind is an example of six film comics who worked well together. the reason is simple: it is really three comic teams working together: charlie ruggles and mary boland, george burns and gracie allan, and w.c. fields and alison skipworth. ruggles and boland were paired in about half a dozen comedies during the 1930s, usually with boland as a somewhat bossy wife, and ruggles as a nervous wreck of a husband. fields (usually a single act) was paired three times with skipworth (tilly and gus and if i had a million were the other two times). skippy always figured out how to control or counter the larcenous activities of her man - it the present film she takes action into her own hands with the stolen money that is being searched for (she knows that the local sheriff, fields, is not the one to trust with this). as for burns and allan they manage to effortlessly involve themselves with the put upon ruggles and boland on their cross-country trip by car.ruggles quickly gets to realize what a mistake it was to agree to travel with gracie - at one point she manages to cause him to fall off a cliff, and dangle from a branch. he is relatively helpless when she insists on 1) photographing him on his perch, and 2) correcting his grammar. the presence of george and gracie's humongous dog ("ran tang tang" is it's name) does not make travel arrangements easier for charlie and mary.fields has some choice moments. when he insists on shouting at the quartet, he says he's allowed to do so - he's the sheriff! he also explains, during a pool game, the improbable story of how he got his undeserved moniker "honest john". you have to listen carefully to the tale, as it is interrupted with his attempts to play pool a few times (once getting accidentally beaned by a billiard ball), but it does show that there were items that even fields would have had no reason to steal.oh, in the "summary line", i mentioned a forgotten actor named bradley page - he was the man who is responsible for the trouble that charley ruggles is suspected of. bradley has to have a reason to leave town in order to catch up with the unwary ruggles and boland, so he telephones his girl friend. he tells her to call back his job and say that he has to leave town because somebody has died. there is a pause as he apparently hears a question shot back by the girlfriend. "anybody!", he says - clearly annoyed. although the bulk of the humor in the film is carried by the sextet of performers, mr.page happened to have the most amusingly unexpected line in the film.

michelle pfeiffer stars as a mob widow who seeks a normal life but has her hands full with the new boss and an undercover agent. a lighthearted demme film with some good laughs and pfeiffer in a comical role that she has fun with..on a scale of one to ten..8

nicely done evil little comedy pitting the fbi against organized crime with a nice lady caught in the middle. the actress who played the jealous wife of the mob boss 'tony the tiger' almost stole the show with her raging tantrums. 3 stars

strange but acceptable mob comedy that has an undercover fbi agent (matthew modine) flirting with a mobster's concerned widow (michelle pfeffier) to tie two murders on a elusive mob boss (dean stockwell).the movie shows that it doesn't have to go over the top just to be funny and director jonathan demme ("the silence of the lambs", "philadelphia") keeps the movie from looking like it being was restrained. that's good and it avoids being predictiable, too.

i'm surprised with the amount of negative reviews on this film. if you don't like this movie for what it is - a silly, over-the-top, mob story - then you are simply reading too much into it. this film is a classic tale of a mob wife trying to escape "the life" and the troubles that follow her. michelle pfeiffer is terrificly 80's 'jersey, who is an uncertain, uncomfortable mob wife while matthew modine is an anal retentive-like mob tracking cop who falls for her. the plot is mostly predictable and cutesy and mercedes ruel steals the show as the queen of mob wives. if you aren't looking for something too dynamic and complex, this movie is absolutely entertaining and an 80's cult classic. you won't be able to stop watching if you start.

i can't even begin to imagine why everyone hates this movie so much. it had me literally crying with laughter several times ("i trust you slept well?" "actually, we had a bit of a rough night." "ah, the perils of adultery.").admittedly, the ending is a little flat, but still has its moments (the booger ball's obvious fake spalsh as flew into the ocean, "beach house paradiso").personally, i think this is the funniest movie i've ever seen.10/10

i cant see how some people cant find this film funny i saw the end of it on sky movies in 2001 thought i would by the dvd since then i have laughed my balls of with lines like rik mayalls laugh "hahahahahahaha" and eddies "hello night porter" when they never get any phone calls overall i think this film is very very funny.

my god, this is funny stuff. yes, it's puerile in the extreme, but also rather witty ("here's the page with all the wines on it." "it's a little early for us, i'm afraid." "well, what are you doing up then?") and the fight sequences are second to none. despite what you may have heard, the laughs *do* keep coming, and at a surprisingly generous rate. the sheer comic abilities of rik mayall and adrian edmondson help keep it riotously funny. wringing every drop of comedy from the script. i can only compare it to "fear and loathing in las vegas" - you either find that film hysterical throughout or not at all; the same applies here. it's probably the funniest british film since "withnail and i", but to say it's an acquired taste is something of a gross (sic) understatement.

i own this movie on dvd and i have watched it about 10 times and it's still funny. the jokes will never get boring and i often burst out laughing at inappropriate times just thinking about them. the premise is that richard and eddie of bottom fame own the cheapest hotel in britain next to a nuclear power plant. they are desperately in need of cash and when a film star in hiding comes to stay their luck just might be in.to watch this movie and not become utterly bored or disgusted you first need to like the humour. some would say that only hardcore fans really enjoy watching it. but overall it's a great movie.

this is a gem of a film, slapstick violence a-plenty, simon pegg and green spew.a suspicious looking power plant and an incontrollable motorbike add to this stonker. if you haven't seen this i can highly recommend it, maybe not quite as good as bottom but not far short.if you have never seen a man impaled by the nose on two hooks then what are you waiting for buy this film.i didn't even see the twist at the end coming when it turns out that ritchie and eddie are both ghosts.feeb - 1 boiled egg.

okay, this may not be the most sophisticated movie you'll ever see. actually, there isn't a bit of "sophisticatedlyness"* in it. it's puerile, adolescent, inoffensive, idiotic..and utterly hilarious. basically, richie and eddie run the worst hotel in britain. cue some ridiculous antics with the guests while they beat each other up, try to get the rent money out of the only resident who is daft enough to stay, have an all night drinking binge with the boys from the power plant next door...and fall in lust with the beautiful actress who comes to stay to avoid the press. give it a try if you're a fan of rik and ade and their work. if you're not...don't get the movie. simple as that.*i'm not being thick, this is a word from another one of rik's fab jaunts into the movie world ^_^

bottom has been my favourite sitcom ever since i saw it on t.v and the movie is even better if your a bottom fan i say this is a must buy!!! the plot is that eddie and ritchie run a hotel named guest house paradise but not all goes right for them as customers leave until a famous actress come to stay they try there best to impress her but not all well go right this is a upbringing to british cinema so buy this and you will wet yourself with laughter. also starring simon peggi (shaun of the dead) and also bill neigh (love actually) it might of not done good in the box office or by the looks of it on this website but don't listen to them buy this and i swear you will love it

i had been looking for this film for so long before i found it, i had seen it when i was younger and loved it, after my second viewing i still loved it and i still do.this is a love/hate film, if you like bottom, young ones, the comic strip, then you will find this funny. if you don't like that kind of humour then don't bother. i love this film and have grown up with these comedy programmes, for me this film is simply placing their comic genius on the big screen.. it is not an award winner by any means but if you just want good wholesome slapstick then this is it!the film lacks the quality of the tv series and this is usually the case with films but it still has enough material to keep you laughing even if a lot of the jokes are pretty similar to their previous work.yes, the humour is a little childish and not to everyone's taste but sometimes you just need that in a film.

this zany film rivals the ghost and mr. chicken as one of don knott's finest film performances. knotts is an accountant for a podunk city hall that is good for swindling the citizens. they fire the "three competent bookkeepers and keep the dumb one" (knotts of course is the dumb one). when his garbage collecting cohort accidentally empties the wrong trash can, knotts finds himself wrapped up in a bizarre trap set by the city council for him. funny moments in the movie include the bowling alley restroom scene, and the cemetery scene is absolutely hilarious. typical knotts, the nervous ninny act is well used, and as usual he is surrounded by lots of crazy character actors from the sixties. such actors as frank welker, and pitt herbert add to the mayhem. as one may expect knotts's armed with a big car, a pretty girl, and no real clue of what he's doing. fun for anyone, especially nostalgia buffs, but just about anyone will love it.

a good documentary reviewing the background behind our societies oil addiction, the problem concerning our present energy usage and finally discusses the effects of the coming energy deficit originating from the peak oil production problem.this movie should be educated to all students as part of their education. show it to your children, parents, relatives and friends. they will thank you eventually.after reviewing the contents of this documentary and comparing its mentioned sources i would say that the facts in this movie are well scientifically supported.

i'm giving this film 9 out of 10 only because there aren't enough specific scientific references to the amount of energy it takes to produce food to satisfy the science haters. mdixon seems to believe the admittedly biased commentators are making this stuff up, but even an elementary understanding of resources and the laws of thermodynamics will indicate that at the very least, they are on solid scientific ground when they state that we cannot continue to depend on oil, we must transition to different types of energy, and do not have a plan that will replace the amount of energy we get from oil. other civilizations have refused to face the facts of life, and have perished. read jared diamond's "collapse" which is a popular book, or any elementary ecology or earth science textbook and you can verify the basic premise of this movie. go ahead, fiddle while rome burns!

i have been most fortunate this year to have seen several films at my university's art museum. on occasion, well, more like half of the time, i am unable to watch the films there. i have systematically attempted to view each of the films that i have missed. so far plagues and pleasures on the salton sea and who killed the electric car? are the other films that i have had to watch this way. the film covers an intriguing subject matter and is well-theorized (emphasis on this later) but not as successful as plagues and pleasures, but far superior to electric car. the film's thesis concern's the future of the american concept of suburban living. it questions the feasibility of such a practice as oil prices rise. so, the film discusses the origin of the suburb, and it's evolution until the early 2000s. one theme the film discusses at length is the alienation the suburb creates among its inhabitants. while several people may live together, they do not "know" each other as we define the word. this, to me, represents the strength of the film: its appeal to actual human emotion. we are able to understand the filmmakers' argument so much easier because they do not have to convince us of their argument's legitimacy. this is also one of the reasons salton sea is such a wonderful documentary. unfortunately, suburbia loses its message in firebrand explanation in support of its central argument. as those interviewed speak, their arguments become progressively more akin to those made by militant environmentalists. we are told that oil production will hit its peak in this decade, but are given no scientific evidence (professional reports, statistics, graphs, etc) in support of this claim. we are given little information as to how this date was calculated. fortunately, this was the only significant flaw that i was able to detect in the film's argument yet it's a glaring one nevertheless. another less-important discrepancy i noticed was the liberal (political) bias which could polarize some viewers. however, this bias is revealed thorough clips of various events and not the filmmakers themselves. the clips, especially those from the 1950's, seemed a tad unnecessary to me. the film was no better with their presence, and would have been more concise in their absence. as i thought more of this film before composing this review, i thought about why i found its argument more convincing than other documentaries that i'd recently viewed. finally, i realized that the filmmakers actually offered analysis to the suburban problem. they propose a decentralized village-system where pockets of people would live together. they posit this practice would lower the necessity for fossil fuels and reduce wasted space. they define wasted space as the long stretches of parking lots between shopping areas, for instance. what is incredible about this supposition is that it's actually conceivable. most documentaries vaguely state that some problem should be ended but offer no method of doing so. thinking more about the film, i decided that this analysis is what saved the film for me and why i give it a favorable review. while neither perfectly convincing nor fluid in presentation, the end of suburbia is a worthwhile investment of one's time. it not only addresses the contemporary problem of sprawl, but it also provides realistic insight on how to amend it. the audience can also enjoy the high production value with various clips from the 1950's spliced with the modern arguers. people living in atlanta, georgia or the triad region of north carolina will particularly enjoy this documentary as sprawl is the most established there.

the end of suburbia (teos) is a very useful film. it's also important and provocative. there seems to be no middle ground with either the film or its main source of entertainment, the anti-sprawl meister, james howard kunstler. while i am not a big fan of the new urbanism, my criticism of it is because of its small vision. in the case of new urbanist peter calthorpe - another talking head - you finally hear what's somewhat obvious in and amongst the special added teos out-takes... calthorpe just doesn't understand peak oil. i've used this as a teaching tool in economics classes to get at the importance of land as a factor of production - a fact long diminished by neoclassical economics - and also as a vehicle for educating about: peak oil, our wastrel land use, global warming, our threatened food production, public transit our compromised futuremove over south park! .... made by canadians from toronto for $25,000 and released in may 2004, this video sold over 24,000 copies by october 2005. one major dvd rental vendor recently ordered almost 400 more copies.the end of suburbia sales were actually climbing 1 1/2 years after its release and it has also been available on one of the major online video services since september 2005.a sequel, escape from suburbia, is in the works with a possible release by august 2006.

okay, so i've read most of the reviews on this movie, as well as comments left by visitors to this site, and the feeling i get is that most people who wrote reviews really didn't like this movie. that's why i'm writing now-i represent the minority because, i did. i admit, i went to see the movie because i am very impressed with ryan gosling's compelling abilities, and the projects he has been a part of lately have been nothing less than incredible. he is an amazing actor. that aside, i wanted to see this movie because it seemed intriguing to me... why? because it's a whodunit where you know `whodunit' from the start, and that's kind of unusual.as the plot goes, two teenage boys endeavour to commit the "perfect crime" because they believe in a twisted philosophy that only through committing acts of crime are human beings truly free-the uninhibited, and let's remember, guiltless, acting out of one's will. the relationship between richard and justin was complex, hinted at homosexuality, and was brilliantly acted by ryan gosling and michael pitt. gosling was the manipulating, controlling smooth-talker, and pitt was the extremely book-smart, socially awkward outcast. enter sandra bullock's character, who it seems most people didn't particularly appreciate. i think when people see she was the executive producer they automatically assume any role the actor has in it is a self-glorification thing. i didn't see that as the case here. without "cassie's" personal history about the ex-husband that nearly killed her, who, not surprisingly, shared similar traits with richard hayward, she never would have pursued her instincts about justin and richard. the case was seemingly airtight against ray, the unsuspecting school janitor and friend of the boys. even when the boys are questioned near the end of the movie neither bullock nor her partner have much solid evidence about them other than the fact that they lied about knowing each other, and the vomit justin left at the sight. therein lay the genius of the movie because the philosophy the boys were trying to prove through the act of killing, the guiltless acting out of will as `true freedom,' ended up working against justin, who ended up having a conscience after all (and ended up leaving part of his conscience at the body dump site). without that crucial piece of evidence, they almost had a "murder by numbers." and to readers out there who have puzzled over the title as much as i have, i looked in to it and found that something done "by numbers" (such as a painting) suggests careful and critical planning and exacting. there's also a song by sting called "murder by numbers", but that's beside the point. :)many readers questioned the necessity of the relationship between cassie and her partner, but i think it really meant to show how cynical and manipulative she had become because of her history. like it or not, her history does play an important role in this movie because without it, she would likely have never followed her instincts about justin and richard. yes, it was a bit of the cliche `women scorned, woman acting out vendetta in every facet of her life' plot, but i think without the depth of cassie's character you have just another movie about teenage killers, and they just may have gotten away with it. there's no movie there.and to the reader who commented that the teenagers obviously didn't commit the perfect crime because the police were on to them from the beginning, can i remind you that the reason was because of the purposely placed, and totally traceable shoe prints. the boys wanted to be involved-it was a game. they were so confident that they had committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see first hand the difficulty the investigators would have in uncovering what they think is the truth. what they didn't expect was that cassie mayweather had an overactive case of instinct working on her side. a little unbelievable? maybe. but many crimes have been solved by police officers who have followed their instincts. however, this is a movie!i saw this movie in theatres about three times, and each time it revealed a little more to me, and i liked it a little more. the more i watched it, the more i was captivated and frightened by the psychological depth richard hayward-there are people really like this. my main complaint about the movie would be that they should have had justin and richard's interactions a little more central (because, let's face it, there lays the intrigue in the entire film) and my main props go to characterization-each character was very distinct and interesting in his/her own way. it was very well acted, although i would have given ben chaplin's character a little more depth to work with (he's a good actor) and maybe pared down bullock's character a smidgen.i think everyone should keep in mind that for a hitchcock type thriller like this to basically tell you the "whodunit" at the beginning, it poses a very big challenge for the writers to keep the attention of the audience until the very end. i think they did so quite well by utilizing a few small plot twists throughout, slow revelation of the different character dynamics, and by lighting up the screen with some really emotionally charged performances by the young actors ryan gosling and michael pitt. i think if we remove our innate cynicism and attempt to see how psychologically complex the characters and their interactions are, we may be able to look beyond any apparent plot holes and see the real texture and quality of this movie, if only in the characters who were brilliantly portrayed. especially richard hayward. not that i'm biassed. :)

i liked this movie. unlike other thrillers you learn to know the killers very well. you also get to know the two detectives hunting them. the killers are two high school kids. they are very intelligent and want to prove they are smarter than the police so they plan the "perfect crime". we all know this crime will not turn out perfect. what we don't know is if they will be caught, or may be just one of them, or even none. in a way i kind of hoped they both would get away with it, although i don't know if this was the movies intention.the story is told in a nice way. you are starting to get to know the people involved. the character of sandra bullock is likable but has her own secret, which works against her. ben chaplin is pretty good as sam and the two kids are both great. the scenes between them are the better scenes in the movie.i think you can say the movie is pretty good and not as predictable you would think. for a nice evening with a movie, 'murder by numbers' is a good one.

not bad but could be loads better, also seems to follow a staple diet for crime drama. you've got sandra bullock as the cop who finds it difficult to work with others, you've got her placed with a new partner. there's a closed case but a cop who works on it anyway, and there's so many corney lines in the film it makes you want to scream.however, if you can look past the formulaic elements there is a good film hiding underneath. it's gripping and the subplots worked for me. well worth a rent but maybe not a purchase.

this thriller has so many twists and turns it had me on the edge of my seat. i saw it on video, some of the landscape at "the bluff" might have been a bit more spectacular on the big screen. cast has sandra bullock, ben chaplin (from "the truth about cats & dogs"), michael pitt (henry parker in "dawson's creek") and ryan gosling (???).

this multi-leveled thriller kept my attention throughout. it is disturbing and informative to see how perverse human behavior can be. it is also instructive as to what past wounds can motivate present behavior. no one, save sandra bullock's partner, is very likable. however, all are believable. sandra did an excellent job. her character, cassie, comes alive with all her pain and fear and defenses. she is a survivor and so her life experience finally brings her to a healing moment. i enjoyed this movie very much. tom landers

this is an excellent, suspenseful, murder-mystery movie. not only was the plot full of suspense and intrigue but you get to see gorgeous ryan gosling for a couple hours, what's not to love! also, sandra bullock is good in this movie - i've always been a fan of hers, (i just wish she hadn't decided to be in "the lake house" which was horrible, but that's another story altogether). obviously since there are thousands of other murder/horror movies out there, there are bound to be similarities between them, no need to bash this movie for having some similarities to at least a few that have already been made. anyway, this is a great movie for those of you that actually enjoy "scary" movies, it's a little dark and twisted but overall a great movie!!!

cassie (sandra bullock) is a hyper-serious police detective. as an ex-boyfriend once tried to kill her and, indeed, left her grievously wounded, she is determined to bring those who harm others to justice. as the result of her near-death experience, also, cassie favors one-night stands and trusts no one. one day, a woman is found dead in the woods near cassie's community. she has been murdered heinously, beaten severely and left to die alone. naturally, cassie will stop at nothing to find the murderers. assigned to help her is fellow officer, sam (ben chaplin). he soon discovers cassie's relentless attitude and all-consuming instincts when she asks him to pick up a sample of vomit that has been left at the scene for analysis, among other actions. the trail soon leads them to two high school students, richard (ryan gosling) and justin (michael pitt). could these teenagers really be responsible for the planning and execution of the perfect "joy" killing? this is an intriguing film, but viewers should be warned that the subject matter is grim indeed. killing for the "sport" of it is seldom the topic of films that are of the "all sweetness and light" variety and this one is no different. that said, the cast is great. bullock, without a hint of her talent for comedy, is terrific as the police officer whose own past compels her to lock up the evil folks of the world. chaplin, too, is quite nice as the detective who is both attracted and repelled by the forceful cassie. as for gosling, he gives a most memorable performance as a brilliant mind with a satanic soul. the production values for the movie are good, too, with appropriately fine costumes, settings and photography. if you are a fan of bullock's looking for a laugh, this is not the one for you. but, if you adore mysteries, even those with the grimmest of plots, you will find this tale enthralling.

now, i know that sandra bullock produced this film, but she needs to learn that sometimes you need to make certain sacrifices in order to advance the story...like not trying to make the whole movie about her character!the story is about two high school students (one rich and popular, the other smart and anti-social) who formulate a plan to commit murder and follow it by the number...just to see if they can get away with it. enter sandra bullock and ben chaplin as detectives trying to solve the case. the boys have planted evidence, created alibis, and cleaned up after themselves so well that the cops fall for the whole act. but sandra has a feeling that all is not as it appears to be.this movie could have been a great little hitchcock-style thriller, but the movie spends too much time on getting to know sandra's character rather than focusing on the actual crime itself. you see, something happened in her past that keeps haunting her throughout the film. and we get to know all about it...all about it. it just gets rather tedious after a while, especially when you are right in the middle of an intriguing murder investigation and then have to stop that investigation to hear about what happened to her in the past.ryan gosling and michael pitt are the real winners in this movie. they play their characters convincingly and with just the right amount of malice. if the script had spent more time focusing on these characters, and kept the detectives there to just do their jobs, this could have been an immensely entertaining thriller. with the way it is, most of the thrill is lost. they should have cut out all the stuff with sandra's character and made that a separate tv movie for the lifetime channel. but, i digress. it's still an entertaining movie, nonetheless. i do recommend this movie...but wait for the video/dvd.

i knew little of this movie when i entered the theatre for an advance screening. i gathered from the ads that it was a thriller.what we have is like "compulsion" meets "matlock". two teens decide to commit a perfect murder. a victim is selected at random and then carefully executed so that no traces of the actual murderers is found. then a bunch of false leads are planted that point to an innocent bystander. (innocent of the murder anyway)enter sondra bullock as the investigating officer. (imdb says that she's fbi, but i don't remember that. i thought that she was a regular cop) she's frustrated by the inconsistency of the killers profile ("the profile doesn't fit the profile!") and by the power and influence of the father of one of the boys.she's also has demons of her own which figure prominently in her decicision to become a cop. but this is the only character that is really more than one-dimensional. all others are pretty flat.for a thriller, there are really no big thrills. it's mostly a cat-and-mouse game like an episode of "matlock" (which she's watching at one point in the film). the twist is that there are two involved in the killing. just who is the real murderer, justin or richard? it'll cost you eight bucks to find out.

murder by numbers is a pretty good movie. even though the plot rolls along at a snail's pace, what with sandra bullock's character getting all mixed up with her partner and the movie flashing back to a previous trauma situation she had been in, it does succeed in keeping the viewer involved in the film.having said that, i do think that it does a good job in setting that eerie sort of "who done it" type atmosphere. it keeps you guessing at which one of the boys really was behind the murder, if not both of them. i think ryan gosling and that other kid (lol) do a good job of selling that bully versus dork relationship. not sure about gosling playing a bad-ass, but for a guy who would later star in a movie like the notebook, he did a pretty good job. once the movie gets rolling, though, i really found myself involved in the story, sort of asking myself, "oh my god, what would i do if i were in that situation?" like i said, a good csi type movie, maybe not for the extreme crime drama movie junkie, but a good all around flick.8 outta 10

i can get very tired of murder mysteries with the exception of a few really excellent tv series. otherwise, there are just too many of these murder plot themes. i don't like the theme of the two over-clever, selfish youths killing as an intellectual exercise, i've no interest whatsoever in hitchcock who appears to have been associated with this in some way i don't intend to find out about. but don't misunderstand me, the theme is in itself excellent, the whole movie is so well done, and of course sandra bullock is superlative as always. sandra's character is (as in miss congeniality) not rated by the male team she works with in spite of her obvious skills, and the boss mostly ignores her ideas, eventually forcing her aside and giving the case to her male partner. of course sandra works out what's going on and nearly gets killed in a very dramatic denouement. it's intriguing how the boy who worked out the murder plot can't allow her to be killed by his colleague - he has a conscience of some sort and perhaps could be "saved, while the other is a true psychopath.sandra's hard shell is caused by misery in her past that's tied in poignantly with the murder case. her colleague, realising that sandra's solving this case in spite of being balked by the dense superior, finally discovers what happened to sandra herself in her teens, that she must now face up to and exorcise and the last scene shows her starting - we hope anyway - to do just that. i can see from the few other reviews i've had time to read that this movie would attract a broadish group - those interested in the two spoilt boys whiling away their time with their grisly philosophical determination to trick the police and get away with the perfect murder, the relationship between them that's so cleverly depicted, the ghastly links to the heroine's past, a police theme, and some smokes and mirrors - as well as for hitchcock fans.for those who've queried why bullock's character has to have a problematic past, really i think this would be a far less interesting movie if she had been just a detective trying to fathom what was going on, with a willing sidekick helping out and a male-chauvinist boss. the link between the murder victim and the detective is necessary to show the detective becoming too involved or otherwise how would she lose her arrogant boss's confidence and thereby nearly lose her life? that's hardly an original theme, in fact it's usually an extremely irritating theme as this male chauvinist boss brutally tells his frustrated but obviously inspired operative to get off the case and leave it to someone who clearly doesn't have quite the skills to solve it nice though the sidekick is. i was getting very worried towards the end re what might happen to sandra's character as her emotional involvement in the case and special sympathy for the unfortunate victim of the crime dangerously drove her on with this case by herself.i wasn't disappointed re the relationship between bullock's character and her sidekick. that goes along interestingly and at times very poignantly.the relationship between the two boys is definitely intriguing, if that's what you were interested in watching. i felt it was kept low key in some ways either because the movie-makers didn't want to get into boy-boy friendships too much, or because we weren't supposed to think emotion ruled their relationship. the movie cleverly makes you wonder which boy's in charge of the situation and there are some twists and turns and the boys show their underlying immaturity at various stages.there one thing i wish had been clarified and that's what happens "after the movie ends" when sandra's character arrives at the court.... you need to see to movie to know why she's there.very well acted by all. i certainly can't agree with those who complained against bullock's acting - she was superb. the part suited her very well indeed. the story is gripping even if murder mysteries aren't your thing and they aren't that often mine.

this one is about a homicide detective who battles a couple of young rich kids who have nothing better to do than plan an intricate murder and cover it up, they seem to outwit the police force seemingly at will. they taunt the detective by planting clues and leading them off on a wild goose chase. this one has a decent plot with a few good twists at the end of the movie, sandra bullock does a fine job in this one as a woman on the edge, not sure of herself and battling her inner demons, she can't seem to keep a man in her life, especially partners, they seem to keep leaving her for some reason. altogether this isn't a bad film, it keeps you guessing all the way the very shocking ending.

a bunch of full-length movies featuring the muppets, created by jim henson & co, have been made, but "the muppet movie" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features "the great muppet caper" and "the muppets take manhattan". it was released seven years before i was born, so i obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did i get to see its two successors when they were first released). however, i saw a lot of the muppets during my childhood, mostly after henson's premature death in 1990. i finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack. unsurprisingly, i liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.one day, while kermit the frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing "rainbow connection", a hollywood agent named bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in tinseltown. kermit takes his advice and goes west. he soon meets fozzie bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along. the frog is also noticed by doc hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants kermit to be his mascot. as a frog, kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with fozzie. on their road trip across the country, kermit and fozzie meet other muppets who join them, including miss piggy (who soon becomes kermit's love interest) and gonzo. unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to hollywood, doc hopper, assisted by max, is willing to do anything to force kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so kermit finds himself in increasing danger! one thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and i can understand why. there is, of course, the oscar-nominated "rainbow connection" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as kermit and fozzie's catchy road song, "movin' right along", and "i'm going to go back there someday", a poignant ballad sung by gonzo. "never before, never again", the song miss piggy sings when she first sees kermit, is the only one i would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden. the muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on tv, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them. some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as dom deluise as bernie the agent and steve martin as the "insolent waiter." also, it's not 100% comedy. there are serious parts of the film which they also did well.watching this original muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing "muppets from space" (one of the muppet movies made after henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year. i was very disappointed when i saw that film, which had never happened before when i watched any film or tv show featuring the popular puppet characters! not only is that movie not very funny, i also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the muppets, as i stated in my review of it! however, i can't say i think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier. "the muppet movie" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable. i highly doubt there's much left to say about "the muppet movie" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment.

i have always loved the muppets. though most children's entertainment then wasn't that likable, the muppet's was. the muppet's are very, very funny. they are probably the most likable children's characters ever. not only did the muppets have their own show. they also have starred in many films. from the muppet's christmas carol to the muppet's treasure island. the first muppet's movie, the muppet movie, was also, like the show and the other films, excellent.the muppet movie is about how they all got started. kermit the frog used to live in a swamp. until one day a movie executive tells him that there are auditions for frogs in hollywood. so kermit takes off for hollywood. along the way he runs into lots of people such as fozzie bear, gonzo the great, and miss piggy. also, an evil man is trying to capture kermit.all of the muppet films are highly enjoyable. i mean they are all very funny. this film has many film appearances. such as steve martin, mel brooks, elliot gould, carol kane, richard pryor, and orson welles. the muppet films are all very enjoyable. i hear that jason segel is going to star in one soon. i can't wait to see it.

i have not seen this movie since 1979 when i was a teenager. i grew up with the sesame street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing these characters to life. jim hensen was a genius and master muppeteer. when i watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when i was younger and things seemed so much simpler. for this bit of time travel i rate this movie a 10.the plot line explores how kermit goes from the swamp to hollywood. the laughs and gags are classic muppetism. i am glad these films are still around for the next generation. i hope i never out grow the magic of the muppets.

this film is one of my fondest childhood memories. seeing the muppets (at the height of their popularity) heading hollywood, singing and dancing, with miss piggy googely-eying her beloved kermit, fozzie bear doing his best as everyone's manager, and a generous cast of "extras" delivering a film that turned out to be "okey dokey".kermit's melancholy ukulele number "rainbow connection" was nominated for an oscar that year, but was beat out by norma rae's "it goes like it goes". i'll pick kermit's song any day! get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasy...someday they'll find it, the rainbow connections, the lovers, the dreamers and me!

the first feature length muppet movie, and excepting maybe the muppet christmas carol, the movie puppeteers the world over are still looking for as a guide. disney has done the muppets a dis-service and this movie proves it over and over again. featuring classic comedians and guest star cameos, keeps to a simple but original plot, classic muppet lame jokes, paul williams genius in song writing, and electric mayhem madness, and comes off with an amazing movie especially when you realize that the major cast are puppets. only croft has come close to hensen's genius with puppets. half of the fun today is playing is that cameo actor/actress still alive???? i can only hope frank oz and dave goelz and the rest of the surviving muppeteers can somehow rescue and revive kermit and company from the deadly grasp of disney.

who doesn't love the muppets?! impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm, fuzzy feeling inside. so, i guess what's important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special. i don't remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film i recall quite fondly. in fact, there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self-conscious in any bad way. refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique; the "magic" transcends all that other stuff. 'tis indeed what movies are made of.so, how does the film achieve these things? hmmm, nice question! stumped am i? let's see. really, i feel like it's quite simple. the filmmakers believe in their material and don't take themselves too seriously in the process. i probably wouldn't say the film has many truly inspired moments, but it does have a certain life to it (that funnily enough a great many "real people" movies lack). a zest. you really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures. they also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearing.generally i get the impression that the people that made the movie just weren't afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel. kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session. lots of talent, little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through. the cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance. maybe i don't feel i have much to say about it because i was half-asleep when i saw it (and/or as i write this review). anyway, i'm sort of semi-repeating myself here but i really liked the sense of family the movie had. full of love i suppose you might say. again, a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly.and to repeat myself once more, one of the film's best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. like the nathaniel hawthorne quote about happiness being (like) a butterfly, so the muppet movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so. same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that. anyway, if that sounds sappy, i also reckon it was pretty hilarious.so, all in all, this movie was very funny, touching and difficult not to smile along to. plus it features lots of great music! highly recommended to all humans, both the young and the young at heart.

lemuel gulliver (ted danson) is a doctor who goes missing at sea, leaving pregnant wife mary (mary steenburgen) behind. eight years later, he turns up, disheveled and seemingly mad - babbling about his adventures in the lands of the tiny lilliputians, the giant brobdingnags, the floating island of the intellectual laputa, and the houyhnhnms, a race of intelligent, talking horses who have to deal with the yahoos - a race of bestial humans - among many other adventures. the not-so-good dr. bates (james fox), who has designs on lemuel's wife, has gulliver incarcerated in a mental institution, and lemuel, mary, and son thomas (tom sturridge) must find a way to prove his sanity.a splendid adaptation of jonathan swift's satirical novel, this film is a magnificent adaptation on so many levels: the story, the satire, the characters, the visuals, the brilliant cast. it's simply a treat to watch, and it's almost amazing considering that it was a made-for-tv film.the film does a brilliant job of capturing swift's vicious satire, which cuts like a hatchet through british society of the time, but still resonates today. the wise brobdingnags and the houyhnhnms are almost perfect individuals who find it virtually impossible to understand why gulliver speaks with such pride of the vices and corruptions of his society. the scenes where gulliver struggles to prove himself different from the yahoos are perhaps the best, with biting satire in describing how they pick their leaders ("they seem to pick the worst among them. . . who rules until they find someone even worse"), go to war ("we only go to war for a very good reason - such as they are weaker than us, or we want all of their land"), etc. the scenes involving laputa are also effectively done - the intellectuals are so wrapped up in their specialized fields that they have no time for anything else, and really possess little common sense. and the addition of the asylum plot line enhances the story greatly - dr. bates is truly nasty character, and when he gives a speech to the inquiry on gulliver's alleged vices, it's quite clear that he's describing his own faults.the film makes use of beautiful, and fairly convincing cgi effects depicting the very diverse settings of the novel with great effect. the contrast of sizes is done in a very skillful way, and all of the worlds depicted in the story are convincing in their own way. the cinematography (particularly that concerning the asylum) and the costumes are brilliantly done. the editing of the present with lemuel's memories is a device which could be awkward, but works very well.the cast is truly wonderful; a veritable who's-who of british and american talent. ted danson gives an excellent, multi-layered performance as gulliver, showing effectively his transformation from a person bewildered by his strange surroundings, to the lunatic state he was in when he reappears, to his rational, intellectual personality at the end. most well-known for his work on sit-com, danson shows that he's more than just sam malone with this wonderful serio-comic performance. mary steenburgen is effective as his wife, and james fox is absolutely repulsive as bates. the rest of the cast is made up mostly of cameos, with peter o'toole, omar sharif, warwick davis, kristin scott thomas, geraldine chaplin, alfre woodward, edward fox, and sir john gielgud being the most memorable - but even the smallest parts are very well-played.while not 100% faithful to the book, "gulliver's travels" is a triumph of story and images. it's not to be missed.9/10

'rejseholdet' is one of the best new danish tv-series that i have watched.the series is about the danish police force's unit 1 - a kinda fbi-style team that help solve murder cases all over the country, and the cases they work on, plus the influence that their jobs have on their personal lives, and the price they sometimes has to pay to be a part of a top police team.i didn't expect much when i started watching this series - i was pleasantly surprised, the series is exciting, sometimes fun, it's got both drama and suspense, i love it.

this production, build on real danish crime stories, is a experience through excellent directing, acting on all levels and has a nerve not often seen in crime series. every episode is a thrill because it's seems like the hole team believe that "this is my life right now - this murder or murders are my responsibility to solve" and the output is brilliant.as a viewer, you just have this wonderfully filling of being entertained cause it feels like their focus, on purpose or not, lie on that they wont you to have a good time...:o) don't miss this one, it's just right under 'band of brothers' quality and is a "must have seen" experience - what a wonderful crime time !

this is one of the best non-english series i have seen. it weaves interesting single and double episodes of crime-solving together with a personal aspect that you just don't get in csi. the individual characters all have personal lives that combine well with their day job and occasionally interfere. additionally the characters all manage to naturally evolve throughout the episodes.the casting is superb and it was taped all over denmark, giving a good example of the highlights that majestic country has to offer. unfortunately only 32 episodes were made, however they are top-notch television. here's hoping they consider making some more episodes of the same caliber.

first off, i'm an american -- i haven't seen any comments on imdb about this series yet from a u.s. viewer. secondly, i work in the television business in development. so i wallow in much of the sludge that comes out of american broadcast programming. "unit one" is an example of television that's a throwback to what i would attribute as '70s-style scripting, feature-wise. namely, those films made by young autueurs who had free rein to make the dramas feel more realistic and to allow for organic character development. it tacks more along the lines of stellar british dramas like "cracker" and "prime suspect" as well as australia's brilliant "underbelly." "unit one" features stand-alone cases that are committed, then solved, each week. the mysteries aren't extraordinary or particularly byzantine. they usually center around one single twist, clocking in generally at the 40 minute mark, and resolution is neatly wrapped up in the 15 minutes thereafter. what makes this series a breath of fresh air is that it features main characters that you are hooked on and find relatable by episode 2. these are real, breathing, alive characters that have personal baggage, yet it's not a talky, batty type of baggage that american flotsam such as "grey's anatomy" or "desperate housewives" spoons out. these are realistic individuals whose backstories unfold leisurely over the course of the series, as if you work with them on a daily basis. after the mindless decade of "csi's," "ncis's," and "criminal minds," along with their subsequent spawns, it's refreshing to actually sit down to watch friends you want to spend time with, as is the case with "unit one." the quippy banter, the unemotional wooden dialogue, and the over-the-top jeopardy that those american series i mentioned bludgeon us with each week are absurd compared to the nuance and the quiet resonance you get with this remarkable danish series. i'm on episode 7 of the first season, but i've already bought all four seasons and am in for the long haul. if you need explosions and farcically-hopped up testosterone, along with music by the who and fast-cutting, neon-lit, jittery palsy-cam action with cipher-like main characters as your main diet of television drama viewing, i suggest you stay away from this series. if you are an adult with a hunger for subtle, poignant, thoughtful and, yes, sometimes straight-forward procedural crime dramas, i urge you to check this show out.

we've just watched the last of the series shown on the sbs network and will miss our weekly dose of danish delight. my wife and i picked up the show after the swedish show "the eagle" finished and it seemed by comparison to be a very poor substitute for our then favourite show on tv. week by week, however, the show grew on me, and whilst not as glossy as the swedish show and definitely grittier in terms of their investigations of everyday crimes, it certainly provided a very satisfying weekly viewing meal indeed.prior to these 2 shows i had not really been a fan of the cop genre and can't say i am now but the 2 scandinavian shows really provided us with an insight into life in those northern euopean countries through the eyes of their special policing units.

have just seen the last episode, no 32, (though the site says only 30 episodes were made) and i must comment on the fact that this series was really very good and i would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys crime/cop stories. supposedly all 32 were based on fact with information at the end of each episode of the court sentences imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes, this has at times been a gritty, well acted, believable and dare i say, entertaining series. the fact that the powers in denmark decided to disband the unit was almost unbelievable as they did their work so well and in the series at least, never failed to "get their man"! it's a definite 10/10 for me.

this film is about aging geisha in post war tokyo. okin, played by the incredible haruko sugimara, lends money to two other ex geisha, tamae (chikako hosokawa) and otomi (yuko mochizuki) and they resent the way she is somewhat smug about it. tamae has a son, otomi a daughter, who during the film announce they're leaving them while okin, never a mother, gets visits from two men in her past who, it turns out, just want money from her. its a compelling tale of what choices you make, what you do to get through life and who you're responsible and beholden to. haruko sugimara has always been in my eyes one of the greatest character actresses ever from any country and she plays the mostly unyielding, less than compassionate okin with an air of superiority that makes you not like her, but at the same time almost envy her. at a time when great films were made by ozu, mizoguchi, kinoshita and kurosawa, amongst others, mr. naruse is right up there with him. if you have a region free dvd player, you should attempt to find the two naruse box sets released in england. i think this film was a great character study of women who are in danger of being irrelevant. that they are really not makes this film a veritable masterpiece.

naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of japanese film, the other two being ozu and mizoguchi. this is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired geishas. whatever happens, when such a woman ages, and loses her charm and mystique? well, for those who are interested, watch this film. one: okin, is successful as a money-lender, but the other two have to borrow from her and are resentful. okin doesn't have any children, but the other do. okin finds out that her old love is coming to visit her, and is excited. naruse is a master in subtle studies of his female protagonists' characters. bangiku ultimately draws the viewer into the study of the questions of ones happiness, and one's life-worth. very good film indeed.

a look at three geishas who are way past their prime. now they look back on their pasts with fondness and bemoan their present. kin (played by floating weeds' haruko sugimura) has sworn off men and has made a good living as a moneylender; everyone on the block owes her. the other two, nobu and tamae, wish they could land husbands, but are not foolish enough to believe they ever will. meanwhile, their children - one has a son and one a daughter - are both about to get married (not to each other). tamae is irked at how much prettier her daughter has become than her, and bitterly tries to convince her not to marry the man. nobu's concerns about her son are more legitimate in nature, but they are also (understandably) self-serving. after her son leaves, she'll be alone. a bit into the film, two of kin's former clients come looking for her, one a man so obsessed with her that he tried to get her to commit double suicide with him, the other one of her handsomest clients. unfortunately, he comes for her money, not her love. the way i've described the film makes it sound unrelentingly depressing, but it's really not. sad, but not fatally so. it's more bittersweet. unfortunately, i only marginally liked late chrysanthemums. the story seems better when i look back on it, but it is very slow and dull. i actually nodded off twice during the film, and i wasn't at all tired before i started it. this is the kind of film that i can appreciate more than like; it reminds me very much of my reaction to a couple of ozu's more famous films. 7/10.

mikio naruse's examination of the lives of three idling, constantly complaining, single ex-geishas in post-war japan is a wonderful character piece. they used to be friends in the old days but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful moneylender and the other two owe her. although the moneylender is the only one who has become successful in this rebuilding economy, she is the only one of the three that has no children. the other two each have a child whom they depend upon for income, because neither of them work. complications ensue when the kids decide to get married (though not to each other) and leave home. this leads to the bitter, grumbling old women to become even more bitter and grumbling, getting drunk and bemoaning their rotten children and inconsiderate friend the moneylender. meanwhile the moneylender is herself unhappy, despite her fortunes. she has no one besides her young deaf maid to keep her company and chance encounters with two former lovers from her geisha days lead nowhere - all they really want is to borrow money from her. the three characters are all neck-deep in the quicksand of their own bored lives and are too weary to struggle much, usually opting instead to resign themselves to the futility of it all or, at the very most, toss complaints back and forth to each other."late chrysanthemums" is very slow-moving and not much actually happens but naruse, like all great directors, has the ability to do much with very little. i haven't seen much of his work but i suspect that this isn't his best, even though it is very good. the problem, i think, is that it all doesn't seem to amount to much. but the film is full of good points. although it is cynical, it isn't overly so. naruse seems to sympathize with his desperate characters, and he paints vivid portraits that make the characters seem even somewhat noble in the squalor of their self-made misery. while the film isn't a must-see, it is important as a fragment of the work of a great little-known (outside of his own country) director, precious little of which is available on video here in the u. s.

for me, "late chrysanthemums" was interesting not only because it was my first film of naruse i completely enjoyed, but because it was technically as modern and innovative as his 30s work i've seen. this doesn't mean innovative editing in the way godard would introduce it with "breathless" in 1959, but quite the opposite.the editing was as fluent as in the best of hollywood films from the 30s/40s, but at the same time incredibly fitting regarding the way he was telling his story. unlike them, it never purposefully accentuated anything or tried to make itself "invisible" but, together with the cinematography, made me feel like i was traveling on a gentle stream, constantly feeling the waves beneath me, like a gentle stroke of the hand or the almost unnoticeable rocking of a cradle. in this sense the film was comparable to ozu's and mizoguchi's work, but somehow even more subtle.what was so modern was the fact that the editing seemed almost a character in itself, similar to the remarkable camera-work in dreyer's ordet (1954) or vredens dag (1943) which is revealing us a deeper understanding of the film and its characters rather than simply showing them to us.i feel that naruse's editing and cinematography are the most interesting aspects of his films, elevating the stories significance beyond the obvious. the wonderful sets and settings shouldn't be forgotten either! i found the story itself to be rather conventional.the narrative and its characters were introduced in a very interesting way, and i thought that the first half of the film was setting up a delicately ingenious spectrum of emotions and interrelations. unfortunately the second half of the film and its resolution were rather didactic and and formulaic compared to the set up (though by itself it would have been perfectly fitting in any other - less complex - film). somehow i felt that he failed a bit in trying to dissolve the many layers he had woven. maybe he should have kept them intact. this criticism might seem a bit harsh to a viewer of this film, especially since the procedure is again reminiscent to the way ozu dealt with the plot in his films. unfortunately i haven't yet the feeling that naruse was able to elevate the story and its characters in his films' conclusions in a similarly sublime fashion. the best efforts i have seen to date - ukigumo (floating clouds / 1955) and midaregumo (scattered clouds / 1967) - sustained the energy he had built throughout the narrative, while delivering poignant and resonant endings.this is already more than most director's are able to do, and in my opinion the basis for a real mastery of the cinematic medium. in this regard, and considering the resonance of the last two films i've seen by him, he may have already become one of my favorites.the only problem i have at the moment, is where i'm going to see more of his films on the big screen.

sadness and nostalgia permeate late chrysanthemums, a 1954 film by japanese auteur mikio naruse, now undergoing a retrospective of his long unavailable films thanks to james quandt of cinematheque ontario and the japan foundation. based on three stories by fumiko hayashi, late chrysanthemums tells the story of four retired geishas, now middle-aged, whose lives have become full of disappointment and regret. performance are uniformly outstanding, particularly that of haruko sugimura, who starred in films by ozu's late spring, floating weeds, and tokyo story among others. sugimura portrays kin, a former geisha who has no children and lives only with her young maid who is unable to speak.she has become cynical about men and has turned her attention to money, particularly real estate speculation and loaning money to her friends, nobu (sadako sawamura), tamae (chikako hosokawa), and tomi (yuko mochizuki), all former geishas. kin's friends live in meager circumstances and complain about how kin has become greedy and tomi spends considerable time gambling to try and make ends meet. both tomi and tamae are in the process of losing their children. tamae's son is leaving to work in the coalmines in hokkaido, and tomi's daughter has decided to accept a marriage proposal from an older man. both resist the change in their circumstances but come to accept it as inevitable.two male friends visit kin, seki a former lover with whom she once contemplated double suicide, and tabe (ken uehara), another lover who she looks forward to seeing again after many years. her mood is upbeat but soon turns to resentment when she discovers that the two men are only interested in borrowing money. naruse cuts between two extended sequences seamlessly as kin confronts tabe and tomi and tamae console each other over the loss of their children the dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are women of strength who, though their future does not seem bright, refuse to see themselves merely as victims. late chrysanthemums has the simplicity, humor, and stoic acceptance of life prominent in the films of ozu and is a bittersweet reminder of the slow passing of time and the comfort that memory and companionship can bring along the way.

subtle, delicate ,touching.a young man in a summer dress on a bike like incarnation of perfect joy. history of a coming -out and anatomy of relationship.soft ambiguous gestures, slices of desire and a day like space of innocent miracle expression.two men, a girl, a afternoon on beach, some words and a gift. religious traces and a pantheist vision. cercle of light and expression, nooks of an ordinary day and hot evening.a erotic chaste film in which the gay identity or the first sexual relation are only instruments for good definition of a universe with sensitives values.pledge for self- discover, universe of beauty exploration, the sign of ozon and same nostalgic air of every creation, "robe d'ete" is a splendid occasion to understand the moment like projection of dream, to look, with emotion and child soul the essence of the essence beyond the images or people.

yeah i watched this mini series with my mom and dad as a kid. it was one of the few mini series that my 9 year old mind actually could follow. i recall it was very well done, and didn't necessarily have the feel of the typical crap mini series. it was more or less an original concept that really grabbed your attention. i would recommend this miniseries to anyone who is a fan of history and plot twists. although most twists in this movie are either spelled out or predictable, it is still worth the time. i haven't checked to see if you can get it through netflix yet however. i would imagine not. they should play it on the history channel or something.

like most other reviewers, i really enjoyed this tv miniseries. i didn't see it when it first came out, but my grandfather - a big fan of mysteries and war films - happened to record it in 1989. i remember watching it at my grandparents' cabin one night and i was completely drawn into the story! it has a very intriguing plot and a good mix of drama, romance, and espionage. i've seen lots of films that are set during wwii, but none with a twist like this! thankfully, i was able to make a vhs copy of the film several years ago. i've watched it several times since then and i still enjoy it. i would love for this film to be released on dvd. it would be so much easier to view with chapters.

i have been looking for this mini-series for a very long time. i saw this movie when i was living in back in russia many years ago. i'm curious if somebody who has the recorded copy of this movie can send me the copy. i'm willing to cover all the expenses and pay for the extra tapes or dvds. this is one of the best tv series that i have ever watched. i would recommend it to anybody who is somewhat interested in israel history and world history after wwii. i'm also trying to find a book (i have heard that its even better than the movie)however the new one costs around $50 on amazon and i have never purchased a used copy. my e-mail address is yurets777@hotmail.com thank you very much for you help.

i agree with so many of the other reviewers here. this was a great film and an even better novel by robert fish. unfortunately, i believe the author died before he could see this film made. the performances are all top rate, with the three principles (john glover, ben cross, and veronica hamel) seemingly made for their roles. the exteriors, both in europe and israel, seem very authentic, and the 4-hour miniseries length was just right for the telling of this story. fortunately, i did tape this when it was on television and have enjoyed watching it ever since. i can say unhesitatingly that it holds up even to this day. i gave it a rating of 10. if you haven't read the book, you should really find a copy. this would be an outstanding film to release on dvd with extras that could easily include interviews from the cast.

i watched this on tv in 1989 and regretted not taping it. i was very intriguing and suspenseful. it is amazing as the events unfold and this man's past catches up with him.the acting is first rate and the story is exactly what the title claims... "twist of fate"... but no one could run away from a life that this man had at the beginning of the movie.

william m. thackeray once said "a good laugh is sunshine in the house." when i watched take away, i must say that the sun did shine in my house. this film was superb, the opening was very cleverly done, the story held together well, in a nutshell two fish'n chip shop owners who normally enemies are forced to form an alliance of sorts to engage in a david and goliath struggle against a fast food chain which builds a restaurant on their street. the ending was hilarious even though i have found many who disagree with me on that one.the film was though very discreetly, portraying contemporary australian ethnic stereotypes, in particular the collision or culture clash if you will between the traditional anglo australian and italo australian stereotypes, and how they found a sort of "unity though adversity", very nice.i found vince colosimo's performance as "tony stilano" an italo-australian fish 'n chip shop owner in his thirties to be first-class, his acting was very genuine and convincing, through his performance he managed to really bring to the surface the essence, or i should say the soul of the italian australian stereotype, which in reality is not too italian but not too australian either, colosimo found that balance, breathed into its lungs and gave it life.the cinematography could have been better, more shots of the local area would've been nice, from what i can see it was in melbourne, but where in melbourne? to me it looks like somewhere between ivanhoe to bullen, though i am not 100% sure on that one.i don't know why so many people are comparing this film to "the castle" though they have similar themes running through them, take away stands in a league of its own.i think the film was excellent with a capital "e" it has everything, it's funny, the jokes are great, it deals with contemporary issues facing australian society, the story holds well, i loved it! i highly recommend it.

i expected it to be good, after i'd seen some other ozon's superb moments, and read much about it... but this movie is brilliant - clever, very bright (emotionally and visionally), perfect in all moments. every movement is there for a reason, everything fits so closely and primordially true and honest. this is the movie about the beauty and innocence; about it's simplicity.

i hadn't planned on seeing this movie, however i wasn't disappointed when a friend dragged me along. although there are no real surprises here, the guys do reasonably well with their obviously modest budget.if you've seen the trailer you probably know what to expect from this type of movie and there's a pretty constant stream of jokes here, with a couple of classic moments, with the highpoint probably being an excellent flashback to what the guys were like in the 1980's. also, i've read elsewhere that the ending was a disappointment, but i found it refreshingly different from what i had expected from this genre.overall, this movie wont change your life, but it's got enough laughs there to keep you entertained throughout.

though several scenes of wirey spindell can be described as "over the top". i thought that it was refreshing to see something that was willing to go to a level of near-taboo twisted comedy.wirey spindell is a great film with great dialog. i wouldn't say that this film is for everyone, but the film is on my top 10 list.if you can look beyond it's occasional offensiveness and watch it for the film that it is, i would hope you could see it in the same light that i do.

i like the earlier description of this movie as a life poem. i caught this totally at random on the movie channel last night, and was captivated enough to stick with it the whole way. there's really just a toally unique voice to the film, a poetry of narration that's meaningful without straying into pretension. there's also many hilarious moments from wirey's middle-school days that are crude without being potty humor. it's sad that this movie is so low-rated. the fact that there are so many 1's makes me think the numbers are cooked- i can't see how anyone could see the movie as that abysmal. sure, this is by no means a typical romantic comedy, but it is a very unique viewpoint of a very unique life, of a man whose very appeal comes from his detachment, a detachment he must overcome before it destroys him. give this flick a chance. it came out of nowhere for me, and i feel the richer for it.

i was surprised to read the comments of the person who so disliked this film. it really is quite funny. there are definitely a few laugh out lines that my boyfriend and i quote to each other. some of the situations might be unsettling (bisexuality, drugs, a particularly strange child's view of sexuality) but believable at the same time. it's about communication and miscommunication between men and women.

i saw this movie on a night i couldn't sleep, i loved it and searched to find out when it would be on again, probably the best movie i have ever seen, at the time, and even now the cast is full of people i had never seen before but it seems like a real life story based out of nyc, this is the kind of movie that elevates the viewing pleasure because you see it, hear it and feel it, from the moment i saw wirey drinking a beer and watching the game i imagined what it must be like to grow up without a father, there are so many lines from this movie i use on a daily basis like "the personal alone time" in the bathroom drinking a 7-11 beverage, great film

i, as many imdb patrons seem to have, stumbled upon this little film when it appeared on the canadian "showcase network". i was, as many of you, also sucked in and watched the entire film. i was hooked, at first, by the literate dialogue and wry sense of humour that the film is rich with. i was coasting along comfortably on a sort of "kevin smith meets killer films" wave until half way through when the movie really buckled down and explored it's themes in more detail... with a decidedly darker and more poignant edge. far from being taken out of the experience, i was brought further in. this is not the best film of it's kind and will certainly not have universal appeal... so i do understand some of the more negative reactions to it. but i bought in... and enjoyed it immensely. the "flash back" type movement in the chronology was effective, the characters were well-realized and the issues raised were human, accessible (to my experience anyway) and interesting. i was quite impressed with the film's ability to remain sweet, funny and entertaining while not shying away from controversial subject matter and raw emotional language, dynamics and situations. this movie is a great antidote to a lot of the schlock that has permeated the witty/clever romantic genre. a kind of male brigitte jones for the literate sect. take 2 hours out of your busy schedule and jump into wirey's world... or you could go rent "you've got mail", 'cause if that appeals to you, you won't like this anyway! those of us who did like it will be alright without you on our side...

wirey's journey through the final days of bachelorhood, liberally sprinkled with flashbacks to a sexually active and diverse childhood.it's definitely not a feel-good romance movie. it is a romance movie, but one without illusions. everyone's an adult here, not your cup of tea if you want another sleepless in seattle or notting hill.

as i watched "wirey spindell" i couldnt but laugh at what was taking place on screen. wirey sure got a lot of play from both boys and women but i was confused as to why the actor that played wirey in h.s. was 10 years old. then the actor changed age to like 20 to play wirey when he was a senior in hs...but whatever, i thought it was funny.

an example of genius filmaking. the epic story of three major stages of life for a young boy told with eloquence and raw fearlessness. rarely does a film come along that causes me to out loud say during most of the viewing, "this is a really good film...." again and again. that is exactly what happened when i watched this film. i really do not understand how anyone could not like it. i found myself at moments crying and laughing at the very same moment, unable to control how i felt about the scene. the acting is outstanding. eric mabius- why is he not all over movie screens? he was really extraordinary. his seemingly effortless attempt on the screen impacted me in deep visceral ways. i thank him. in my opinion, eric schaeffer is one of the best filmakers around, and i hope he continues to rise to the challenges that he faces while trying to give us art in the face of ferocious commercial filmaking.

i disagree with the imdb.com synopsis that this is about a bisexual guy preparing to get married. it's more about all the crap we go through - self-induced and because of our parents - that we have to "get over" when we grow up. like the linda mccarriston poem says, "childhood is the barrel they throw you over the falls in." this movie is much more like a narrative poem. it's about life and the mistakes we make and hurt we inflict and experience over the years, and how in the end, it's all about love (i'm not trying to be hyper-sensitive or schmoopy) and finding and being with one special person.

there's not a dull moment in francois ozon's "robe d'ete". it's surprising how much is packed into this short film. while reclining on a deserted beach after a nude swim, a young gay is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette. she invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach. on returning to the beach. they find that all his clothes have been stolen. she lends him a summer dress to cover his nakedness and requests he return it next day. he rides his bike back to the holiday cabin dressed as a girl. his gay companion is sexually excited. early next morning the young man returns to the sea and bids farewell to the girl whose holiday has ended. she suggests he keep the dress as a memento of their summer romance. it's a light-hearted film that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea, but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nudity or homosexual themes.

instead of watching the recycled history of "pearl harbor" with nothing new to reveal except for a couple of real events involving a few individuals thrown in so the makers of the film could say they contributed to the spread of history, along with nothing but cgi explosions filling in for a sappy romantic triangle. one should go see dark blue world.this film takes place during the historic time in wwii which the czech pilots left their homeland and went to fight for the raf instead of laying down their arms and giving in to the nazis. it was a part of history that should at least be told once to the outside world. a love triangle takes place between the main characters, but one of them does not die off conveniently like in pearl harbor, but through sacrifice for true friendship. the movie is tragedy after tragedy, with not even a bittersweet ending, with our hero not enjoying glory of taking his country back, the return of love by his current lover, the return of love by his reunited lover, or even the return of unconditional love by his life long pet. he is utterly heartbroken and feels no worse off in the russian labor camp. this kind of ending is something that hollywood would probably change if it was their script.the movie does play on the sentimental sometimes, but it also shows the humanity of people. overall, a worthwhile movie.

this is an excellent film. the aerial scenes were well-done. it was also the right balance of war and love. the film gives meaning to the phrase, "never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few."

this feels as if it is a czech version of pearl harbor. it has a same story, both guys fall in love with the same woman. and add to the twist, the woman is actually a married one whose husband has been missing for a year. i don't think that the story line is too strong. the younger guy is quite naughty, that is cute. it kept me watching because of the emotional music, and the pleasing scenes one after another. it also has some strong visual special affects. best of all, the love stories is seamlessly integrated with the story. i think that if it was in english, it would be such a big shot all across the states. it is too bad that not that many people are open for foreign movies.

"for a squadron leader - normally the only guy trained and equipped for navigation in a squadron and very hard to replace - to risk an expensive plane and himself to pick up a crashed fellow pilot, no matter how close a friend he is, in the face of oncoming enemy troops, is hard to believe, especially when they both have to share a cramped spitfire cockpit - two into a skyraider, ok, but a spit?! come on, this part of the film is a biggles adventure, not fitting a film that one is supposed to take seriously!" as said by tord s eriksson (gothenburg, sweden) is rubbish. not at all biggles. one true story of the war comes to mind of two grounded spit pilots, who planned and flew (illegally) a strafing mission over france. one had to crash land and his friend landed his spit under fire, while german infantry was moving in on them, and flew them both out of there. in a spit. they were both severely injured in former fights, one had an artificial leg from the knee down. now that may sound like something out of bigles, but it happened. ill get sources if needed

this is the movie that finally pushed me over the line into registering with imdb so that i could vote for (and comment on) it. i've only recently come to appreciate well-produced "war" movies, and this is one of the most thoughtful i've seen."stunning" is the word that comes to mind when i think of this viewing experience. my husband and i watched this film last night for the first time. it is gently moving, yet exciting at the same time (not a contradiction). this story in the hands of hollywood could have become just another smarmy, action-packed, top gun time-waster.the two lead actors playing frantisek and karel played off of each other marvelously well; and krystof hadek is a very "pretty" boy without seeming to exaggerate or exploit that fact. in terms of hadek's acting ability and appearance, my husband said (tongue-in-cheek), "well, he's no tom cruise." i replied, "thank god!" if you appreciate beautiful and understated acting, see this one.

i saw this film in wales in july. it deals with the courage of czech pilots who flew numerous missions for the raf after their country had been occupied by the nazis. in this film, the action takes place both in the early 1950's when these pilots are being beaten in political prisons in czeckoslavakia and during world war ii in britain. they were imprisoned after their return to their homeland because the communist regime viewed these warriors as a threat to their occupation of czeckoslavakia. the pilots maintain their dignity in prison and during numerous air battles against nazi pilots. this film contain a love sub-plot that does make sense because it helps us to understand that both civilians and soldiers made great sacrifices to preserve democracy. the end of this film indicates that the heroism of these czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990's after the restoration of democracy in the country then known as czeckoslavakia. this powerful and moving film was made with financial support from the czech government. i highly recommend this film.

a surprisingly beautiful movie. beautifully conceived, beautifully directed, beautifully acted, beautifully acted and most beautifully photographed.....the cinematography is nothing short of splendid. it is a war movie but is epic in it's scope and blends romance, tragedy and comedy into a story that is as harrowing as it is provoking.

yet another foreign war movie that puts hollywood to shame. real in the same proportions that hollywood productions such as harts war and windtalkers are unreal. a moving story backed up by strong acting and great film making.

along with having minor flaws to it, this film is a masterpiece, and most definitely the best war film i've seen. not the mention it's one of the best films i've seen in all genres. i might have written this for no man's land before, but now i think this one's better. it's very sad in the ending, and i almost cried after the two shocking scenes that came within 5 minutes close to the film's final. karel's performance as the main character was fascinating although he's supposed to be a rookie considering his age. this film makes you think a lot, makes you cry (or at least gets you close to it), and makes you hate any kind of war and political bs. the flashbacks to the prison-hospital make the film even more delicious. one tiny flaw about the film is the non-british accents of supposedly british people. most of the british people on screen were actually british, but how about the ones who are supposed to be british and speak with a foreign accent? that really didn't fit into this adorable film. but it's pretty much the only flaw i've noticed. effects could also be a bit better but then again, we all remember many films from one particular land that have tremendous fx and absolutely nothing else. briefly, this film is a total masterpiece and every single individual should see it. if you want to travel to the czechoslovakia of 40's, and if you want to virtually witness a tremendous amount of emotions at once, this film is for you. if you don't want to do those, this film will make you want to do so.

engaging entry from europe about czech fighter pilots flying for the raf during ww2. it's always interesting as an american to see a new point of view on familiar events in history. there's nothing terribly original or revolutionary about the style in which this is filmed or the romantic love triangle that anchors the narrative. still, it is compelling all the way through. there is a good balance between drama, romance, humor, action, and symbolism that is understated beautifully by the director and cast. this is a breath of fresh air after sitting through overblown and boring hollywood epics like "pearl harbor." a solid production all around. this is definitely worth your time if you are a fan of foreign cinema.

i'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur ozon. i've seen only 4 films so far, and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions. not a single non-lonely female character out of 12, and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings.this film is probably the only one (out of four) where this impact is for good.the gay theme is an almost standard part of background for ozon's films, so it doesn't grab the accent (although the looks of the characters might). watch for the feelings, not for their objects.very nice and fleeting, truly like a summer romance, and while being a relaxation to thought and mind, it gives some food for the soul.

nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film. the fact that you keep seeking and hoping for more flying sequences, tells you that they have just enough. the acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid.............a must rent, view, or see.don't be afraid of subtitles........its worth a little aversion therapy10/10

this is such a beautiful movie! not only does it portray war, it also has friendship & love. the life of slama is filled with sadness, every aspect of his life fell apart. i can only imagine how he would feel when his friend make the ultimate sacrifice.i see a slight similarity to 'pearl harbor', which is also about two pilots falling in love with the same woman. however this film is much better made, because this does not portray the woman to be unfaithful & easy-going. the friendship between the two men is also much more convincing & well built-up. i definitely recommend this movie to all people.

this is one of the best czech movies i have ever seen. the director did excellent work, there is great camera and the actors are really great. i like war movies so i really liked this one. i would recommend it to anyone who wants to know something about czech pilots during 2nd world war and their life after the war, in communism.

a nicely paced romantic war story that should have got more exposure. the czech pilot who played piano gives a mellow touch to the story. the flying footage may not have been enough for aviation buffs like myself, but then again, this really isn't an action movie. though it does not have anything in common with the james salter novel "the hunters" that became the movie about korean war f86 sabre pilots, dark blue world had a similar feel but with more of a romantic element to it. better in some ways than battle of britain in that it doesn't rely on big name actors. suggest viewing this movie with some czech beer and some czech dumplings called kneldniky(sp).

this is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind. one knows it's going to about a mute, one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentiment.well, forget it. the movie starts with a little black humour, and then gets started. from then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of moscow. all right, it must be said: the unexpected twists are expected, and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder. but this movie doesn't let you go.it's like the old gangster movies, but then without any glamour at all and in russia. and that's one of the most important aspects of this movie: it's situated in russia. this does have a great impact on the movie, according to me it makes it better. everything becomes simple and basic, life is without nonsense. this could be a great potential for more movies in the future, gangster movies about the russian mafia.it is a beautifull and terrifying movie. it's horror, but you can't feel but sympathy for the little mute. one last advice: don't look this too late in the evening if you want to sleep well.

first half of the movie scared the hell out of me and normally i'm not easy to scare, but second half of this thriller didn't work quite a well, but still very scary! a good thriller, than use simple ways to make good horror. lowbudget, set in russia, unknown cast, and made in europe. but still great fun, and yes there is a few laughs throw in for good matters as well!

if you want to see a true thriller, rent this!!! it's not from the director or screenwriter of "scream", doesn't feature overacting, overpaid "tv" actors passing off as "stars", and is not a run of the mill special effects bonanza. instead you'll get a top-notch, edgy, very strong (in violence) yet thrilling nailbiter.

well, this film came on on a workday at 230am. the cute little actress who played billy caught my attention initially and after the 1st 15 minutes i was held captive to my television till the very end. it has you on the edge of your seat, then throws in clever bits of comedy during the most tense sequences.the only draw back is that the story was not substantial enough to fill hour an a half film, causing certain sequences to drag just a little. nonetheless, it was still very entertaining, and i recommended it to all my co-workers the next day.

mute witness is a modest, yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves. the film  written and directed entirely by anthony waller  is a tense, action-packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences. no pointless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot-twistsjust straight to the point mystery. mute witness handles about the vicious topic of `snuff'-movies and is effectively set in russia. *** spoilers *** since the production costs are cheaper there, a us film crew temporarily moves to russia for shooting a horror film. an old hangar is used as film location. the female make-up artist of the team accidentally gets locked up overnight and while trying to find a way out, she witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuff-movie! she's caught and tries to escape but, since she's a mute, she can't cry for help and neither can she explain what she saw to the police properly. the girl's life is in real danger now, since there's a whole hidden network behind these snuff productions and they don't want the witnesses to be alive *** end spoilers ***. mute witness contains multiple highly exiting action sequences and is rather bloody. some of the mystery clues are effectively kept secret till the very end. regarding the similar topic, i'd say it's definitely better than the more famous `8 mm', directed by joel schumacher and starring nicolas cage. the acting in mute witness isn't great, but the leading actress (who's russian herself) looks really cute. sir alec guinness makes a special appearance, too. and a very cool one, i may say. surely recommended with guaranteed fun and scares.

this is a very good movie. i give it a 10.it's very different in that it's kind of a long stalking scene all the way through. the fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable way.she sees a murder (for a snuff-movie) and decides to run but is chased (this takes quite some time). i won't reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience, but rest assured: it's very believable, well played, very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great ending.don't miss this movie.

superbly crafted low-budget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at, and plenty of ghoulish humour along the way as well.the cast play it very well, although richards' self-centered movie director is a bit hard to take at times. the tiny two-scene cameo by sir alec guinness, oozing menace as the crime czar of moscow, is simply the icing on the cake.well worth repeated viewing, but not on dark nights when you're all alone!

an intense thriller about a mute movie make-up artist who witnesses a snuff film being made when she is working late in the studio one night. after she tries to get away from the murder scene, she realizes she is in for more than she bargained for when the entire mafia is out to kill her for being a witness. this movie leaves you on the edge of your seat.

this is definitely one of the most scary and spell-binding films ever made. you are stuck to the movie from the beginning to the very end. even though there are some plot holes, it keeps being exciting to the final showdown. besides "8 mm" and "peeping tom" this is one of the best films about "snuff movies", a taboo theme of our culture. if you like the scream trilogy, you will probably love that one.

i love this movie ! i think i've seen it 5 times already (it was quite a success in france and they often play it on tv). ok, it's a thriller and there is great tension. but mostly (and specifically in the second part) it is absolutely hilarious ! and very original. the directing and photography are just splendid.

god bless joe d'amato...i love italian horror, cheese (movie-wise ;)), sci-fi, etc.this one, admittedly, was a bit harder to watch, but another fun bad movie.i like how people preface a negative review with "i normally enjoy bad movies, but..." no buts, this was a bad movie for people who love bad movies. it's one of my top bad movies.miles o'keefe was a poor man's conan, but oh what fun. who can't have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb, a hangglider and a cheesy rubber monster? it's fine to hate this movie if you only like hollywood drek like "titanic" or "pretty woman" but if you truly, i mean truly love bad movies, check this one out.this is one of those movies that are fun to rent for a beerbust or when you have a couple buddies around and looking for a little mindless fun.my rating 8/10.

i've waited 9 years to watch this film, simply because i never saw it advertised on tv. eventually i caught it and it was well worth the wait. it's much better than your over-hyped scream or last summer garbage because it's all at a fairly quick pace, with no drawn out, creeping through the house to cheesy music scenes. only the bad dubbing lets it down a little but don't let that put you off in any way. what lies beneath - over hyped and crap. mute witness - low budget, not hyped at all and very good.

the plot is somewhat original, and all the actors did their job pretty well. there is a plenty of comic relief, too. some things do not make a lot of sense (e.g. the first "chase" scene, why would the heroine not just hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave?). the russians actually speak russian without accent, but the cars are extremely strange, with models spanning like 50 years, and so the place seems weirdly out of time. overall, if you like thrillers you will probably like this one as well.

i enjoyed the acting in this movie. except for the sister. she reminded me of janice on friends. i could never quite believe she was anything but obnoxious. my main problems with the movie were the anticlimatic ending and the execution scene with the sister and brother-in-law. the guy falling out of the exploding car? maybe if his hand had been blown off and he ran to the mute for help and she kissed him and rushed him to a hospital, maybe then i could have gone for the ending. i think somebody needed to die in the execution scene. mainly the brother-in-law. he was such a pain in the ass anyway. or maybe the sister needed to accidentally kill the guy who saved the mute. i could have even bought into the brother-in-law killing the hero and the ending being the two sisters being put in snuff films. it is worth watching again and as i always say, it is much easier to be a reviewer instead of an author.

this is, without doubt, one of my favourite horror films ever! i really cannot believe that it didn't gain much more popularity when it was released, especially when the main contenders at the time were the usual wes craven sequels and copycat horrors, mute witness has all the style, suspense and quickfire plot twists of a hitchcock/depalma movie, coupled with some very sharp black comedy and a great plot. it never promises to be any more than a good popcorn-and-hot-dog movie, but it is difficult not to just enjoy the film for what it is.the plot centres on billie hughes - a mute girl working on the set of a horror film being made in a russian factory. by a series of events, she finds herself accidentally locked in, and stumbles on the filming of a snuff movie.one of the best things about the film is the lack of screaming that seems to invade every horror film ever made. as the main character is mute, she cannot make a noise - something which is a blessing at some stages of the movie, and a curse in others.the director seems to have studied his hitchcock very well, even the opening scene is a tongue-in-cheek nod to both hitchcock's "psycho" as well as fairly generic slasher movie scenes.while the acting can be hammy at times, the whole film does hold it together, not only throwing in a couple of excellent scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat, but a few neat little questions about how the film is going to end.all in all, a hugely overlooked, well-paced and action packed psycho-thriller which i would recommend for any jaded viewer looking for something a little different from the usual freddy/jason/scream/michael myers/damien regurgitation's at hallowe'en.

one of my all-time favourite movies. nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time. if i could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from momentary amnesia i would so i could enjoy this movie as much as i did that very first time. it's still enjoyable second and third times round but i found myself appreciating the humour more as the shocks and thrills weren't unexpected. if you want a see a film that you truly won't be able to predict the ending of then i highly recommend this film. its chilling, shocking, full of suspense and there's also loads of humour to help you through it too. if you watch this film and don't love it i truly question your sanity!

i don't know how this film went unnoticed for so long.i saw this film on tv, i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film. i missed the first, probably , 10 minutes, but that does not matter..this film literally gripped me, it is a real spine chiller.the absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effect,u do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new. u never know when they will get killed or what they are up to. so it is all the more tense.even though there are many new faces their performances were top class.the filmmakers play with your mind, just revealing enough gore to make imagine the rest. the shock, fear, horror and helplessness are also brought out well by characters in the film.the well written situations n twists,fast camera movements, slick editing and superb direction makes it an excellent suspense thriller. this film actually switches between the genres - horror and suspense thriller leaving the viewer clueless and tensed. undoubtedly comparable to hitchcock. i could not even move from the tv even during the commercial breaks .. i was the helpless mute witness to this superb film.

man, i never laugh so much this year, and it's pretty hard to make me laugh. while i expected some hostel-style movie, the smile came to my face even from the beginning. this film-inside-film shows a female stabbed "victim" messing the whole set until she finally "die". her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us, the viewers, that mute witness is not a typically horror movie.the main character, the mute american make-up artist billy hughes, is played by the beautiful yet talented russian actress marina zudina. her performance is top-notch; her character can't speak, so the body language and the emotions on her face must compensate.and, oh boy, she did a wonderful job. her sister (fay ripley) is the girlfriend or the fiancée or the wife of the "in-film director" (evan richards). they were both very funny most of the time. i won't spoil more, but the scenes following the bathtub moment, with them two, the fake policemen and later the angry neighbor were plain brilliant black comedy.the plot get twisted near the end, possibly misleading at one particular moment. but don't worry. such a delicious movie can be viewed in family or with your boy-/girl-/friend.

in today's world of advertising and teenage horror and sensationalism it is very rare that one gets to see a movie and no nothing about it. movies like psycho and blair witch, while being great in suspense (both with great build ups) are spoiled by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them. with mute witness, a rare treat, i stumbled upon this film and watched it, scared witless, in the middle of the night. i was scared by the menacing russian ambience, the 'snuff' theme and the claustrophobic plight of the mute and the fact that the (amusing, which always leads to likeable) characters could meet the end at any second. since this is a low budget and rare film we watch it without any expectations. it also has fay ripley in a rare movie role, watch and prepare to be excited, scared and thrilled in totally unexpected ways.

i couldn't stop watching this movie, though it was far past my bedtime. comparisons to hitchcock are deserved -- this thing really plays with you. it walks a wonderful line between real, immediate suspense and a dark, distancing humor. like many of hitch's heroes, our doe-eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific -- and we are taken on quite a ride with her, at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear, at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardy.the filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out. right from the opening shots, they engage and challenge you to determine what is real and what is fabrication; who is to be trusted and who is a monster. the plot twists and turns unpredictably. suspense is created with a combination of carefully chosen camerawork, imagery, music -- but most simply the eyes of the characters, which sends raw fear right into you. a warning: there is some frighteningly real gore, as well as some nudity. the horror scenes are done in an emotional way that make them far more scary and disturbing than in any teenage-slasher pic.and a teen-slasher pic it ain't. the characters are quirky and feel like real people, for one thing -- a couple (including the heroine) you may even find endearing as i did. there will be no mistake you're watching a movie made for grown-ups. i mean, alec guinness is in it, briefly, and you know he didn't need the work!pop this in the vcr some night when you can't sleep. . . and don't want to, yet.

the story is airtight from the beginning until the latter third of this movie. then the story gets more and more outrageous. the main character portrayed by marina sudina is fantastic and had a difficult role. this could have been a super-great movie had the ending been more realistic.

does anybody know why this movie is called the couch trip? i was just watching it and am still not sure why this title was picked the movie was very funny and its probably my favorite dan aykroyd performance it even beats out his ghostbusters performance i had never heard of the movie before i seen it in a sears store i read the back and thought it sounded good so i bought and when i finally got a chance to watch it, i thought it was better than what i had originally expected. this movie rates as good as animal house and national lampoon's vacation in my mind i wish comedies that have come out lately were written as well as this one was nothing sad happens in it and the bad stuff that does happen are also funny parts if anyone else feels this way and would like to read a comedy script for a movie that doesn't have a sad situation in it email me at killer2511@hotmail.com

a lot of people don't think dan aykroyd is funny. this movie proves otherwise. aykroyd is brilliant delivering his one-liners in this comedy. the only major problem with this is that it wastes far too much time near the end jumping back and forth from aykroyd's character and the doctor who is pursuing him to prove he's a fraud. the doctor goes nuts like doctor leo marvin (richard dreyfuss) in "what about bob?". the scenes where the doctor is desperately trying to get back to los angeles are silly, unbelievable, and unfunny. other that this aspect the movie really is funny, especially the first half.

i would agree with the comments already posted to this site by the previous rater.i first stumbled across this movie back in the '80s, when i was employed at a psychiatric hospital. unfortunately, many of the barbs aimed at the psychiatric profession do hit home. i especially enjoyed the ending, where the psychiatrist would speak thru the door to the hospitalized grodin. trust me, its fairly accurate.of course, doors at most psych hospitals are not locked, nor are straightjackets used much these days, and any hospital must be licensed to have a "padded room".but a wonderfully underrated film, and certainly one that is quite amusing.jeff

i first saw the couch trip (1988)on late night television years ago and instantly fell in love with it. the funny thing is i usually catch all the comedies made but have never even heard of this one until i saw it. dan ackroyd is plain and simpley hillarious period. he has made a couple great movies with belushi and don't forget saturday night live. but i think the couch trip is probably his best and funniest. with a good supporting cast of charles grodin, david clennon, and walter matthau this piece of cinema shines with comic gold. ackroyd's wife donna dixxon even does a fine job here. my favorite moments of the film involve ackroyd and david clennon's charachter lawrence baird. those two played well off each other. so if you haven't seen a good comedy in awile take a trip back to 1988 and rent or buy the couch trip. i just did, amazon 78 cents. what a bargain, too bad i got hit with a 2.50 shipping fee. oh well still well worth it. any guy will love this flick check it out.

i am surprised that this, well above average 80's comedy scores only a 5.2 from all the imdb voters. dan ackroyd does his usual satirical turn as a con who seizes a great opportunity to steal a contract from his prisons physician. he retreats to california to start his work giving advice on a radio show pretending to be the infamous dr lawrence baird. the only person that knows he's an imposter is the drunken priest (walter matthau) who comes along to be pampered by ackroyd's new found wealth having blakmailed him. charles grodin throws in a good supporting performance too. for its genre i think this film deserves the same crediblity as 'ferris bueller' or 'trading places'. 7.5 / 10

as a fan of dan aykroyd, i watched this film when it was recently shown in the middle of night on tv. i wasn't expecting much, so it came as a big surprise that i loved it so much.this is the type of film that dan aykroyd seems to love to make. a chance for him to 'ham it up' and not take things too seriously. if you loved him in the blues brothers or ghostbusters you'll know what i mean, and you'd be wise to check out the couch trip.avid fans of aykroyd will also have fun spotting all the tiny links to his other films in the script!i can't describe this film without spoiling it for you, so all i can do is tell you to check it out. i can't praise this film highly enough, and it must surely be time for a dvd release!!

michael ritchie's "the couch trip" is a wonderfully anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist. it is so subtle and wicked that you start to realize what a stinging satire it really is. it is also dan akyroyd's best movie, made in a particularly great film year (1988)for him. first, "the great outdoors" and now this.akyroyd stars as john burns, a career crook who fakes insanity to escape prison. now, a dumb comedy would just be about this. but "the couch trip" uses this as a springboard for everything else. beverly hills psychiatrist george maitlin (charles grodin, subtly hilarious here)has a nervous breakdown and a replacement is selected: lawrence baird, who happens to be akyroyd's psychiatrist! you can pretty much guess what's going to happen, but the great thing about "the couch trip" is not what happens, but how it is done. "the couch trip" gives dan akyroyd the best role he has ever had. his john burns is one of the truly original comic creations in movie history. wicked one liners and physical humor are a part of it, but what makes it special is that akyroyd makes burns a lovable character. we root for him and grow to like him a whole lot during the 98 minute running time.but akyroyd isn't alone here. he gets strong support from other great comic actors. walter matthau joins the hilarity as a con artist minister who catches on to burns' secret and commits genteel blackmail. charles grodin "slow burns" his way to another great comic role as the burned out psychiatrist. grodin has been one of the most underappreciated actors in hollywood. it's criminal they haven't used him more often. richard romanus plays grodin's slimeball lawyer to perfection."the couch trip" is one of many films made by the now-defunct orion pictures corporation that are currently unseen. mgm spent a fortune buying the orion library but have yet to truly cash in on their acquisition. "the couch trip" joins "dressed to kill", "blow out" and countless others in gathering dust rotting in the vault. shame on mgm for their inaction. hopefully, with new management, "the couch trip" will find the audience and respect it deserves.**** out of 4 stars

i loved complete savages! why did they cancel it anyway? they should have made a second season and so on... god! they always cancel the good shows... and leave all the boring stuff. nothing interesting at tv since complete savages is gone. this show was a great idea. a single firefighter father with five crazy sons and a lazy dog... each and every one of them has his own madness in that house. tj is always the kid...always the smaller one... kyle rocks! he breaks everything he touches! he's always on detention, he's always doing the wrong stuff... but still, he's so funny by all the things that he does. sam is the smart one. he's always shy and stupid when it comes to girls... finally he ends up by dating angela. chris is the sports guy who doesn't have much to do with school, studying, and stuff like that. he's always funny. and finally... jack! the rock of the show. the oldest of all, the macho guy, "the rock star"... but still, as crazy as everybody else. nick is...helpless with these guys. oh! and i almost forgot! uncle jimmy... he's the man! he's like a 30 year old kid. he's like doing the same stupid things that the boys are doing. i always wondered how did he end up by being a firefighter... and the dog is the image of all the savage family. the thing is... this show had everything to become something really big. it had everything, man! but, of course...they canceled it...

a great show.first, to the people who don't like it..don't like it, then don't watch it...this is(was) an awesome show. better than according to jim (a favorite of mine). it shows a real family household (as opposed to 8 simple rules,etc, where everything goes peachy).they're loud, they're messy....i can sympathize with their dragging all the garbage into the kitchen. it happens in real life..sorta like the "portal to hell", and everyone growling like dogs over the fast-food boxes.it's a "been there" show....you know what's coming, but fun to watch, because you have been there before.a good cast, they work great together, a admirable enough show to warrant a dvd release. mel gibsons "safety videos" were a highlight of the series as well.opinion? good show, really deserving of a dvd release (deserving to not be canceled as well).

am glad that i am not the only one to find this series very good. this is the best series for young ladies! i have so strange taste on comedies and i find so hard one to please my intelligence, and i am so happy that their humor is exactly what i need. love the gang of actors! if anyone knows a series or just a movie similar to this one, i say pretty please write back because i miss the series.and kindly ask the writers and the producers to continue it, even if the actors are now all grown up, i guess!have a nice morning/day/evening/night! (because i do not know the exact time you will be reading this post)

each show is excellent. finally, a show about something other than why it sucks to be married or good looking people talking about why they are like normal people. shame it got canceled.mike scully and julie thacker, formerly of the simpsons, wrote or executive produced some of the funniest episodes of that series and a lot of the similar style humour seeps in here. take officer steve cox and think troy mcclure. however, it does come with its own unique brand of humour and let's face it, a teenage girl will love it just by on the faces alone.what is it with television that cancel most good shows and we are spoon-fed with such abominations as who my mother almost slept with or whatever that show is called? please learn a lesson. not everything has to be about cuteness or romantic travails or especially reality shows on how to demystify every aspect of life. some people actually like to laugh and not have to think afterward. well, my griping is done for the day. now back to the simpsons. when is it on? oh, yes! all the time.

i think that complete savages is a very good tv show and they should make many more episodes. it is one of my favourites!!!! it is very funny and it is really good acting. i say that you should give them a chance to do more episodes. iknow that they can and they should!!!! they should put complete savages on nickelodeon more than what they do! i'm sure that many people will agree with me!!!!! i like the tv show because it is a very good programme for people our age and it is very funny. i also like complete savages because it isn't always about the same thing and things that happen could be real, unlike other yv programmes. when they advertised it, i didn't like the sound of it, but i watched it for the first time and i loved it. complete savages is an excellent comedy and i miss it being on tv!!!!!!!!!! i can't really compare complete savages with any other tv series because it is different!!!!

teen deviyaan is a great film. a very breezy entertainer and a very modern film for its time in the 1960s. the music and songs are terrific though the lyrics of majrooh are meaningless at places. dev anand is a tremendous star and as usual does great justice to his role. kalpana is sexy and nanda is ok. simi too is just about ok. the film has terrific dialogue by vrajendra gaur who wrote most of dev anand's films like mahal, duniya, warrant, jaali note, manzil, etc.etc.it is a story of dev getting attracted to three females - the mod kalpana, simi and the homely nanda. he eventually opts for nanda. the story is about ok but its been narrated in a gripping way and the dialogue and songs and the great dev anand are the highlight of the film. a must watch film for all dev anand fans.

one of the best romantic classic,teen deviyaan is a film which is all about selecting among equals your most soft emotion,love.this is a simple story of a middle class man who came into limelight by his poetic talent and charming personality. he is attracted towards three women and vice versa, one a hindi movie star, the second a rich lady and the third who lives in his neighborhood.the situation put him in confusion as he has to decide one of them as his life partner.he asked for few days from all of them.ultimately he goes to a astrologer and asked him who he loves most.his confusion is no more and he came to know the lady living in his neighborhood who really cares for him and loves him is his true love.devanand played the lead character and has fully justified his contemporary romantic image.

i saw teen devian in 1993 telecasted in doordarshan on a friday night, and could scarcely believe that such a remarkable film was ever made in bollywood. it was mind blowing  a film with a "modern" storyline, superb music, three lovely ladies and my fave superstar dev anand.in this unusual storyline, dev falls in love with three women  the simple nanda, the ravishing kalpana and the sophisticated simi. they too are enamored with him and want to marry him. this puts dev in a dilemma (which is the crux of the storyline)- whom to marry?. he consults a hypnotist who asks dev to gaze into a crystal ball. dev finds the answer and marries nanda. beautifully directed (most probably by dev saheb himself & not by amarjeet the official director) the b&w classic has evergreen music  some of sd burman's (helped generously by rd burman) best compositions. "uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth" is the probably the most sexiest song ever composed in hindi films. credit should also be given to majrooh sultanpuri for penning the memorable lyrics teen devian is a breezy musical which completely suited the style of dev anand and he did full justice to the role. unfortunately teen devian has never received the recognition & popularity it richly deserves.a must see for any hindi film buff, i will rate the eternal favourite 9.5 out of 10.

i think it was way back in 1987 that we had our exams and my friend and i saw in the papers that one of the theatres was playing 'teen deviyan'. we decided to go just for the heck of it without hoping anything great. but we were in for a pleasant surprise. the movie was made in 1965 but even by today's standards, the plot was absolutely modern and way ahead of its times. the music was wonderful and dev anand as a city bred looked and acted his best. i still remember that elated feeling when we came out of the theatre after the movie was over. whoever thought of this story of one man falling for three very different girls at the same time? no he is not three timing or fooling them but he genuinely likes all three of them for different reasons. one is homely, one is an actress and the third is a 'high society' girl who can also help dev in his career as a poet. the question is which one is the 'one' for him. what makes the matter worse is that all three of them like him too. when things come to an impasse, a hypnotist takes him in and in his hypnotized state he dreams of his future with each one of them and reaches the right decision.this dream of his which is the only colored part in an otherwise black-n-white movie is the crux of the film but surprisingly is edited out from most of the versions available today. if you want to watch this movie make sure that this part is intact. in case you watch this movie without this part and get confused, don't worry because you just watched an incomplete movie.

for all intents and purposes, 'teen devian' might seem like just another lightweight bollywood musical. to some extent, this might even be true, especially because the producers had to be sure that the film succeeded with the masses. but somewhere behind the scenes, either sadashiv brahmam (who had the 'idea' for this story) or amerjeet (who directed the film) decided that there would be a twist to the usual formula, and succeeded perhaps beyond even their own expectations.this is not simply about a handsome man flirting with 3 women, undecided on whom to choose as his life's partner. dev anand's character was really in love with each of the 3 women at various times, and they with him, despite being aware of the other two. dev anand's relationship with simi and kalpana is particularly interesting - in that each of the women comes to depend on him heavily. there are quite a lot of suggestive teasers in the stars' body language that lend themselves to imagination depending on the viewer's maturity. the theme is surprisingly adult and after all that it was ashame that the ending was tame, obviously designed to please the masses and deflect criticism.

this flick is strange but i liked it a lot. its about a good girl who loves her bad boy and their messed up honeymoon. he doesn't love her back and he's a mean son of a bitch. he starts to love her after some really whacked stuff happens on their honeymoon i wont give it away. its weird yeah!! but different than other movies in a good way i think. i don't know what to compare it to but its a love story. but has lots of funny stuff too. like get to see james franco in a wig. i liked the notebook a lot and it kinda felt like that because of the love story. but the rest is way different. nothing like that. sienna miller is really good. i saw this movie at a test screener because i like her a lot and her fashion. i liked her in factory girl but this is a better movie than that was. her and james franco look really in love in this movie and i hope they are together in real life but don't knowsee it!!!!

i saw this at a test screening in chatsworth a week or so ago, and went with a bunch of my girlfriends. we all really loved it a lot. james franco is amazing and so hot, i would see it just for him!!!!!!! but sienna miller is also really good and plays a southern girl who is in love with him so much that she can't let go. david caradine who was in kill bill plays a cowboy and he is perfect for that. the story is kind of strange but if you believe in the power of love and magical things you will love it!!! it is really original, and it is also very funny and everyone laughed a lot but by the end it gets more serious and we all ended up crying. i am going to see it again with my friends as soon as it comes out, it is really good!!!!!!!

this movie rocked!!!! saw it at a screener a coupla weeks ago. kinda a strange story, where james franco plays this jerk who marries sienna miller just to get out of the country and they go to niagara falls for their honeymoon. don't wanna give it away cuz the movie isn't released yet but its totally cool and you would never expect the stuff that happens. i kinda thought i would hate it cuz its a romance but its also kinda twisted and stuff which i like a lot. the acting is really good and sienna miller is totally smokin' and plays this really sweet girl. i think she should do more roles like this. james plays a jerk but you end up liking him and the end of the movie is really good. david carradine plays a cowboy and he is good. i gave this movie a 10 because i came out of the movie really liking it and wanting to see it again which i didn't expect and my girlfriend really liked it and cried. good date flick

i saw this movie at a screener and its the best movie i have seen in a loooong time. i loved it!!!! james franco is sooo hot and him and sienna miller make the perfect couple. i don't want to give away what happens but they play a pair of newlyweds who go off on their honeymoon to niagara falls and some pretty wild stuff happens along the way....the movie is really really funny and sad and original. i can't even say what it reminded me of, but go see it! i cried so hard but really loved it and wanna see it again as soon as it comes out! my friends cried too. i hope it comes out soon - does anyone know when? i would really go see it if i were you

i loved it. others have revealed spoilers, but i won't. it was an unusual premise, actually sort of weird, but i went along with it completely. camille was a difficult part to pull off convincingly; maybe that's why some people hated it. but i think sienna was excellent and her acting skills enabled her to nail the part perfectly - without being maudlin or ridiculous. i don't know why she was even interested in a loser like james franco, but married him anyway. i like him as an actor and also thought he did a terrific job. he has nothing to be ashamed of. there have been movies with with similar setups e.g. "ghost". i simply love sienna miller and went along with the situation as written in the script. i feel her great acting talent is vastly underrated, and hope it becomes more recognized by the public. i thought all of the actors played their parts very well, and hope more people get to see the movie. i highly recommend it. i was surprised that my local block buster store had about 10 copies available. i definitely plan to buy it.

an unusual movie, which starts off with the classic premise of a hooligan who marries a girl who loves him in order to escape the country. but a twist soon turns the tale upside down. most of the film hits the right buttons: the story develops smoothly, acting is solid (sienna miller's drawl is priceless, she really can act!), chemistry between both leads works, and rolling american rural scapes and quirky side characters really make for a good time. the mood, which starts off as light and romantic soon moves into something darker and downright eery at times.at times though the pace slows just a tad more than we would like, but don't let this stop you watching this unusual little cinematic treat. alexandre montin, paris

as most people i am tired of the by the numbers clichéd movies that hollywood makes. there seems to be no creativity in hollywood. companies only want to spend money on remakes are sequels that have an audience built in.this movie is a welcome change. it could be classified as romantic comedy for it's genre but don't let that turn you off this movie. this is a very original movie which is not like most things hollywood produces.if you are reading this, you already know the basic plot so i will not bother going over that. the only movies that come to mind to compare this to are "interstate 60" and "art of travel" which are little known gems that take a different path than most of the hollywood garbage.this is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching more of the same.dean

super original. really great movie! james franco and sienna miller really do go so well together on screen. i sure hope it comes out soon. i first saw this movie at a screening. because of my age and gender, i was asked to stay for a "talk." we all got to comment on the movie and a lot of people didn't seem to like it. i really loved it and i don't know why so many people didn't think it was that good. go see it when it comes out and decide for yourself! one thing that you might want to do if you are going to see this movie is to go into it not knowing anything about it. i had not known anything when i went to the screening other than, it was called, "camile." it really is worth seeing.

"edge of the city" is another movie that owes a lot of credit to "on the waterfront". from it's nyc locations, to its score, to the belief that whatever trouble you may be in, you can somehow right your wrongs."edge" also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism. in my opinion, that is where the movie does not succeed like "waterfront". at 85 minutes the movie rushes through the establishment of relationships, and ties everything up so quickly that much of it seems forced and unbelievable.possible spoilers****the relationship between sidney poitier and john cassavettes could have been further developed in the beginning. i don't believe that these two characters, from two very different places would have built such a strong relationship so quickly. i think that the whole love sub-plot with cassavettes could have been eliminated. he is so awkward with a woman that it becomes painful to watch. the only reason why it is in the movie is so that she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end. there are other ways that they could have shown this. i would have also liked to see some scenes of axel in the army to illustrate why he is the way he is.the acting is excellent. poitier is terrific in a role that is beautifully written. his role as tyler is interesting and multi-layered, and (especially for 1957), a man who is confident, respected, and intelligent. cassavettes, as axel north, while very good, does not seem quite right for the part. warden is terrific as the boss who knows axel's secret (although his fight scene with cassavettes at the end is staged horribly. too many break-away boxes). i thought ruby dee was wonderful in role of poitier's wife.on the whole, "edge of the city" is a smart, movie with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style picture, without taking the time to let the drama build.7 out of 10

a skillfully directed film by martin ritt where a drifter and anti-hero, john cassevetes lands in n.y. to escape a tragic incident in his life, where he killed his brother in an automobile accident as well as going awol from the army.cassavetes, always an intense actor, shows grit in his portrayal of a film. am surprised that montgomery clift didn't get this part.ruth white is his mother and does remarkably well in two scenes on the telephone.once in new york, he befriends sidney poitier as the two work on the docks. immediately, jack warden, a bully and villain in this film,takes a dislike to him and tragedy ensues when poitier tries to defend his friend.ruby dee, plays poitier's wife in this film, and is brilliant in a scene where she urges cassavetes to reveal the killer of her husband.this is definitely an interesting film of moral values and the loner in society. with the backdrop of tenements, the right mood is depicted in the film.

i watched this movie a long time ago, but i've always loved it. the story is about a young girl, sally o'moyne who finds out at a young age that when she prays to st. anne, her prayers are answered, hence her missing lunch pail and a mean neighbor who tattles on her and she prays, that someone should give him a black eye for tattling. well, a minute later something hits him and he has a black eye. sally then believes in the power of prayer and decides to use that power for good. she is well known and loved around the neighborhood as she has copybooks/journals filled with all her friends requests to st. anne.meanwhile, a local boy returns home from college (i believe) and sally is awestruck at how much he's grown-up. sally has a huge crush on him, but is so shy. should she use her power of prayer to st. anne for her own selfish desire or just watch as the most popular girls in school try to snare the man of her dreams? this is a fun filled movie with a grandfather who is so charming and irish, brother's who are hilariously annoying and a sworn irish neighbor-enemy who spars with grand-pop on an everyday basis. he has his own story of wanting to buy the o'moynes property which is a little house in the middle of two huge apartment complexes (his own), in other words, the o'moynes house is an eye-sore to his lovely buildings.this movie is definitely worth a watch and is good enough and rare enough to add to your movie collection. i hope you enjoy!

this film centered on a young lady who makes prayers to help her family and friends when they encounter difficulties in life. it made me think of other movies like the "song of bernadette" and "francis of assisi" and has a very strong catholic faith influence in the film. ann blyth is very charming as first, the catholic school student and then later as a young woman who buys a statue of saint anne (which is the name of the street that i live on, by the way) and makes many prayers for the saint's intercession whenever problems come up in her life. frances bavier (aunt bea from the andy griffith show) and edmund gwenn (from miracle on 34th street) play relatives of her. a local priest of mine used to say that my sister resembled ann blyth and the both of them have the same first and middle names. a nice good family film that came from an era when life was a bit more simpler.

wonderful family film that should be a staple at christmas time. it's a mystery to me why it isn't. a true lost film that i first encountered, flickering away on my old 19" black and white rca, when the million dollar movie was still in vogue on channel 9 in new york city. this rudolph mate directed fantasy should be nestled under everyone's christmas tree. but it has never been released on home video. too bad. i believe i saw part of it on amc a few years ago, before they cut many of their older films from the rotation. tcm should take up the slack and play it at easter or on christmas eve. any movie with santa, aunt bee, the hostess cupcake lady, and an actor with the first name king, can't be bad. ann blyth as "sally" is a bundle of energy. during her school years, she rushes over to the chapel to pray for st. ann to help and give guidance to her mixed-up and financially strapped family. it works. so, after she graduates, she places a statue of st. ann in her own bedroom. at one point the entire o'moyne residence is moved to another address. i think this was done to put an end to a neighbor dispute between the o'moynes and the dastardly fellow next door. blyth is cute as a button. edmund gwen can play the reclusive grandfather in his sleep. all-in-all, this is a satisfying movie experience.

this is a family comedy -- in the very best senses of the term. uncomplicatedly about faith and family, ann blyth, with the help of everybody's favorite grandpa, edmund gwenn, gets divine help in lifting the o'moyne's above the would-be vengeance schemes of goldtooth mccarthy (john mcintire). pure fun.

dan dailey gives a sincere and colorful performance as the great dizzy dean. his handling of the character is very true to life and captures the flavor of dean's background and limited education. the film of course centers around dizzy deans rise to fame and his sudden trip to the sidelines with an injury he chose to ignore, much to his regret. his wife is splendidly portrayed by joanna dru who gives a very down to earth quality to the woman who loved and supported the ballplayer who rose to a "dizzying height" so quickly. the portrayal of dizzy's later career as a sportscaster is honest and unflinching, reflecting his troubles which stemmed from his poor education and his colorful language both on and off the air. dizzy was quite a character and daily has breathed life into his story with admirable skill. if you enjoyed this film, i recommend the comedy "kid from left field" (1953) wherein daily plays a down and out has-been ballplayer idolized by his young son (billy chapin). daily again fleshes out a ballplayer in a completely satisfying manner. i heartily recommend pride of st. louis to baseball fans everywhere.

in a sport that prizes quirkiness and treasures it's characters, one of the greatest of them from the 1930s was pitcher dizzy dean. he was so colorful a personality he was probably elected to the baseball hall of fame on the strength of that as opposed to his pitching statistics. after all part of the dean story is that early end to his career.in the pride of st. louis dan dailey successfully captures the character of dizzy dean, at least the dean i remember. i'm not old enough to remember him pitching, but i do remember him broadcasting baseball game of the week during the 1960s. for that's part of the dean story as well, being a pioneer broadcaster on radio and later television. now that announcers are in the hall of fame, there's no question dizzy belongs there.jerome herman dean was one of a tribe of sharecropper's kids who had very little schooling, but an amazing talent for throwing a baseball at blinding speed. in fact he had a younger brother paul dean who was a pretty good pitcher himself.richard crenna plays paul in this film and it's one of his earliest film roles. paul dean in real life was a quiet retiring sort who's career was also cut short by injuries. because of that crenna isn't given much to work with. during the dean heyday, sportswriters tried to pin the nickname of daffy on paul, but it never took. joanne dru, taking a break from playing, western gals in gingham dresses and corsets is first rate as the wise, patient, and understanding patricia nash who met and married dizzy while he was playing for houston in the texas league. in the 1937 all star game dizzy started for the national league. facing cleveland's earl averill, dean was hit on the foot by a line drive smack at him. refusing to listen to medical advice, dean came back to pitch too early. he'd broken a big toe and put too much of a strain on his arm. he was never the same pitcher and his refusal to accept that is part of the story. had he had a career of say ten to fifteen years who knows what pitching statistics he might have rolled up. dean was the next to last pitcher to win 30 games in 1934 and after denny mclain(who was something of a character himself)did it 1968 it hasn't been done since.dean went into broadcasting and while he was not the first former player to go into the broadcast booth, his colorful game descriptions made him an instant hit. he started broadcasting for the other st. louis team, the browns, and the browns were a pretty miserable team with not much to cheer about. dean became a star attraction there.of course part of the dean story is the trouble he got into because of his lack of education and his colorful way of expressing himself on the air. that's part of the story i won't go into, but in the film it's handled with tact and humility and your eyes might moisten if you tend to the sentimental.a fine baseball film, a real tribute to an american success story.

fred was such a great show.it was simple but somehow very addicting.i can still remember the days when i'd watch this on kids wb saturdays ,but then kids wb did the unforgivable.kids wb became like that older relative that tries to act "hip" and "funky fresh".*shudder*they became like that relative who tries to act all cool ,but the attempt is a cheesy disaster.they pulled coconut fred's fruit salad inland and all the other good shows to put on some of the most pointless shows i've ever seen in my life(johnny test).the only thing that keeps me watching kwb anymore is the occasional bits of the old shows and the anime on 4kids.it was such a huge mistake to pull this show off of the schedule.this brings me back to my first point... bring it back!!!

"coconut fred's fruit salad island!" is a hilarious show that is on saturday mornings on wb. it stars coconut fred and all of his friends on the island, and every episode is a very funny misadventure of theirs. most of the time, it is because of coconut fred's trouble making antics which makes it funny, and other stuff going on on the island at the same time. the humor is great and nobody on the island is very bright at all, which adds it being as amusing as it is. i don't think this could be funnier. the voice talents of the characters are magnificently superior and are exaggerated, which adds to the show's hilarity. if this is ever on dvd, i'm getting it a.s.a.p!strongly recommended for a good laugh.

fans of apocalyptic movies will savor this well-made low-budget thriller that is essentially a remake of the 1951 george pal classic "when worlds collide." a comet is headed for a near-collision with earth, and when his fellow scientists disregard his warnings of doom, eccentric scientist peter crawford (dennis hopper) gathers a group of private investors to secretly construct an underground sanctuary.the story unfolds through the eyes of muscle-bound gulf-war veteran jake lowe (peter onorati)who inadvertently discovers crawford's hidden sanctuary and then decides that crawford is wrong for keeping his project hidden from the rest of humanity. as the comet approaches, the subject of who should live and who should die makes for interesting drama.while the special effects are not in the same league, i enjoyed the story more than i did spielberg's war of the worlds, because i feel this screenplay is better. some suspension of scientific reality is required, but it's worthwhile for the development of a good story. i highly recommend this film to fans of the genre.

for a movie shot in 18 days and a budget less than 2 million, this little movie that could deserves a 'best we could' award. interesting premise (aside from the usual meteor stuff) with solid perfs by a cast of familiar faces. 2 thumbs up. advice to the other reviewer: don't be afraid to say you liked something.

a £3.50 dvd can be a gamble and this was one that sort of paid off.a decent saturday night type movie that entertains if you gloss over the obvious plot flaws. special effects are a bit few and far between with some repetition (and why does london always look as if it's in the 60's ?)if it had the budget of, say, armageddon then i'm sure it would have performed better at the box office as the story is quite a good one.overall, tycus is consigned to b movie history but if you see it for £3.50 then it's worth buying.

uzumaki, is a visually stunning film, and i don't think anyone is going to be able to argue that. but, unfortunately, the story somewhat falls flat.the film nevertheless is very entertaining. it uses it's wild style to tell a somewhat non-existant story. the film almost works, just based on it's characters and style, but in my opinion, leaves something to be desired.

i enjoyed this film very much. it effectively combines humor, fantasy, and a few moments of horror with a solid film making effort from higuchinsky. brilliant visuals and a very original story concerning spirals. my only complaints are that it had its dull moments and wasn't as daring as it could have been. still, i give this a solid 8 out of 10. the u.s. should take note of this and other fine japanese horror/fantasy films that have come along recently and have them available on region 1 dvd. actually, asian cinema in general, have some of the finest films that have been unnoticed by the american public because they're hard to find. i strongly recommend people to go look for these treasures, they're hard to find, but once you find them, you'll be glad you did.

wow.. i just saw this movie on the sundance channel, and it really is bizarre. i may not be a film expert, but it's probably the most bizarre film i, as an average movie fan, have seen.whoever came up with with it had a great imagination. i'm a bit of a fan of japanese dramas, and there are often actors from dramas in movies.. (matsushima nanako, for example, the lead in ringu, is a major j-drama star.) but it looks like this is the first film for kirie and shuichi's portrayers. i must say, if they really are debuting here, they do a pretty good job.kirie was a very sympathetic character, i thought she was easy to relate with. she was kind and good-hearted, perhaps not the most popular girl but nicer than some of the other attention-seeking girls. she was also pretty in a classic kind of way. i hope she does more films, but it's been a couple years so maybe she has no such plans.the ending was odd. i'm not going to give anything away, but the rest of the movie's bizarreness was kind of put to shame.very bizarre, but very imaginative and unique movie. i'd recommend it for japanese horror fans, though i'll warn you, it's a lot more bizarre than ringu.nonetheless, i'd give it a 7.5 out of 10, for originality, imagination, good characterization, above average acting, and just being plain intriguing.

as is frequently the case when manga is translated into live action, there is quite a bit lost in the translation. however, this remains a highly entertaining film. the premise is unusual and it is presented in the quiet, understated style so prevalent in japanese films (ha!). the special effects are a little 70s camp but, it adds to the comic book feel of the film. i wouldn't recommend this film to everyone but, if you are familiar with (and enjoyed) other japanese horror films like "evil dead's trap", this film will appeal to you.

hey now, i have never laid eyes on a manga comic, but apparently this movie is based on one. ah well, such is life. anyway, this is a pretty bizarre, to say the least, movie, as things literally spiral out of control in a small japanese town. people are becoming obsessed with the uzumaki (spiral) and this young girl watches her friend's father videotape a snail, and later in the movie, people start becoming snails? it also seems this boy's dad becomes so obsessed he somehow commits suicide in a household appliance. there is some bizarre humor here that might be at home in a tim burton movie, but there is some nastiness & gore like only the japanese can do with justice. as with a lot of japanese films though, the ending is the ending, and did anything get resolved? well, not to my mind, it didn't. there are some hints as to why this is all happening but they aren't explored and there's a lot left to either the imagination or else it wasn't deemed important. still though, there are lots of things for the eye to feast on and if you aren't obsessed with everything making perfect sense, this is well worth seeing, because it's just so original and bizarre. my favorite was the father with the spinning eyeballs, personally. 8 out of 10 stars.

i've seen a fair few films from the far east recently.....some were excellent (battle royale, infernal affairs, the eye), and some were not so great (versus, the triple cross). then there are ones like uzumaki and returner, which while flawed i still enjoyed.the basic premise involves the mysterious and horrific effects that a growing obsession with spirals has upon a community. sound silly? yeah, thats what i was thought. firstly, the good stuff. direction was top notch, sure a bit over the top in places but never the less interesting and stylish. secondly the story, was original and like other writers commented very lovelace-esq...it was interesting. what it reminded me most of however was early cronenberg; films like shivers and videodrome.the acting wasn't great, but not too horrible either. to be honest i was actually bored on a few occations....i felt the pacing especially initially was a little slow. my main problem was that it was too silly and funny to be true horror, and yet not so enough to be considered a comedy. *spoilers* below.*spoilers* some good scenes (washing machine =)) and i liked the final shot/voiceover. at first i thought it ended far too abruptly but about 20 seconds later i realised the meaning and liked the end. however, because of the lack of seriousness in the story, combined with over the top scenes such as the news report at the school ment that i did not care for the characters much in the end. the final scene which was perhaps supposed to be a little poignent, while in reality i couldn't really care for the girl or her boyfriend. *spoilers end*so overall i kinda did like this film, but it frustrated me and i think there was real potential in addition to some good scenes. couple of other points, the main girl is quite pretty and cute, and the song that plays at the end is good too. i rated it 7/10.

i happen to have read all of junji ito's english released manga. i watched the tomie film and it was a big steaming pile of turd. thankfully uzumaki actually does justice to the manga. i think those who have read the manga will really appreciate this film more, as many screenshots and camera angles are exactly like in the manga and it is interesting to see how the book characters are played in the film. this film reminds me of eerie indiana. the ending differs to the manga, which i was expecting. kirie looks like her manga counterpart, and her male friend suits the whole very well. very creepy i have to admit, this film feels like a feverish nightmare, the kind you have when you were a kid. not really scary at all, but freaky, if you get my drift? another great horror from japan, get yourself a copy.

it's very true that this film defies convention by not spelling out the plot for the viewer. while some may have a problem with having to figure it out for themselves, i embrace "uzumaki" for its irreverence. there is a plot, it's just that it may not be immediately accessible to a lazy viewer. this is a film that invites numerous interpretations, as all great art does - however, this film is also very entertaining, making it a rare film experience. it's simultaneously provocative and fun.

"uzumaki" takes place in a small japanese rural town,where people are going mad.they go nuts over vortexes and spirals.the crisis is getting worse,because people are turning into snails and vortexes appear everywhere."uzumaki" has to be one of the most bizarre and original horror movies i have seen.the plot is really clever and the gore scenes are really funny as the film doesn't takes itself too seriously."uzumaki" is wonderfully photographed and the use of colors is top-notch.the characters are likeable and there is enough shocking surprises to satisfy fans of japanese horror.despite of some hilarious scenes,the overall tone of this film is pretty dark."uzumaki" is not as good as "ringu","ju-on" or "audition",but if you like japanese horror movies you won't be disappointed.7 out of 10.

a town in japan is being taken over by a horribly brutal abstract shape: the spiral. it's becoming a theme in everything from animals to clouds to people and twisting them, mentally and literally. this film shows it happening to several groups of people. some demonic possession is implied, but nothing is entirely sure except that the best bet is to get the heck out of dodge. the film progresses really well from normal life to abnormal phenomena (giant snails and crazy people) to the truly supernatural (walking dead).as a jaded american horror movie fan, this was just what i needed. maybe it was just the novelty of a different culture's film, but it seemed to have a very original progression, set of characters, and the premise was definitely new. the japanese may think "horror shapes" (uzumaki means "spiral," i'm told) are old by now, but it was nice for me because i'm used to monster/alien/virus/disaster/undead films. in an american movie, you know who's going to die (the annoying/nasty/lascivious/racist characters) and who will live (the children/heroine/dogs/cats/nice guy). that's not true in japanese horror. it was not predictable how they would fight the evil or how it would end up. also, it had this really new (but probably typically japanese) color leached pacific northwest style cloudy day thing going, which was a fresh visual effect for me. the horrific moments were seriously creepy, relying on a little gore but mainly just impossibly overdone facial expressions (think the ring) and body manipulations. this should be one of the greats, up there with once-original ideas like the first nightmare on elm street or night of the living dead.

each frame in the movie is a lesson to new directors or existing directors to know how a movie should be taken. hats off to sekhar. he is underestimated in indian film industry. the director has got all the qualities in taking this movie in the range of satyajir ray, adoor.. every character is portrayed effectively in the movie. though it's simple story, it's been taken to such extent it can be considered to one of the best in india. i don't have enough adjectives to praise the movie. just as the way the life goes in day-today atmosphere, the movie has been taken. though the songs in indian movies are considered to a weak area, songs in this movie has given extra energy to the potential of the movie..especially background score..it's amazing

anand is one of those low-budget but well taken movies. it's a "cup of coffee" entertainment, with no violence, blood or "jump out of your seat" excitement which most telugu films have. however, it does have some massala of it's own. roopa is a headstrong and down-to-earth young woman who is not afraid to confront any sort of situation, even her offensive mother-in-law's distaste for her. she even backs out of the wedding because her fiancé doesn't stand up for her. however, her air of confidence and independence is enough to make anand, a rich young gentleman living in the city, aspire to be her new husband. his father accidentally kills her parents in a car crash anyways, so why not pay her back? but roopa is not the kind who will fall for charming smiles and polite behavior, she puts him through a bunch of situations, continuing to be rude and a pain. it's not until he stands up for her and saves her life that she understands she loves him too. but complications ensue

ok, so i'm not usually one that runs out and rents foreign movies...especially foreign dark comedies. i think i can count on one hand the number of films that i found genuinely hilarious from beginning to end. this movie will be added to the short list. even dark comedies right out of hollywood sometimes turn me off because they require an incredibly dry sense of humor. but this one had my eyes welling up with tears. my sides hurt. i haven't laughed that hard in a long time. this movie was recommended by my mother and i don't think i would have even dreamed of watching it had she not raved about it. don't be afraid of having to read during your movie - you'll miss out on a hilariously well-acted flick.

of adam's apple and with your permission. i didn't know until looking it up just now. also the errrrrrmmmmm 'wilbur wants to kill himself' i prefer this very focused deadpan ...drama over adam's apple's over the top comedic zeal. but with your permission is much more layered and subtle, but that's another director.once the 'meaty' part of the story takes place i felt the dread of coming back to the shop again and again. a bit claustrophobic .. maybe that is intentional. it builds on the atmosphere. you dread the rediscovery and again and again until the 'kick in the shin'.this is some funny stuff.

send them to the freezer. this is the solution two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh. an incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror film. the complex characters defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile - if you can stand it. definitely a dark film but also a bit redemptive.

not sure i've ever seen a black comedy from denamark before but this is quite good actually. the humor is suitably low-key and deadpan to go with some of the gruesome activity. svend and bjarne are fed up with working for their boss, because he's always putting them down (in fact he mentions that they weren't bright enough to unzip before peeing at one point). they do what they have to to start their own butcher shop and when a workman is accidentally locked in the cooler overnight while fixing a light, they hit upon something that makes their butcher shop far more popular than their old boss's. in fact, he's the one they sold their first "filets" to, and it's partly his fault, since he served them at a rotary dinner at his house and the guests raved about it and showed up at svend and bjarnes the next day. bjarne is somewhat horrified what svend has done but it doesn't stop there. svend has risen above his sad little existence to be someone of some popularity which is new for him and he doesn't want to let go of that, so the freezer continues to fill up with all manner of acquaintances (and, at one point, "a small swede from the park"). suspiccions arise, though, because ex-boss holger thinks something is wrong. bjarne is also haunted by his twin brother eigil, who lived in a sanitarium for years in a coma and whom bjarne wanted the plug pulled on so he could get inheritance money to help open the shop. when eigil was taken off the respirator he was revived, much to bjarne's horror. and bjarne has a love interest too in astrid, who works at the cemetery. neither svend nor bjarne are well adjusted individuals and so things start to spiral out of control. the deadpan humor really makes this, and while this isn't exactly laugh out loud material it certainly is amusing. it is somewhat creepy though considering the cuts of meat and body parts casually lying around, especially since these two take it all so matter-of-fact. if you're a fan of black comedies this is recommended, i liked it quite well myself. 8 out of 10.

not entirely sure how i stumbled upon this movie, but i'm so glad i did. initially, we were put off by the fact that it was subtitled, but even my dyslexic brother who hates to read (especially at the weekend) enjoyed this film. i found the script fantastic and the way it was delivered in such a dead-pan manner only added to the puddles of pee on my sofa. not entirely sure whether it's quite so funny to the native danish as the comedy seems to be enhanced by the tonelessness of the subtitles and the ambiguity of the translation. i haven't watched many danish films (or any for that matter), but judging by this film i'm guessing they're not constrained by the same political correctness as elsewhere (gawd bless 'em) making the character of eigel a breath of fresh air, because let's face it special needs are funny. there are so many great one-liners in this film it puts american sitcoms to shame.

my family watches this movie over and over. even our 3 year old loves it. i like the "goodness" in the movie. giving the stranger a chance...showing goodwill to one obviously in need of some unconditional acceptance. the movie gives a feeling of goodwill and victory. one other aspect of the movie that makes it so appealing is the personalities of velvet's siblings. the bird lover. the bug lover. the boy lover! very cute and happy movie. there is one thing, however that is irritating about it. that is how mrs. brown often makes mr. brown look foolish or unwise. she, at times,comes off as a know it all, and he as a dimwit, which he is not. too bad to put that into such a nice story. nevertheless, we will continue to enjoy this wonderful, old movie!

i hope we never become to cynical as a society to appreciate the simple beauty of this movie: beautiful to look at with its romantic english countryside, and beautiful in its message of faith and loyalty. watch this with your children, especially your young daughters- velvet brown is a wonderful role model for girls. this was one of my daughter's favorite films.the story is based on a best selling book by enid bagnold about a girl, velvet, whose whole life is her horse, pi, and about her single-minded pursuit of her "impossible" dream. i won't say anymore about the plot less i spoil it for first-time viewers. she lives with a big loving family in a small coastal village.this is the movie that made elizabeth taylor a star, and to watch the film is to understand why. she is a natural actress who radiates an inner beauty that matches her outward beauty- trusting, passionate, innocent- she is the emotional core of the movie.mickey rooney gives a wonderful performance as mi, the young man who arrives on their doorstep one day, stays, and helps velvet train the pi. this is one of his finest performances. also standing out is anne revere as velvet's mother in an academy award winning role. her strong, loving and wise character understands that life isn't of much value unless you follow your dreams: "we're alike. i, too, believe that everyone should have a chance at a breathtaking piece of folly once in his life." i heartily recommend this very sweet, very inspiring classic from hollywood's golden age.

first, let me say that i find films like shawshank redemption and green mile, and most of spielberg to be absolutely horrid and stomach turning. although, national velvet on the surface would seem to be in the same genre and has what should be cringe-worthy moments, i thoroughly enjoyed it, laughing and bawling throughout the film.the premise of the plot, a young girl with an unknown horse from a small village entering the grand national is certainly as implausible as could be, but it is the only thing that you have to accept for it to work as a fairy tale or allegory. the characters have depth and grow throughout the story. ann revere gives an absolutely stunning performance as one of the wisest women ever depicted in an american film. her interaction with the good-hearted donald crisp is funny and sweet. while liz taylor tries a bit too hard to be even cuter than margaret o'brien (she succeeds btw), her passion and love for her horse shines through her face. mickey rooney gives a beautifully nuanced performance of the trainer.this is far from a perfect movie. some of the situations and scenes are a bit corny and dated (the kids' antics, and rooney's scenes at the track and in the pub for example) but it doesn't matter. the plot remains true to the characters and leaves quite a bit unsaid. we don't have unnatural overly dramatic and preachy moments - sometimes more is less. the final scene is a great example of this - the emotional dialog is left to the viewer to fill in.strong understated performances, rounded characters, pithy dialog, intelligent and internally consistent storyline. we believe in the characters and are moved by their story. yup - they just don't make them like this any more...

national velvet (1944) the movie that put taylor on the map. costarring the then number one box office champ, mickey rooney. taylor plays a girl in love with her horse and when jockey mickey rooney is unable to ride in the grand national race, spunky liz cuts her hair, pretends to be a boy and races the horse to...well i won't spoil the end for you. it's quality melodrama that mgm was famous for putting out. and it's another early color picture to boot!

this is a delightful film. elizabeth taylor does a wonderful job, as does mickey rooney. the film just makes you feel happy. it's inspirational, and even though some parts are a bit overly sentimental, that is easily forgiven. i could watch this movie again and again. the race at the end is exciting every time i see it. highly recommend this film.

this is the greatest movie if you want inspiration on following your heart and never giving up on your dream. elizabeth taylor is velvet and in her prime (of her childhood, at least), mickey rooney is a cynical friend who eventually becomes her trainer and they go off to the grand national steeplechase with her beloved horse "the pi"--short for "pirate"--only to have velvet become the jockey and have a chance at victory. to those of you who have not seen it yet, i won't give away the ending but you should see it and once you do you'll love it. notice a very young angela lansbury as velvet's eldest sister.

mickey rooney (as mi taylor) is a young man drifting along the figurative road to ruin, where he meets 12-year-old elizabeth taylor (as velvet brown) - she adores horses, but he has a sad history with the animals. ms. taylor is enamored with mr. rooney's horse-sense; she takes him home, and gets him room and board with her family. they are supported very well by anne revere and donald crisp (as mr. and mrs. brown). butch jenkins and angela lansbury are taylor's strained siblings.the plot of "national velvet" is implausible to a fault; for example, the circumstances leading to taylor's ride in the "big race" are quite a stretch (but were likely more believable on paper). still, the characters' connection to horses, and to ms. revere's character are nicely conceived. rooney and taylor are excellent in the starring roles; there is a balance between rooney's fading "child star" and taylor's exuberant new "child star", which adds depth to their characterizations.the excellent performances of rooney and taylor are further enhanced by fine direction, photography, and editing from clarence brown, leonard smith, and robert kern. a sentimental classic. ******** national velvet (12/14/44) clarence brown ~ mickey rooney, elizabeth taylor, anne revere

it's a beautiful film.the scenes are well pictured.anne revere 's dialogs are really well written and inspiring,the philosophy and thoughts that this film gives and the things it teaches makes it great and wonderful.mickey rooney is great in the movie and his role goes through lot of emotional turmoil as the film progresses.elizabeth taylor looks very pretty,her scenes in the film are inherently poetic,the way camera follows her and the way the music make you feel make every scene of her ethereally beautiful.this movie has great spirit and a beloved cherished classic.angela lansbury is quite amusing in her role though unrecognizable if you have seen her in role of 'm' in 'the manchurian candidate'.donald crisp has done his father's role full justice and the script provides him with ample stuff to justify his role.its a very nice film and a must watch for family and children an evergreen christmas favorite.

in my opinion, national velvet is one of the top family classic's of all time. it features mickey rooney as (mi taylor) and elizabeth taylor as (velvet brown).velvet wins a race horse, named (pie) in a raffle. she falls in love with it right away. with the help of mi, an ex-jockey, they train it to race in the grand national's. after the jockey who was scheduled to race pie backs out at the last moment, mi convinces velvet to take his place.this was a well put together motion picture. fine storyline and top notch acting. the inner play between elizabeth and mickey was magical. this is a wonderful family picture expertly directed by clarence brown. the photography is stunning. this is a movie you will enjoy for years to come.this picture is what made elizabeth taylor a household name. both mickey and elizabeth remained close after the film. they still send post cards to each other after all these many years. one side note. elizabeth loved the horse "pie" so much that the studio gave it to her.

"national velvet" tells the story of velvet brown, a young english girl with dreams of entering her beloved horse into competition at the prestigious grand national horse race. the film follows her as she trains her horse with the aid of a former jockey and the support of her parents.while "national velvet" is a family film that fact shouldn't deter anyone who typically views such films with derision. the film is indeed one that will appeal to the entire family, not just attention-addled youngsters. it even managed to land five oscar nominations, hardly a sign of slacking off for a general audience.anne revere, in the part of velvet's mother, actually won an oscar for her performance. she was indeed excellent in the role but it is 12-year old elizabeth taylor who steals the show. she is a charming presence and exhibits a talent beyond her years. also on board are oscar-winner donald crisp as velvet's father, mickey rooney as former jockey mi taylor and angela lansbury (in one of her earliest film roles) as velvet's older sister.the film's lustrous technicolor makes for an attractive viewing experience while the editing secured the second of the film's two oscars. additionally, the film was nominated for its direction (by clarence brown), cinematography & art direction. the score by ten-time oscar nominee herbert stothart is also worth mentioning, though it went unnominated.all in all, "national velvet" is a wonderful family film that deserves a higher rating. i realize that the prospect of watching a film about a girl and her horse isn't exactly going to thrill some people but this one is worth taking a chance on.

this was one of the first color films i have seen at the cinema when i was a child. it is good to remember it. the girl, liz taylor, who later became a beautiful woman, starred together with the tiny and excellent actor mickey rooney. the content of the film plot is good for all ages, good wills and behavior. good ethics of velvet's parents, particularly her mother is something to take into account. our generations should be well educated and this film may help to this purpose. velvet loves the horses and racing them, and mi taylor (rooney) brought her to an international horse racing competition in england, where at the end the young velvet won, but was disqualified because of being female.

all i can say is i really miss this show!! my wife & i just got married around the time this show started up!! why did cbs take it off the air??? i think it was the best show for the whole family to enjoy!! it made me laugh!! it also made me cry. but when cbs took it off the air my wife & i thought cbs made a big mistake. you know what would be so great?? have a reunion show!! that would be so cool!!!! anybody know if it is on dvd yet?? on the last season of promised land, did cbs show the whole last season?? i think cbs took it off the air at mid-season. my wife & i will never forget it. the opening with that theme song was fantastic!!! this show only comes once in a life time! may we never forget promised land!!

although it has been off the air for 6 years now, promised land was one of those shows that comes along once or twice in a generation. good cast, supporting cast(among them, richard thomas and ossie davis) and crew. the plot is believable with mcraney packing up his family and just saying "to hell with it all" after being subjected to so many disappointments and incidents since his return from vietnam years earlier. i think a lot of vietnam-era veterans, myself included, could really relate to mcraney's thought process in finally deciding on his course of action. many of us did precisely the same thing in real life, after returning from that war and finding that america was not the same place we left. the show imparts not only values but a glimpse into what took place in one veterans life. in those two respects alone, i think it is one of the more poignant tv series of our time. why this program only ran for 3 years is beyond me.

i absolutely loved this series, and was very sad to see it go. yes, it's christian based, and traditionally as well. it deals with some tough issues, as the other reviewer points out, but i guess it depends on your viewpoint on these matters, and as a teenager growing up and now as a mother myself, i was so happy to see a tv series that was clean and, well, quite frankly, wonderful! i, unlike the other reviewer, was heartened to see how they dealt with the condom deal. instead of hearing the typical wishy washiness about condoms, they showed the son actually working at being chaste and applying it to his later relationships, which were pure and godly because of it, and a lot safer because of it (100%!).after watching this entire series, you become extremely attached to all the characters in the family and outside the family (once they settle down more permanently), and the moral values they teach in each episode are just priceless. i found touched by an angel (made by the same producer) to be cheesy here and there (although overall i liked it), but this series, in my opinion, was a lot better made and had better acting and was more interesting as well. it was good for the entire family and was interesting for the entire family, which was a huge plus. the family wasn't outstanding, they had their own faults, but in the long run they did what was right and you saw them grow and change and struggle like any true family does. it was my favorite show at the time and will always be near the top of my list, i hope it comes out on dvd!

i saw 'i smell the dead' -- sorry, 'i sell the dead' -- at a press screening. glenn mcquaid, the film's writer-director-editor, is a laddish irishman who introduced the screening by announcing that -- whilst it was in progress -- he would be 'going out for a pint'. i don't begrudge him a drink, but -- by telling us about it -- he seemed to feel he needed to certify his laddishness or his irishness, or both. when the opening credits rolled, there were -- as usual at press screenings -- loud ovations for the names of every actor or crew member who'd got friends in the audience, and silence for those who hadn't. mcquaid returned for a witty q&a afterwards.this horror movie doesn't take itself seriously, which is good because its humour is considerably stronger than its horror. only one scene is even remotely scary, and most of the 'horror' is merely gross-out, but i laughed throughout much of the film.this movie appears to be set in ireland circa 1850 (by which time grave-robbing was mostly defunct). the story is told in flashback: we get flashbacks within flashbacks, and the narrating character flashbacks material that he couldn't know about, because sometimes he wasn't present or (in one case) because the action is unfolding behind his back.the story begins with a prisoner being taken to the guillotine. guillotines weren't used in 19th-century ireland, but -- for once -- we actually see a plausible guillotine sequence. the prisoner struggles on his way to execution, the rope cleats are accurate, and the prisoner manages to look up to see the blade overhead. (and there's a payoff later to justify the historically inaccurate use of the guillotine itself.)the characters are ostensibly irish, but one major character speaks in cockney slang: using phrases like "a mug's game" and "take a butcher's" (for 'have a look'). for once, actors in 19th-century roles display 19th-century dental hygiene, yet nearly all the clothes and hairstyles (and the women's make-ups) are resolutely 21st-century. i'm not complaining in the case of heather bullock, who wears a very fetching black miniskirt cozzie that appears to be pvc. phworr!the lead actors (except ron perlman) are excellent, but most of the supporting cast have no sense of the victorian period. the worst offender is joel garland as the publican, whose characterisation is firmly rooted in the twenty-first century. just when i thought that garland's performance couldn't get any less victorian, he used his fingers to make "ironic" air-quotes.the sets (especially angus scrimm's lab) are detailed and impressive, yet failed to convince me that people actually lived and worked in these places. nearly every interior contains burning candles, but never once did i see what would have been there if these were actual victorian homes or workplaces: leftover drippings from previous candles.one scene features an extra-terrestrial: i was annoyed that mcquaid plumped for a stereotypical "grey" schwa alien, rather than something original.there are splendid montage sequences, but mcquaid opts for flashy effects -- split-screens, overhead shots -- that don't serve the story. i was impressed by a recurring blue-screen device superimposing the main characters' heads over other backgrounds. less effective was a recurring 'creepshow'-style motif of camera shots morphing actors' faces into drawings resembling panel art from 1950s ec horror comics. i'm a fan of ec comics, but they don't belong in 19th-century ireland. the money that mcquaid spent on flashy photo f/x -- showing off his editing skills without serving the story -- should've been spent on accurate costumes.big spoilers now. ron perlman gives an "oirish" performance full of acting-school tics. ostensibly playing a 19th-century irish priest, he writes with his left hand. (in victorian ireland, left-handed children were punished for using "the devil's hand" and were forcibly retrained to become righties.) but perlman's character turns out to have a reason for concealing his right hand. elsewhere, a character is bitten by a zombie yet suffers no ill effects, so i knew there'd be a payoff later. several scenes that would more logically take place at night are shot in daylight, apparently only because this was easier and less expensive. (since mcquaid is a proficient director and editor, he could easily have shot "day for night" ... but using a process-photography effect to help tell the story seems to interest him much less than showing off his flashy editing techniques.)mcquaid seems to be giving homage to those great old hammer horror flicks. but those hammers were so great because the actors and production designers worked hard to convince us that we were actually witnessing events in 1888 whitechapel, or wherever. 'i sell the dead' almost entirely fails to evoke the 19th century.glenn mcquaid shows talent as a director, scripter and editor, yet in all three capacities here he makes odd choices ... then largely fails to justify those choices. but i enjoyed 'i sell the dead'. i'll rate it 7 out of 10, and i look forward to his next movie.

grave robber is sitting in his cell awaiting execution is visited by a monk wishing to take down his last words for posterity and as a warning to others about the horrible life he lead. at first reluctant, but with his tongue loosened up by drink the young grave robber is soon telling his story which is full of the dead, the undead and things that go bump in the night. new york lensed horror film (filmed in part on staten island which no doubt brought the spirit of andy milligan lurking about) is one of the better horror comedies to come around in a while. this is an often very funny film that just spins its story out in every which way. the cast is first rate. dominic monaghan plays arthur blake the grave robber telling his story. ron perlman is father duffy the monk taking the statement and perhaps getting too involved in the tale. both men are clearly having a grand old time and it shows. the rest of the cast is equally as good. the music by jeff grace is excellent. the effects are perfect for this sort of ghoulish silliness. the film is a great deal of fun. if there is any trouble with the film its that perhaps it throws its net a little wide so as the result has way too much going on. i don't want to give too much away but i don't think we needed the alien body in the mix. still this is a great deal of fun and its one i'm pretty sure i will revisit on the ifc in theaters where i saw it the first time, and later on i'm sure i'll pick up the dvd.worth a look.

i sell the dead is a big, sloppy horror comedy that refuses to take itself too seriously. this has advantages and drawbacks. the 85 minutes of the film breeze by and the film is full of bits sometimes funny, sometimes scary, sometimes gory, occasionally all three at once, but the individual bits are much better than the sum of the film's parts.the story, such as it is, follows professional grave robber arthur blake (played by dominic monaghan). arthur's partner-in-crime willie grimes (larry fessenden) has just had his head chopped off for murder and arthur has one night left before his own head is forfeit for the same crime. arthur insists that he is innocent of murder, but there are plenty of other crimes that he is willing to confess to when bribed with irish whisky by a catholic priest (played by ron perlman).since the movie is a series of grave-robbing anecdotes confessed by arthur, it becomes a sort of horror anthology - a series of disjointed tales, all linked by a similar cast (arthur and willie) and a similar theme (grave robbing). like most horror anthologies, there is no consistent mythology, because all mythologies are true and happening simultaneously even when they contradict one another.it probably didn't help that i saw this film the same night as trick 'r treat, a horror anthology that avoids all of the traps that i sell the dead falls into. in fact, trick 'r treat, designed as an anthology, tells a more unified, consistent story than i sell the dead which is intended to be a united narrative.the other problem with the film (and i recognize that this is insane nit-picking) is the way the film plays fast and loose with history. grimes is killed with a guillotine. we might be able to stretch a point and say that he is killed by a scottish maiden, a precursor to the french guillotine, but the scottish maiden was abandoned in 1709 and this film is set a good hundred years later since burke and hare are mentioned and they were executed for murder in 1829. grave robbing as an industry became obsolete with the passage of the anatomy act (1832) so the film must take place before then.i know that bringing this up is the ultimate in historical nerdiness and we are clearly dealing with a universe where all sorts of dead, undead and legendary dead are possible, but the easiest way to anchor a fantasy, to convince the audience to suspend their disbelief is to use something real and authentic to bounce the fantasy off of. and it's not like the history of grave robbers or body snatchers or resurrectionists (call it what you like) is a boring story.the most frustrating thing is that writer.director glenn mcquaid clearly does know the history, especially the good bits. as an example, when grimes first takes on arthur as his apprentice he correctly explains to arthur that as resurrectionists, they don't steal the clothes from the dead, because stealing corpses is a misdemeanor, punishable by a small fine, while stealing clothes is a felony, punishable by deportation or possibly even death. so you would expect wille and arthur to strip the corpse at this point (and for the rest of the film) but of course they don't. you could accuse the director of ignoring his writer's script, but not when the writer and the director are the same person.my point isn't that there should have been a lot of buck-naked corpses in the film, my point is that if you are going to bring up this quirk in the law and make it clear that willie and arthur will follow the law no matter how silly it is, than you do have to pursue that thought to its logical conclusion, even if that means that willie and arthur wind up chasing a zombie through a graveyard trying to rip his or her clothes off and stuffing them back in the empty coffin, so that they don't get deported for stealing the walking corpse's clothes, otherwise don't bring up the matter at all.historical nerdiness aside, i sell the dead is worth a rental as a slight but funny horror film that could have been much more.

this movie was very funny with just a bit of gore. it is about two grave robber that are going about business as usual when they discover that there is a different clientèle they can serve. this changes the direction of the corpses they collect. the movie is told by the younger of the two as he is explaining the business to a priest before he is sent to be beheaded. his partner had already been beheaded. the priest is required to take down the last confession and it takes the form of a story. there is some animation thrown in which gives it a tales from the crypt feel. in the story we meet another group of grave robbers that everyone fears, but at one point, the younger of the two up for execution is offered a job, so this calms some of the animosity between the groups. when a woman joins the two men, she oversteps her boundaries and gets them in trouble with the feared grave robbers. the story leads up to the meeting of the two groups, which led to the arrest of the man that is confessing and the man that has already lost his head.

i sell the dead (2009) **1/2 dominic monaghan, larry fessenden, ron perlman, angus scrimm, john speredakos, eileen colgan, brenda cooney. uneven blend of horror and comedy that poses as a valentine to the '60s horror films by roger corman and hammer studios, with two cretinous grave robbers (monaghan and fessenden) facing final punishments for the crimes via the guillotine but not before their tales of the occult can be recalled in flashbacks. amusing and a few well sprinkled jolts but really a mess of a b-movie trying in vein to be a cult classic largely thanks to the casting of genre vets perlman and scrimm to no avail; a good rental for halloween. (dir: glenn mcquaid)

it is so refreshing to see a movie like this with actual mood and personality instead of just a bunch of cgi cartoon gimmicks. this is a great horror-spoof that has genuine chills along side some really great sets and performances. its laughs are subtle, but plentiful. because there is very little if any cgi, there is no need to violently shake the camera around to hide the crappy effects. this makes the movie immensely watchable compared to the other camera-man-must-be-sh%#@ing-his-pants films of this genre that have come out in the last decade or so.far more enjoyable than the big-budget re-made garbage being released by hollywood today.see it.

i saw this at the san francisco independent film festival and liked it a lot. it worked for me as a slightly weird comedy, because i don't like horror, but there were only a couple of minutes i had to close my eyes.the dialog was good, the costumes and settings were not far off bbc-quality, which is amazing for an indie film. i liked the way the plot twists and even meanders, it kept surprising me in good ways. i even warmed up to the willy grimes character, who i quite disliked at the beginning. it would have been better if there'd been any motivation for the woman to be so interested in going to the island: that felt very much like a plot device.i am fond of dominic monaghan, and he did a good job at pratfalls, horror, and at the more thoughtful moments. nice voice in the narration, too.this would be a fun and unusual date movie.

ok. finally, a horror film that's done well. as soon as i heard the music, i knew that some effort had been made in creating what i consider to be an almost masterpiece of good ol'horror. zombies, whores, booze, grave snatching and a lot more. a great cast, well acted, well directed, well written---there was hardly a flaw. even the american actors with irish/english accents really pulled it off. i thought that the actor larry fessenden looked familiar to me. it was that missing tooth. finally i realized that this guy was the lead in "habit" a film about vampires in nyc. i thought he was excellent in that role. now i'm wondering if he's an american or not. his accent was so convincing in "i sell," that i thought he had to have grown up in the emerald isle, not in the us. well apparently he's a born and raised new yorker. a great actor--really made the role his own in this movie. nothing beats a horror flick set in early 19th century europe (like the old hammer flicks.) i encourage anyone that wants to have a great time to watch this well crafted movie.

the 1990s film with anthony hopkins and debra winger is rightly showered with praise, and i enjoyed it very much, but this tv original is just as good, and in some ways, more appropriately cast. claire bloom isn't a brash joy, but she is still confident and throwing her cap at her favourite author (played by joss ackland in one of his best performances).quieter, calmer, and less emotional than the attenborough film this may be, but it does justice to what is a marvellous play full of meaningful dialogue. you'll still cry to this version, but perhaps you won't have the musical prompts to set you off.there's room for both - and having seen this on stage, i would say that the ackland/bloom one is slightly more faithful. but they're both excellent.

easily one of my favourite dramatic tv films, in many ways beautiful yet sad, heart-warming and thought-provoking, this is a superb dramatisation of a few years in the life of c.s. lewis and his relationship with joy davidman. i found it to be incredibly absorbing with excellent and 'realistic' dialogue and situations. it all seemed very 'real', yet there were also 'magical' moments that almost leave you breathless with delight. ackland and bloom as the central characters were excellent, as were the supporting cast. it's one of those dramas that i find hard to criticise, simply because, for me, there is nothing to be criticised, it just works so well on so many levels.very highly recommended.

this was a very faithful presentation of lewis's life in the mid-50's. the dialogue on theology and the banter with his follow colleagues was exceptionally good. michael white's book, "c.s. lewis: creator of narnia" deals with this time frame in a very parallel way. joss ackland's acting was superb in catching the unemotional lewis. the movie took great pains to be presented in an accurate english setting. the development of a strong bond between "jack" (his preferred name) lewis and douglas gresham, joy's son from her previous marriage, was enjoyable to watch. the movie did avoid the distasteful element of "warnie" lewis's (jack's older brother) drinking problem, but it would not have moved the story on, so it is best left out.

this version did not move me as deeply as the later, hollywood version starring anthony hopkins and debra winger. while it was beautifully filmed and superbly acted, the bbc version was more packed with dialog that imparted information which i found fascinating. it gave me a detailed glimpse of the intellectual, theological and moral considerations that motivated c. s. lewis. it was therefore more interesting and stimulating than the hollywood version, but not nearly as visually stunning or viscerally affecting. still, while i did not leave a heaping mound of sodden kleenex in the theater, i did use one, and at frequent intervals. i enjoyed this film every bit as much as the hollywood version, and was grateful for the increased understanding i gained.

this movie was recommended to me by the same person that blessed me with a copy of the chronicles of narnia. shadowlands is one of the most amazing screenplays ever written. it is well executed, acted and directed. the cinematography is a bit dark for my taste but i'm sure it was intended to be so. the screenplay is like poetry in portions of the movie, through out the movie i found myself taking pause to reflect on the comments just made on screen. this is a wonderful piece of cinema and i can only hope that more people will run across it and add reviews. fair warning though this was a 6 tissue movie for me. very touching. very heartfelt performances.

i really liked this film about love between two adults in postwar britain. the high standards of bbc tv is evident in the production, and superb lead actors (claire bloom and joss ackland) make this an uplifting experience. bloom and ackland have previously worked together in theatre, and their chemistry and interaction is splendid. i recommend this version of shadowlands over the film version of 1993.

this is a wonderful movie...it's funny, dark, poignant, thought-provoking, innocently naughty and generally entertaining all around. i don't know that i've seen the like before..."the rapture,"or maybe one of todd solondz's black-as-night "comedies" or even the recent movie "teeth" come to mind...but those are all bitter, nasty little gems. "franklins," despite the darkness around the edges, manages to have a thoroughly sincere and pure heart.the story is similar to john waters' "low down dirty shame," only this film differs in that it actually has a story, and something to say as well, beyond waters' juvenile "sex isn't dirty (snicker, nudge-nudge)" message. a conservative, repressed family undergoes a drastic change as a result of a car accident and suddenly aren't so conservative anymore...in fact, they're finally actually happy, probably the only people in their town (or maybe the entire world) who are. to talk about why this is the case would be to spoil the film; simply put, everyone should see it, though of course only people who are already sold on what the movie's upbeat, hopeful philosophy is ever would.the acting is great--just this side of realistic enough to keep the proceedings from getting too heavy...teresa willis gives an especially memorable and brave performance as an uptight mother who emerges like a butterfly when she's freed up. both she and robertson dean deserve kudos for their unflinchingly sincere performances (not to mention frequent and extensive nudity and sex scenes); they turn what could have been a salacious joke involving a "deviant sex practice" into a touching, believable and endearing moment. aviva as the daughter is a standout and someone to watch, perfectly capturing the attitude, angst and speech patterns of a girl her age. vince pavia as the "himbo" brother with a secret is good looking and functional although his storyline and how everyone reacts to it is more rewarding than his actual acting. mari blackwell as the conflicted best friend to mother franklin is wonderfully cold, confused and even compassionate in a role that could have gone over-the-top.technically the film looks fantastic, all bright colors and wide-open locales...it looks like it may have been shot hi-def...if so, the line has gotten very thin, it looks very much like film. there is a great deal of talking and a lot of it philosophical, which gets a bit preachy (moreso, i'd imagine to a viewer who disagrees with the film's politics), but this film says a lot of things that need saying...if only people wouldn't be afraid to listen and think. the arguments that take place are smart and well thought out, first and foremost refusing to demonize either the religious or non-religious parties.the ending is on the ambiguous side, which i found a bit of a disappointment somehow...i think it would've worked better had the author (as jay floyd is, since he produced, wrote and directed) given a more workable denouement, some sort of solution, but then again, there probably isn't one when it comes to pitting people with different faiths against one another. all the same, it was a moving, memorable final image that left me choked up--a success. meanwhile, i'm awfully glad mr. floyd got this film made and look forward to sharing it with as many people as possible. check it out.

amateur camera work aside, i thought this movie was very different, and unlike all the blogs and posts i have read, i got something totally different out of the ending than others. the premise of the story revolves around a very religious family and their ties to their church. how they must adhere to all the rigid rules and regulations, but the daughter seems to have problems staying on track, what with nasty thoughts of others and her use of bad language. yet she prays a lot, as does her family. then one day they are headed to a church picnic and are in an accident. from there the parents and her brother change; what with being knocked out and "saved" by jesus. warning: major spoiler alert. or so we are led to believe. i think if you watch this movie from the point of view of the daughter only, then really pay attention to the end you will see that what we, the audience, thinks is an actual occurrence with the parents and son, is in fact all a dream, and from the daughter's pov. this would explain a lot of the actions portrayed by the parents and the son, which were totally opposite of how they lived before, especially the sex, and also would also explain why peggy got away with murder, etc. look at how perfect that pie is, but go back and look at the cake betty makes. that is unless caroline removed all evidence that the pie was laced. and also the fact that the scene where she sees her dead parents, laying there in each others arms, and her brother, all whom of which seemed to die very peacefully, even if being poisoned, fits with a dream sequence.

i was surprised that " forgiving the franklins " did not generate more buzz at this years sundance film festival. there were times that the laughter at the screening i saw was so loud that you could barely hear the movie. the movie has some excellent acting and a story that really makes one examine broader issues . you know little issues like religion, sex and the truth. lots of comedy's seem to rely on the same old corny contrived situations, many leave you thinking " i know they ripped this off from some sitcom " .this film takes off on its own unique direction . i really think that jay floyd did a fantastic job with a tight budget on this film.

i saw this film at the sundance film festival and i too was surprised that it didn't generate more notice because it was not only powerful and beautifully crafted but very original. the audience was totally engaged and the greatest part of seeing a film like this at a festival is the opportunity to talk to the director and cast in the q&a session afterward. they literally had to throw us out of the screening room for the next film - we could have gone on for a lot longer. the film is thought provoking and hilarious at the same time. it will be a shame if this film isn't picked up for wider distribution - i hope it will at least become available on dvd because i want to see it again and share it with everyone i know.

saw this movie and totally loved it the characters are great . it is definitely my kind of movie you do not get bored in this movie i love independent films they are so much more rewarding. my husband and i really enjoyed jay's style. if you are an open minded person who loves thought provoking films and loves conversation after it's over you will love this film. it is definitely thought provoking.the film definitely will step on some toes but who cares those people will probably not go to see this movie. it is amazing to see the characters evolve . jay floyd has really captured both sides of the table. applause applause jay i hope you are working on another movie.

it's always a pleasure to see characters in a movie who are wholly good-hearted and well-intentioned, even when they're surrounded by those who are neither. the film's moderately silly premise is that the conservative, religious franklin family (mother, father, teen boy and girl) are involved in an accident wherein the parents and brother have a near-death experience during which they meet jesus, a pleasant but somewhat exasperated soul who removes from them the burden of 'original sin.' when they return to their lives, many of their views and attitudes have changed, much to the consternation of the daughter, who didn't share the experience. the religious side is, i think, presented with a good balance, from the good (jesus) to the starkly awful (those of his 'followers' who are obsessed with the sins of others and utterly oblivious to their own). it's a movie to make you think, give you a few good laughs along the way, and leave you with the pleasant feeling that the world just might be a nicer place than you think it is.

wow, just caught this movie from blockbuster and i love finding gems like this. while it was definitely shot on a budget and misses a little bit in clumsy editing (i.e. accident, hospital scenes, second to last end scenes), for a first directorial effort, i give this 10 stars! i absolutely loved the thought provoking concepts brought forth and if you're a free thinker and open to ideas outside the box, i highly, highly recommend this movie. i think the director and writer, jay floyd, should be given some attention and more opportunities in the film industry. based on his credits, he may be another quentin tarantino.

in this tale of a tightly wound christian family that has three of its four members "born again" after a cake-caused car crash, what really stands out is how grounded most of it is, where there is so much potential to go over the top, and how truly inspired most of the acting is. where most of the film's moments, particularly its frank and "innocent" discussions of sexuality after three of the four family members have their guilt and shame removed, is hilarious, it is also thought-provoking and the characters stay with you.how often, for example does a character in a comedy spin from near caricature to full-bodied emotional being in the course of one scene? how often do we see a cast that can pull back from showboating mid-sentence, in order to show a bit of the humanity beneath the character's skin? even many of the "bad guys" in this film have moments of heart-breaking honesty, even while much of what they do can be absolutely ridiculous and horrifying. there is truth and history behind even the most questionable acts in this film, which is a difficult task in satire.how refreshing it is to see a darkish comedy that can dare to be humanistic. how nice to see actors so fully committed to character that they can dare to let them be ridiculous and sublime.and as a gay person, i do not think i have ever been quite so touched by a heterosexual sex scene as i was by the first sexual encounter between the parents of this family after their accident.bravo. bravo. one of my favorites at outfest this year.

the most "spiritual" film i have seen in a long long time. maybe ever. also one scene around the dining room table a piece of comic perfection. i understand a release date is coming up in the fall. if it comes to your town and you want to see a movie that makes you think this is it. aviva is great in it and she is most certainly a future star - (superbad is out now which she is in) - also all the actors seem perfectly calibrated. there is a tone set by this movie that is used to surprise through out. i would not know what to call it - it is comedy but the undergirding message is so fierce and direct that "comedy" is not a big enough word for it. i love this film. it is a thinking man's comedy. but even that phrase is not really good enough. ftf does have a message and that message needs to be heard right now

forgiving the franklins is the best film i have seen in years. the acting was fantastic..especially mari blackwell who was truly remarkable in the role of peggy lester. she brought peggy to life with incredible skill and made her as real as my own next-door neighbor. i also enjoyed robertson dean in the role of the father... he is a true professional, and managed to pull off even the most intimate scenes with a rare grace. the performances by the entire cast were very good, excellent, in fact but peggy's role as played by blackwell made the movie. the cinematography was beautifully done throughout and was most impressive. the only criticism i have to offer is a slight weakness of the ending scenes, which were overly drawn out, repetitive and a bit too focused on the wrong character. i would have liked to see it end on a note of forgiveness....but spite of that slight flaw, it is very much worth the watching and applause for all involved in the making of it.

i saw forgiving the franklins at a paramount screening and loved it i have to be honest i really didn't want to go and i had become quite jaded about the movies being made today i have to tell you forgiving the franklins was fresh and wonderfully put together i laughed my ass off it was great story telling i could not believe two guys shot this and put the whole thing together. i thought if these guys can do a movie like this with this budget imagine what they could do with big money behind them. and then i thought be the jaded guy iam the studios would probably f...it up anyway. that being said thanks guys i got lost and in your film and that's why i go to the movies to forget the world for a couple of hours.

just saw this film the other day at the santa fe film festival. i was delighted by its honesty and humor. it was the most thought provoking movie i've seen in a very long time -- i just can't get it off of my mind for some reason. it may not be for everyone, because it makes you think. i don't know if people like to think in movies so much anymore, which is a shame. the actors who play the franklins are quite a find. i couldn't imagine playing these complicated people with such frankness. though i thought a couple of the supporting characters were not as good as the franklins, i can totally forgive it -- because this is an important movie in my opinion. i didn't expect to like it so much, but as i've thought about it for a few days, it's proving to be a very relevant piece of entertainment.

i agree with the other 9 and 10 star reviews. i saw this at the south by southwest film festival in austin. of the 20 films i saw,7 were really good and this was the best one for me. i'm a sucker for movies that have plot devices where characters go through transformations that totally change their lives. the excellent acting was mostly done by people involved in tv, or it was their first movie. it was written and directed by jay floyd. this was his debut as a director. jay's day job is apparently as a clearance administrator for lots of famous films. forgiving the franklins was a total delight and extremely funny in spots. this is one movie where i would buy the dvd and re-watch it, truly a high complement from me. well done, jay, yes...give up your day job!

i just got back from the glbt film festival at the amc loews 34th in ny. a friend told me about this film. audience response was very positive! lots of good solid laughs as well as some quiet moments of realization. top notch in every area. a movie that makes you think, and then makes you realize how lucky we'd all be if we could turn back time and live without shame or guilt. i imagine this will come close to, if not win, the audience favorite award! what was most surprising was the fact the the movie appears to start off as a satire and then slowly weaves into a genuine commentary on the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the very group it started to satirize. there isn't any mean spirited humor at the expense of one group, just a slow realization that we would all be better off if we just went back to the gentle innocence that we all started off with.

as i've hopped from film to film at the sxsw film festival, this film from the opening night has stayed with me. curious, because it is a dark comedy with quite an absurdist premise.a family of hyper-stressed fundamentalists in a small community of like minds is changed by an auto accident. three of the four have the same near-death experience in which they are fully opened, as each receives a reversal of the concept of original sin (i won't spoil this scene with the specifics). the fourth, a middle school cheerleader, is not just the only one physically hurt, but also is unchanged and is now witness to what has become her crazy, apparently spiritually bankrupt, family. every new moment brings a new outrageousness as they have become innocently naked and frank in every way, horrifying her and then the community.forgiving the franklins has the most beautiful sexual awaking scene between a husband and wife that i have ever seen, to the sarah brightman song "deliver me," a song that can now bring tears to my eyes.the cast is terrific. robertson dean as the dad, vince pavia as the son and aviva as the cheerleader daughter are excellent, mari blackwell plays peggy, the mom's questioning neighbor and best friend perfectly, a much more nuanced, fleshed out, real character than what might have been (everyone in middle america knows a peggy). and theresa willis positively glows as betty, the mom. there are lots of risks taken by the actors playing the three changed characters, and these risks pay off.i hope this film gets a wide release - if so, i plan to see it again.very accurate review at: http://www.fosteronfilm.com/phil/forgiving.htm

for real though, this game is where it's at. i'm 20 years old and that's basically where it started for me. 4-bit graphics was fabulous. i hope you all remember this game with as much adoration as i do. that bluto is a real meany.

i originally saw this movie as a blockbuster vhs rental. that was quite some time ago, but still remembered it. blockbuster doesn't have it anymore. netflix didn't have it and there weren't many copies on the web -- only a few spendy vhs copies. recently did finally find it available in dvd form on ebay for a reasonable price (in pal format, but our dvd player will play pal discs on our ntsc tv).wife and i both enjoyed it. the style of the movie is a bit strong, and many if not most of the parts are rather strongly over-played as if amateurs were making it(especially the kids), but it's not bothersome. the contrasts of societies are accentuated in the overplay.there is a bit of political preaching in terms of saying that the young in russia shouldn't try to escape their not-so-great life but instead should at least try to make things better first. but that's not dominant. it's fairly humorous most of the time.some downplaying of the west commented upon by others isn't that at all imo, i take it as a comment about expectations of the russian characters. at least when taken from my western viewpoint. perhaps it's a downplay of the west from a russian viewpoint (which it is literally by the characters saying it).i can't say how literally true to the film the english subtitles are, but i can say that the subtitles were done very well, full of english idioms as if done by a native english speaker -- complete with "colorful" language.

one unfortunate reality of post-soviet russia was that the people's welfare didn't change much from soviet times. as we see in "window to paris", most people are still as depressed as ever, while they are encouraged to go after money.then, everything changes for music teacher nikolai chizhov (sergei dontsov) after he finds a window that leads to paris. he and his friends are naturally quite amazed at what they find. this movie has one of the funniest discussions of elvis presley and edith piaf that i've ever heard. so watch this movie. you're sure to love it. it's sort of a precursor to "being john malkovich".

this was a wonderful little film that truly was creative and fun--something you see all too seldom in movies. the film begins in russia just after the fall of the communist government. as a result, society seems to be in chaos and life has yet to improve now that the old regime is gone. dirty cities, crime and lack of housing still plague the poor residents of st. petersburg.into this scene of bleakness and uncertainty comes an idealistic music teacher. he is among those without a home and he finally gets a letter from the government that tells him he has a tiny room in a nearby flat. when he arrives, the place is a mess but the people seem friendly enough so they all have a lovely party. in the middle of the night, they are awakened by an old lady walking out of the giant wardrobe in the room (i was half expecting lucy and the other kids from the lion, the witch and the wardrobe to come out, but they didn't). they are too shocked to do anything at first but decide soon to investigate. instead of just being a clothes closet, the wardrobe opens into paris! how the residents of the flat respond to this magical gateway is really intriguing. some, like the music teacher, are thrilled and in awe. most of the others are more pragmatic and are mostly concerned with looting everything from paris before the gateway closes once and for all! these russian thieves are awful people--greedy, coarse and crude but down deep---very deep--are hearts of gold. i like how this is a metaphor for the nation now on the brink of capitalism. at first, they run amok grabbing everything they can and only later do they reveal some depth--but mostly they act much like guests on the jerry springer show! the film has many twists and turns and is both funny and mesmerizing. about the only negative is that due to some harsh language and a nude scene (albeit, a very funny one), this is not a film for kids. this is a real shame, as with some very minor editing, this could have been a great family film.

this is one peace of art! if you like comedy you should watch this! here comes a funny moment from the movie: "spoiler"nikolai and goroshkov are walking together in paris for the first time. they are visiting the local market. and goroshkov goes: -"look nikolai, how much food they have! look! one-two-three-ten-thirty-fifty-hundred kinds of meat! but if ask for a tiny-tiny peace, just for the taste, they won't give you. french are very greedy!" then goroshkov takes nikolai to a tv-shop...goroshkov: "tell me, who needs all these televisions? look at this monster here, for example!" goroshkov points a finger at the "monster"-tv and goes: "and this motherfu*ker...he is supposed to be digging a ditch, but no, he's on tv...wait a minute... that's me! hahah!"wanna laugh? watch the movie, you won't regret!

my first mamin film, saw it on ifc long ago, and loved it. it seemed absolutely artistic, original, fun and hilarious. not a moment in the film let me down or made me bored, and i was laughing a lot or had a smile on my face. i mean this movie is truly funny. but here's the catch: it's also very artistic and creative - if you don't know yuri mamin (probably, sadly, because so many of his great films aren't available here) he has a very original style like no one else's, and for me this isn't even my favorite film of his (right now it's the insane ("saideburns/bakenbardy"). also, i have to say as a russian, this film is great because you really do see what russians are like. and this is possible because this is a true russian film to me, not a foreign film trying to be american or trying to appeal; mamin did not sell out (nor has he since, gorko (1998) was as good if not better. this is true russian style filmaking that came out of communist social realism.if you liked this film, i think you have a very high chance of loving mamin's other films, in fact i like quite a few of them more than this one. i guess this one is his most accessible film. a similar film is fountain, taking place 6 years before during perestroika, it has the same actor in the leading role, and more of mamin's regulars who you will recognize from window to paris; this one has one supernatural twist in the end but is mostly a realistic comedy, a great one. viva mamin, hopefully criterion will hook all of his movies up one day, he's still working, and his catalog is so great! see any of his films if you can.

a funny and scathing critique of russian society and culture during the transition from communism, okno v parizh also shows the west in an unfavorable light. a group of russians living in st. petersburg (a.k.a. peter the great's "window on the west") find a magic portal that instantly transports them to paris. mamin's film is truly hilarious, and just "weird" enough constantly keep even the jaded film viewer on his toes. the songs, the dream sequences, and the deliciously disgusting fringes of society from both cultures mingle to create a memorable and meaningful film. anyone trying to understand the shift in russian cultural sentiments since the fall of the ussr should begin here.

i thought that i wrote a comment on this movie before, but i can't find it on here. anyway, i am writing it again. i accidentally found this movie from my college's library collections. it was free to watch, so why not.i am certainly glad that i watched it. i love this movie. i have seen a few russian movies before, most of them have serious topics. i am surprised that this was one a good comedy. i had a great laugh while watching it. and this is a movie that i want to buy. this thing is so funny. and they are not just silly funny, those plots were very original, and well thought, so they don't seem to be silly at all. i am surprised that this movie didn't attract many viewers. this is a classic that you can watch it over and over.those actors were also very authentic, their acting are real, not faked. if you haven't watched it, go get a copy soon! definitely recommended.

this movie just screened on channel seven - australian tv - today.in my opinion, it was a very interesting take on how the nazi's treated the russian jews as mercilessly as everywhere else.kellie martin did a really great job, and her tears and frustration as "frusia" were quite convincing.the holocaust is a part of our history that we must not forget. schindlers list wasn't the first - and it wont be the last - account of survival and courage in that five year nightmare. my family is dutch, and i will always applaud any movie makers who want to keep the candlelight alive by telling of someone's courage to stand up and help those who were being abused, violated and murdered for being "a jew."

the second (not animated) movie about the only people still refusing to surrender to the roman empire is even more hilarious than the first film "asterix & obelix contre ceasar".where the first movie got all the laughs because all cartoon-characters were so perfectly brought to life without losing their cartoonesque identity, this sequel (which is a separate story as are all the comic-books) is even better. sure, all the ingredients that you find in the first movie and in the comic-books are present again: obelix is still dying to taste the "magic potion" that gives his other tribe members such enormous powers, caesar and the rest of the roman empire are still enemy number 1, but some new, refreshing elements have been brought to the stage as well.not only is setting very idyllic (biggest part plays of course in egypt) but rather than repeating movie number one, some extras have been added by making all kinds of references to other movies (bruce lee etc.). this is all not very new, but the unexpected combination of the known story from the comic-book (with almost the same title as the movie) and references to stuff that has got absolutely nothing to do with asterix & obelix really works.in that way the movie builds further on a tradition by comic-writers goscinny and uderzo who didn't hesitate to bring laurel and hardy on the stage and even dedicate an entire story to kirk douglas.if all of this doesn't convince you to watch this movie, i'm sure monica bellucci playing cleopatra will....

cleopatra (the delicious monica bellucci) is challenged by cesar (alain chabat): in order to prove that the egyptians are better than the romans, she promises to build a fancy castle for cesar in a period of three months, without any delay. she calls the one-arm architect numerobis (jamel debbuzi) and gives him two options: to be covered by gold if he accomplishes his mission, or become crocodile food if he fails. numerobis will ask for help to panoramix (claude rich), asterix (christian clavier) and obelix (geraard depardieu) (with ideiafix). this movie is very funny, specially the parts where obelix and the pirates leaded by red beard participate. however, the screenwriter and the director should have noted that french is not an universal language as english is. therefore, the jokes with words (like in austin powers movies, for example) does not work well for people strange to french language. french people and persons fluent in french language will certainly like these jokes, but they do not make any sense for me, that do not speak french. my vote is seven.

eh oui, impossible n'est pas gaulois.well paced, highly entertaining film. pretty good command of the french language and knowledge of modern france (and history) are recommended. i don't think this film really works in any other language. the film is incredibly much better than the previous one (in search of...). apart from great actors and savvy camera handling it's the wit and firework of allusions, word plays etc. that make for a really great movie. the cartoon vorlage is recognizable but the film is very emancipated. the cost of the film is put to good use. indeed, all the special effects fit 'naturally' into the movie, you never feel choked by them.bref, oui, les 2cvs, ça traîne un peu mais à part cela, imhotep!-a neighbour from the other side of the rhine

i was a little afraid when i went to the cinema to see this movie. indeed, it is always tough to make a movie from a comics and the first episode of the adventures of the french two greatest heroes was good but not fantastic. finally, it is very funny from the beginning to the end with unexpected gags, some cartoon scenes, no timeouts, great fx, a great cast, great landscapes, great everything !!!however, i wonder how they will manage to translate all the french names in english or german, because it is certainly funny in french but how will it be in another language ???

i like this movie. i may be biased because i love dolphins. however, my 3 and 4 yr. old will sit and watch the whole movie.... it's not oscar material, but definitely entertaining. the dolphin cinematography is well done with a beautiful backdrop of ocean scenery and sunsets. my favorite scene is when flipper "flips" the pop can out of the water striking sandy in the head. it's an endearing funny moment that makes me laugh every time. on the other hand, the villainous banterings of the bully boatman (forget his name) are a little hard to take. and the shark scene is far from reality. question: do dolphins really make that much noise? or is there some serious dubbing happening here? bottom line: my kids like it and it keeps recycling through our vcr.

flipper is a nice heartwarming movie for whole family. it's obviously not a great movie, free willy looks much better almost in every component of film making. possibly, at times it becomes a bit naive , and the writing and the script are not the best part of the movie, but it's a entertaining film with very good cinematography (including underwater shots) and some important moral messages. elijah wood proves himself one more time as an incredibly talented and underrated actor. he can make bad movie watchable, okay movie - good, good - great and great movie becomes all time classic. paul hogan performance also was very good and he is completely fit to his role. as i already say above, whole cinematography was very good. but underwater shots definitely is the best parts. so flipper is a perfect way if you want to see nice, sweet and entertaining movie. if you like me become sick and tired of modern hollywood trash, filled with sex, violence, vulgarity and profanity you most likely would like this movie. my rating: 7,7 out of 10. feel free for mailing me about any of my comments and posts here. sorry for my bad english.

i thought this was a beautiful movie- very brave. such beautiful imagery-and i liked the use of breaking glasses w/ applause. also how the best friend repeated the line about "..and she's one year older than me.." showed that their friendship has rekindled and grown, but maybe some competition is left...i loved the footage of hands feeling the fabric. the dance concert was beautiful. the beginning seemed slow, though..it took awhile to feel for the characters-the husband could have been more abusive-he just seemed absent so when other characters talked about him-it didn't really fit. the affair btwn. the best friend and husband seemed random..the doctors meeting seemed to hint that there was not much time left(to live..) so when the infidelity was revealed, i didn't feel as much sympathy for the character-more like relief! the ending was so great- the lines btwn. her and the husband, and the scene where she is pulled over is brilliant!

this is one of a very few movies with terrific acting, wonderful story line and worthwhile to watch. it is about changes in life. it is about how happiness can be found when one is true to oneself. it is about accepting oneself and others. it is about life challenges. it is about coming to term with reality. it is about courage. it is about love. both actresses are very true to their role. the actresses had very good chemistry between one another in the movie. this is the key of the movie that made the movie. it is rare to see an independent film like this one. one could tell the hard work that the film crew had to have while producing this movie. i wish to see more movie from this producer/writer. see the movie, you will love it.

i just saw this film in austin texas at the austin gay and lesbian film festival and it was my festival favorite. the gymnast is a film not to be missed. it is an honest "coming to terms" story about relationships, self discovery , growing older and having the courage to change and move forward. not only is this a good story but the glorious aerialist performances by dreya weber and addie yungmee will take your breath away! see this film! it will be coming soon to a festival near you. this film deserved to be picked up right away by a major network or studio. i will certainly purchase this when it becomes available on dvd.

wow what can i say it was a good movie, very different to all the boring remakes we see lately the only thing i would have liked to see a bit more of an ending like when jane left her husband im guessing she was going to serena cause she fell for her,not just her but everything that she is,i so wish producers would actually show that sort of ending instead of leaving to it your imagination sort of ending i really hate it when they do that. the aerial acts looked like fun but i guess you'd have to be light and muscly, i would like to see more movies like this one, maybe the could do a sort of sequel of jane and serena.if i were in jane's shoes i would have went for the girl too she was attractive.

...this one. what came to my mind immediately was loving annabelle, as it has this same kind of mature mood and distanced dealing with the subject. we simply observe as the story unfolds, without taking sides, or having to confront any "moral" issues (or of course we are, but are not spoon-fed them). sure, there were some difficult facts to face, and choices to make, but it just flowed. basically it was just like any other love story, in any other life, with any other sexes.i personally found the girls having a good chemistry, and had fun with them on their night outs. the only thing i could really pinpoint as a problem would be it just felt kind of...retained. held back. it's not about the sex scenes (or those missing), but given that i felt the film at its liveliest during the moments they were together having a good time, it kind of contrasted with the rest. lowkey is good, but it just never quite sizzled like loving annabelle, nor touched me quite as much.this said, i heartily recommend it, it's by no means a waste of ones precious time, on the contrary...7/10

this movie was beautiful and touching. it touched a place deep inside me and i'm not sure why. i am a happily married woman and i've never had lesbian tendencies, but my, this movie almost made it something i crave. the choreography, the storyline, the dialog... the movie was a work of art. the synopsis without spoilers is that a woman gymnast unsatisfied with her life and looking for... something, anything. she is with a man who does not want a baby, but she does. he's not mean to her, but he doesn't treat her the way a woman should be treated either... i guess he doesn't really appreciate her. all these years she has stayed in shape and decides to go back to the gym. she meets another woman during her acrobatic training and an intimate and beautiful relationship unfolds. throughout the movie she has another woman friend that she trained with in her younger years, and they have stayed close friends.the relationship that unfolds is.. i don't know quite the word, but very understanding, comfortable, intimate but sexy... something that could only exist between two women. the kind of relationship that could really bring meaning back into your life. someone that makes you feel special, exciting, beautiful, confused even.the relationship with her close friend is beautiful in an equally different way. they have a close and intimate relationship. her friend showed me what a true friend really is. someone who is understanding, easy going, real, fun to be with, someone who is there for you no matter what. someone who is supportive, and you can huddle with and tell your deepest secrets. someone who shares your past but does not share your secrets. the story is simple in the fact that it was not overdone, but not underdone in any way. it leaves a lot of sensual imagery to capture it's moments. the dancing and choreography was stunning. i could watch it over and over. the way the artist captured the main character's feelings and emotions was. the dancing and the imagery was very dazzling and mesmerizing to watch. what a cozy a wonderful story! i fell in love with this movie. if you have a chance, rent this and watch it!!

"the gymnast" unfolds in short shots and short scenes, revealing its characters and message over time. the spare editing is accompanied by a beautiful, simple score. this intimate approach is wonderful for feeling like you're on a path of discovery as much as the characters are.the spare approach is also its drawback; there are a few scenes that are confusing because they don't have enough context. there are some decisions made by the characters that seemed rather flip until i watched the interviews that were in the bonus materials. i'm glad i did, because the actors' descriptions of their motivations gave me a much more well- rounded understanding of the film overall.aside from the story itself, it was wonderful to see women so comfortable and strong in their own bodies. the shooting was very tastefully done; very matter-of-fact. one has the feeling of seeing a love story and a life story unfold, not a voyeuristic sleaze film. the physicality of the athletes -- their realness -- is a great contrast to the sometimes ethereal nature of the plot.not a film i'll need to see again anytime soon, since the storyline is simple but its delivery is powerful enough to stay with me for a long time.

everyone who worked on this film did an amazing job. this is honestly one of the best lesbian films i've seen in a long time. the acting, writing, cinematography, music, visuals, everything was top notch. as an avid fan of the genre (both lesbian films and gymnastics), i was so unbelievably pleased by this film. it truly gave me so much more than i expected across the board. hearing the q&a with the cast and crew was great, the lead actress has so much positive energy and is so humble and gracious, it's a pleasure to see people who can be talented and not lose sight of what's really important. and the writer did a hell of a job, as well as directing and the editing was awesome. thanks so much for making a great film! thanks also for the line about 'if you're going to slap a label on yourself, it would be bisexual'. i'm so tired of movies where characters who have a relationship with both sexes get passed off as gay or straight, it's wonderful to see bisexuals getting recognition for existing and being part of the gay community, and it was nice that labels weren't even necessary at all in this film. what an ending! just when i thought it couldn't give me more, it did. beautiful work and my applauds to all. i will spread the word, this is definitely a film not to be missed!

the gymnast (2006) was written and directed by ned farr. dreya weber portrays jane hawkins, a former world-class gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns her living as a certified massage therapist.the promotional material leads you to believe that the plot hinges around jane's accidental reunion with a former teammate. although this meeting takes place, that plot line is secondary to the main plot, which involves jane, her husband, and a professional dancer named serena (addie yungmee). the two women develop an act of the type performed by cirque de soleil. the two complement each other--jane is more experienced with heights and has tremendous upper body strength. serena is more elegant and artistic, although, obviously, also capable of incredible physical feats.the film works because we can understand how jane would turn to addie, who is caring and compassionate, while jane's husband has taken her for granted for the many years of their marriage.both women are incredibly fit and athletic, and dreya has the lean body and well-defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts. they clearly are truly performing their act, and the results are so excellent that we can believe they would indeed, be a success in las vegas, or anywhere else they traveled.the sexual tension between the women is obvious, and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while suspended in the air. a woman with a neglectful husband and an attractive woman partner make for an explosive situation, which isn't resolved in a neat and tidy fashion.of the six films we saw at the rochester ny lesbian and gay film and video festival, we thought this one was the best. it will work on dvd, and is definitely worth seeking out on large or small screen. note: stay for the credits!

thankyou for making such a wonderful escape . that's what i love about movies. i'm so impressed with the aireals , the way they were shot and the timing was so dynamically perfect with the music .being a dancer myself , and having been a part of many dance films choreography is usually chopped ,diced and sometimes not even to the beat....."showgirls" the movie . the relationship between the ladies was ever so present in the movement .my favorite scene is the last one, when she is pulled over . i've seen the movie before, a different version ., and i disliked the husband more last time . i felt a little more sorry for him this time . it changes how i feel about the female love birds. its all so magical .

whatever you do, don't stop watching when you think the movie is over! hang around for the first batch of credits or you'll really miss something! we saw this movie at the savanaah film festival and thought it was the best of the bunch. dreya weber is a marvel really, not only because of her performance, but because she can pull it off so far above the ground. at the q&a she said there were no wires or effects, so everything you see is really her going for it. addie couldn't make it to the festival because she was dancing with madonna. she was excellent and, my gawd, so beautiful. i was amazed that the film went over so well with the blue haired lady crowd, but there you have it, savannnah isn't a backwater.

somehow, somewhere, someplace.. you gotta see this film. breath taking aerials, and incredible outstanding performances from highly gifted actors.you think cirque du soleil blows your mind,wait till you see what these 2 women do - most importantly, the emotional journey and struggles jane(dreya weber) faces are universal in theme to many women. a superbly directed film which deals with the complexities of relationships,and holding on, until you're ready to let go. this masterpiece will touch women and men alike. ned far (director/writer) and ridiculously talented dreya weber (star/producer) just had the guts to tell it, honestly and sincerely. this film will hit big - see it however you can - or you won't be "in the loop" when it becomes one of the most talked about films.

now maybe it had something to do with the fact that i saw this movie at a low point in my life, when i was really trying to figure out where i was going and what i needed to make myself happy, but this film really spoke to me. jane is an everywoman: although she has so many positive things going for her, she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life. she is strong and intelligent, but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a second-choice life. she seeks out new challenges and happiness, seeking desperately to fill the hole in her heart. dreya weber is an exquisite jane. as we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair, the torture of her desperation and, eventually, the strength of her conviction. the beautiful addie yungmee is also very well cast and an asset to the production. allison mackie is a scene stealer as a saucy character with impeccable timing. i highly recommend this film; although it's low budget, it has big budget writing and production values. ps- great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women. women will love the story and characters, but there's something for the men here, too. :)

this film tackles the subjects of loss, personal struggle and transformation in such a smart, artful, sensitive, and visually stunning way that i was completely transported. it is a rare gem of a film in the way it honors beauty and women. you'll have to see for yourself. dreya weber (jane) masterfully portrays the subtleties of a remarkable if not somewhat broken personality, in a way that every woman will relate to. i found the honesty of the emotional interactions among characters to be very refreshing and profoundly engaging. there was nothing in this film that said to me "low budget" as far as quality is concerned. nothing. the fact that it is a low-budget film is a tribute to the film's creators. the final sequence during the credits will also knock your socks off. it is a brilliant celebration of jane's choice. unexpected and inspiring.

the relationship between the main characters i thought was very realistic. how the two end up involved is believable. it doesn't have that whole "oh yeah right" that most hollywood movies have. not too mention how they captured the sexy, beautiful and painful side of trapeze. i am a trapeze student and i love that they showed how hard it is on the body, hands and yeah those fabric burns are brutal! definitely a must see for the relationship as well as the art that is made in the movie. i loved it! i'm happy with the way the movie ended but i definitely wanted to see more. be sure to stay seated through the credits for a special treat hehe. great scene!

i truly enjoyed this film. it's rare to find a star who can pull off the physical aspects of any sports/dance themed film convincingly and do a first rate acting job as well. in this film you find two stars who rise to the occasion. both women deliver warm, touching and at times humorous performances. the film also touched on a number of topics, from racial issues to sexual identity. and yet the approach wasn't heavy handed. the production values were also top notch for a small budget film. i saw this at the philadelphia gay & lesbian film festival and went back to see it a second time. it was a real crowd pleaser. everyone i spoke to seemed to enjoy this film.

low budget, mostly no name actors. . . this is what a campy horror flick is supposed to be all about. these are the types of movies that kept me on the edge of my seat as a kid staying up too late to watch cable. if you liked the 80's horror scene this is the movie for you.

this movie was talked about in fangoria where i heard about this, it was interesting to me mostly becuase it was direct-to-video and i recognized two of the stars on the cover, james marsden of disturbing behavior and christine taylor from the craft. and to my surprise on valentine's day when i was searching through the horror aisle to find it on the shelf! i immediately had to grab it. me and my brother and our girlfriends watched it and to my surprise it was pretty good, the tales were interesting and for once they were actually scary, unlike a lot of other horror movies being made recently. some of the plot i do not understand but once i watch it again i bet i'll get it. and to even more of my surprise there were other stars i recognized including one of the girls from the tv show my so-called life and jacinda from the real world, i'm not sure why this movie was only direct-to-video, with a little advertising this movie could have at least made up for how much money was spent on making it. the only problem i have is that since it wasn't released in theatres i guess i'll never be able to view it in widescreen. you should definitely take a chance and rent this one.

i loved this movie! i'm shocked and disappointed that it never made it to the theaters. every story was better than the last..much better than the much hyped "scream" series and "i know what you did last summer"and way better than the terrible "urban legend". i'd recommend this film to every horror fan.

it may not have had the big budgets, celebrities or endorsements of scream, urban legend or i know what you did last summer, but campfire tales had one thing these three movies lacked: true horror.this film tackled the subject of urban legends a year before the aptly titled and less than enthralling urban legend did. it was intriguing, masterfully scripted and logical in a way i know what you did last summer could only dream of. finally, it held its focus and finished with a flurry while scream fizzled and died.what's most exciting about the film is the variety of horror that the writers and directors achieved. the overarching story of teenagers around a campfire was classic dread at the unknown (but certainly expected) doom that awaited them in the forest, but the tales themselves are where the movie really shined.the opening sequence is pure, fast-paced urban myth. it's based on a popular legend, and the director plays on this with the style and pace of the action, making it more enthralling because we know what's going to happen.the first campfire tale is a straight-forward thriller. based on another popular myth, we don't actually realize this until the end, both because it blends so well into the story and because the action keeps our attention. being the thriller of the trilogy, this one plays off our fear of the unknown and includes several well-done "jump" sequences that don't feel nearly as cheap or contrite as those in movies like scream or urban legend.the second tale is more suspense. this time, though the characters still don't know what's going on, we do, and this provides the horror. no need for cheap thrills here.the final tale contains elements of the supernatural and uses a creepy/trippy atmosphere to scare the viewer. because we can relate so easily to the characters and their situation, our fear comes from their intensity and what they can't explain. this is the true ghost story of the trio.i didn't expect to enjoy campfire tales when i rented it. i figured that if i didn't like its more acclaimed, bigger-budget counterparts, how could i like it?the truth is, though, this film succeeds where the others fell far short of the mark.

this movie is so awesome! i loved it, it was really scary. i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there. it probably helped that i watched it at midnight. if you want a real scare rent this one! 10/10

i switched this on (from cable) on a whim and was treated to quite a surprise...although very predictable this film turned out to be quite enjoyable...no big stars but well-directed and just plain fun. with all the over-hyped crap that is out there it is very nice to get an unexpected surprise now and then... and this little film fits the bill nicely. 9/10

i cannot believe i enjoyed this as much as i did. the anthology stories were better than par, but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me. alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself "where i have i seen them before?" forget the running time listed on new line's tape, this ain't no 103 minutes, according to my vcr timer and imdb. space maggot douses the campfire in his own special way and hikes this an 8.

yes i am a ff7 fan, but how many people who watch this movie are not going to be? and so, i'm reviewing this movie from a ff7 fan perspective, and with no regret. (i would not know how to adequately review the movie for someone who has not played the ff7 game.)visuals - 10/10 i loved advent children. it's a sensory delight - a complete audio-video overload. the visuals were breathtaking: some feats were accomplished that i would simply have not quite thought possible with an animated feature. when the action scenes came about, they were, for lack of a more accurate word, a roller-coaster. with dramatic camera movement sweeping across from range to range, to seamlessly integrated bullet-time effects at the crucial moments, to the sheer level of detail - it's all hard to fault. the animation looks big budget, the style and imagery is awesome, and the effects at times made me forget that i was watching animation rather than live action footage. i could ramble on for hours repeating myself on the fantastic quality of the visuals, but it simply wouldn't do it any justice.sound - 10/10 the sound was fabulous. the voices for all the characters didn't disappoint (no one sounded silly) and the sound effects were bold and sharp. the music - from the game that (in my opinion) had the best game soundtrack ever, transfered beautifully to the movie. most of the memorable themes from the game are present in the movie, albeit often using different instruments to fit in better with what's going on. there was some bolder rock and slight thrash metal music over the really intense action scenes from time to time, but it all fitted in well with the movie's situation at the corresponding time.story - 7/10 the story and characters would be the main flaws of the movie. both aspects were simply not up to par with the game - but then again, the game could spend 40+ hours developing these points - the movie only has about 90 minutes. as far as the story goes, the plot wasn't bad or anything, but just not as ambitious as was expected from someone who played the game through. in effect, the plot seemed rather weak in comparison. the game was so extravagant with the intricate plot twists and story progression/development, that the movie never really stood a chance to compete in the same league. instead, the movie took the more sensible approach - to expand on the action and try to place as many inside-jokes and themes into itself instead of trying to impossibly recreate the massive story factor, which was originally such a driving force in the game. the lack of materia usage also caused me some controversy - the story of the movie chose to use little (though not zero) materia, and instead lots of supernatural fighting ability and skill. i would hope that if a sequel was made it would incorporate materia much much more extravagantly and importantly into the film. there were also many plot holes in the movie - all which can be forgiven if you think of advent children as a random anime, but seem ridiculous when you realise how it was based on a game that executed plot tremendously well.characters - 7/10 the characters, whilst all being present in one form or another, don't necessarily shine to their true potential. there simply isn't really enough movie-time to spend with all of them. and so, all of their background stories and abilities are not entirely showcased, and in some cases, barely at all (red and cait sith leave absolutely no real lasting impressions). even cloud, who is the focal point of the movie, i feel doesn't use enough of his familiar abilities from the game. the materia issue is a strong reason for this. with that said, it's a joy to see the cast back in action, even if it's in such a role that doesn't utilise them to their fullest. the new characters were the ones that caused me most of the strife however - the bad guy trio and the kid dude denzel - there was a huge lack of explanation about any of them. anyone willing to use their imagination can probably fill in the blanks with something reasonable and be done with it, but objectively speaking the issue is still there to be commented on and is therefore a little disappointing.value - 10/10 the replay value for this movie is excellent - i personally want to watch it again in a more bigger and louder way - bigger screen, louder volume.enjoyment - 10/10 whatever the flaws of the movie, they simply weren't big enough to hinder my enjoyment of it, and i honestly think that will be the same case for most people. i enjoyed advent children tremendously, and encourage fellow ff7 fans to go see it.

now after watching the advent children twice, the storyline isn't as shallow as majority has criticized it to be in my opinion. if you haven't played ffvii or disliked it for whatever reason, this movie is most likely not for you. being familiar to the original story is a prerequisite to understanding ac fully, otherwise you will just see the greatest cg animation in your life so far.without actually spoiling the storyline, i must admit that after seeing ac we have been putting pieces together with my friends relying on our knowledge of ffvii. seeing it second time allowed to actually pay attention to the story more and most of the questions we may have had were answered. some were not. ac is clearly for ffvii players/fans and doesn't honestly try to be anything else. there is little to none realism in it outside ffvii world which serves the purpose. music is mostly reconstructed ffvii themes with a heavier touch (tbm team according to end credits) and works well with the eye candy without exceptions. i found the music enhancing the experience added to the visual fireworks in all situations.we all know you can't put a ffvii in 1.5 hours and keeping that in mind the storyline actually offered more to me than i expected. there are two issues at hand in ffvii : ac and both stories were wrapped up very smoothly between the action sequences. and trust me when i say there's a lot of it. action that is.i'm changing my vote from 9 to 10 after watching it the second time because i had missed a few explanatory sequences i couldn't put together the first time that provided some answers. as a warning, it's going to be easy to disregard the story and concentrate on graphics, but try not to judge the adevent children because of that. if you don't let the story in, it's no wonder it seems sloppy.i'm not going to praise the graphics because i assume we all know they are awesome, which might be an understatement. especially characters talk so much more with their facial expressions than ever before. i hope you pay attention to the storyline for it actually makes sense and works well with the whole. get ready for the ride of your life, there are no breaks.

i do not have much to say than this is a great finish to the story. most people have said that there is not enough plot and its just eye candy.but think about it, everything was explained in ffvii you cannot add more plot to such a grand story it would ruin it. they did the best that they could do and i think that this should be taken more as a final fmv.. the last fight. graphics - 10/10, absolutely amazing story 8.5/10 - don't think they could of expanded it that much more. and the stuff they could put in there was clever enough i thought. characters 9/10 - well most of them have already been explained during the game but still could not fit it all into 90 mins. sound - 10/10, since i am a metal fan i loved the fight music.. and piano just reaches right in there..it is a great st and i was not disappointed.tilt/replay 10/10 - enjoyable every time. overall- 9/10 (ff fan view 10/10)i personally think this is what was needed, a fight to end it all.. the plot was already in place. the action was necessary as much as people complained. i loved every second of this movie. it was a pleasure to visit the world of ffvii just one last time.just remember this.. most movies that have been made form a game have been directed by movie directors i think this is pretty great for a team of game directors.. don't think i've seen a better game to movie..thankyou square, i think you did it right!

graphics: brilliant, obviously. the most stunning things were definitely not given away in the trailers. fight sequences move extremely fast, but after watching a couple of them your eyes should be used to it and it won't seem so confusing. cloud has a wide array of swords, and i kinda wish things were moving a little slower just so we could see them, because they were each incredibly detailed. oh, and we finally get to see exactly how one equips materia...music: brilliant also. i was a bit nervous about it, since (from what i've seen) nobuo isn't the best at writing music to go along with action (remember the steal the tiny bronco sequence?), but it's brilliant and it fits perfectly. i'm glad i preordered the ost. they changed the lyrics to one winged angel though, so you won't be able to sing along if you know the carmina burana lyrics.plot: the first half of the movie sets up things and introduces everyone in a fairly complex tapestry, but the second half is almost entirely fight sequences, once all the players are in place. i wouldn't call it a weak plot, but it's nowhere near as convoluted as the game's plot was. i think this is in an effort to avoid trying to overshadow the game, and i think that's a good thing...the movie is its own entity, and shouldn't try to top the original in terms of sheer plot.i admit, i was kind of hoping that this movie would bring ff7 to a wider range of people, but this is not a mainstream movie. i was going to give it only nine stars, just because it doesn't even really try to explain anything to newcomers...marlene (at least i think it was marlene...sounded like her) gives a bit of background at the beginning, but it's more of a refresher than a crash course. but then i realized, for me this movie is a 10/10, so why should i take off points just because other people probably won't like it as well...if you've played the game, or are at least passingly familiar with it, you should see this movie. but you don't need me to tell you that. if you're not familiar with it, go out and buy it, sit there for twenty hours and beat it, and then see the movie...although even without any background, it's still stunningly beautiful. you just won't get any of the inside references...which make up 50% of the movie (that is, everything that isn't a fight sequence).

"duckman" is a great show. i first saw it when i was 10 years old at the time and after school i rushed home and turned on comedy central. i saw a cartoon called "duckman" and i loved it!! it's such a funny and cool show. it's created by klasky-csupo, who are great creators of cartoons. they animated some of my favorite shows ever, like "the simpsons" and "rugrats".i've seen lots of episodes of this show and i think they're all really funny and sweet. the voice actors did a great job voicing the characters, too.i wish that comedy central could bring this show back, along with "the critic" and "dilbert".but this is a great comedy central show. great job, klasky-csupo!

rated tv-14 for sexual content and language.i remembered hearing about this show back in 1998 when it used to play on the channel teletoon.i didn't watch it then but now, it plays on the channel, razer.i have seen about four episodes of this show and i must say, it is fairly intelligent and funny.the show stars jason alexander of seinfeld fame and also tim curry of rocky horror picture show and it fame.the show is about a duck who is a police officer.he basically does his job as a policeman, while coping with personal problems.this show is fairly funny at times and fans of animated-comedy will like this.

perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the usa, "duckman" runs short at 70 episodes in four seasons.unlike the often innocuous criticism found in "the simpsons" (a pretty good show in its own right), and the rude-for-rudeness-sake humour in "south park," every bit of this series follows a plan. the criticism of us society, from its mercantilism to its selfishness, carries much more bite than it does in any other animated series.the cultural references in "duckman" also tend to be obscure sometimes (anyone browsing the fan sites will realize most have not even been caught). in that, it is different from "the simpsons," which usually uses pop culture instead of the high-brow stuff often hidden in "duckman." as other people writing about it notice, there is a growth in the characters (bernice, duckman and cornfed). also, by making the main character not just an offensive neurotic but in fact someone who is living a personal tragedy (as is made clear in episodes like "the once and future duck" ('you'll love her until the end of your days...') and in "bev takes a holiday" (when he takes a chance to tell beverly all those things he couldn't tell beatrice), the series is anchored in a deep sense of reality.one can't avoid feeling sorry for him and his lucid madness.all in all, in my opinion, the best cartoon ever made in the usa and one of the best series ever. i doubt it will ever be on dvd though. far too many things the duck said make much more sense today.

duckman was a show that used to be on during the last hour or so before it was time to sleep about ten or so years ago. it was a contrast to a lot of the kid-type of animation i was watching at the time; i was still a minor junkie for disney and looney tunes stuff, and most saturday morning cartoons were still on the run-off of the peak from the days of ninja turtles and batman. but also around this time i began to recognize that the more raunchy, mature, surreal, obscene, and (though i didn't know the term at the time) satirical cartoon shows were more creative than the stuff i was used to. around the time of beavis and butt-head, ren and stimpy, and even the maxx were hitting tv sets via mtv, usa put out two shows- one of them was weird science, and the other was duckman. i've always remembered a few key bits from the show, and some of the lines are very quotable to those who haven't forgotten it completely. luckily, i found a tape recently with about six episodes i taped long ago, and the jokes stayed very fresh. and the delivery of the jokes are rapid-fire a lot of the time in the better episodes. in the voice department, the choices in talent are top notch for the story-lines, which are usually just an excuse for crude, fascinating parodies of pop-culture, politics, movies and tv shows, music, detective mysteries, and the dysfunctional family unit. jason alexander is a wonderful choice for duckman, and his performance is a comedic 180 from his days on seinfeld (even if there might be some similar characteristics here and there). also, the voices of gregg berger as the unmistakably monotoned and deadpan cornfed, dweezil zappa as the hilariously inept ajax, and nancy travis as the sex-starved, obnoxious sister-in-law bernice, all contribute in a full amount. along with some great writing - even when a joke isn't sure-fire, the wit behind it compensates - the animation style, while a far cry from some of the refurbished, computer-enhanced product of today, is inventive and often abstract. it has that home-made, gritty quality that beavis and butt-head or south park would later have. and, like those shows, if you're a little kid, i mean little as in younger than i was watching the show, you may not understand most of the jokes (i.e. there are enough stripper and vd references to fill two shows sometimes). but it's inventive to catch if it's on tv late at night, and it functions rather well in that time slot. one can only hope for a dvd box set. so, to no one who's barely or even never heard of this program, here's a general note: think of this show as if dashiell hammett met up with walt disney and decided to go to slum part of vegas with a free mini-bar and make a collaboration in the vein of luis bunuel and the simpsons combined. not to mention, it's by the group that did rugrats.(strong) a

i've always enjoyed animated ducks for some reason: duck tales, darkwing duck, daffy duck, donald duck. though none of them are as deranged as duckman. originally broadcast between 1994 and 1997 duckman lasted for a total 70 episodes but could easily have gone on forever without becoming stale.the titular character is a discombobulated, unapologetic slob and pretty much the worst living person in the world. he's a private detective, a widower, a peeping tom, an alcoholic, a sex maniac, a murderer, a (fill in the blank). you name it, duckman has done it. but who can blame him for being such a slimeball when the world he/we live in is so insane, outrageous and just plain nonsensical? eric tiberius duckman(voiced by the maniacal jason alexander) could carry the whole show by himself but when he's surrounded by a bunch of eccentric supporting characters you just know that trouble is just waiting to explode at every opportunity. my favorite has to be willibald feivel cornfed (or just cornfed pig), duckman's incredibly deadpan sidekick who is seemingly talented and highly skilled at everything and is perpetually oblivious to his partner's infinity of vices and incompetence.the typical plot will involve some bizarre case he'll inevitably blunder through or will revolve around his highly dysfunctional household, though every now and again duckman's arch-enemy king chicken (tim curry), a sort of professor moriarty in fowl form, hatches some diabolical scheme in revenge for being bullied in high school.since i was a teenager this has been my absolute favorite animated show, better than the simpsons, family guy and even king of the hill. nothing will ever surpass it. there never was, or will be, anything quite like duckman ever again. the level of satire, observational humor and writing is so sharp it's deadly and the animation is done in that unique klasky/csupo style (anyone who has seen rugrats will understand). it's a wonderful, highly imaginative and wild world and all with a noirish, 1940s feel.you can never have too much of this particular bird.

ok, so it owes pulp fiction, but in my opinion has it's own voice and identity mainly because of the music-video direction style, sketch-like narrative and great performances. thomas jane delivers great (the drug-dealer show-down is extraordinary), aaron eckhart likewise. james legros has a short and effervescent appearance-great humor-"they got the wong house". the porzikova interrogation and rape scene is memorable, as is mickey rourke's cameo appearance-"take a peak".great hollywood popcorn b-production with strong performances of a-level aspirants and renegades(rourke).well, take a peak, it's worth.

pepe le pew can either really creep you out or totally sweep you off your feet. either way, you can't help feeling a little awe on beholding this classic wb character. this commentater personally believes that pepe was the inspiration behind other would be animated casanovas today from cartoon network's "johnny bravo" to disney's lumiere from "beauty and the beast". his unique brand of love making is to be wondered at in today's world where his antics would normally be slapped with a sexual harassment warrant and at least a 50m distance from all his victims. in this particular cartoon, a world weary cat decides to do an ultimate makeover and earn some respect for a change for pretending to be a skunk. all goes well, until pepe arrives and promptly pursues the unfortunate feline with his overwhelmingly enthusiastic love-making.the groundwork for pepe's many trademarks are laid in this cartoon. from his adorable "frenchified" love calls to that aggravatingly calm hop-chase of his. this cartoon only goes to show that as far as the world of cartoon fantasy is concerned, the most ardent wooer can go the distance...and have his beloved "pig-eon" leaving dust trails behind them.

i just watched this film, and i have to say it surprised me. it was very well done, with good acting and a deep look at high school students from japan, in adolescent love.the look and feel is a lot different from many movies, and you can easily get into the film. much of the emphasis seems to be in the story itself, which is extremely subtle. the main theme and relations with other characters are a bit complex. but the the overall sense of realism and dimensions still pulls you in.a main draw back is of course, those who like something simple. which is not here. you have to be open to many things, including a new culture, to get more into the film.i did enjoy this film though. it is worth watching.

watching this movie, i can't help drawing the comparison between it and wild reeds, another thoughtful film about teenagers coming of age.like wild reeds, this movie is slow and the director would not be hurried. so if you want a quick resolution to things, don't watch it. this movie is like a slice of life, beginning imperfectly and ending imperfectly. there's no resolution to anything, no happily ever after for anybody, just like real life.this movie is as real as it gets. the acting is surprisingly good. the director is fond of long, really long, shots and the actors and actresses excel at showing subtlety and inner thoughts.i love this movie. i almost didn't watch it but now i'm very glad that i did. it's not a movie for everyone but if you're willing to let it grow on you, you will be rewarded.10/10

writing about something so wonderful is completely hard. actually, it's almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this movie. this is a marvelous story about sex and gender, and it's almost unbelievable that we have not to deal with obscene scenes of sex. feeling, this film was made for people that like to feel, and just to feel, life in all its complexity in a gorgeous simple way. we look at it, and something starts growing inside our minds, even our hearts: it a pure poem. i've watched some "gay" movies, and i almost always got really unsatisfied with unnecessary scenes of sex, not because i don't like scenes of sex, but generally they are so pornographic that i'm forced to think that the director or the producers or the writer of the script thinks that homosexuality means perversion. nagisa no shindobaddo is totally different from that ones. three are the main characters. we have ito, yoshida and aihara, two boys and a girl in a peculiar love triangle. ito likes his best friend yoshida, yoshida likes aihara and aihara likes ito. imagine what this could turn in unprepared hands? but in the contrary, hashiguchi makes a magnificent story which goes profoundly in the philosophy of life, adding a question in our mind that made me think, astonished, in the end of the movie: why? and that why expanded in multiple questions inside of my brain and inside of my heart. the scenes, actually, sometimes tending to be boring, are moments of the most delightful poem which we are able to feel, but totally unable to write down in words. and maybe because of that, we are unable to understand the question in the end of the movie. i'm sure this movie was not made for us to discuss every piece of it some people want to understand a film almost dissecting it. others are so used to common "american gay" movies that can't appreciate the real value of this master-piece. watch it, close your eyes in the credits and feel, everything, feel yourself, feel the wonderful song. for all this and much, much more, i give a nine. and i just don't give ten, because ten of ten is perfection. but i confess i almost did it.

"nagisa no shindobaddo" or "like grains of sand" is an amazingly beautiful story about teenage boys and girls dealing with the state of becoming one with who they are. this movie isn't about homosexuality, but it is about sexuality.aihara, an aloof girl, will definitely make the viewers ponder who is behind the aloof girl. does she love yoshida? or does she love ito? or did she somehow turn into a lesbian because of the "incident"? (i doubt it).and what about yoshida? does he realize that he loves ito in the end? well, we all know he loves him as a friend. but you'll never know once you see this movie... haha :) in the end, aihara (along with ito) delivers an exceptional message to the audience: which is that it does not matter if you love a boy or a girl. and i have to tell you, i'm so dense that i didn't get it at first. ^^;; it's because of the whole no talking scenes... you have to try to understand what the characters are thinking and saying through their actions and not by what they say (especially the final part... whew, boy, that was confusing!) it's a confusing story, but it is beautiful nonetheless. :) this movie is certainly one of the best japanese movies i have ever seen (and trust me, i've seen plenty).

i think that never been kissed was a totally awesome movie. the casting was really good and they acted very well. i really like drew barrymore and of course for me it was excellent. i was scared at first because it said that it wasn't coming out on video. boy, am i happy that it is because it's a beyond cool movie. go see it if you already haven't!

it doesn't matter whether drew or leelee are total babes, but there are a lot of girls who are so pretty and hot but they appear to be so nerdy. this movie is not oscar type of movie but it has at least a good point of view of what life is like for young people or for "real" people. it made us laugh and learn to accept others for who they really are. this movie represents the real world and that what really matters.

drew barrymore is such a great actress when it comes to these kind of movies. she stars wonderfully and gets away with the quirks and jokes. romantic comedies like this suit her and i believe that she's done her best so far. check out her other romantic comedies. you'll see what i mean.

after seeing this movie, i came to the realization that drew barrymore is a great actress. this movie wouldn't have been watchable without drew. the fact that somebody as attractive as drew, could actually gross me out, and she did when she was "josie grossie". her attempts to "transition" as the cool girls called it were hilarious, especially her trying to dance at the night club.we also had snl favorite, molly shannon, playing a great part as anita, josie's best friend. one of the funniest scenes in the movie was anita trying to teach the class sex ed. this was one of mollys funniest performances and best.leelee sobieski also had a great part and i really felt for her, because i know people like her that got tortured like that.this movie is a must see for drew barrymore fans, because drew makes the movie.

women will like this movie better than men. of course, women like all romantic comedies more than men - on average. i generally like romantic comedies quite a bit, however i considered this a 5.5 for the first 50% of the movie and about a 6.5 for the next 40% and about a 9 for the last 10%. so, begrudgingly, i will rate it a 7. i tape and keep all movies rated a 7 or better and none that are a 6 or worse - at least that's my objective. i have over 1200 movies, so why keep the dogs.my wife liked this movie quite a bit more than me, though i'm not sure why. i am a bigger drew barrymore fan than she is.the whole point of this movie was about a young woman who goes back to high school (undercover) to write a story about the high school experience nowadays. she was a dork in high school the first time around and has to learn how to be cool the second time around. her journey toward cooldom, as well as her falling in love with a teacher, is the story.what drove me nuts for the first half the movie was just how mangy she looked. i wondered why they would pick her for this role until i realized how capable she is at looking like a dog. so much so that i truly don't think i want to see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning. argh! naturally, she transformed into a rather attractive (cute) woman by the end and she became very popular.the ending is about a 9.9 on the very sweet scale, so you sappers out there will like that. otherwise, it isn't very memorable and easily missable.

i just saw this movie for the second time with my 8-year-old daughter and i remembered why we liked it the first time. all these people who say it is bad are too uptight and critical! it is simply an entertaining little movie, it's not supposed to change the world. i thought all the actors did a great job with their characters. (except for jeremy jordan as guy--he was a maggot who looked seriously in need of soap and shampoo. if he is supposed to be the hot guy in their school, then they've got slim pickins'.) but i digress--drew barrymore was delightful, as usual, and david arquette was even enjoyable, and i usually can't stomach him, if only because of those stupid at&t commercials! molly shannon is always entertaining, and leelee sobieski did a great job as a tortured brain. some parts were actually painful to watch, reminding me of high school. even though i thankfully didn't get made fun of, it made my heart ache for those who do. movies like this are actually good for children to see--my daughter made several observations about the cruelty of some of the students and how wrong it was. this movie is appropriate for anyone and a good way to while away 2 hours. if there's ever a time you want to see a lighthearted little movie with a happy ending where you don't have to think very much, then this is definitely a consideration.

drew barrymore gets second chance at high school, on undercover assignment as newspaper reporter. in flashbacks, we see that the first time around was, to put it mildly, a major disaster. david arquette is amusing in modest role as drew's brother, who also enrolls to help out sis. lots of subplots endanger but never overwhelm simple charm of movie. drew keeps making her niche as major innocent-sexy light comic actress.

i thought this movie was great, not only because of it's storyline but because it was portrayed greatly by the excellent cast. i read that drew barrymore wasn't exceptional as josie geller because she is beautiful. yes she maybe but in the movie she played outside herself, which brought on a plain girl searching for who she is in the world. the story is sweet and definitely for the hopeless romantics out there, i for sure am. david arquette is mad as her brother rob, and michael vartan is gorgeous as sam coulson. leelee sobieski did an excellent job as her mate aldys, someone who wasn't afraid to be herself. i think this movie should get more credit rather than being branded as a "teeny boppy" flick

this movie may superficially appear to be flaky and for teenie-boppers. it seems to be the stereotypical high school movie. but in fact, it takes an honest and touching look at the high school experience. it doesn't propose some unrealistic ending where the geeks and the popular kids reconcile. it doesn't change what happened in adolescence; it just attempts to reckon with it. this is a really great, fun, heart-warming movie, good for teens and for those who can still remember being one...

this movie turned out to be pretty much what i expected. of course it's sappy, of course it's predictable. we all know the fairytale. but knowing that when you go to watch it, it's enjoyable enough to watch. it was funny and sweet. i did find it annoying that they showed geeks as either kids who didn't wash there hair or kids who loved math and joined clubs about math and wore t-shirts about math. i was an outcast in high school and i didn't do these things. it goes much deeper than that. having to do with many things, some of that being how much money your family has, how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness and how mean you are willing to be to other kids. anyway, i won't get into it. i don't agree with other opinions that drew isn't convincing as a geek. with braces, no make-up and unwashed hair, i don't think too many people would be drooling over her. and even when she goes back to high-school and sheds those things. she's still wearing the "wrong" clothes, "wrong" hair and has the "wrong" attitude to be considered cool. and her other "geek" friend may be beautiful but it doesn't matter, where i come from, you can still be an outcast and be beautiful. (inside and out)

'never been kissed' is a real feel good film. if you haven't seen it yet, then rent it out. i am going to buy it when its released because i loved it. drew barrymore is excellent again, she plays her part well. i felt i could relate to this film because of the school days i had were just as bad. i thought the plot was well written, there was comedy and romance which are the type of films i love. i loved the ending because even though you know what's going to happen, it still leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting - anticipating!!

there is little more that i would like to say about this movie than it really can touch your heart if you let it. sure, it's surrounded by all the stereotypical hollywood stuff, but i found myself actually engrossed in this movie and very interested in the outcome. i'd recommend it to all you romantics out there in a second!

i love this movie. it focuses on both issues: reality and fantasy. reality because hey, we all wanted a date from that popular guy billy. and some of us haven't been kissed yet, right? be honest!another real issue is because of the pain people gain from teasing. and whoa, high school life. remember it? the fantasy is finding your true love, when you're 25 and still in high school. not really fantasy, but close enough!although some parts are unbelievable, it was a great movie. there are no other words to describe such incredible work. and the story was wonderful. drew barrymore did a charmingly wonderful job, same as the hilarious david arquette. the people who worked in the movie are all wonderful. didn't i just repeat that?never been kissed is one of the movies that the later generations should watch. it shows reality and some-not issues for people like you and me.

of course, really experienced reviewers who like stuff like star wars and professional crap will definitely drag this movie and say really bad comments about it. but really, it is enjoyable teen comedy with an awesome story and good acting.josie gellar (played well by drew barrymore) is part of a news-reporting team and she has been offered a ('real') job - she has to go back to school and find out what teens are like these days. well this goes alright, until josie remembers her horrible time at high school and gets freaked out. but she's never been hip, never been cool, never been popular until now!sit back relax and enjoy with never been kissed!

i saw this movie for a first time years ago, when it was still new and i was satisfied. it's a great hollywood make-belief story for teenagers. however, it's not lifelike. as much as you would want to believe it, these stories never happen. that's why it is irritating to watch movies like that. they play with teenagers' minds, just imagine how many girls still in high schools believed in that magic and got disappointed. i wouldn't recommend this movie to my little sister or my cousin. the director should have spent some more time thinking about the plot instead of thinking about actors. yes, they (actors) were good, but the idea isn't worth a 10. there are a lot of films about teenagers. so why don't we make a better one?

i thought this movie was really awesome! one of drew's best. i am also a fan of michael vartan so i thought he was so hot in this movie. why all the bad reviews. i would want to watch this movie over and over again if i could. i also loved the ending. this movie clearly has shown a smile on my face! i was also surprised that james franco and jessica alba were in it. i love them both so i also highlighted this movie. at the end, when drew is making the huge comment about the truth it really told the truth of what sometimes happens in high school. again, the movie was amazing. defiantly a 10/10. hope this comment was very useful to any imdb readers.

josie is a reporter from a newspaper is set a task to go back to high school as she is going to be 17 again. .as she is there, she remembers some really awful stuff thats happened to her the first time she was in highschool as we see in flashback scenes.in the flashback they show that (little spoiler) josie was kind of a nerd in high school and was picked on a lot and one day the cool guy tells her that he is taking her to the prom, only on the prom night as she leaves her house she gets egged by the ass hole and his bitch. what a horrible thing to do (some will find this hard to watch as it so nasty and it will make you feel warmer to josie).i did not find this movie that funny but there was some really funny stuff in the office scenes a lot more funnier then anything that happened in the school.this movie did have the perfect happy ending, as it did bring tears to my mum and sister eyes. the acting in this movie was not outstanding, it was good for the most part of the movie, there is some poor acting in some parts of the movie.i going to give this movie 7 out 10.

i love this movie so much. it always makes me cry. if you appreciate drew barrymore half as much as i do, you'll love this movie. it's got all the essentials i look for in a movie. it has good actors, good characters, good humor...a lot of heart-warming moments too. the flash-back moments when we see josie in high school make me cry though. every single time. i'm sure you'll like this one, don't judge based on the fact that it looks like a teen movie, even though it is, in a way, a teen movie. sure, if you're a guy, and all you watch are hardcore special effect movies only in the top 250 movies of all time, then this isn't for you. but if you like romantic comedies you will not forget after seeing it, pick it up at a video store and enjoy: drew barrymore is great in this one!

never been kissed starring drew barymore as reporter josie gellar is a sweet, extremely sappy and sometimes quite painful tale of a timid woman named josie gellar who though brilliant is quiet and shy and has never been kissed by a man. she is assigned her first major news story for the newspaper she works for-to go undercover as a high school student befriend the popular cool kids and get a scoop as to what really goes on in the world of high school. only problem is josie has never been popular. high school was in fact, a traumatizing experience for her as she was the recipient of quite a lot of teasing and cruel jokes. josie grabs this assignment, as much to finally "fit in" as to get a scoop-what she finds is the major premise of the story.never been kissed is one of those movies that's so sappy and schmaltzy at times, particularly in a few scenes at the end that the limits of believability are sorely tested and many a cynic may not like this movie. it is however, very sweetly done. drew barymore is perfect as the bumbling yet lovely josie-she breathes a breath of fresh air into the character and makes her appear perfectly realistic. i also enjoyed leelee sobiesky as the intellectual student who befriends josie on her first day at the school.never been kissed has some really funny moments as josie unravels in her frantic efforts to be cool. example-the reggae bar scene.i also loved the appearance of josie's brother rob who also goes back and signs up as a high school student, the way that he helps to give josie her "dream" of finally fitting in is just hilarious. at the same time, as josie's woeful story of her original years in high school are shown in flashback it is extremely painful. you do not need to have had similar experiences in high school to josie to be affected by her story-drew is wonderful at making her character have a personal connection with the audience and we adore josie from the beginning.there is a lot of "mean girls" a 2004 release, in this movie but mean girls honestly was a lot grittier. never been kissed becomes very much a romantic pic as josie develops feelings for a certain man and the question becomes will they get together.i liked this movie. it was really beautifully done in some areas. the movie is corny in some places yes, the last scene-realistic-no way-does this movie manipulate your emotions in the most obvious hollywood way? oh yeah yeah yeah baby! but it manipulates beautifully, there are some lessons to be learned here. the movie never preaches but manages to paint an accurate picture of what high school was like for a select few. i have actually met people who have had similar experiences to josie-i've met people very much like all these characters-i think a lot of people simply don't know or can't conceive of the cruelty that can exist in the world of high school, and how hurtful it can be, but it's there. not unrealistic at all. what struck me was drew's speech at the prom, as she demonstrates the "sheep mentality" that can exist so prevalently -as hollywood and manufactured as many think that may be, it was well done and very true. i'm making never been kissed sound a lot heavier then it is, in truth this is a perfect movie to pick when one wants a sweet feel good light heartwarming picture. it's engaging, sweetly acted and just rufus. i'd say check it out. 8 of 10.

never been kissed gives drew barrymore the chance to do something that maybe 70% of us would like to do. go back to high school and make some necessary corrections. actually the first time for me was bad enough and at my age i doubt i could pull it off the way drew does.of course the reason could also be that once we leave high school it's like leaving a cocoon and we have to deal with the great big unfriendly world out there. i've known a few in my life who would go back and stay if they could. in fact there is a law and order episode which explores the dark side of this same situation. a girl looking young enough to pull it off, goes through high school at least three times and kills the person who stumbles on her secret.with drew though it's an assignment. she's a copy editor for the chicago sun times who yearns to be a reporter. publisher garry marshall who plays the part like donald trump took over the sun times gets this brilliant idea and just sees in barrymore a young enough looking person to pull off the masquerade. high school the first time was bad enough. drew was not the most popular then and she's not doing better the second time around. that is until brother david arquette also goes back to school and helps her over the rough patches.of course this raises a whole lot of issues for drew, peer pressure from two sources, job and school. what's a girl to do?never been kissed is a light and charming comedy which to its credit skips over the opportunity to be crassly exploitive and gives us some good entertainment. drew is very funny and sweet and her performance in moments of stress for her character moves nicely into pathos. michael vartan as her english teacher is the kind i wish there were more of in the education field and leelee sobieski and jessica alba play a pair of the empty headed cool kids that drew tries so desperately to hook up with.still it doesn't inspire me to return to midwood high school.

i saw this when it first came out and have seen it several times since. i have the dvd. it's one of drew barrymore's best works and one that is worth seeing more than once. not being popular in high school was one f the things in the film i could relate to. i wasn't quite as tortured as josie was (during her real high school days) or like aldys, but i was never the go- to-the-major-party type either. the prom scene were the three popular girls fall victim to their own prank as josie pushes way aldys (the intended victim) is my favorite scene and i clapped when i first saw it. i can still watch this movie today. it is excellent.

i can't say that i embrace this as a romantic comedy, as i found little funny about it. i did find it endearing, entertaining, heartwarming, and terminally sweet, and while there were some witty moments, i found them more bittersweet than outright comedic.i liked this one. barrymore has grown so much as an actress, and it's always wonderful to catch her on the big screen, but this translates well to the small screen, too. in fact, on subsequent viewings, i like this one more and more.if you're a fan of the romantic comedy, then you may be a bit put off by lack of comedic effect with this one, but if you're in it for the romance, it's definitely here to be found.it rates a 7.8/10 from...the fiend :.

very sadly, i can relate to this movie, as i'm 17, and have yet to be kissed, so i really feel for josie. it's been a while since seeing this film, but to write this review i re-watched it, and remembered everything i loved about it.drew barrymore is a great actress, and this role suited her really well at the time. the chemistry between sam and josie was really good, and michael vartan was an excellent actor in this.i loved the storyline too - as i said up there, i could relate, and it's rare you find a film you can completely relate to.all over - i loved it. 7/10

this is a truly hilarious film and one that i have seen many times. drew barrymore is brilliant as josie geller, as is david arquette as her brother. you cringe with embarrassment at the thought of her returning to high school as the film is a reminder of what high school was really like! her outfits are wacky and weird, and it brings back memories of those who dressed a bit differently! the gorgeous michael vartan was adorable as the teacher (wish there had been teachers like that when i was at high school!) and josie's boss is fantastic. this is a film you could watch again and again, with a fabulous sound track! one for all those at school in the 90's to watch!

i think this movie more than any other shows what a great actress drew barrymore is because she plays a ugly duckling in high school which is something i never imagined her being. a great flick with lots of laughs . i don't usually go for those feel good movies but i really enjoyed this one.

i loved this movie. not as great as "50 first dates", but it's definitely a repeater, especially on a rainy day or with a group of girlfriends. yes, the plot was "cute" and maybe even unbelievable, but what's so bad about a feel good movie. drew as josie and her romance with the teacher is so sweet and brother baseball wannabee adds to the movie's good feeling. with all the junk out there, what's so bad about a good movie the whole family can enjoy? without being embarrassed while watching with your kids! drew is an awesome actress that really seems to be unappreciated for the most part. this is definitely one of her best roles!

i'm not sure if these other people saw the movie - some apparently couldn't follow the "complicated plot". he's a billionaire who owns an oil company who also happens to big game hunt - wow - that's really far fetched. any way - his new "drilling machine" happens to break through a glacier and on the other side is a world seperated from our own time where dinosaurs and cavemen wander around. nothing ground breaking about this but it certainly isn't ludicrous. anyway the rest of the movie is about this t-rex they find (which the billionaire, boone, claimed was there) hunting them and them hunting it. look - it's an old made for tv movie - of course the special effects look cheesy - they didn't have cg - they did the best they could and for a mftvm they did a hell of a job for the time. this movie should be remade for the big screen - i'd love it and i'd be the first one in line. seeing that dinosaur with modern day special effects stalking those guys would be great!

this movie is kind of good. it seem that they used the tyrannosaurus rex like a blown up balloon, just like godzilla, just maybe back in those 60-70's days, scientist haven't got enough info. on all sorts of dinosaurs. back in those time scientist still making dinosaur, so i guess this movie was base on a tyrannosaurus rex movements back in the 60-70's. there even a part where a giant rock, fired by someone at the tyrannosaurus rex, it damage the tyrannosaurus rex and it was knock out for a little while. at the end, the tyrannosaurus rex went back to search for food. there is something wrong in the movie as well, like a rifle, how can one rifle kill a tyrannosaurus rex, when it could be 1,000-5,000 stronger than we are. if this film going to make a remake, i suggest make it more good and excited, because watching a old movie seems like to have a remake of it, if lucky.

great cult flick for mst-3k types: richard boone is a mess -- bad hair, arthritis, even his dark glasses aren't right; about as good as a bad dino-flick can get... actually, that charging saber-toothed styracosaurus was pretty cool -- maybe spielberg should take a couple of notes from that one.

well done melodrama that tells the story of sally, tomboy dancer in the circus, raised by sideshow performer mcgargle (played by w.c. fields), he of the top hat, little mustache, checkered pants, and proficiency as juggler, pickpocket, and runner of carnival con games like three card monte and the old shell game. mcgargle has raised sally, who worships him as her "real father" since sally's mother (kicked out of her home by her father, a judge, when she married a "circus man") died and left sally orphaned. sally is feisty and loyal to mcgargle no matter what he gets up to - but mcgargle seems to feel a bit of guilt over keeping her in the circus instead of with her own family all these years. when they end up performing in a carnival in the town where her wealthy grandparents live, mcgargle uses the opportunity to "investigate" sally's real family, with the idea that he may restore her to them. but grandfather the judge takes an immediate disliking to sally 'cause he doesn't like a "show girl" - what a stern, narrow-minded man he is, a real piece of work that guy! and meanwhile sally is busy being pursued by a handsome and rich young man, son of the man who helped grandpa get his riches.this is a very good film with a few laughs here and there and a sort of odd editing style (i don't know how to describe this other than it shows long shots, then sort of jumps back a few seconds or changes angle suddenly as a close up is shown). carol dempster, who plays sally, is delightful here - quite cute and comical in her performance. w.c. fields, even without his famous voice, is very funny - just the way he moves and his amusing, comical reactions to things (like a small dog seen in one funny scene), we even see him juggling briefly in this. i love the few peeks at the old-fashioned circus and carnival that is shown here. the print of this featured on the dvd is very nice looking, tinted a light sepia tone, and the piano score for this is really excellent, performed by philip carli based on the original cue sheets.

this story takes place in wisconsin. i was half heartedly watching my tape when i heard the name appleton. i wasn't sure where it was taking place until i heard them say green bay & then i figured it was wisconsin. watching further confirmed it.anxiously awaiting the outcome i could really feel corrine's frustration. i did not know it was based on fact until the end. it left me glad but sad and wanting to know more.

a man and his wife are not getting along because of the wife's jealousy and drinking problems. when the wife disappears, her sister begins a vigorous search involving the local police, state government, and a television crime show. what she finds out stuns the entire community. good drama with lots of fine performances; based on a true story.

a great suspenseful thriller the acting is first rate and the plot keeps you guessing. this well performed and directed movie is based on a true story and well worth while joe penny is cast extremely well and ann gillian is convincing as the concernened and terrified sister. joe again prove he's acting ability is amazing and the ending well done. it,s worth watching i hope they repeat it soon on any channel, i will definitely record it. for penny and gillian fans it's worth your time. rent it if you can better still try to buy it i going to. perfect early nineties thriller watch thismovie it's great.

one of the most macabre, depressing, yet eye-opening docs. i've watched in awhile. there's no narration or story that's told, just a "third eye" type camera following around 2 couples of heroin addicts in nyc through the seasons. watching them shoot up on the floors of public washrooms then "clean" their needles in the public toilets... sometimes it's a bit too much and you need to hit pause just to go for a breather.anyone currently in recovery of alcohol/drug addition should watch this when they're craving - it really shows you to what you could be going back to! after seeing this it's a wonder how anyone could even try this drug to begin with.the only thing it needed was a follow up at the end to tell where these people are today. judging from what is shown in the doc., there's no hope for any of them. they mention wanting to get better and quit, but it seems the only end to their habits is to quit by way of dying.this definitely isn't for all audiences. i found myself kind of like watching a car accident - after i started watching it i just couldn't turn it off. i had to keep watching with a dark/morbid fascination of what it's like inside the lives of these addicts.

i watch this film with horror in my heart because my mother also was a crack head like michelle. i've been wondering where michelle is now. there has been times where i had to find my mother in places i was scared to be but more scared to leave her there! to see michelle act like that made me wonder where she was sleeping all that time?? i watched in hopes the it was never that bad for my mom! and what i want to know is... where did matt and tracy "tear that ass up"?! worst scene for me was watching tracy shoot up in an old navy dressing room!!!! u never who try clothes on before you and it looks like all of them except michelle has aids!!!! where are they know 2008? can we get an update??????????

"dope sick love" is a really remarkable documentary made for hbo about two pairs of heroin addicted lovers roaming the streets of nyc. i managed to catch it one night by accident and found it absolutely mesmerizing. there is no narration and we never see any interviews with the subjects, the camera just follows them around, like a third eye, completely detached. the people being followed don't even seem aware that they're being filmed! (or, at least, they don't seem to care). the footage is amazingly candid. some of the most candid i've ever seen. this is as real as it gets. the nuts and bolts of what its like to be on the street and addicted to heroin. we watch them score dope, shoot it, make up, hustle, and even impersonate cops to rob people, and about a million other tiny details that less observant documentary filmmakers would leave out.some of the footage is truly horrifying. like watching one guy frantically searching for fix he lost. i found myself praying that he would find it, just so that his misery would temporarily end. and when he does find it, the guy literally dances in the street.the cyclical nature of drug addiction becomes very apparent while watching this. everything is about getting the next score to these folks, yet the next score seems to be well worth the immense trouble they go through. i would love to get a copy of this, if anyone knows where it is available. highly recommended, if you can catch it on hbo.

tracy and matt, michelle and sebastian: these are the two couples whose lives of addiction, crime, and squalor are brilliantly captured in this raw and honest hbo documentary. they're in turns petulant, charming, repulsive, astonishingly stupid, and dedicated: to the drugs and to each other. they're also each very different: matt is a working class boy who clearly revels in his naughtiness, whilst prep school dropout tracy supports the couple with western union money from her moneybags father, who makes a surprisingly sympathetic cameo towards the end of the film. meanwhile widow michelle (whose hubby died of an od) earns her daily bread by posing as an nypd vice cop willing to cut her would-be johns a deal to avoid prison time, and sad sack companion sebastian lives off the proceeds. you'll be pulled into their stories and will wish the film went on for twice as long. unlike most documentaries of this kind, there's no coda providing us with an update about their progress (can matt and tracy really keep that brooklyn apartment? will michelle go back to bellevue for more detox? and can sebastian become any more pathetic?). as a result, the film seems incomplete, but that may have been the point. essential viewing, as long as you aren't completely averse to scenes of people shooting up.

the animatrix: a detective story is very well planned and has a great storyline to go with it. carrie-anne moss plays trinity in this animated cartoon. i really like the 'private detective' ideas created by the director.

this is one of nine shorts on the anime disk, "the animatrix." it is my favorite. the artwork is amazing. the black-and-white, somewhat grainy texture perfectly captures the mood that the segment is trying to portray. the story is tight, and the ending is true to film noir.overall, i gave the animatrix a "7", but this particular segment deserves a "10."

film noir meets anime... brilliant! this was one of the highlights of the surprisingly creative animatrix shorts. this was one of my favorites if not my favorite (i also loved world record). this is basically a reference to those classic film noir detective stories and movies of the 40s, except it's animated and involves the matrix. but by being animated, it is able to take the extreme camera angles, the detective life style, the shadows, and everything film noir to an entirely new level. the femme fatale? trinity. the detective in this story seems to be living in the 40s in his mind but stuck in a modern world, and everything becomes too much for him when his case suddenly involves science fiction and agents when a mysterious woman in black walks into his office...my grade: 9/10

the detective story is not typical for the matrix universe. it is a film-noir-esque private eye story, with a strong narrator and a very rich feel. rich, in terms of its visual appeal. the snowing scenes, the grainyiness, it all stuns the eye.but what about the story? it is interesting, even if it feels a little out of place. the agents hire a privat detective to track down trinity. he finds out that they tried the approach before, but with hazardous consequences for the hired detectives. still, he tries to locate her and eventually succeeds, through alice in wonderland references and hackers and chat rooms. then things begin to get interesting...all in all, this is a perfectly satisfying short animated movie.8/10

this is the fifth part of 'the animatrix', a collection of animated short movies that tell us a little more about the world of 'the matrix'. this time they introduce trinity (carrie-anne moss) in a story about a detective who is hired to find her. with great black and white animation and an interesting story this is again a great animated short from 'the animatrix'.

this is one of the periphery stories told by the animatrix that isn't directly relevant to the war stopping one glorifying plot of the films, but trinity, voiced by carrie, does appear in it. it features a private detective who is hired for big money to look for a hacker named trinity. we see his search which features other pis, only one who he meets, who has seemingly gone mad from his own experience trying to track trinity down. eventually he makes contact with trinity who he assumes to be a man of course - told in the narrative and something that firmly puts us in his own perspective despite what we already know - on a hacker chat-room, and solves a riddle which forces him in a hurry to catch a train. he forgets his hat but his faithful cat throws it to him in a moment of ludicrousness so absurd it's hilarious.he meets her on the train but the ruse is thereby revealed when agents attack; the agents were using him to get to trinity and trinity was trying to free the pis sent after her, which he doesn't know of course, and which isn't explicitly stated in the animation itself, something common to film noir titles, which often hint at plenty of interesting back-story, subplots, developments etc. but don't show you more then the core story and a limited point of view to create an extra air of mystery and intrigue.almost everything in this short is in black and white, the music is reminiscent of film noir and the offbeat, old fashioned yet dedicated detective is the perfect protagonist for a film noir title. the trivia section of this title's entry on imdb also helpfully presents a few references this title makes to hardboiled literature, something it also borrows heavily from, a genre of mysteries for detectives, gangsters etc. who engage in challenging conflicts readily and often. animated aptly by studio 4°c and directed by shinichiro watanabe, it is an enjoyable variant on the usual matrix story.

the eighth, and thus second-to-last short of the animatrix ones, this is the only one quite like this. this takes two of the main types of filmed entertainment inspirations of the matrix, and combines them unbelievably well. this is immensely faithful to the trilogy in that aspect, the tone. the animation is a gorgeous, breathtaking animé. the style, which is omnipresent in this, is noir. the plot is fitting, and the story-telling, as well, as the music, is spot-on. the sound in general is fantastic, and really helps solidify the mood and atmosphere, along with the drawings and designs. the voice acting is impeccable. this is one of only two where people also in the movies reprise their roles, and both have anne-moss, who is the only of them appearing in this. this is one of the best of the nine, and also one of my personal favorites. this is about ten minutes long. the pacing is perfect. it never slows down terribly much, but it's not overwhelming, either. the ending could not have been more appropriate for this. this shares a nine and a half-minutes long making of with kid's story, and it's well-done and informative. i recommend this warmly to any fan of the universe and the two genres that this is made up of. 8/10

i've seen three of the animatrix episodes, and this is my favorite of all of them. the second renaissance provided a flimsy back story to the already flimsy universe. program was a stylistically impressive number, it just felt kind of silly. i guess what gives this one it's special touch is the direction from shinichiro watanabe, director of the incredibly popular (and for good reason) series cowboy bebop. it has some of the best elements of bebop: slick, sci-fi adventure, a no-nonsense, slightly apathetic hero working for hire, a bounty-head (more or less), and a chase scene, all wrapped up in an excellent film-noir packaging. watanabe's tarantino-style slickness comes through here full throttle.

this is one of the anime films from the animatrix collection, one of nine - the only one done in black and white, and the only one featuring trinity. richly textured and beautifully rendered in every way, and the animated version of trinity definitely does her justice. if you're a fan of the matrix, you will need to put this on your short list.

wow, its been quite a while since i've watched anything so mysterious in the way it is portrayed.a detective story uses old fashioned black and white images to portray a private investigator who dresses in an old fashioned trench coat and hat. the theme of this animation is reminiscent of that of sam spayed which was briefly mentioned by ash.sick of spying on cheating house wives because of his clients, ash was offered a chance to track down a "computer hacker" which he thought was a worthwhile chance for a four figure sum he could not turn down and the rest is history.the ending was a little bit bland but still okay. for those out there who like old fashion stories this is the one for you.

just how exactly do gay asians manage in a culture that generally refuses to even recognize the concept of homosexuality? for millions of gay hindus and muslims there seems little hope of ever leading a life that is accepted and endorsed by their otherwise very close knit families. this is the main point explored in chicken tikka masala - presumably named after the western spicy dish involving tender pieces of young chicken flesh! jimmy is a typical young asian brought up in britain by traditional parents with the common narrow minded and selfish views on marriage and grandchildren. like millions of others he is led into an arranged marriage that seems inescapable even though he is apparently completely gay and deeply involved with a very attractive young man with whom he lives. he knows that the truth should be told but fears for the consequences of that particularly so as his father appears to be terminally ill. and so he becomes embroiled in a web of deceit that becomes wider and wider as the plot develops.the film is beautifully sensitive and not at all judgmental or patronizing to any group portrayed. the acting is generally excellent although it might seem a bit ham in places as the director tends to search for humor rather than letting it blossom naturally. there are no prizes for photography or script but the film is made entire by the wonderful sentiment expressed at the very end - a sentiment that all fathers across the world would do well to learn from.

have just got back from seeing this brilliantly funny film.granted, part of the reason i loved it so was because i could point out people and places i knew ('i walk there everyday!', 'i work there!', 'i've had drinks there!', 'hey! that's our postman!' etc...). but, still, if you're out for a 'feel-good' with a bit of spice (excuse the pun) - this is just the right answer. relationships, culture and, most importantly, love are all woven together within the plot.with preston (where the film is set) recently being made a city, it is good to see this work featuring the place and adding to the feeling of uprise. it is also a brilliant representative of the many cultures in this part of the north.fabulous!

my comment is mainly a comment on the first commentator (the extra on the film) and his unhappy assessment of the film. i think his perspective indicates why an extra is an extra and a director is a director. the film was sweet, the acting sufficient, the experience of watching it a nice diversion from a busy work week. it wasn't "the hours" (acting), or "the matrix" (special effects), or even "the color purple" (direction). most movies won't be. but it also wasn't the crap fest that "vinny..." would lead you to believe. sorry guy, just my 2 cents.as to the movie itself, it was in the end very gay affirming (+ #1). it showed a world full of diverse and less than perfect people--you know, just like ours (+ #2)! it opened a door on one culture without excluding other cultures (+ #3). and i liked the music (+ #4).

this film is about a young indian guy who comes home one day and finds himself getting engaged to a woman. the problem is that he is gay. in order to stop the wedding without telling his parents that he is gay, one lie leads to another until it spirals out of control.this film is hilarious and got me laughing many times. sally bankes' acting is superb and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly. the plot is outstanding as well. i find the plot very realistic, and i can completely identify with jimi's feeling of being terrified, worried and upset. on the other hand, jimi's boyfriend, jack, is given much less attention in the film. i would have liked him to be given more lines in the film, and have more character development. however, as i guess the director wants to make this a more mainstream film, the love between jimi and jack was not developed in the film.it is great to watch a gay affirmative film. furthermore, this film preaches us to be accepting to other people's difference, be it sexuality, culture and the way of life. this film makes viewers think hard.we need films like this to give us a boost. thanks for making this film!

for people who are first timers in film making, i think they did an excellent job!! we have to support the emerging industry especially coming from up north. it was very popular when i was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs. it's a feel-good film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema! it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents. the film has just opened, i do hope it does well - people should support this little film. i think this 'vinny...' person is very bitter, about something! and getting too personal? shame!! i say well done to all those involvedhave a drink on me!! i look forward to you next venture.

typically spanish production - slow-moving, but with great sensuousness and sexuality oozing from the lead actress paz vega. (watch her in "spanglish"). great sets, lots of colour - you get to see cordoba, seville, spanish mountains and countryside. the plot tends to meander here and there, but if you follow closely (i managed to, even though the film is in spanish), you'll get the gist of it.it's about how one very highly sensual young gypsy woman, carmen, uses her feminine wiles to seduce men to do her bidding. carmen is being taken to prison after attacking a fellow cigarera at the cigar factory where she works. she persuades jose, the soldier in charge of taking her to prison, to let her escape. jose succumbs to her charms because she speaks basque (he is navarrese and speaks the same language). jose is punished by 1 month in jail and demoted to foot soldier. he later meets carmen at a party and they end up becoming lovers. but carmen refuses to commit to him, and continues her lascivious and flirty lifestyle. in a jealous rage, jose kills a fellow soldier who has been with carmen. they then have to leave town. life on the run turns jose into a bandit. carmen, meanwhile, remains the same, a wildly promiscuous woman. in the end, jose loses his mind and ends up killing carmen.the story is told by jose in prison, awaiting to be executed. the person he tells the story to is prospero merrime, a french writer and anthropologist, whose fancy watch (it plays beethoven's fur elise) was stolen by either carmen or jose.worth watching for the sets and for the delectable paz vega.

this movie is a quite fair adaptation of the prosper merimeé's novel. in the novel merimeé himself is a character, don josé is from navarra (north spain, and historically a basque country zone, they can speak basque language). they are in seville (andalusia, south spain) and they only speak spanish with andalusian accent, in no way they speak basque, but carmen explains to don josé that she was living in navarra. you can believe it or not, anyway this is the book's version, then you can't be critical with the movie about this, be with the book! you have to note are different the novel by merimeé and the opera by bizet, and this movie is an adaptation from the novel, anyway in the opera don josé is still spanish from navarra, never he's french. why so many people keep thinking don josé is french? i don't know but i guess because the novel and the opera are in french although is supposed to be in spanish.the only important difference between the movie and the novel is that in the movie don josé also kills the "torero" lover of carmen and in the novel he doesn't (neither in the opera). i guess they wanted to keep the movie a little more gore! i think the movie is quite good, anyway.

there have been approximately 60 different films & television plays,besides the classic opera of this tale of a sex mad girl and her hapless soldier lover. this story has been done so many times, in various ways.vicente aranda directs joaquin jorda's screenplay adaptation of prosper merimee's classic novel & play.this is the story only of bizet's opera carmenpas vega is an exciting carmen,full of passion & the ability to drive simple men to do terrible tragic things. leonardo sbaraglio is the hapless soldier who is ensnared into carmen's poisonous web & led to doing bad things.jay benedict is the author prosper who tells this tale.there is not much action, but there are some very hot sex scenes.in fact this is almost an nc-17 film.since i have seen this tale so often in so many guises i was not overly impressed.it is a very well made film & will be of interest to those that may not know of it,my not overly enthusiastic review also could be that i miss the fantastic opera score by bizet.see this as you may like it more than i did.ratings *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) imdb 7 (out of 10)

this is a nice movie with good performances by paz vega and leonardo sbaraglia . of course vicente aranda is a legend in spanish cinema and surely one of the great directors in spanish cinema but i don't think this is one of his greatest movies even if it's fine. the screenplay plays with the introduction of merimeé as a character , it's a nice touch but it's unbelievable. the music is composed by jose nieto , national spanish prize in cinema. i mean this movie is very good in all the technical aspects .there are very good actors in supporting roles like antonio dechent , maria botto and others . i give it 7 out of 10 cause i think this could be a better movie but as it is it is not boring at all.

even for the non-opera loving public the name carmen is immediately recognized as an opera by bizet about a gypsy girl whose capricious loves destroy men. but as much as the opera is now considered a staple in every opera house repertoire, the real story of the wild gypsy lass as created by prosper mérimée in 1845 has never been told as well as in this cinematic version by the abundantly gifted spanish director vicente aranda ('juana la loca aka mad love','amantes', 'if they tell you i fell', etc.). incorporating the author of the novel as a main character seeking the story of carmen from one of her lovers - josé - provides just the right vantage for the story of this famous gypsy wild lady to be told. carmen (the amazingly beautiful and talented paz vega) works in a cigar factory in seville, a factory adjoining the military station where the very proper josé (leonardo sbaraglia) is stationed. carmen is tempestuous and in a fight instigated by a fellow factory worker bringing attention to the fact that carmen is a gypsy, carmen murders the co-worker and is arrested. josé is physically attracted to the voluptuous carmen and when carmen flirts with him he consents to allow her to escape - his payback is the promise for a night of passion with carmen. carmen keeps her pact, providing josé with his first sexual encounter, and josé is doomed. his lack of military discipline results in his losing his rank and being imprisoned for a while, but at his release josé encounters carmen again, kills a fellow officer, and in fear runs off to the hills to live with the smugglers and gypsies that are carmen's people. many incidents occur to try the passionate bond between the lovers, but when carmen's real husband is released from prison, destructive behaviors take over, behavior's that include carmen's infatuation and affair with a bullfighter and the passion of carmen and josé comes to a tragic end. one factor that makes the story (as adapted for the screen by director aranda and joaquim jordà move so well is the role that prosper mérimée (jay benedict) plays: his questioning of josé completes the story that bizet's opera only outlines. the acting is superb, the cinematography by paco femenia and the excellent musical score by josé nieto contribute enormously to the success of this very fine film. this is a must for lovers of the opera carmen, and a splendid action drama for those viewers who admire historical pieces. highly recommended. grady harp

i thoroughly enjoyed carmen, better than original sin (angelina jolie & antonio bandaras), which share some thematic similarities, and which i also enjoyed very much. i felt the acting was stronger here (paz vega displayed a wider range, has more fire; and sbaraglia was also great). overall, their acting was more gritty, more believable (less dreamy than original sin, and both actors here had less 'celebrity status' and 'pretty face' to depend on to make the movie work. vega definitely sizzles, as to be expected.director vincente aranda has also built a detailed world (again, better than original sin) that lets you feel the grime and the daily goings-on of archaic spain - for example, people unloading goods from a cart on the street, workers changing the candles of the street lamps, all in the background of the action. whilst i greatly sympathize with the recent idea of redeeming our femme fatals (like brian de palma's femme fatale), carmen is a poignant, modern take in the tradition of the noir classic double indemnity, and is a delightful pleasure to watch. this is another fine example of the triumph of daring european cinema over glitzy and safe hollywood fare.

snakes on a plane was such a well hyped film that it was both inevitable and a little crazy to try to release another movie with almost the same title in the same year let alone the same week. reading the other comments here i see the results. a lot of people are mad. mad because it doesn't have the best special effects. mad because it doesn't have a star cast. mad because they wanted to see samuel jackson say "i'm sick of these m^*&*&%-er f*^(^%-ing snakes on this m^*&*&%-er f*^(^%-ing train"! well, this sure ain't the samuel jackson version. and maybe that's good.snakes on a plane was lost between cop film and horror, a family action film and a bloody gory movie of death. saturday night live performers got laughs while jackson swore enough to make a grandmother cover her ears, and as far as kids go, they would be traumatized by the violence.snakes on a train however knew exactly what it was. this was a cheaply made horror movie on a train. sure it had snakes and sure many of them were scientifically harmless garden snakes with fake rattler sound effects. but never once did it miss a step in its plot or intention where as the "on a plane" version was tripping all over itself from the first scene on.i did enjoy the over the top fun that snakes on a plane had to offer and i admit that the "...on a train" version was a little dry. but hey, in trade, it was a cool and unexpected story. this little horror film could have gone way more wrong than it did.for this it gets a 7 out of 10.

this is one of the funniest movies ever made. and for those of you who don't get it, it's supposed to be funny. so often comedies try to be so intentionally funny that it misses, but here is finally a movie that succeeds in being hilarious in the most subtle of ways. even "spoofs" lack the originality and natural feel of this film. it is a comedic classic that will surely be appreciated in another time when studios are fdoing this sort of thing regularly. kudos to the makers, and to a hilariously subtle cast of actors, including isaac wade, whose performances is top-notch. truly, a real break-out star performance by an true underrated stage actor. it'll be great to see this guy get his due.

ladies and gentlemen, we've really got ourselves a winner here. actually we don't, but boy is this film an often hilarious and always entertaining horrible hoot of a stinker. poor alma (fetching julia ruiz) is suffering from an ancient mayan curse that causes lethal poisonous snakes to grow inside of her body. alma and her deranged shaman husband brujo (alby castro, who feverishly overacts with delicious eye-rolling intensity) stowaway on a train that's bound for los angeles. naturally, a bunch of deadly vipers get lose so they can terrorize the motley assortment of passengers. the mallachi brothers, working from an absurd script by eric fosberg, treat the ridiculous premise straight, thereby creating a wonderfully wretched piece of deliriously campy cheese. the cruddy cgi effects, the pathetically unfrightening common variety gardner snakes (there's would-be scary rattlesnake noises added to the soundtrack to imbue them with a faint sense of otherwise nonexistent menace), the plodding pace, the total dearth of any tension or momentum, the obvious rickety stage-bound train set, and especially the simply astonishing "you gotta be kiddin' me!" over-the-top preposterous ending are all downright awesome in their very jaw-dropping awfulness. better still, we also got game (if lame) acting from a no-name cast, a nice smidgen of tasty gratuitous female nudity, a funky hum'n'shiver score, and plenty of extremely gross and grotesque make-up f/x. bonus points for the fact that the token irritatingly cutesy little girl gets eaten by a large reptile and for the stoner engineer who gets caught smoking crack out of a hollow light bulb (!?). an absolute gut-buster of a kitsch howler.

ok firstly, if your not a fan of the whole low budget horror genre then don't bother with this. you really need to be a fan to get the gag.the move is basically about snakes ..on a train. lots of them.there is an ancient curse involved and a crazy ending which i wont spoil. the gore effect are full on and real icky... but the movie is mainly one big gory gag about snakes scaring the hell out of a bunch of people trapped on a train.the suspense is built up well and there are some memorable and well composed scenes.. some of the acting is a bit hammy (watch for the surf dudes) but thats not really the point... give this movie a go. know what to expect and you wont regret it!

the tagline on the box hails, "100 trapped passengers... 3,000 venomous vipers!" you almost have to admire that degree of "no chance in hell we're ever going to deliver on this promise" bullshit. i could admire the asylum's hucksterism more so if they made movies that, well, you know, were good or, at the very least, worth a damn. haha, and it's what i like about theses movies. they are garbage. you put them in a toilet and then you flush. it worth the price if you are a fan of cheesy movies. it may become a cult classic among many fans. the gore scenes are effectives, there's not much i can say, it's a z flick that parody the new movie with samuel l. jackson, hell, it may be better so who knows!

forget everything that you have ever read about the mallachi brothers' straight-to-video release "snakes on a train," especially if it was a negative review. this movie is way more fun than the movie that it obviously rips off: "snakes on a plane." frankly, i am surprised that more people aren't rhapsodizing about this low-budget asylum release. instead, most reviews that i've read have nothing kind or critically worthwhile to say except the usual stupid herd mentality idiocy, such as the acting was amateurish, the action didn't numerically live up to the advertising, and the entire thing amounted to a hideous waste of time. of course, it doesn't help that the title is a tip-off to the obvious rip-off nature of this film. actually, i felt that "snakes on a train" surpassed "snakes on a plane" for a number of reasons.first, the producers used real, genuine snakes until the last fifteen minutes when they substituted either giant fake snake heads or computer generated a super-giant snake that consumed an entire amtrak like train. how many movies have a snake gobble a train? as a result, "snakes on a train" ranks as the first movie to scale that height.second, this low-budget movie employs some grisly gross-out effects. the woman who coughs up baby snakes--real ones--was fantastic! the special effects of her forearms getting tore up later in the movie were visually enticing! also, you get to see a little white girl get eaten alive by a snake. she was as cute as she could be, no more than 10 years old or thereabouts, and she died screaming all the way as nasty olé giant mister snake head swallows her. not only kids in jeopardy but kid eaten! this is exactly the kind of graphic material that you won't find in 99 % of all theatrical hollywood releases. of course, she wasn't eaten by a real snake, but it's the subversive thought that counts.third, it is one of those cursed upon movies where alma (julia ruiz of "that guy"), the chief female character--no heroine--has a curse placed on her by her parents because she didn't marry the man that they recommended. as a result, she is filled with snakes, coughs up quantities of green radiator fluid slop then chucks up a baby snake. imagine medusa, the mythical characters that had snakes for hair, only with the snakes in her belly. her psycho-shaman type boyfriend collects all the snakes that come out of her because they are heading to l.a. on a train to see a relative of his who can put all the snakes back inside of her and return her to normal. talk about a whacked out character performing stomach churning routines. prepare yourself for lots of slime, blood, and gore. fourth, the train had only about twenty or so passengers, not hundreds. nevertheless, it looked like the mallachi brothers filmed this above-average horror flick on-board a real train with real snakes and they played up the swaying motion of the train on the tracks.fifth, the snakes slither around for the first hour, quietly infiltrating the train before they turn weird and attack everybody. in other words, it's suspense, suspense, suspense, before people start dying from snake bites.up until the last five minutes when the snake grows bigger than the runaway train and swallows it, "snakes on a train" is warped, wonderful, and way-out. it doesn't have the attention deficit editing of a big league hollywood movie. it's a fantasy about an unfortunate hispanic women victimized because of her feminist, at-odds-with-society attitude. altogether, you've got gory fantasy type stuff; suspenseful snakes slithering around the train, and am over-the-top gigantic snake at the end. incidentally, they get on board the train because a bunch of other mexicans have bribed a train employee and the mexicans on board think that the girl is so cute that they let her and her boyfriend on free.i think it's better than "snakes on a plane" if you want a tough, little, independently produced horror movie.

let's get one thing straight, this gets an 7 out of 10 not on a normal scale, but out of the bad movie scale. this is the kind of movie you rent on purpose, where you intentionally walk in knowing that it is a horrendous knockoff and shun'd by everyone else. i went in with one promise from the movie, that there will be snakes on a train, and it delivers! the gore itself is really good, and the characters have awesome roles. come on, it has everything from stoned train pilots to teenage girls trafficking drugs, even a electrical engineer getting his pimp on! you get to see some topless nudity, explosions, snakes, gore, and a mexican main lead running around curing his girlfriend by hitting his crack pipe and blowing the smoke in her face!! as i mentioned and many others have, the movie pacing is a bit off, but respectable nonetheless. movies like this keep our group tradition of banding together and all chipping in a buck or two to watch masterpieces such as this. there can be no better time spent then coming together to enjoy a good bad movie. it could learn a thing or two from the likes of other such fine flicks as alien lock-down or boa vs python, but those are some big shoes to fill. a solid 7 out of 10.

forget some the whiny (and pointless) comments left here by some. this series is well acted, well shot, and makes a refreshing change to most of the pap on tv.any fool can nitpick anything. however, in this show the characters are believable, the story lines intriguing and compelling (but do require some intelligence on the part of the viewer), overall it's enjoyable, and it's british !! (we do occasionally come up with some gems, and this is one of them).the shows are an hour long each and i think there are four of them all together (at least i've only seen four of them). the show clearly impressed some u.s. tv station/director who made a longer series which was nowhere near as compelling in spite of the bigger budget.if like soaps and reality shows you won't like or understand eleventh hour.

in 1242, russia in being invaded by two sides: from the orient by the mongols and from europe side, by the germans teutonic knights of the holy roman empire. the city of novgorod is the last free city in russia. the population, in order to organize the defense of novgorod and the lands of russia, calls the prince aleksandr nevsky, who had defeated the swedish in a previous battle. his successful strategy defeats the germans, after a great battle on a frozen lake. this movie was made in 1938 due to the threaten of the german to russia, in a pre-second world war period. the idea was to make propaganda pro-russia. however, it is an overwhelming, marvelous, stunning powerful masterpiece. it is amazing the combat scene on the frozen lake. the present generation is very accustomed to special effects, like in the `lord of the rings' trilogy, and maybe cannot understand how fantastic is this black and white fight. if the viewer can forget the ideology and watch it as an art, he will certainly be astonished in the end with such a masterpiece. my vote is ten.title (brazil): alexander nevsky

i saw this film back in the early 70's and i was mesmerised by judy geeson. for me it captured the clandestine nature of rod steigers irrepressible obsession with the young and extremely sexy hitch hiker, played by geeson.you couldn't help feel a little sorry for the wife, played brilliantly by claire bloom. i was really disappointed to see that the original cut may have been lost and there is little chance of it being released on dvd.i defy anyone who saw the film, and it's strong message not to be equally absorbed by the three main character performances, and i would have loved to have seen it again, if nothing else for a purely nostalgic reason.going back in time, some 35 years.a real classic.

many accuse rod steiger of overacting, and anyone who has seen the amityville horror and the 'fly' section would struggle to say otherwise. that said, he's brilliant in this.it's never on tv, you can't buy it on dvd (legitimately). in 1988, when channel 4 still had a prescription for innovation, they showed this amongst a small amalgam of 60s films, privilege etc - and i remember an essentially theatrical experience, transposed well to film. the great thing about theatre is it's enclosed - how do you make it available and interesting on screen? ph just about pulls it off. because this sort of film is never even on cable or sky tv anywhere it's hard to get a debate going, but for anyone out there who has seen it or can remember, my memories are of a forthright, almost strident performance by sally geeson 'thats all taken care of' (which eschews the almost diffident general performances of her and her sibling in many early 70s offerings) she says ref conception. there are several of these - key lines you remember years, decades on. that's the power of a film like this.ps i just saw it again and its just as good. one day, tv too will be enlightened.

i watched this film recently for the first time in over 30 years and was very pleasantly surprised. i remembered a film that caught the mood and feel of britain in the mid 1960s without falling into the 'swinging britain' clichés that so many other films thought they had to propagate, my memory proved correct. those who feel that this is like a tv play are not entirely wrong but while andrea newman was to become famous for risqué tv drama, this film is more in the tradition of the 'kitchen-sink'films such as 'saturday night and sunday morning' but with an emphasis on middle-class rather than working-class life. rod steiger is excellent as the middle-aged angst-ridden lead, unhappily married to a repressed and apparently barren wife (claire bloom). the onset of the 'technological revolution' is the the backdrop for the drama in which old values and certainties are challenged. this is the stage for the central character played by judy geeson, a role which at the time was a shocking departure from the typical prim behaviour of contemporary heroines. the reversal of roles, with the girl rating her conquests in a little-black-book was a precursor to the feminist movement and was criticised at the time for promoting promiscuity among young girls. the irony of these criticisms is to be seen in both claire bloom's and peggy ashcroft's characters who are both acceptingly dissatisfied. peter hall made few films and on this evidence that is a great shame. steiger is exemplary and wholly credible showing why he was so highly regarded

spoiler alert--and i really mean it!! read no further unless you are prepared to have a major plot element revealed!!okay, first i've gotta say that i have a relatively high tolerance for depressing films. i'll watch and appreciate films about true life horrors (such as war and the holocaust) or where death and sadness are important to the plot but i hate films like steal magnolias and terms of endearment where the film is built around a manipulative death of a main character. so, already no matter how well made this film is, it's got a major strike against it because one of the main characters dies from a disease at the end (though they never say what he had in the english subtitled version).so you might ask yourself, "then if this blow-hard hates this type of film, then why did he watch it in the first place?" you would have an excellent point to ask this, though i hope i am not really a blow-hard! well, when i found it in our local library i had no idea what it was about!!! the movie was not intended specifically for export, as the subtitles were in korean, english and japanese and the box was printed all in korean. well, being a fan of trying films from any nation (i've seen films from probably at least 30-40 different countries), i gave it a try.well, apart from the obligatory death, i loved the film and so hated the way it ended. while i usually hate hollywood-type miraculous endings, i wanted to see the guy saved through some new drug or experimental surgery. i was really bummed that he had to die--particularly since he seemed like one of the nicest people i've seen in films in a long time. his smile was infectious and i really wanted him to get the girl in the end. oh well, at least i can appreciate the film's message that you need to seize the moment. great acting, music, etc., but just not the most satisfying ending for me. this film was good enough to encourage me to try some more korean cinema.

i was lucky enough to watch this film in the recently concluded international film festival here. i was actually able to watch another south korean film (the power of kangwon province) but christmas in august caught my attention more. the story is simple enough, the usual boy-meets-girl (or shall we say girl-meets-boy?). what made it special for me was how it was rendered. we can say that the movie was quiet and endearing. we don't have flashy and contrived romance here, only two ordinary beings made wonderful by their friendship and unexpressed love for one another. i also loved how the movie used pictures as expressions of relationships past and present. i wished that this was shown here as a regular film. i'm sure it would call out to a bigger audience.

how would you feel if you had only a few weeks left to live? this film helps you to know through the eyes of one guy who is faced with that situation. it is told with sympathy and without too much emotion. some might feel it rather slow - but i think that adds to the realism of the film. some might see it as a love story, but i think that is secondary to seeing his last days through his eyes. the loves of his life are part of the end of his life and give it more impact. low key and gentle, the film rolls out the story much as life does. without clichés and with unexpected events set against a backdrop of getting by. if you like your films gently emotionally realistic this may be for you.

i watched this film with high expectations but was somewhat disappointed. although i like this film and was engrossed by the story, i did not find it moving and think the ending falls flat.the story consists of the friendship between a man running a photo shop and his best customer who is a traffic policewoman. the location is a quaint korean village. this film is in some ways realistic as there is an element of tragedy and yet it is not melodramatic. however i was not ultimately moved by a film depicting a man who is loved so much by a woman, yet does not even give her the choice to enter his life. in my mind he is a sweet, noble loser.good points - excellent acting by the two main leads, enjoyable snapshot of village lifecons - flat endingoverall - good but i prefer the before sunrise and after sunset films (or is it before sunset and after sunrise)

korean "romance" about the owner of a camera store who is diagnosed with a fatal disease. as he goes about his daily routine and prepares for the end he becomes acquainted with a young girl who is a customer. a friendship and romance grows, eve though neither expresses any sort of affection for the other. good film is unlike anything you are likely to see remade in america simply because the studios would insist that the "couple" act on their feelings. he will not say anything because he doesn't have that long to live, she won't because its not the thing thats done and he is not responding as she thinks he should. of course its much more complex than i'm making it out to be and in all honesty its the sort of thing that you should discover for yourself. is it a great film? no, but it is a good one that will move you emotionally. the final lines of the film still haunts me: "i always knew that love would fade like a photograph - but you will remain in my heart as you are in my last moment. thank you and goodbye". it may seem odd out of context but with in the context of the film it is very moving.

i really appreciate what jung-won had done before his death. everything. i want to say that his choice for love is unselfish. if he chose da-rim , that will be good for him. but da-rim will need more time to recover from his death. obviously he does not want to let it happen. as he did in the film, he chose giving up. so it was just temporary agony for da-rim.as comparison, my life without me is very different. their behavior shows big difference between eastern culture and western culture. i cannot say which is better. every one can has right to choose. that is totally up to you. life is equal for everybody. we can live only once. any choice is acceptable if only you think it is fit for you.in truth the slow pace of the film cannot be the excuse for rejecting the movie. just calm down. you will get more from the movie.one of the best korean movies i ever watched. 9/10

this wonderful movie really takes the time to step back and tell the story without words. the end of the movie contains almost no dialogue but what is in the minds of the characters is always perfectly clear. you know the film is not going to have a happy ending but you leave the film feeling hopeful.

this film would have put the typical hollywood "tearjerkers" to shame. the emotions portrayed are subdued and understated in a very comfortable fashion. the plot is cliche enough with a lead role having terminal disease (this is not a spoiler and was well established quite early into the movie) the method of execution is somehow unique from most love stories you ever saw--not even a kiss was being exchanged and yet you will feel the enormous current of love between the two leads. initially, i assumed this "restriction on emotions" to be something analoguous to the typical "eastern values" but later decided against it.this film is so understated that if you compare it with movies like "cinema paradiso", cp would have felt overtly manipulative by comparison. so, it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea.after watching the film, i have this strong feeling that holly- wood love movies, (or love movies all around, to be accurate) have been glorifying romance or passion and label it as "love". i am sure we all have our own definitions and i wouldn't say these qualities are mutually exclusive. but, i would venture to say that the movie will let you wonder if there is any added dimension you have with you loved one.it's very obvious that i enjoy this movie a lot. considering the fact that the movie is so plain in appearance, it is paradoxically one of the more "cinematic" movie i saw lately.

if you want to see a film with no guns, blood, sex, shouting angry people, hero, bad guys & girls or even clumsy love words and you want to see a film in which every shot has the meaning of "love" , this one is a must see film. for me i've been waiting for a film like this all of my life.

i always had this concept that korean movies were all about comedy and drama, but "christmas in autumn" has changed my point of view. this movie is so simple. it doenot have any melodramatic scenes or over the top comedy scenes. not a single scene where the actors cry out loud. not even a scene where the actor and the actress kiss, not even a simple kiss. and yet this movie is able to reach it's viewers in ways that i dint know existed. the ending of the movie left me speechless. i dint even cry, but my eyes were red hot. this movie left me a feeling i can hardly describe in words.i don't think i can recommend this movie to everyone but i do recommend this movie to people who want to watch real cinema. 9.4/10

palwol ui christmas is very korean, if you have been to korea or have korean friends, you should know what i mean. korean are very traditional people, they see love very quitely. a kind of feeling you don't find in today's world. i think that is why this film is so special. it is wrong to compare this film with "love letter" by shunji iwai, japaness are very good but could never make one like palwol ui christmas. if you have a chance please see this movie for yourself.

christmas in august is a perfect movie. a flawless movie about all the flaws of humanity. on the outside it may look like a movie about death, but is in fact a movie about life. i simply cannot recommend this movie enough. and be not afraid, dear readers, it is not a depressing film. as stated, it's a movie about the brightness of life coached under the guise of death. you will laugh. you will cry. you will realize that life is fragile and short. and you will leave the viewing with a better understanding of how precious life is.10 out of 10(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie and reviews of other foreign films)

a photographer in the small city of gunsan in south korea learns that he has a terminal illness but downplays the seriousness of it to his family and friends. we never find out the nature of the disease but the main focus of hur jin-ho's poignant first film christmas in august is not his illness. it is the grace in which he conducts his life - his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. sadly, it was the final film shot by cinematographer yoo young-kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory.the photographer, jung-won, is played by han suk-kyu, at one time, korea's most popular star. a handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. jung-won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (goo shin) and sister (oh ji-hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the vcr, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. as jung-won goes about the day-to-day business of getting his affairs in order, dar-im (shim eun-ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements.abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. love is not something they say or do. it is their ground of being, the place where they come from. to protect dar-im from suffering, jung-won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop's window. although jung-won's decision to withhold his illness from dar-im is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "live life to the fullest" by playing around.one of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. jung-won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. christmas in august is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. it is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. it is a love story where love means having to say you're sorry. although there have been many films on the dying process, christmas in august propels the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. incongruously, this film about death is an experience of the utmost joy.

last time i checked in here i think there was no more than one comment. i'm very glad that more people have caught on this flick now,and even more so about you all digging it as well. i caught this the night of christmas 2004,and i found myself unable to change the channel on my tv,even though it was an asian flick-and i'm-sadly but truly-very used not to give any chance to any off-hollywood products. i did that night,though,and i thank god deeply for it. i've not been able to shake that movie out of my system since-not that i've tried to or wanted to-and it still amazes me-in an extremely grateful way-that such a great,beautiful experience came in such a way,completely unexpected,like a christmas miracle.please,if you got the chance go see this movie,buy it or rent it of bootleg it or whatever,but watch it. i guarantee it will affect you. i'm out of time,but i'm far from finished with my appraissal here,so ill be back as soon as i can.

this is, without a doubt, one of the most accomplished debut films for any director. the movie is only 90 minutes long, but manages to say just about everything about life and death. not much action, and dialogue is minimal, but the movie flows perfectly and demands your attention due to the wonderfully natural feel of everything going on. the performances by the leads are perfection, and even some supporting characters get strong emotional scenes. the movie will be somewhat lost on today's modern audience, but this is one that everyone ought to see.refreshingly unsentimental and honest, this is on par with ozu's works. scratch my title, this one is perfect!

how often do we live our romantic life as on the big screen, with torrid affairs and passionate encounters? almost never, if what i see as normal life around me is anything to judge by. romances, as previously stated, are hardly ever earthshaking affairs that leave you at the top of the world or batter and bruised.romance, in its every day form, as lived out millions of times over around the world, is a slow, subtle, and quiet affair. something that grows in you, ever so slowly, probably without you even noticing it slowly taking over your being. no one can tell me when i am in love. for if someone did, i would not believe him anyway, for no one but me would know. and even then, it is just a feeling, a certain knowledge that you are feeling this exalting emotion. that you want nothing but the best for someone, that you would never want to see them suffer a moment of sadness. that you are willing to take a great degree of pain for them. i would not go so far as to say be willing to die for your loved one, for we are all human, and we do not know what we are capable of in the face of death until that moment is upon us.is the love between the main characters of the film, ever so subtle and understated, no less noble than that between romeo and juliet? the unstated emotions, the unsaid feelings, convey far more than any repeated shouts of "i love you". the restraint shown by the lead actor, displayed ever so poignantly in the scene where he watches his love interest through the cafe window, yet never did he move to make himself known to her, was simply heart-wrenching to watch. would most of us be selfless enough to remain hidden, knowing that her emotions and feelings could not possibly be reciprocated?on another note, how will i deal with my own certain death? while i can claim i have been seriously ill, i can not in all honesty say that i have ever come close to death. will i be so calm, putting all my affairs in order, and leaving instructions for others to take up what i leave behind? i suspect i will be calm, for i will have little choice in the matter. can i be so selfless? again, the answer will have to be in the negative. i can empathize with the anguish, knowing that your life is forfeit, that fate has dealt you a fatal blow, and that future events, however little there are of them left, are no longer under your control.life is nothing more than a series of small events, the culmination of which may seem great for some in retrospect. but only very rarely.

hooray for korean cinema! last year i saw "chungyang" and "nowhere to hide", now i catch up with hur jin-ho's directorial debut "christmas in august". the variety of themes and level of achievement speak highly of a national cinema ripe for discovery. this film's major themes are death and love. the graceful and thoughtful way jung won(han suk-kyu) copes with his impending death, and the sublimation of his desires toward darim(shim eun-ha) out of true love for her. i was deeply moved by his careful management of behavior and emotions, shielding darim from unnecessary pain without rejecting her.the success of this type of film is predicated on the skill of the actors. han and shim excel, being both quite expressive yet naturalistic. a number of secondary characters, jung won's relatives, friends, and clients, are quickly delineated to enrich the story without detracting from its main focus. to live is to love, but all things must pass. pain subsides. life goes on.

i was very happy and at the same time quite surprised by other positive comments written by non-koreans below. this movie is amazingly heartshaking, and shows very 'sad but warm' view toward life which is typical to korean people. i thought other foreigners would not understand this delicate feeling and under-rate this quiet film as a boring one, but i was wrong. the attraction of this film might be hard to avoid to foreigners, too. (even without subtitle...)i would like to mention some points others have missed. of course, this film depicts love between a man and a woman. however, the very theme is way beyond that. actually, it is about time, value of remembrance, and death. in this film, the focus is not on the 'love affair' between two people. as some pointed out, they do not kiss, they do not hug each other, even without holding hands. so love itself is not completed (whether positively or negatively) in the film. rather, what haunts jungwon (a leading actor) is his impending death. he's running out of time, he can't hold it, leaving a few behind including his father and of course, darim (a metermaid). so the problem is how he can face the death and leave something valuable in his short life, not how he can make love with darim.this kind of theme sounds very familiar to us. there are lots of movies regarding patients with uncurable disease such as 'love story'. however, what makes this film outstanding is the way jungwon deals his death. he is a loser, but tried to do his best while he's alive, in a silent way. he does not tell anybody around him about his death. he hides something in his mind but without rage, hate, vengeance. he just tried to do best while he was alive. this limited communication and obedience to fate is the typical mindset of koreans and the point most western people don't understand or at best, misunderstand.this theme is very effectively expressed by the director of this film (surprisingly, his debut). some say he's much influenced by japanese director ozu yasujiro, who directed tokyo story. indeed, i remember i read in some magazine that the director himself admitted he was influenced by ozu. i'm not that knowledged to analyze his style comparing to ozu's, but they have some in common and some not. low angle and static camera, especially remind us ozu's style. but, in terms of theme again, this korean director seems to have somewhat warmer and hopeful vision.it is expressed concisely with jungwon's last photograph. very well done and really heartbreaking scene, i think. actually, the director first had the idea of this film when he participated the funeral of a very famous korean folk singer who died young of mysterious suicide. they say he saw the photograph of the singer at the funeral and thought of a film on death and remembrance. (and possibly hope for the remnants, i think...)i highly recommend this film to anybody who has deep interest in film art as well as korean culture. this film, in my opinion, can be rivaled with other movies like tokyo story, and a sort of american beauty. it is that great if without language barrier. dvd version is going to be out in the market this february, so it might be a little help for foreigners with english subtitle.

towards the end of his career jack arnold, a very efficient director who gave us such classic 50's creature features as "it came from outer space," "the creature from the black lagoon," and "tarantula," teamed up with former football star turned top 70's blaxploitation film headliner fred "the hammer" williamson for a pair of movies, producing the amiable, if unremarkable western "the black bounty hunter" and this refreshingly breezy, clever and highly entertaining 70's black action variant on your standard 40's film noir down-at-the-heels private detective yarn.williamson displays a charming combination of dry, self-deprecating humor and relaxed, easygoing self-confidence as shep stone, a cheap, affable, and forever in debt erstwhile los angeles cop turned private investigator. stone's so hard-up for cash that he uses a bar as his business office and just barely makes ends meet doing penny-ante low-paying minor cases that the police don't want to bother with. while pounding the pavement for one of these deceptively simple gigs (stone's trying to find some guy's runaway teenage daughter who's hiding somewhere in hollywood), stone finds himself elbow deep in a complex, dangerous, seemingly bottomless criminal plot which includes a flipped-out jesus freak religious cult, assorted deadhead hippie dopers, a sordid porno ring, a priceless missing gold-tipped cane that belonged to a legendary silent movie star, a nefarious underground drug smuggling operation, and an ever-growing number of fresh corpses.while lacking the wickedly playful, mischievous ingenuity of robert altman's masterful "the long goodbye" or the haunting, unremitting pessimism of arthur penn's beautifully bleak "night moves," "black eye" nonetheless still makes the grade as a highly successful hip'n'flip 70's spin on 40's mystery suspense thrillers. arnold's capable direction keeps the pace moving at a nice, steady clip, punctuated with sporadic exciting mano-a-mano bare knuckle fight scenes and excellent use of various colorfully seedy l.a. locations (the rundown abandoned amusement park at the film's conclusion is especially effective). the script by mark haggard and jim martin supplies a goodly amount of fairly complicated and often genuinely surprising plot twists. and the expected array of quirky, rough-around-the-edges secondary characters are an interesting oddball bunch, with particularly notable turns by rosemary forsyth as an alluring, powerful lesbian model agency owner (forsyth has the picture's best line, boasting to stone when she first meets him, "i'm a whole lot of woman"), teresa graves of "get christie love" tv show fame as stone's loyal bisexual girlfriend (the film's casual, nonjudgmental depiction of both foryth's unconventional femme fatale and graves' equally atypical gal friday is one of its strongest assets), and bret morrison, who did the voice of radio's "the shadow" in the 40's, as a smugly sleazy porno filmmaker. all in all, it's a modest, yet surefire winner.

i have reasons to love the great users of a camera; fluid direction of action lends itself to fast-paced adventure and comedy narrative; but such a skill, in the hands of a king vidor or an anthony mann can also be applied to idea-level work. this is paul wendkos' masterpiece. its storyline can be retailed in a single pair of sentences. general hector cordoba is setting up as near-emperor in northern mexico, and steals a huge cannon from general blackjack pershing. he sends his crack mission unit, divided, apprehensive but determined, led by george peppard, to get the cannon back and bring back cordoba alive, to put an end to the rebellion. charismatic raf vallone plays cordoba; the ladies in the piece are giovanna ralli and francine york; with the squad even further comprised of nico minardos, peter deuel, and don gordon. other stalwarts in the class include john larch and john russell. also horning in on an already fantastically-dangerous operation are miss ralli, and a stubborn mexican teniente (gabriela tinti) whose regiment was betrayed when cordoba set up on his own. the danger is multiplied when gordon's brother as advance spy is captured and tortured to death while he has to watch...and he decides he needs to kill peppard. the attack that captures the cannon, when peppard's orders are not obeyed by a regular army type, is one of the most electrifying visual and staging achievements in cinematic history; the penetration of cordoba's stronghold, the revelations uncovered there, and the actions that win the mission team a chance at victory--or almost victory--are flawlessly presented. this is a beautiful color adventure film, with unusually strong costumes, acting, lighting, art direction sets and music by elmer bernstein. the script by stephen kandel is probably his best ever for a feature film. this is probably the most underrated major western at the moment, but i have always appreciated its heroes as result- getting hard-workers. but as peppard reminds his group on the way home, "the trouble with being a "hero"--is the morning after". to find out why he says so, you will have to see "cannon for cordoba".

once you sit down to see this film " a cannon for cordoba " you get the feeling it's going to be a great. the reason? the film begins with a rousing score by noted composer elmer bernstein who gave us such memorable themes as 'the great escape and the magnificent seven.' indeed, when you read the opening credits headlining the cast is none other than george peppard as capt. rod douglas, you know it's going to have action and lot's of it. furthermore when you see actor john russel playing general john j. pershing, you know you're in for a heroic saga. the story is taken from the annals of the mexican revolution and involves the u.s. in a border town dispute with the mexican bandits who cross the rio grande in the early 1900s. among the most brazen of the rebel leaders is general cordova (raf vallone). with his army of mexican revolutionaries, he attacks pershing, kills his men and steals some valuable artillery pieces. since the united states army cannot enter mexico legally, capt. douglas is sent on what is slated a suicide mission, without orders and without aid from pershing. his mission is to retrieve the cannons, destroy a rebel stronghold and bring cordova back alive. selecting the roughest, toughest, most experienced, certainly the most insolent men available, douglas enters mexico and attacks the nearly impregnable fortress. dramatic action follows, as does lots of explosive excitement. if one is asks for criticism, i would say the choice of heavies. vallone and john larch are not very menacing. not so with the men who side with peppard. pete duel and don gordon (who is superb.) nevertheless, this movie is recommended as good viewing. ****

hard justice is an excellent action movie! the whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting! for the people who say they don't make shoot em ups like they use to. well, this one is really hard-core! david bradley is really good and his character takes a pounding in the movie. he gets hit by the stick over a dozen times, gets stabbed in the back and is in a coma for three days and then wakes up and fights again, gets beat up, recovers and is ready for more action! his character is incredibly tuff! charles napier was very good as well and he arguably steals the show! vernen wells was good! professor toru tanaka had a short and an uncredited role in hard justice! as for the action, it is truly awesome with all of the gun fights and the huge stand off like scene in the beginning has cars getting blown up and flipping up in mid air! there is so much that happens in the 95 minute run time. for the action fans you will be blown away by all of the fire power and fighting that this film has to offer! hard justice is a movie that isn't easy to locate and if you are at a video store and you see it for sale buy it up because this movie is big keeper an d plus the box is cool! there is a ton of action that has to be seen to be believed! look and see if you can find some good deals on ebay, half.com, amazon.com's z-shops and market place sellers! i strongly recommend that any action movie fan who loves shoot ems and fighting movies and has been disappointed by other movies that have the look like a true non stop action flick but fails to deliver it to get hard justice!

this movie is very similar to death warrant with jean-claude van damme and also has some similarities to island of fire with jackie chan and i also heard that there is some other very similar action movies, but this film has a much better action than death warrant or even island of fire (that's right, the jackie chan's movie). rarely american action movies has such a great action sequences, though there was many negative reviews on this film, it easily beats most of the action movies of that time who were more successful. there were many martial art's scenes, david bradley was fast as bruce lee in this film and what else was good, that fighting scenes were much longer than in most of the american martial art's movies. the shoot-out scenes were similar with john woo's movies, maybe not that good, but still very exiting. there was also many impressive explosions and one great chase scene. i've seen some other david bradley's movies, but this one, yet is the best in terms of action. ok, this movie has some cheesy moments, but which movie hasn't? the acting was decent, charles napier was incredible and his character was real tough. adam clark who played squid and yuji okumoto who played the main bad guy were also very good. other actors acted pretty well too, though the acting isn't important in this type of movies. if you are action movies fan (i mean the real action movies fan, who really can appreciate the good action), than you must see this film.

a tremendous action movie that i have ever seen. it was the first expression that i uttered after watching it twice on the local tv in my country, indonesia. a combination between a constant shooting and a great fighting choreography played well by david bradley. he was good here besides "american samurai". his skill in martial art was performed above average. he succeeded to make the fighting scenes nice to watch. not only punching and kicking like what most of martial artists show in their movies. david bradley could utilize all the martial arts techniques such as throwing, smashing and kicking. very recommended for action fans.i have tried to look for the dvd but i still cannot get it particularly in my town. anyone could help me?

"hell to pay" bills itself as the rebirth of the classic western... it succeeds as a western genre movie that the entire family could see and not unlike the films baby-boomers experienced decades ago. the good guys are good and the bad guys are really bad! . bo svenson, stella stevens, lee majors, andrew prine (excellent in this film) tim thomerson and james drury are all great and it's fun to see them again. james drury really shines in this one, maybe even better than his days as "the virginian." in a way, "hell to pay" reminds me of those movies in the 60's where actors you know from so many shows make an appearance. if you're of a certain age, buck taylor, peter brown and denny miller and william smith provide a "wow" factor because we seldom get to see these icons these days. "hell to pay" features screen legends along with newer names in hollywood. most notable in the cast of "newbies" is rachel kimsey (rebekah), who i've seen lately on "the young and the restless" and kevin kazakoff, who plays the angst-ridden kirby, a war-weary man who's torn between wanting to live and let live or stepping in to "do the right thing." william gregory lee is excellent as chance, kirby's mischievous and womanizing brother. katie keane plays rachel, rebekah's sister, a woman who did what was necessary to stay alive but giving up her pride in the process. in a small but memorable role, jeff davis plays mean joe, a former confederate with a rather nasty mean streak. i think we'll be seeing more of these fine actors in the future. "hell to pay" is a fun movie with a great story to tell grab the popcorn, we're headin' west!.

this certainly is one of the best western movies produced in the new millennium. it's an homage to all the stars of the great tv western classics, and it is the ultimate revival of the western movie. the story of two brothers who meet after the war between the states and end up on different sides of the law isn't new but interesting nonetheless, and the shootouts and the atmosphere are great. there is some graphic violence like bad guys getting chopped to death with an axe or women being shot down in cold blood, and lee majors doesn't take part in the action until the very end, that's why i gave it 9 out of 10 points. but it still is one of the best new western productions i've ever seen. i've had the honor and pleasure to meet chris mcintyre at the festival of the west and have a nice chat with him, and i've had the chance to meet buck taylor who performs the role of town doctor. in my opinion, we ought to be much obliged to chris mcintyre for his efforts to gather that many stars of the classic tv westerns and sass around him to perform in a new western such as this. chris has an outstanding talent for choosing the right actors for the main characters, too. both are young and promising, and i think we should see more of them in future western productions. i sincerely enjoyed this western movie - it was worth every minute. i hope that chris mcintyre will continue to work on other western movies and present us with some more great productions such as this one. great work, chris! jasper p. morgan (pete)

good film.i managed to pick this up on dvd in a local store sale. £2.99 seems like a good deal and it is. thing is the film is named "to kill for". it took a little detective work to find out it's original name.in the uk it has been rated as an 18 and rightly so although the standard of films depends on the "ability to sell". having seen final destination 3 last night it, in my view, should have been a 18.maybe the fact the delightful, traci lords is in it tends to make the classification board step it up to 18. such a shame.traci is a great actress and should be given the chance to appear in bigger and large budget productions. she ability to turn what is branded a b-movies into a fine performance is nothing short of amazing.long live traci lords and her incredible talent as an actress.

many of us find art agreeable only when the masterpiece itself touches something deep inside us. that is, the completed creation can only be accepted and appreciated if we can somehow personally relate to it. it was winter, here in australia 1992 when i had seen batman returns at the cinemas and it blew me away. both "me's". i was supposed to belong to an ideal, a standard, but at the same time i was living another life. tim burton was the first film maker to say its ok for a comic movie to be dark and to confess that darkness can happen to us all. after tim burton's batman interpretations, many other dark comic book heroes and anti-heroes flooded the cinemas. comic book folklore for decades had told of friendly, likable heroes with dashingly handsome smiles and magical superpowers who fly in the sky, and spun powerful webs from their wrists and wore red boots and had the strength of a locomotive. but what happens when you are only ten years old and you see your parents coldly executed in front of your very eyes? you snap. somewhere in your psyche,your young tender psychological make up breaks apart. the only way such pain and hurt can be managed is to create an alternate persona.you make a promise. your other self will be stronger, harness all the anger all the rage to use whatever means available to avenge the innocence of your parents onto that criminal, those criminals, any criminal. this is life seen through bruce wayne's eyes. both pairs. the world he sees is dark, gloomy, and cold. although he patrols the streets and people hear him cruise by, they don't rush out to get his autograph. he is their saviour, not the winner of a personality contest. batman returns is about losers. batman, for yet another christmas, remains "the only lonely man beast in town". bruce wayne never gets to lawfully arrest the vile max shreck. the penguin never gets to unleash his pain of being discarded by his parents onto the citizens of gotham, and selina kyle is forever lost to being mentally fragmented and traumatized. and the hero doesn't get the girl- or cat.this movie delves into the desire in all of us to want so desperately to belong, to have a home, as expressed by bruce wayne and oswald cobblepot.the film brings out a need in all of us to be heard, respected and not ignored as desired by selina kyle , oswald and of course bruce wayne. but sometimes we are all suppressed in one way or another, we are told to be an ideal, to behave to a certain standard. that is until we finally snap. only hope remains at the end of the movie as we see catwoman rise towards the night sky. but come what may we all must wish good will towards all men and women. as for me , i cant say that i will reach a point where i will believe my problem with duality will be reconciled. but thats ok. we all have a dark side. batman returns is not only the best of the batman films ,it is truly a stand out exceptionally fine masterpiece of storytelling.

ah, batman returns, is it possible to have a sequel to be almost as good as the original? with batman returns, it came pretty close! we have terrific actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new villains, catwoman and the penguin. we have michael keaton back as batman and he's still awesome than ever. michelle pfieffer, the perfect choice for catwoman and was perfectly cast into place. as much as i love and is such an incredible actress annette benning, she couldn't have been catwoman, she doesn't really have the look. danny devito, who could have imagined him as the penguin? he was just great and terrifying! batman returns with a more loving community of gotham city, they are celebrating christmas time with, max shrek played by a creepy christopher walken. the perfect villain who mistreats his lovely secretary, selina who happens to hear too much at his office causing him to push her out the window in hopes that she dies and will never reveal the information of knowing the penguin and the attempt to make him loved in gotham. when she survives and is awakened by cats, she wants revenge and is ready to go at it with her cats! but there is also another active villain, the penguin who is in search of his parents that abandoned him and now he is looking to be the new mayor of gotham city! can batman be able to stop both super villains from creating their hanous acts and stop the mayor from destroying the city as well?you'll have to see! batman returns is just as good as the original batman, despite the first one remaining the true classic, this one still takes you for a ride. and come on, i mean we've got michelle in leather! her classic moment of just meeting batman and the penguin "meow" is classic! there are memorable characters, lines, and sets! you'll have a blast! trust me! 9/10

and a perfect film to watch during the holiday season as the winter/xmas atmosphere that burton creates for gotham city is way cool. it's weird that warner decided to release this as a summer film. it doesn't fit.but what's even weirder, when you consider the content of this film, is that it was aimed at families. an upper-class family throws their mutant baby down the sewer, a socio phobic billionaire dresses up in leather as a flying rodent, a lonely secretary dresses up in leather as a feline and a freak runs for political office. and s&m and bondage are presented in a very perverted way. but burton got away with it. his visual style in this film is at it's best.this and batman: dead end are the only true live-action incarnations of the comic-book character. true, the animated series was the closest to the source material, but compared with batman forever and the un-nameable one after that, batman returns is the best of the four.darker and more violent than the first movie, the sense of gothic pathos reaches a new high. i was quite keen on michael keaton as bruce wayne (don't even get me started on george clooney!), he displayed the right balance of weirdo loner and cool crime fighter. michelle pfieffer is great as catwoman (much sexier and more 'realisticly' cat-like), she wears that leather outfit better than halle berry. and danny devito was so convincing as the penguin that his scenes became disturbing to watch. and christopher walken is brilliant as the spooky max shreck (if you think you recognise chip shrek it's none other than a very young leatherface/butterfinger).danny elfman's score is also even better than it was first time round. his powerful and engaging themes are way better than the dross that followed in the later 2 schumacher movies. this movie is the batman phenomenon at its zenith. forget the following sequels and stick to the animated series after this. let's hope that christopher nolan and christian bale can bring some integrity back to the live action batman with their movie next year.this dvd was one of the first ever dvds released by warner (almost 7 years ago!!!) and as a result there are no features and the case is a snapper. pick it up cheap like i did and hope for an se in the future.

in extramarital we see b-actress traci lords at her very best. she's all wrapped in horror & suspense here, a type of role that suits her very well.this mainstream movie lends a lot of its atmosphere from paul verhoeven's 'basic instinct' (1992), by the way. however, there are differences between the main female characters of traci lords ('99) and that of sharon stone ('92). for instance, in extramarital traci adds some tiny elements from her porn-past. we also shouldn't forget mentioning extramarital's three main actors. by putting down a convincing performance, each of them greatly contributes to the overall quality of this movie. all this makes extramarital into a very enjoyable b-movie. its storyline shows a good build-up, its tense being well-spread from start to finish. this movie keeps you at the edge of your seat, until its unexpected end.

"step by step," is my opinion, is a pure abc hit! i can't recall every episode, but i still enjoyed it. it's hard to say which episode was my favorite. however, i think it was always funny when a mishap occurred at school. i always laugh at that. as a matter of fact, i think just about every single one of j.t. (brandon call) and cody's (sasha mitchell) lines were funny. it would have been nice if penny (patrika darbo) had stayed on the show throughout its entire run. everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. in conclusion, i hope it never stops airing in syndication.

i watched this show until my puberty but still i found it to reflex many situations that worry us when we're teenagers although it was a family oriented show. until the mid 90's it focused more on the young adults and their situations.that's why i loved "step by step". i mean, it offered situations for every age and unlike many shows of it's kind, it delivered expectations.let's be honest; this wasn't an extremely funny show, no, but it had some situations that you could feel related to but only funnier.there was an extremely good charm between patrick duffy and susan sommers. duffy rocked! sommers was tender and actually funny. i was in love with stacy keegan because she was extremely sexy (loved her legs) and witty. but sasha mitchell stole the show with his cody character. he was the man back in the day! oh, the memories. nowadays, this show wasn't been able to adequate correctly on the new generations and that's why it should be kept in the vault of memories. that's it, only memories.thank you step by step for making my puberty funnier.

me and a coupla friends form university - alberto lopez, dave hall, celina alcock (we graduated from uea, norwich, uk in 1997) still get together and watch b-movies once a month.we are consummate experts in the art of bad movie-making, and this film was quickly placed in the top 10 of awful/brilliant movies.so if you've just got the beers and weed in, and need a film to laugh like a drain at, droid gunner aka phoenix 2 is the film for you! marc singer is totally aware he's in a turkey of a film here, and milks it for everything he can! matthius hues is sublime in his wooden acting and musclebound moronity (is that a word??) as he grunts "but i want my 20 thousand!" pure shlock gold! if you liked this, also see: trancers, the runestone, dollman and anything by charles band or fred olen ray.....(but be warned: some of their films are completely and utterly without merit and you'll be screaming for those lost hours of your life!!!?!).

after watching this film i experienced a new sensation. i had watched a film in which the lead actor had put in a performance that almost rivaled the legend chevy chase in 'fletch'. this isn't to say that the performances are comparable, but both give practically flawless delivery of their lines. that actor is marc singer! singer is jack ford, the 'droid gunner' of the title, grinding out a living collecting the bounty on androids.there are some mutants, topless pleasure droids(!), a scandinavian smuggler, and possibly a half-hearted attempt to make a statement on class or maybe even globalization or......... well it doesn't really matter. what matters about this film is the dry manner in which singer delivers his lines resulting in side-splitting humour! what matters about this film is that director fred olen ray seems to realize that serious sci-fi very rarely works, and when your budget is skimpy it is best not to take yourself to seriously. olen ray has said that everyone involved in this film had great fun and this transfers onto the film.i dare you to criticize a film that allows itself to portray futuristic earth as eternally dark and neon-lit and then ends in a 'pipes and valves' warehouse. self parody is a very redeeming quality. to summarise, fred olen ray is an ambassador for independent film making and marc singer the perfect b-movie lead.if only olen ray could draft in tim thomerson to the equation then we'd have a film on our hands.

therefore it is important to talk about the dvd release instead of just the film. tales from the crapper is a film that only one studio in the world could deliver. the one that has brought us innovative and original real independent films for 30 plus years now: troma. this is truly a very special film because it manages to be certainly not my favorite of the troma-productions, but released on a disc that because of what i just said is one of my most valued and favorite dvd's. not only counting the countless troma discs i own, but counting my entire collection of films. the film itself is the result of an ill fated plan to produce a television series to be directed by a director who was trusted with a substantial amount of money (especially for troma) to make something wonderful and delivered a lot of unfinished and incomprehensible material before quitting (or being fired, i am not sure which at this moment). in order to prevent having to shove a vast investment down the toilet lloyd kaufman and michael herz decided to get together a team of directors and actors and use the material as the backbone of one movie. one movie that really consists of two, in the nice old tales from the crypt anthology fashion, hosted by the crapkeeper played by mr kaufman himself. but, as i said, not quite my own favorite of all their movies. that is greatly due to a weird sense of discipline at the various sets, forgetting about the hard troma rule of "no booze on the set" which was discovered by a furious lloyd and other less respectable employees that troma had at the time of the filming of the added scenes. all this made it all but impossible for mr kaufman to make a worthwhile product in the editing room. but lloyd kaufman is a genius, and with the troubled added scenes to an already misshapen start-product he crafted not much less of a masterpiece. the film itself is as good as circumstances would allow the most brilliant filmmaker to slice together and it is certainly highly entertaining, totally confusing, loaded with those elements that made troma great and certainly unique and one of a kind. as a film itself, though, not as brilliant as many other troma productions. the genius of independent cinema however made the dvd of this film so much more than a release of a film with some extra's. the film is, when push comes to shove, actually only a part of the entire dvd that in its whole is a document of the difficult situation serious filmmakers find themselves in having to survive in a world that is monopolized by the few very big ones who don't really allow any other players on their market turf. a document of the problems one has when trusting people to be on the level, only to find out that freedom sometimes is something that is hard to live up to and realization that access to a movie budget when the boss is not around can corrupt even those who should really know better. the brilliance of this dvd is that the film is not perfect, and that lloyd knows it, and doesn't want to make anyone think he believes it is. the full-length commentary is a show in itself (as is often the case with mr. kaufan's audio commentaries), mixing humor, sneers at those who deserve it and highly interesting information for anyone interested in independent film-making in such a fashion that watching the film again with this commentary straight after viewing it on its own merits is so interesting it is hard to stop. the feature-length documentary the thick brown line takes us behind the scenes at the various locations where lloyd visits the sets only to sometimes take over and make the most of what he finds there. we see him somewhat disillusioned sometimes, different from his appearances in other making of documents such as fart of darkness and apocalypse soon, both to be found in the must-own make your own damn movie box set. the added scenes with james gunn (who started his career at troma only to find success as a writer an now a director in hollywood) and trey parker (again someone to start out with a troma-released work, to later be a national hero with his south park series) are entertaining and probably (as is much else on this release) a reason for obtaining this disc alone for anyone remotely interested in the work of these two characters. loaded with much more than i could mention here (including a second audio-commentary) this is one of the best troma-dvd-releases.

these were two video shot movies that troama decided were horrible so in a desperate move turned into this one movie. perhaps the bitterness on troama's side helped spark the comedy, but for whatever reason this is very funny stuff with an inspired bit with "oliver stone" doing commentary during the movie. lots of cameos, lots of use of the lesbian cannibal hoedown song add to the fun. trey parker, ted raimi, julie strain etc etc....one of the best of recent troama releases. yes it's all over the place, know that going in, the production quality, or lack of, becomes one of the many running jokes. go with it and you'll be in for a good time.the behind the scenes, frequently the best things about troama releases are also above average this time around. i really think the anger they felt over these two lousy films helped drive them to, well not greatness, but drove them to "fix" this film in a way that's better than either of the films would have been as they were originally planned.

this was an excellent movie - fast-paced, well-written and had an intriguing plot. the special effects were innovative, especially in the opening scene. the training segment got a bit silly but overall it was a tense movie.

okay so i love aidan quinn's acting even with a bad script. this is not the case in the assignment. as other viewers have said, this was a movie i stumbled upon on cable and got so into it i didn't want it to end. take one cuban american navy ofc.(quinn)who is an upright, uptight soldier and family man. add a crazed agent(donald sutherland) who is looking for the worlds most notorious terrorist and add a ben kingsley and you have "the assignment". sutherland is a witness of the most notorious terrorist carlos actions in a cafe on a lovely day where he is so profoundly rocked at this mans evil that his sole reason to live is to get this man as long as he draws breath.take one soldier on a pass in israel who is a dead ringer for this man and is beaten and held by kingsley until they realize they have a plan. by taking on carlos by being him, or being forever responsible for never helping rid the world of him, makes for a very heavy assignment and guilt trip. by not helping his country he is bound as a man and his military duty to chose wisely. so the training begins. lets say carlos training is right up there with the academy of arts and holocausts. when i say this intense and wonderfully casted,scripted and executed film rates the best, i am not understating it. all three actors could save almost any script..together this is a movie to be seen from frame one to credits. i am not into terrorism or movies about it but i got hooked! bravo again to aidan quinn who for once plays a heavy that could hold up to any actor including gary oldman. thats a compliment. rent it and get lots of popcorn. oh did i mention the sex?? it works better than "last tango!"and its educational.

while "the jackal" [remake of the excellent "day of the jackal"] has better esthetics [and a boatload budget], this film nails the actual persona of "carlos" down...quinn excels as the naval officer enlisted to impersonate the wiley jackal to draw him out of hiding and, at the hands of kingsley and sutherland, turns himself inside out to do so. risking his family, his career and all that he believes in, he takes on the task, albeit utterly unwillingly.to say more would spoil it... this is an excellent film.3 1/2 niro~stars [of 4]

a very intelligent and exciting thriller that doesn't rely on action but on situation, which is all to rare these days. i would compare this film to the day of the jackal, another film about the pursuit of a dangerous international criminal. the acting across the board is superlative - aidan quinn has a tricky double role as the vicious terrorist carlos and as the navy man who impersonates him. donald sutherland plays the amoral cia agent who hires him. ben kingsley plays the israeli officer who assists in the plan. this is a very tense and effective film, and it's remarkable considering just how little action there is in it. the first half of the film is all set-up, as the navy man prepares to impersonate carlos. the second half is a breathless actioner, the action coming out of the characters and their situations, thus making it all the more gripping. a really tight film that shouldn't be overlooked.

the movie was very good. i'm an avid mystery fan and i usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. while i did figure out who was going to be killed i didn't figure out who did it. i wasn't happy with the portrayal of the gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. please know that while these poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have japp, ms. lemon and especially hastings! david suchet is definitely poirot. i have seen every actor who's played him. the worst was peter ustinov!

the acting is good, the action is good, and so is the plot. if you like some good, fast entertainment with an air for authentic action scenes, not the hollywood (looks great, but is totally ridiculous) kind, you're in for a special treat. just sit back and enjoy...

an excellent "sleeper" of a movie about the search for carlos the international assassin. am surprised this film didn't rake in $100-million-plus because it's much better than most films that do so. rent it now.

i must say i didn't expect much about this movie, but it turned out not to be bad at all. most striking of course, was aidan quinn's performance. i would never expect to see this fine actor as an action hero. the great thing about it is that he really builds up his character (annibal). i mean, it was not like mel gibson or bruce willis would do it, he was sensitive and modest. for example, he's really upset when he kills someone. i also noticed that some clichés were avoided. when annibal gets his training, you would easily expect him to be a rebel and act like any average american would do in such a situation, ask what the f*** is going on and refusing to cooperate. but annibal is a professional marine officer, he doesn't give up and he tries not to lose his courage, in which he succeeds pretty well, except for a brief break-down on christmas eve, which i think was very realistic. i'm glad that aidan quinn got this opportunity to show another side of him (in fact two, because he plays the villain as well), even although the film wasn't that successful.

picture the scene: a bored student with an empty day ahead, a video shop with a special offer of 5 video for a week rentals. this ex-student usually just grabbed a pile of videos of dubious quality for the most arbitrary of reasons (the turning anybody?). occasionally the odd undiscovered gem did make it into his vcr - this being the case with this film. everything about the film is good, but much more than this the parts all mesh to provide something all too rare - a cracking good film. why this never got a uk cinema release is beyond me, especially when we consider the crap that we have to wade through at the multiplex week on week. whilst i'll happily accept this isn't oscar material (but neither was sodding titanic - schmaltzy cgi-tinged bollocks) it is a an extremely enjoyable film. i was trying to think of a way to describe how best this film should be appreciated/accepted - the perfect film to watch while bonding with your dad, after a coming home for the holidays, after a large sunday lunch.

when i first heard about this back in 1997, over coffee with friends, i decided to check it out. the only problem was that it was on a small screen at one of my local cinema's.that didn't stop the enjoyment of seeing a simply great movie, with a top notch cast in aidan quinn, donald sutherland, and ben kingsley. the whole movie, kept me glued to my seat. i simply found no flaws in this great movie, i give it my highest recommendation to those who love thrillers. i am very proud to have this in my collection.10/10 ( i don't hand this out lightly).

i saw this movie last night and thought it was decent. it has it's moments i guess you would say. some of the scenes with the special ops forces were cool, and some of the location shots were very authentic. i won't be putting this movie in my dvd collection but it is fair enough to recommend for renting. i guess nothing set the movie at another level compared to others of the same genre. the action is good, the acting is decent, the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion, and the story is pretty interesting. 7 out of ten

this is the classic case of an excellent film being looked over by the american public simply due to the fact it didn't have bruce willis or arnold schwarzenneger as the lead man - adrian quinn does a better dual performance, thats right you heard it dual performance in this film than either of those have ever pulled off in their careers! well anyway, now to the review... the assignment is loosely based upon the story of carlos the jackal, a 1970's radical who terrorized europe for years before finally being apprehended by french agents. in this adaptation, a us naval officer (adrian quinn) is on leave in israel when he is apprehended by mossad (isreal's crack intelligence / counter-terrorism agency) and took in for questioning due to the fact he looks exactly like the jackal (this is the one extremely cheesey part of the film, but trust me it doesn't detract from the great value of this film). when it is discovered mr. ramirez is not the jackal, however, he is recruited by a hardened cia agent by the name of jack shaw (donald sutherland, who does his usual grizzled mysterious government authority figure routine but in a stupendous manner) who has spent his life hunting the jackal, and the series of events which follow will captivate anyone who watches this film - it is chock full of great acting, without all the usual action film cliches and one-liners, and a great plot which will surprise anyone. the three leading men - quinn, sutherland and kingsley - carry this film much further than its modest budget would have allowed with anyone else filling their shoes. also kudos to the director and his staff, the camera angles and cinematography are top notch, especially in the action scenes. the assignment is better than anyone renting it could ever expect, its a pity the film did fairly poorly in the box office, otherwise we might see a sequel to this stupendous espionage thriller. 9/10 stars, this reviewer highly recommends it to all potential viewers!

the movie was very good. i'm an avid mystery fan and i usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. while i did figure out who was going to be killed i didn't figure out who did it. i wasn't happy with the portrayal of the gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. please know that while these poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have japp, ms. lemon and especially hastings! david suchet is definitely poirot. i have seen every actor who's played him. the worst was peter ustinov!

just after having moved into his new cottage in the english country, hercule poirot gets an invitation to dinner from sir henry and lady angkatell, the owners of a large mansion nearby. but the next day, one of the guests is found shot near the pool, and his clumsy wife is holding a revolver a few steps away....this agatha christie mystery is somewhat thin, though the killer's plan is still very clever. it's the exquisite filming and cinematography that elevate the story to a higher level. this episode mostly keeps the serious tone of "five little pigs" and "sad cypress", but contains more dark humor than them. the cast includes possibly the two most famous actors to have worked in the series by this point, edward fox (as the butler) and sarah miles (as lady angkatell), though the standout performance is given by the dazzlingly beautiful megan dodds as the ahead-of-her-time henrietta: her one-on-one confrontations with suchet sparkle and are the highlights of the film. oh, and since an english police inspector does get involved in the case, i think they could have brought philip jackson back for this one. (***)

this is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of 'the hollow'. it could be argued that the actual mystery here is not one christie's best but what makes 'the hollow' special is the characterisation and i found the actors here, more or less without exception, were perfect in their parts. in such a uniformly good cast it's difficult to select stand out performances but i have to say that sarah miles is just perfect as lucy angkatell. what is extraordinary is that she not only conveys lucy's dottiness, tactlessness and her more lovable qualities but she also manages to pull off the underlying truth that in fact, lucy is not really all that nice! megan dodds is also very good as henrietta and claire price very affecting as gerda. john christow is really quite an unlikeable character but jonathan cake nevertheless manages to make us see what his women see in him.as i said, the script follows the story quite faithfully. the only disconcerting thing i found was that midge and edward's relationship really comes out of nowhere and i do believe that some of it must have ended up on the cutting room floor! theirs a secondary story however and the primary story is very well done. the whole thing looks beautiful as well, really capturing a perfect english autumn.its a beautiful film in every respect and well worth seeing.

this movie deserves a 20/10 if i could give one. "the hollow" is a great hercule poirot novel and the twist at the end fools most people. i am overjoyed that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel. there was no major difference that i could spot. the only difference was that poirot was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel. the acting was superb, and the music, as usual, was amazing quality! david suchet is perfect in his role, and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either. in no other movie that i've seen so far has poirot been portrayed so brilliantly! hats off to the producers-- they have made a movie that i along with many others will cherish for a long time to come!

excellent work all around especially by the actress who played the wife gerda (claire price) as well, of course, as david suchet. i did really figure out whodunit but that is beside the point. the ending, which i won't divulge (someone describes it on the board in answer to someone else's question if you are interested.) i found really sad. despite agatha christie's reputation for writing cardboard characters, i thought these really well-rounded by and large.the pacing of the story was good and i enjoyed seeing sarah miles as lucy and edward hardwicke (cedric's son i believe in addition to being a well-known dr. watson.)) as her husband.

david suchet,(poirot),"foolproof",'03, gave an outstanding performance as a perfectionist in almost everything he did or said. if he had a cocktail, he always had a napkin to blot the excess on his mouth with unbelievable perfection! you could just view the expressions on the detective's face and see that he never missed an item of importance in the suspects behavior. the beautiful falls colors through out the english countryside was simply breath taking. megan dodds, "bait",2000, gave an outstanding performance as a very sexy, wild woman who was able to keep very important secrets away from mr. poirot. a very enjoyable film if you really like the acting of david suchet as mr. poirot!

i like the phrase "british post war suburban paranoia" that one of the reviewers used. it describes so well the kind of films john mills excelled in ("the october man" (1947), "the long memory" (1952)) in between "big" pictures ("scott of the antartic" (1948) and "war and peace" (1956)).this distinctly "eric ambler" style plot had john mills playing dr. howard latimer, who promises his friend, charles, (unseen) to meet a visiting german actress, frieda veldon (lisa daniely) at the airport. a creepy "reporter" jeffrey windsor (lionel jeffries) is in his consulting rooms at the time and offers to give him a lift but while he is tracking the actress down windsor informs him she is already in the car waiting!!! (something fishy is going on!!!). howard is dropped off for his date and thinks no more about it.the next night he finds her body when he arrives home from work, further more, he finds his friend charles could not have rung him as he is still in new york and windsor doesn't seem to exist. earlier on a patient, mrs ambler(rene ray) who has been referred to him by doctor george kimber (mervyn johns) tells of her recurring dream about finding a dead body and a brass candlestick with a square base. it is a nightmare that is coming true for howard but of course when detective inspector dane (roland culver) interviews her, she denies all knowledge of the conversation - the candlestick is later found in the boot of howard's daimler.when howard is lying low, robert brady (wilfred hyde-white) visits him. he calls himself a "friend" - he has a photo of windsor that he wants to trade for a box of matches frieda gave howard at the airport. howard returns to the flat, charles rings and while howard is on the phone an unknown assailant knocks him out and steals the matches!!! who can he trust - who hasn't something to hide!!!this is a top thriller - not quite in the same class as "the october man", but with john mills doing what he does best - playing ordinary men caught up in impossible mysteries!!!highly recommended.

the film is a remake of a 1956 bbc serial called'my friend charles',& as such gallops thru the material in a relatively short time.i found it fast moving,enjoyable & unpretentious.did anyone else notice the scenes,towards the end,where john mills was being gassed?-the producers obviously decided to omit the scenes-maybe censorship?,but notice when he's sat by the window of the flat,deep breathing closely followed by similar scenes with the car window open. the francis durbridge serials all seemed to inhabit the same universe,that of unexplained happenings,people being not what they seem & the villain being someone close to the hero/victim.a predictable universe in some ways,but one with its own rules & regulations.

"the vicious circle" is a very unknown british mystery story. like many hitchcock movies, it's about a man who is being accused of a crime he didn't commit, and does everything he can to prove it. this time it's a dr. latimer (john mills), who finds a murdered german actress from his floor. as an honest man, the doctor calls scotland yard, which turns out to be a big mistake...there's really nothing special in this little movie. still, watching the film is an entertaining way to pass time. i enjoyed following the plot development. fine actors are a plus.

this is a plot driven movie and extremely entertaining. nothing startling or original within the plot, but crucially, it moves along at a great pace and therefore keeps your attention. i didn't really notice the acting which i guess is a good thing. john mills was fine but did seem to take everything in his stride somewhat considering how his life was falling apart around him. he would be clumped on the head, stand up 20 seconds later, dust himself down and carry on as if nothing had happened. a minor quibble in a film with a strong story, authentic locations and a plot that continually keeps you guessing right up to its conclusion.

yes, i am sentimental, and yes, i love movies where kids are the better humans. true, klatretøsen does have some logical or even plot shortcomings. these are more than compensated by the kids' great acting (julias first movie role at all!) and the charm of a dogma film (i liked this kind of cinematografic art long before the dogma; ever since herzog's 'herz aus glas'). well, i cried through the last fifteen minutes which is a higher tear factor than bambi or fly away home had for me.

klatret©ªsen(catch that girl) is really great movie! it's a 'happy' movie. i watched this movie in 'puchon international fantastic film festival(pifan)' on july 12nd, 2003. there is action + adventure + comedy + thrill + happy + romance(cute kids' love triangle!). you must see this movie. :)

i just saw this movie at the berlin film festival's children's program and it just killed me (and pretty much everyone else in the audience)! and make no mistake about it, this film belongs into the all-time-250! let me tell you that i'm in no way associated with the creators of this film if that's what you come to believe reading this. no, but this actually is it! nevermind the "kid's-film" label on it, "klatretösen" ("climber girl") is on almost every account a classic (as in "biblical")! the story concerns 12-year old ida (magnetic: julie zangenberg), who is devastated to learn of her daddy's terminal illness. special surgery in the us would cost 1.5 million and of course, nobody could afford that. so ida and her friends jonas and sebastian do what every good kid would - and burglarize a bank! sounds corny? don't forget: this is not america and "klatretösen" is by no means the tear-jerking robin-williams-multiplex-plat-du-jour nobody takes seriously anyway. director fabian wullenweber set out to make a big-budget-action-comedy for kids and, boy, did he succeed! let me put it this way: this film rocks like no kid-film and few others did before. and there's a whole lot more to it than just the "action". after about 20 minutes of by-the-numbers-exposition (well, granted) it accelerates into a monster that:- effortlessly puts "mission impossible" to shame (the numerous action sequences are masterfully staged and look real expensive - take that, mummy!)- dwarves almost every other movie suspense-wise ( no easy-they're-only-kids-antics here )- easily laces a dense story with enough laughs to make jim carrey look for career alternatives- nods to both damon runyon and karate kid within the same seconds- comes up with so much wicked humor that side of p.c. that i can hear the american ratings board wet their pants from over here- manages to actually be tender and serious and sexy at the same time (ohmygod, what am i saying?? they're kids! they're kids! - nevermind, watch that last scene!)- stars stafan pagels anderson, who since last years "mirakel" is everybody's favourite kid actorwhat a ride!

this movie is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is. it is a movie both for children and parents, and it is "timeless". i saw this movie before ocean's eleven and must admit that the actors in oe has class in advance, but the play of klatretøsen is much more down-to-earth and moving. why i say ocean's eleven, is the fact that these 2 movies has many things in common and klatretøsen is that good ! that it can bear comparison with oe. the 3 youngsters play their part in a perfect way not to believe, compared to what we are used to in denmark. the different cases of impossible acts, is handled in a way that you wouldn't belive from many young actors (and sometimes not even from the "old boys"). the story ? again it has things in common with ocean's eleven except for the reason of stealing the money and in klatretøsen they need to climb up to the strongroom. the part in which the young people has to take care of ida's younger brother, gives a fine element in the movie. try to imagine how to rob a bank with a 2 year child with a nappy, on your arm :-).this movie can bear comparison with most "grown up" movie like mi2 and ocean's eleven. yes i do believe it is that good. it is best to see it in a theater, as all the children in the room comments the movie and these comments will stay in your hearts forever :-).regards klavs.

this satire is just really, really dead-on, and nobody is spared. but even though this movie has plenty of laughs within the silly story and the grotesque imitation of hitler (here cleverly renamed as "hynkel", and speaking in a hilarious kind of pseudo-german), the general tone is pretty sad, maybe because of the movie's place in history. and the actors aren't even exaggerating that much i suppose. one of the greatest movie moments of all time must be the jewish barber's ending speech, if only things could have ended in that way. it's not even really the character talking anymore, it's chaplin saying something he really wanted to say. if you ignore the technical aspects, the movie doesn't feel dated or old, it actually moves at a pretty nice pace. and the sharp humor we find everywhere in this work will never die, the only thing i don't care for is the slapstick, but that just comes with the era i suppose. this is an incredibly daring, harsh take on fascism, it's so hard-hitting still after all these years.

in a better civilization, this and many other of the david suchet movies would be released in theaters. the plots are fabulous (no, i'd no clue who had done it, but the clues were all there if i'd been more imaginative - the best kind of mystery), the production values astounding, the acting (from edward fox, sarah miles, lysette anthony, megan dodds, and of course david suchet as hercule poirot) simply perfect, the dialogue wonderful, the music and sens of suspense and tension just wonderful stuff.one of the pleasures of these hercule poirot movies for a man is how many beautiful women star in them! here were have two - the sexy sinuous megan doods and the stunning lysette anthony.you really can't go wrong renting these - they're just wonderful - like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine - your mind constantly working because it's all there and you struggle but by keeping your mind constantly thinking can keep up with everything - and the settings gorgeous.i can't think of movies that stimulate thought more than these hercule poirot/david suchet movies. it's impossible to over-praise them - and i had never seen one before a few months ago nor read an agatha christie.

this was charlie chaplin's first all-talking film. yes, there had been a little bit of sound and speaking inserted into his previous film, modern times, but it was still essentially a silent film. so, it wasn't until 1940 that the public got to hear chaplin speak on film.the movie is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation. while i enjoyed the film, i was not nearly as impressed by this as chaplin's other full-length films of the mid-20s and 30s. that's because i really felt annoyed by some of chaplin's dopey over-acting when he played adenoid hynkel--especially when he was giving his speeches. the silly pseudo-dialog just seemed akin to something a lesser comedian would have used (such as the three stooges). plus, playing a funny hitler is hard for me to take.however, when chaplin played the jewish barber, he wasn't especially funny (he really wasn't intended to be a funny character) but he was a tremendous voice for reason and decency. this film should not be remembered as a comedy (especially since it doesn't really excel there), but for its excellent acting and humanity. the final speech by the barber (impersonating hynkel) is brilliant and almost brought tears to my eyes. watch the film for this reason alone.

great comedy from charlie chaplin. i've seen chaplin's 4 major films (gold rush, city lights, modern times, and the great dictator), and i think it is easily the funniest of the four. this movie had me laughing more than almost any other i've ever seen. from the very opening disclaimer ("any similarity between the great dictator and the barber shop owner is purely coincidental") the movie is a laugh-a-minute with a blend of wonderful slapstick and verbal humor. and at the same time, chaplin manages to portray the evils of totalitarian persecution. maybe a little short on the ending and the lasting timeliness of the subject matter, but easily a 9 out of 10 for me.

this was chaplin's first all-talking picture, and the results are mixed. the movie is a biting satire of hitler and mussolini, their henchmen and their fanatical way of life, especially regarding the persecution of the jews. it was daring and forward for 1940 and must have made a lot of people squirm.when compared to chaplin's earlier works, this is quite pale in comparison. the sweet, funny style of his silents, in my opinion, is far superior to his first talkie. there are lots of meaningless bits that drag on. if this was a silent, it probably would not have happened.i find one of the funniest moments to be the musical barber moment and the globe dance. one of the most touching moments is, obviously, the speech at the end.the great dictator is an effective and at times moving film that is a very big part of both chaplin's history and movie history. it is flawed, but chaplin is in great form.

most of this film is an alternately hilarious and brutal satire on nazism and fascism, made at the height of those movements' success.sadly, in the final moments of the film, chaplin abandons all pretense of making art (not to mention comedy) and switches completely to propaganda. and not anti-nazi propaganda, either, but some of the most mawkish and idiotic "progressive" propaganda ever to ooze out of hollywood.never mind that nothing we have seen so far indicates that the barber is even capable of giving the speech we see him give (delivered, ironically, with a disturbing wild-eyed fanaticism); such trivialities must not be permitted to interfere with the message.

written, produced and directed by charlie chaplin, this is the great actor's anti-nazi propaganda piece, skewering adolf hitler.chaplin plays adenoid hynckel, the dictator of tomania, as well as a jewish barber who is hynckel's spitting image. his parody of hitler is brilliant. anyone who has ever seen newsreels of hitler speaking will recognize the eerie resemblance of the caricature. i thought the movie got off to a slow start with some typical chaplin slap-stick focussing on the first world war adventures of the jewish barber. having never seen it before i must confess that after the first 20 minutes or so i was wondering what all the fuss was about. but the movie picks up steam quickly. there are some very funny moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-jewish nature of "hynckel-ism" to make the propaganda point. the climax of the film is a brilliant anti-nazi speech given by chaplin at the end of the movie.as good as chaplin is in this movie, though, i thought the whole thing was stolen by jack oakie, playing the dictator of "bacteria" - "benzino napaloni." our first look at oakie shows how well he had studied his subject - he had mussolini's arrogant posturing down pat. the scenes in which hynckel and napaloni negotiate over the fate of "osterlich" had me in stitches.this was a very good movie, and well worth watching.

although i haven't seen it yet, i know that chaplin is a genius, and only someone of his talent would take on this daring subject matter--a comedy about hitler. all great satire is based on going out on an edge. also, all great comedy deals with the other side--pathos. this film seems like it will skirt both sides. like kubrick's dr. strangelove, the great dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire. the only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it. and hopefully, through laughter, we can learn to view the world in a new light. another film that does this that comes to my mind is emir kusturica's underground, and fando and lis. so, let me watch the film first.

a good, but not great film, "the great dictator" is chaplin's first talkie. it's a good effort, and at times a remarkable satire on hitler, but unfortunately the moments of chaplin brilliance on offer here are let down by a tendency to use too much unnecessary dialogue. yes, chaplin, the silent screen master, just uses too many words in this film, and his tendency towards writing long speeches and extraneous passages of dialogue would carry over into his other talkie films, such as (better) "limelight". still, chaplin was extremely daring in even making this film and his performance in dual roles is certainly memorable. paulette goddard doesn't have the glow she did in "modern times" (her off-screen affair with chaplin was cooling at the time), but she is always worth seeing, and jack oakie just about steals the show as a rival dictator to chaplin's famous creation hynkel.

this must have been one of chaplin's most ambitious projects; he throws in virtually everything, from visual gags and blackout comedy sketches to social relevance, romance, even some violence. the mixture is challenging and intriguing, and the film has many entertaining and clever sequences (like the one where chaplin and four other guys try to avoid finding a coin that will order their self-sacrifice), but the ingredients don't always click together, and the mix (and tone) seem kind of disharmonious. as for the famous final speech, though undeniably honest, it also seems a bit naive today, with its allusions to "a better world where man will overcome his hate and brutality, and his soul will fly". great perfornmances by jack oakie and the beautiful paulette goddard.

being quite a fan of charlie chaplin following good vibes after seeing first 'the gold rush' and then 'city lights', i was eager to see 'the great dictator' as i had been told this was, arguably, his best film. i was also intrigued at the fact it was a talkie; my first one, chaplin-wise.the start is typical chaplin and blatant proof that when it comes to sound, chaplain can cut it whilst not solely relying on music to set mood and to do the talking; it's funny, well timed and the elements of slapstick such as falling off an anti-aircraft gun are well tied in with the jokes. it was good to draw the viewer in with this 'classic chaplin' opening and at the same time, kick start the narrative of characters getting to know one another. what was also well done was the way in which hitler is spoofed. any scene involving hitler or 'hynkel' in this film, was funny and even now; makes you think back as you know exactly who he's spoofing and does create an internal reaction of some kind. the way in which english in mixed in with the mock german during the dialogue scenes is further proof of the way chaplin managed to adapt to the talkie era. my favourite joke was the five minute speech hynkel gave, only for the english translator to translate it into a mere few words; making you think back to footage of hitler you may have seen giving a speech at some point in your life and, indeed, laugh at him.historically, the film got a few things right as well. hynkel is seen getting his photograph taken with children; something hitler did for recognition as he manipulated the media but here, hynkel is seen to yawn and act bored; stabbing at hitler's underhand technique of winning over the german public through sympathy (oh, he hugs and kisses children. he must be ok!). the film is also given a fantastic premise of a jewish civilian reinstalled into the ghetto amongst all the travesties going on but with the catch that he is oblivious. films such as 'the pianist' and 'come and see' are two good examples of nazi cruelty towards 'inferior' people which nowadays, we can all look back on and shake our heads at whereas back in the late 1930's when this was filmed, the fact he had the cruelty going on and was exploiting it makes it even more an astounding achievement. chaplin has managed to replace guns and truncheons for tomatoes and saucepans and still pulls it off.what i didn't like about the film, however, was the fact it settled into an actual narrative after the opening. this slowed the film up and this is very noticeable as the foot was taken off the gas somewhat. the film started to hint at stories and sub-stories. these included the barber and the female neighbour falling in love and the supposed destruction of hynkel's palace whereas none of these were actually developed. the 'giving a woman a shave' and the 'whoever has the coin in their pudding does the deed' gags were hinting at these plot paths but in the end, just materialised into nothing but excuses for drawn out, unfunny gags which was disappointing.during the final straight, the great dictator gets a boost from the fact the italian dictator is introduced who adds some much needed life and excuse for comedy to the film. it works a treat as we see them argue and more underhand tactics are exploited when hynkel attempts to 'overpower' his italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks (although, they are humorously foiled). despite a few weaknesses in pacing during the middle segment and the fact i felt the message at the end was a little forced down my throat, the great dictator holds up for viewing today but that's only because he took the gamble of exploiting things nobody else really knew were there.

chaplin stars in a dual role as a jewish barber who, with amnesia, is mistaken for the dictator adenoid hynkel, (i.e hitler) a movie made in 1940 when the war was in its dark days and was in no way won by the allies..it was banned in germany by hitler and was a risk in a way for chaplin because if the war was lost, he surely wouldve been sent away to be "reeducated"a funny satire with the classic scene of hitler tossing around a giant balloon of the world..good fun but with a message..a little preachy in the end. this was the last movie with chaplin's trademark little mustache. on a scale of one to ten..9

the hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from agatha christie and of course poirot. it' s set on a country house on a weekend. as always all the guests are suspects and it's up to poirot to figure out the truth. with movies like this it's always best not to give too much away so i'll stop here. what i loved in the `hollow' was that it's a mystery the old fashioned way. when poirot arrives everybody is around the body for example. everybody seems to be the culprit. there's that suspicious look and the atmosphere is just perfect for the story.you can expect a wonderful time giving guesses as to whom did it and how and why and maybe in the end even be surprised. a cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you got a pretty enjoyable experience.the actors are all very good. as a curiosity notice edward hardwicke who played dr. watson in sherlock holmes. nice to see him after a few years. suchet is amazing as always and fortunately is on screen most of the time.i did find out who the murderer was but still it's not predictable and it's also very believable.so in conclusion a great movie and as always a pleasure.

okay, it's too long and it's too satisfied with itself. still, "the great dictator" is a fascinating movie. chaplin does a terrific job satirizing hitler and trying to portray the oppression of the jews in nazi germany (this was before the concentration camps were common knowledge). not a chaplin masterpiece, but still worth seeing.

i first saw this movie back in the early 90's,and instantly fell in love with it.richard benjamin and his wife paula made the 1981 movie "saturday the 14th"in 1981 prior to making this movie in 1983.i think they work quite well together.this movie made me laugh on several occasions.it also has a young molly ringwald,who would later go on in the late 1980's to do movies such as pretty in pink and sixteen candles.it is fun watching her a little younger.although not seen by many people..i don't even think the average movie fan has ever heard of this movie.but when i first came acrossed it i was glad i did.i gave this movie 10 out of 10 stars as i think it is a fun movie the whole family can enjoy.lastly i would like to say its not available on dvd,so i picked up a vhs copy on ebay,so if your interested,you probably can find one on there.it might be in the $20-$30 dollar range but i got mind for $12 bucks.i wish they would eventually release this on dvd.

...and i'm so disappointed because i can't seem to buy the dvd or vhs of it anywhere.its a kind of mix of, uncle buck and the great outdoors and molly ringwald is fabulous as the spoilt teenager. this was made when molly was still a brunette, just before she hit the big time with pretty in pink.i'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy, with an edge! if anyone has a copy of this, or knows where i can get one...please leave a message for me - it'll be much appreciated.

this has to be one of the funniest movies i've ever seen. the idea of a typical family leaving everything behind to live in the wilderness. when mom and dad both lose there jobs, not to mention they have green slime in their bathtub. they decide it's in their families best interest to move to oregon. once there everything goes wrong. an interesting cast of characters compliment this movie. including a young molly ringwald,this a movie i would definetly recommend.

the story is about a working girl (ann sothern) who has a pretty thoughtless boyfriend (paul kelly). this boyfriend is so busy trying to start his own business that again and again he forgets dates or shows up late. the final straw is when sothern has a birthday and kelly says he's too busy to take her out to celebrate. so, not wanting to just stay home, she goes on a blind date with what turns out to be a very rich young man (neil hamilton). sparks fly but it also becomes apparent after sothern breaks off her relationship with kelly that new boyfriend hamilton is a "love 'em and leave 'em" sort of guy. how all this is finally resolved is not too difficult to predict--just suffice to say that in the end everything works out just perfectly.this is a very modest little film from columbia pictures--with a relatively small budget as well as second-tier stars. it's clearly a "b-movie" despite there being small roles played by a mickey rooney and jane darwell--as both had yet to become famous. now this is not to say that these are bad actors or the production isn't any good. in fact, given the production values, this is a pretty amazing film as everything seems to work so well despite having a pretty ordinary and somewhat predictable plot outline. that's because the actors and director did a really good job putting the story across. plus the writers did a good job of humanizing the characters and making you care about them. the ending, in particular, is really sweet and practically had my tear ducts flowing! because of these factors, the film earns a 7 of 10.

"blind date" is one of three stories-made-into-movie by author vida hurst. lots of familiar faces in this oldie from 1934. mickey rooney as a mouthy little punk. he seems to be in the film for comedic and homey "family values". jane darwell again plays the strong-willed mother, just as she had in grapes of wrath and the oxbow incident. ann sothern is kitty, who has been dating bill (paul kelly), but meets up with rich bob hartwell, played by neil hamilton, who may or may not be better for her. you can certainly tell that this was made at the very beginning of the hays production code -- at one point, kitty says she can't be up there alone with him if there isn't anyone else in the house...what a change from just a year or two prior, when anything and everything was ok. good solid plot, but a whole lot of conversation and mushy love talk. it raises the question over what a girl should be searching for in a man; should she hold out for a man with integrity who treats her nice, or just find a man with big bucks, as most of the movies from the previous 20 years had advocated...? and how do men change when their situation changes ? watch out for some violence in the strange dance marathon scene. tv viewers from the 1960s will recognize hamilton as commissioner gordon from batman..... also some weird drama in the off-screen lives for some of the cast in this one --paul kelly had gone to jail for being accessory to murder in a love triangle. mickey rooney had an affair with norma shearer, who was 20 years older; rooney ended up being married eight times. tyler brooke (emory) and spencer charters (pa) both knocked themselves off in real life. the title "blind date" has been reused many times, for films, tv series, and even cartoons, but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one.

working girl kitty (sothern) is engaged to bill (kelly), who neglects her by working long hours at his garage in order to save money for their marriage. after being stood up on her birthday, kitty goes on a double-date/blind date, where she meets department store heir bob hartwell (hamilton). she falls in love, but leaves him when his protestations of love appear to cover a desire for her to be his mistress, rather than his wife. faithful bill rallies 'round to comfort her, and at last she gives in to his repeated requests to reinstate their engagement, pressured in part by bill's support of her family after she loses her job. when bob returns, however, convinced that he wants marriage after all, will kitty follow her heart or her conscience? this film was a lot better than i'd expected it to be. the character of bill at first comes off as the sort of loud comic irishman type that jack carson played so often. but kelly (and the script) infuse the character with real compassion and love, and bill turns out to be the best person in the entire group. viewers may find themselves rooting for him against the feckless hartwell! the tone of the film wavers, however, between light-hearted romance and a much darker side, especially in the depiction of a dance marathon and a rather horrific accident at bill's garage.the cast is rounded out by the dependable jane darwell as kitty's mother, an impish but not yet thoroughly obnoxious mickey rooney as kitty's younger brother, and spencer charters as kitty's ne'er-do-well father.

i saw this movie for the first time when quentin tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the alamo drafthouse in austin. he prefaced it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation, it was hilarious. i can see how it would be damaging to some audiences, and the subject is not funny at all, but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard i thought i'd pee. they don't come until after the halfway point, but when they do, oh god...you will die. oh and jim brown is brilliant. he's not in a lot of the movie, but when he's there, you know whose movie it is. naturally, the best line in the movie (and the funniest) is his; you'll know it when you hear it.

this film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70's exploitation film, except it was done in the late 80's for the direct to video market.you have a young couple in love, but the whole world around them is involved either in crack dealing or gang violence. when the boyfriend goes to jail, the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals, who are everyone in this movie except for the cops. first she gets hooked on crack by a dealer and then because he owes drug lord jim brown money, she becomes brown's property. then she's basically enslaved in a military style crack house that the movie is named for.as if this isn't enough reason to see this movie, you also have anthony geary playing a seemingly conservative school guidance counselor, but he's really a major crack dealer. in a sleazy yet hilarious scene, he demands sexual favors from the heroine because she has no money for a fix. in an earlier scene it was established that he is her counselor. that scene and another where jim brown forces her to take a scalding hot shower because she stinks are hysterical. lead actress cheryl kay was really good in this film. tarantino, bring her back.it's not surprising to me that someone mentioned in another review that tarantino is a major fan of this. it has just the right blend of comedy, action, sex, romance, and yes a central message to stay away from drugs. jim brown's villainous turn here deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another great 80's b villain, wings hauser in vice squad. sometimes i think there should be a b movie oscars where performances like this could be acknowledged. in the meantime let's hope that the modern straight to dvd filmmakers learn learn to use this same type of tongue in cheek humor.

leaving aside the drawbacks and deficiencies of the film mentioned by other viewers i must say that it seemed to me a film about power,which is in my opinion one of the most luring illusions. i saw the drama of an emperor and people. it seems to me that the director wanted to pose a question of what the benefit of nation is and what the price of "happiness" for all is. is there justification for the enforced benefit and "happiness"? how much can be forfeited for the nation's security and peaceful existence? is the idea of a powerful would-be empire worth reducing to misery and killing thousands of its citizens now? it seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and seeks to learn it all the time the film runs. he is desperately torn between these desires and at the same time psychologically harassed by the discovery of his true origin. he seems to half hate his subjects for having to renounce his father and his love, half love the people as a good emperor should. no wonder his actions are controversial and emotions confused. it seems to me that as another film presenting the problem of power of man over other men the film is a success.

i enjoyed the film very much, especially the performance of the exceptionally beautiful gong li as the concubine.it was a little distracting, however, to have chinese dialogue plus english subtitles plus american-accented voice-over, even though the voice over was very well synchronised.qin shi huiang di's (the first emperor of qin's)family name was zheng, and his given name yiong so in the english he should have been referred to as "king zheng" or "emperor zheng", and not as "king ying zheng" as in those days the two family/given names were not used together.the state of qin is pronounced "chin" not "shin" - a pity the researchers didn't get this right.i forgave this but was dismayed at the end when the commentary announced that he was buried at "zai-an" together with his terra cotta warriors. the town xi'an is pronounced "see-an" , never "zai-an"- surely the american voice-over speakers could have got that right !

this movie is beautiful in many ways: the plot, the depth of the characters, the stunning photography and acting, the kolossal-like scenes of battles (no computer graphics here, just thousands of people). someone said the story has something to do with the sheakespearian tragedies. i find some connections with the greek tragedy tradition, too.the emperor, extraordinarily acted, struggles between power and love, but he is forced (for the greater good, for the will of his ancestors) to choose the power (and the loneliness, the hate of his subjects and kins) as his destiny. he, like creon in antigone, was a good guy before becoming emperor. once gained power, he has to be merciless and cruel (with innocent children, his mother, his father, etc.) to defend and expand the empire. entrapped by power he becomes a monster. overall, the qin emperor is a majestic greek tragedy figure.the assassin evolves towards a different direction: from pure evil to heroism and morality. even this character is forced towards his destiny by love and by his new ethics. this character is really unforgettable, too.lady zhao, a wonderful gong li, is the uncorrupted morality, nor by power or love or hate. she is morality against power, somehow like antigone. her conspiracies (for and against the emperor) have always a moral rationale.in conclusion, a wonderful movie. if you love cinema and you want to try chinese movies you can start here.

chen kaige lost his sense of tempo. i envy europeans and americans who can watch the film without following the dialog with their ears, because it is painful to do: slow, unnaturally heavy, and over-deliberate. but westerners, on the other hand, suffer from the poor quality of subtitle translation, which manages to lose all the subtlety and double meanings that make a careful study of the film so much fun.

crack house (1989) was one of the few film during the 80's that falls into this genre. what's supposed to be an anti-drug film turns out to be nothing more than some white-exploitation exercise in depravity. there's nothing wrong with that however. the video presentation even has an anti-drug message from one of the stars of the show richard "turncoat" roundtree,the movie follows two young lovers in high school. one of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is his girl. one of them get's turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at his ex-friends. jim brown appears as the movie's "mister big", he's one bad dude who still can punk-out anybody and is a very sadistic guy who likes to smack his hoes and beat the tar out of those who try to defy his word. luke from general hospital makes a guest star spot as well.if you like hard edge sleaze then this movie's for you. sadly, hollywood doesn't make these any more and when they do, it's neither exploitative nor entertaining.recommended for sleaze fans.

based on the actual event , this epic, is set in the year 221 b.c and tells the true story of the unification of china. action packed and filled with intrigue, passion, betrayals and unforgettable battle sequences, it held my attention throughout in spite of its 160 minute length.the king, ying zeng, played by li xuejian is obsessed with unifying the seven kingdoms of china and becoming its first emperor. his lover, lady zhao, played by the beautiful actress gong li, devises a plot whereby she will travel to the neighboring kingdom of yan to set a fake assassination plot in motion which will give the king an excuse to invade yan. however, she falls in love with the assassin as the king becomes more and more ruthless.there are subplots, and tragedy and constant high drama. there are scenes of great beauty and of abject cruelty. there is great cinematography and brilliant use of physical space.the deep characterization made me think of shakespeare. and tragic events that call to mind greek drama. and yet it is totally chinese as it deals with age-old questions of whether the ends justify the means. and raises the questions dealing with life and death and good and evil and all the blurred edges in between.it is the story of individuals against the backdrop of history, a history that has shaped china for the past two thousand years. i was swept up in the story as well as the moral questions raised. there are no easy answers and this was one of the strengths of the movie.recommended. but be prepared for the violence and gore.

this 3 hour epic (seems much shorter) explores the will to power and conquest and the conflicting motives that underlie that quest by tracking two parallel lives: the emperor q'in, whose desire to unify the chinese feudal states has its basis in noble aims but devolves into violent oppression,isolation, and ultimate powerlessness; and the assassin jing ke, a mercenary killer who comes to recognize the unintended consequences of murder and finds a form of salvation. as with all great art, this can be understood on many levels. the movie evoked for me images and ideas from homer, euripides, machiavelli, shakespeare, and freud.the story itself is true (i checked it out at britannica.com!), so this film will appeal to history buffs. it's ironic that q'in spent much of his last years in a futile quest for immortality (not shown on the screen, but consistent with the plot).the movie can also be viewed as an allegory of maoism and the cultural revolution. through the movie, one can understand that the last 50 years of chinese history have had their precedent in the last 3000.fortunately for the audience, these complex ideas are developed in a film that is rich in imagery, action, and pagent. the battle scenes alone are worth the price of admission.

may contain spoilersthis historical movie was so refreshing. although it may be exagerating the actual events, it does show the heartless nature of emperor qui, which he was later infamous for. and there wasn't a single computer generated person in it. i think it's great that china has produce such an epic film. the costumes and the settings were beautiful, the performances were also excellent. dignity vs. death is a major theme in this movie and i think it reflects the chinese history and culture. i also enjoyed a little allusion to the terracotta warriors, a 3d map carved of the conquest of china with individual soldiers. emperor qui of course later as entombed with his life size terracotta warriors.i also enjoyed the scene with the dwarf, he was a very interesting character, even if he only had a small scene.9/10

when i first got wind of this picture, it was just called "shepherd" and was supposed to be the film that would put jcvd back into chances of doing theatrical shtuff. i was very well excited about the whole piece.by the time it was titled "the shepherd: border patrol," i was tap-dancing in excitement for this flick. with isaac fluorentine at the helm of directing, and jj perry pulling stunt coordination, i almost peed me pants in anticipation. pics were released of jcvd kicking 8 different kinds of arse as well as scott adkins playing what i thought was the villain, and i was mind-blown in excitement. i thought it was going to be another epic martial arts situation like lone wolf mcquade.then it came out. i ordered it off blockbuster online for $20 and was ready for anything. the reviews from vandammefan.net kinda had my ideas alittle altered, but i braced myself. the mail came on day 4 and i ripped open the package. my initial plan was to rush upstairs, rip the face off the cardboard packaging, then smash the case in the proper dynamics so the disc would land in my dvd player. however, i stared at the case for 10 minutes then placed the disc in my player and watched the film.by the time it was over, i was cool as a fool in the pool. the shepherd is certainly one of my all-time favorite direct-to-video films ever and makes derailed look like even more of the toilet mess that it is. sure, some of the fights ran a twee bit short, but they were still very awesome. the shootouts were superb, as was scott adkins, who should have been the villain, unlike the forgettable steven lord.i highly recommend this flick. seriously.

van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books. from the setting of mexico to the five star fight scenes, this movie was amazing. the film is all about border patrol officers protecting there territory which is the border of mexico. ex navy seals are smuggling drugs out of mexico into the united states of america (usa), van damme and scott atkins give stunning performances as the cop and the villain. although this film wasn't as good as until death but it still gave the action,acting and the film a five star look. i always look forward to these b grade action films and they keep getting better. keep them coming van damme.watch this film if you enjoyed films like - until death, the hard corps and second in command.

this movie was made on a relatively small budget (10-20 million dollars?) with almost no promotion at all from its distributors. i only knew about it because i am a long time jean-claude van damme fan and i always check out his latest films in hope that they will be at least watchable and aside from some real turkeys (derailed, second in command), they are. this movie has an easy enough plot to follow and van damme gives a good, humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving van damme, scott adkins and the final one of them together. the editing and camera work for most of the film is pretty terrible but isaac florentine can definitely film a good fight scene. i too am happy that van damme has been acting better lately (in hell, wake of death, until death) but with the good acting came less martial arts. in the shepherd, van damme proves that he still has it.

i like the shepherd! sure the acting wasn't good but the fight scenes were nice. van damme throws some nice kicks and so does adkins. the story was average. a texas cop battles smugglers. this movie did everything a van damme movie should do which is martial arts and action. van damme was never a good actor. i think this movie is better than van dammmes last 2. if you're looking for an oscar winning performance you're not gonna get it here but if you're looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you. scott adkins is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately the public has gotten tired of martial art superstars but his movies in this movie are great. van damme delivers strong kicks and it's good to see him performing martial arts again since he has not in his last 4 or 5 movies. this movie is definitely worth watching if you're a van damme fan.

i have not seen a van damme flick for a while, pleasantly surprised, he still has it, looking older, but tougher, kind of like sly, becomes more rugged with age. this is a good flick and has prompted me to take a look at all the van damme movies i have missed over the last ten years. i would like to see a good director put van damme on the big screen with a good plot. van damme still has the moves to amaze the audiences, the last movie viewed with van damme was legionnaire, that was a good flick as well. in addition, i looked in to van damme's early fighting history, i too my amazement i realized he is the real deal, very accomplished martial artist in his younger years.

after 10 years, it is finally save to say that our belgian action star is back again. i personally found this one to be even better than wake of death, which makes it his best movie in... 10 years!! okay, it is not like his highlight years as timecop, universal soldier, sudden death or even his best effort to date: hard target (one of the best action movies ever made by one of the best action directors john woo.) the action is good, the story is exciting, the dialogue is quite funny, this one is better than expected.the bad guys are awesome like in hard target, and the fight scenes are "old school". real fans know what to expect. i must say, i gave up on him, but van damme is finally back. more please....

like steven seagal i also am a big van damme fan and have followed most of his movies since the start of his acting career.in this flick van damme assumes the role of jack robideaux whom is a cop that just moved to new mexico from new orleans to work as part of the border patrol. haunted by memories of his past, it is up to jack to put an end to a group of ex-navy seals from smuggling illegal drugs into the u.s. that killed his daughter.overall i found this film to be very good, van damme is in very good shape for 48 years old and can really move. the action scenes are very intense and the movie even throws a couple of plot twists in to keep you guessing. unfortunately van damme does not have the same intensity as he did say 10 years ago, regardless the shepherd: border control is the 3rd straight solid film that van damme has made possibly opening the door for a larger project.i definitely recommend this movie to a van damme fan or fan of action movies in general; the shepherd: border control is a great movie, not as good as until death but better than the hard corps. be sure to give this one a try, you will not be disappointed.

i thought that this was the most interesting film that jcvd has done in a very long time. i loved his character and the whole thing with the rabbit set a different tone for this film. imho, jcdv may really be on to something going forward. a little more light heartedness, some obvious homages to other films, mixed in with some great fights...i would like to see more this style of film-making from him. one of the other posters thought that the bar scene was a desperado rip off. i immediately saw the r. rodriguez connection also, but thought it was very clever and made me want to see the film again to look for more subtle cues from other films. jcvd rocks!!other stuff after reading other comments:no music in the dungeon fight? at first i didn't like that at first either, but then i thought it was interesting because it threw me off balance a bit by giving us something that we didn't expect. made it seem more real.i also always get a laugh when directors cry like 2 year olds that their film was "stolen" from the studio. directors are paid to do a job. the studio is the boss and they want the product that they want. very few directors have absolute final cut on a film. in this case, jcvd is the talent and the only reason anyone is watching this film. i am sure he got a film that he was happy with. i have a relative who works at a post house who knew a little of the story. presumably, the director worked on and delivered his cut of the film. everyone who saw it said it was a disaster...then jcvd and the studio re edited the movie. this stuff happens all the time. he also did see the final cut (which he claims he didn't) and his "delicate genius" ego was severely bruised because they hated his delivered cut. if this director was smart, he should have taken credit for this one as it would have been his best.

it's really good to see van damme's film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to c-grade flops "derailed" and "second in command" which were both tragic and not in a good way. the sheperd: border patrol is a good action flick with some really great action/fight sequences. it's good to know that van damme still knows how to kick seeing as his last film "until death" had no martial arts in it at all!!!that being said, this film is significantly inferior to "until death" which was a really good turn for van damme. "until death" lacked the over-the-top action of most van damme films but was dark and gritty and van damme's performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film. still, the shepherd is definitely a film worth checking out especially for van damme fans or just action movie fans in general but if you're looking for a film with a bit more story line.....you may want to skip this one!i do believe that this film was done well enough especially on what little budget it would have been shot on. the only real problem i have with this film is the title; "the shepherd"? i don't get it! i suppose "border patrol" just doesn't have the same ring to it without the word "shepherd" in front of it!!!my rating for this film is 7 out of 10 but that's by van damme movie standards not in any other film category.i.e. it's good for a van damme film.

here is one of jane austen's movies that i found very delightful. i read the book first then listened to it on cd and was captivated by how a young victorian girl could be persuaded against marrying the man she loved due to his lack of a fortune or education. the joy of knowing that anne is evidently reunited with a lost love. the fact that her godmother tries to marry her off to a good for nothing cousin who's only out for money. looking at the snobbery that comes from the upper classes and how class distinctions can divide couples from following their hearts. captain wentworth realization that he still loves anne after seven years. his final understanding that anne's love was constant all that time and they she wasn't going to let her family interfere with her true happiness and eventual marriage to one she truly loved.

i finally found a version of persuasion that i like! anne doesn't look like a scullery maid in this version, just a very thin, aging, pretty woman, quite like she's described in the book. captain wentworth doesn't look like he's 50, nor does he look perpetually angry but rather, as he's described in the book, he hasn't aged as much as anne and is quite handsome. and they play their parts with such conviction and realism...that's what acting is all about. they were believable. they created real characters, and it was like the characters in the book came to life. if you haven't seen this version, i urge you to find it, order it or request it from either a bookstore, or a library if you must. it's worth the price and worth the wait. i watched the 1995 version, and the 2007 version and this one towers over the other two. why it isn't rated higher is beyond my comprehension. the book conveys the tenderness of their relationship and this movie makes the book come to life.

i'm just getting the chance to dig into past austen films, and i picked this up because persuasion is, has been, and always will be, my favorite work by jane austen, and anne elliot my favorite austen heroine. so it was with great anticipation that i popped the disc into my player.i wasn't disappointed, either. i knew there were bound to be some draw-backs, so i'll state them, and try not to be too thick about them. anne elliot is the most introverted of austen's characters; she is the least talkative and the least witty. there are passages in the book where anne says nothing - only her feelings are described. this works fine in print, but how to successfully transfer this to the big screen? short of doing thoughtful voice overs (which would grow tedious over four hours) you're left with a long succession of shots where the heroine says little or nothing, and must communicate all by her facial expression. this can leave the feeling that the film is slow, and lacking in purpose. if you need a more overt style of austen, then certainly this film is not for you; but if subdued is more your style, and you tend to pick up on unspoken 'vibes', this will fulfill all expectations.anne firbank (as anne elliot), is, thankfully, an actress whose face can convey much. she looked as i had always imagined anne elliot would look: not a knockout - anne wasn't supposed to be the elegant one of the family - nor in her first youth - which is also highlighted occasionally by the lighting and make-up. what you see is someone who is very like austen's character: someone whose appearance you might pass over once; but hear her speak, and look more closely, and she grows more attractive the better you know her. this is anne elliot, as brought to life by anne firbank.captain wentworth's portrayal is ably handled by bryan marshall. the bitterness is never apparently obvious (save at the concert scene); and, yes, i found it hard to believe he wound find louisa musgrove interesting as she was shown. but that is another point of austen's book: he did not find her interesting, he tried to find her interesting, and, ultimately, failed (sigh of relief). so this, too, fits with austen's original story.i especially liked the portrayal of lady russell, who i thought in the book was not portrayed as truly bad; this also comes out in this adaptation.so this is one film which closely followed the book; i could write much more about how faithfully everything was reproduced, but i'd run out of space here. charles musgrove remained one of the most buoyant characters (good fun), mary the most annoying (i was dying to have her just shut up - but i had that feeling when i read the book, too), captains and the admiral i thought charming.the cinematography i thought a trifle stiff. there was little or practically no fade from one screen to another - perhaps this is due to it being a tv movie. one scene - chop! - the next scene, the actors enter from right, proceed left, and - chop! - another scene, where the same thing happens. this was the only part of the movie which i felt cheated me a little. a low budget has to show itself somewhere, i suppose.and, as i said earlier, if you like some pace to go with jane austen, don't bother with this one, as you'll find it way too slow. i enjoyed it enormously, though, as it brought a wealth of detail (the sets were richly elegant!) to an excellent adaptation of my favorite austen novel. i highly recommend it!

one of the best and most exciting of all conspiracy thrillers, (there were a number of such film in the 1970's). this one is about an accident at a neuclear reactor and of the attempts to cover it up. jack lemmon is the employee who realizes just how dangerous the plant is and jane fonda is the crusading television reporter who takes the story on board and both players are at their best.the events portrayed in the film are, of course, terrifying and not in the least bit far-fetched, (much of what happens here happened in real life at three mile island), and although it now looks like something a period piece it, nevertheless, highlights just how fragile and dangerous a world we have created for ourselves. expect a number of similar films about the effects of global warming any time soon, (and not rubbish like "the day after tomorrow" either).

i thoroughly enjoyed this film when it was first released, and on each occasion i've seen it since. the political drama is effective, if not especially new or inspired. the decades since the release of the film have demonstrated that the willingness to cut costs at the expense of public safety is definitely not just something imagined by a screenwriter.however, i think the most impressive element of this film is jack lemmon's performance. it is absolutely astonishing to watch him at work. he has the gift to be able to communicate so much, at times without saying a word. next time you watch this film, check out jack's face at the times he is not saying anything. he does not need to speak (or worse yet, to mug) to let you know what's going through his mind.i am calling this a spoiler, because of the impression it made on me when i first saw the film: in lemmon's last scene in the film, as he is lying on the floor, he feels a slight vibration. the terror in his eyes is one of the most frightening images i have seen in any film. it is perfect acting, because it conveys instantly the threat about to occur--if jack's character is so terrified, there is certainly something awful about to happen. and it does.

tv newscaster kimberly wells (jane fonda) and her radical camerman richard adams (michael douglas) are at a nuclear power plant when a serious accident happens. the plants managers play it down but adams has filmed it all. wells and adams try to get it on the air but the corporation that runs the plant prevents it. plant executive jack godell (jack lemmon) realizes there are serious problems and tests have been falsified. he tries to get executives to believe him--only they know it. wells, adams and godell find all their lives are in danger.i saw this in a movie theatre in 1979. i was only 17 and it scared me silly. to make matters worse the three mile island accident happened around this time making the movie all that more real. seeing it over 20 years later it doesn't scare me but it still is an excellent film--it works as a mystery, a gripping drama and an expose on the nuclear power industry. fonda (with red hair) has one of her best roles as wells--she perfectly conveys her character's growing suspicion and horror when she realizes a nuclear disaster could happen. lemmon is (as always) excellent. he starts out believing in his company and the job and slowly starts to unravel when he starts finding things out. he was rightfully nominated for an academy award for this. douglas is good but he has a small part and is completely overshadowed by lemmon and fonda.a really great film--one of the best of the 70s. don't miss this one!

bridges's drama about a reporter who discovers some flaws in the safety precautions taken at a nuclear powerplant is directed well and a pretty interesting film from the late 70s. its not amazing, but its solid, the acting is pretty good especially jack lemmon, but douglas and fonda were good too. it was a pretty good screenplay and bridges's direction was solid and suitable. this is definitely not one of the best films of the 70s, but its one of the better ones. a good early michael douglas film and lemmon in his prime.--- imdb rating: 7.2, my rating:, so in simple words, solid but not amazing... thats what this film is, solid but not amazing 8/10

all the right elements seemed to conspire here to make this a memorable thriller for years to come. you have the stellar cast - michael douglas in an uncharacteristic 'free-spirit' role that pretty much launched his movie career, fonda playing her typical forthright female doing her bit for womens lib, and jack lemmon as assured as ever showing us a man with a crisis of confidence. give them a hot-button topic about big business being duplicitous, and that's encouraging for a kickoff, but to have life imitating art so soon after is a marketing man's dream.the script is impressively taut, intelligent but mercifully keeping the jargon to a minimum, and there is a genuine sense of sustained tension brought in play by the director as our three protagonists race to beat the clock. if you like 'whistle blowing' dramas, then this is not quite as good as "the insider", but the whole thing is more than nervy enough.

when the china syndrome was released, plenty of right-wing critics and pro-nuke supporters blasted this film, particularly since its three leading stars were all known for their liberal politics and their overt distrust of nuclear power. but it only took two weeks and a near-catastrophic accident at three mile island to shut those critics up.fonda and douglas are the l.a. news crew that witness a potentially nasty accident at the ventana nuclear power plant. douglas films the event through the plant's soundproof glass; but the tv station will not air the footage, fearing a massive lawsuit. it is thus up to fonda and douglas to get at the truth, despite a massive attempt by the plant's owners to cover up the accident.but a conscientious shift supervisor (jack lemmon) has uncovered certain defects in the plant's pump support structure. he believes that these defects were the cause of the accident and that, though it would be extremely costly and lengthy, if repairs aren't made, the next accident could be apocalyptic. but he can't get anyone who works with him to believe his story. the result is a nightmarish climax that pulls various political, technological, and human interest stories together in one disturbing package.while obviously quite politically liberal in nature, the china syndrome, well directed and co-written by james bridges (the paper chase), is also fundamentally a message movie about the inherent dangers of putting technology and nuclear power together. fundamentally, nuclear power can never be made safe because people can never be perfect. that is what the film is saying; and in a highly entertaining and suspenseful way, it says it brilliantly.

the first thing you see in this film is a static angle(one which will be repeated later in the film), depicting the chaos going on(unseen to the audience) in a studio that airs news. soon after, fonda's character's typical story is shown, in that same angle. don't let this mislead you; the film is not about a female reporter, a woman struggling to succeed in a male-dominated profession. that is merely a lead-in, a way of starting the film(though it's used later). the actual point to this production is revealed gradually, and the first we see of it is in a deliberately long scene early on. the entire film has that pace; not slow or drawn-out, but deliberate. it's never really fast, even in the few sequences that one would normally expect to be so. this pacing(especially because it seems to slow down further as the plot is revealed, as the disturbing, unsettling nature of the film is unraveled) is strong, almost painful to the viewer. it inspires you to, if it had been possible, jump into the screen, grab the people responsible by the collar and yell at them to *do* something about it, to remedy the situation. never once did i feel like getting up or even taking my eyes off the screen for a moment. the subject is extremely important to be aware of, and it's handled perfectly here. no over-dramatization(well... very little, anyway), just an accurate presentation of the issue. the direction is astounding. the empathy felt for lemmon's character is profound. the editing is masterful... one scene near the very end illustrates that perfectly. the editor, judging from his filmography, is vastly underrated. the writing was excellent. the acting was great, in particular by lemmon, fonda and douglas(who also produced it). the lack of a score is perfect; no music is needed to enhance. the ending is sublime and effective. the movie does have a few negative points... among them, some of the dialog is obviously and undeniably mainly exposition, one particular part of the film, whilst dramatic, doesn't seem to mesh with something that follows it. not everyone will watch the film because of two features of it which are commonly (and rightfully so) attributed to bad movies; the pacing(which can be mistaken as being slow) and the (lack of) score. one could argue that to be a negative thing, as everyone ought to consider the points it presents, but maybe it's better this way; handling the heavy subject with the intelligence and respect(for the topic as well as the viewer)... something like this, maybe it shouldn't be spoon-fed. i was mesmerized with the film, and left very taken aback. i recommend this to anyone who believe themselves strong enough to handle it. 9/10

intelligent, nail-biting drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and soon was on the cover of every newspaper in america (when life imitated the film). a nuclear power plant employee in southern california is threatened by superiors when he decides to go public with the real story behind an accident at the plant. ostensibly a stuck valve problem, a tv news-crew's film shows that it was an accident verging on disastrous proportions--and worse, that safety conditions are being scrubbed to save millions of dollars, a cover-up that endangers everyone's lives. the movie occasionally gets too technical (especially in the second-half) and could use more human interplay, however the performances by jack lemmon, jane fonda (as a puff-piece news-woman in the right place at the right time), and michael douglas (as a freelance cameraman) are superb. the throwaway bits involving nuclear protesters is both entirely accurate and bitterly satirical, and the news-biz (with its corporate structure and vapid yes-men) is vividly captured. ***1/2 from ****

i normally don't comment on movies on imdb, but in this case i feel like i should. i love movies, and i want to make them, and this movie is a perfect example of fine filmmaking.this is one of the few movies that i have seen on the small screen (originally seeing it air on amc, i believe, and then on the dvd i just watched) that made me get that feeling in the pit of my stomach. that little gnawing sensation that the director would hope you feel while watching his thriller.jack lemmon's performance is a fine one, and jane fonda and michael douglas follow. i felt so much empathy of lemmon, who's character jack godell, only wanted people to listen to his warning.but what impresses me most about this film is the lack of a score, and this is also what makes it beautiful to me. apart from the opening titles there are no background music to increase the tension, because none is needed. and while the credits run, white on black, in silence it drives the point home.i use the movie as an example to anyone who says music makes the movie. i think the movie should make the movie and the music should only amplify that. but for the china syndrome music is not necessary to get across the realism and the urgency depicted here. the characters portray all of this far better than the music ever could.i highly recommend this movie, it is one of my favorites. if you like movies, you won't be disappointed. if you like movie soundtracks more, you might not want to give this one a go.

although the premise of the movie involves a major "coincidence," the actors all do a creditable job and look great bringing the story to life. i found myself rooting for the characters played by mary tyler moore and christine lahti, empathizing with both, and wanting them to reconcile. sam waterston and ted danson are fine in their roles as well, doing a decent job with the stereotypical buddy relationship. while the story tends to leap through time, occasionally leaving the audience perhaps a little hungry for missing detail, it still flows and avoids any real confusion. this interesting storyline has all the elements for a good "chick flick."

christine lahti (sandy dunlap) and mary tyler moore (holly davis) worked well with soapish material, ted danson did his best with a thankless role of chip davis the premise of this that the two ladies' friendship, one a seemingly happily married woman and the other a career woman who is aware of her biological clock ticking. i found the relationship that ted danson's character had with the single woman played by christine lahti's rather sordid. he behaved in a caddish way, yet he left two "widows" pining over him, bawling. i found it revolting when when sandy told him she wanted to break it off after meeting his wife, he calls her saying he misses her (did he call his wife? there was no sign of that). he behaved like a heel. it perhaps would have made a more interesting film had he not been killed off. perhaps both ladies would have wised up and dumped him. i liked the friendship between the two ladies but it was spoiled by what they had in common: the cad of a husband.

saw this movie when it came out and then a couple more times years later. i'm watching it now 20 years later and it's still a very good story. does it wreak of "lifetime movie network"? yes, but alas lifetime was not even in existence back then so it needed somehwere to air.the cast was excellent. the story was a little schmaltzy; two women become close friends and unbeknownst to either one friend is having an affair with he other friends husband. she's invited over to the house for a dinner party which is how she discovers that her lover is the husband of her best friend. she is horrified and tries to break off the affair. shortly afterwards he is tragically killed in a car accident which is devatating for both women. of course the wife finds out by accident about this affair and wants holly out of her life now, but their friendship is able to prevail because they need each other.i thought it was a very good story a great cast and perfomrances. i really enjoyed it.

ever wonder where that episode, "tuttle," came from in the middle of the first season of m*a*s*h? well now the cat's out of the bag: they got it from this soviet film, a satire on how dumb the tsar is, due to the slip of a pen (rendering the phrase "the lieutenants, though ..." into "lieutenant kizhe" which has no meaning) and nobody being honest or gutsy enough to contradict him and just tell him the truth -- kizhe doesn't exist and never did. so they make up an imaginary life for him and eventually kill him off. and 40 years later, david ketchum and bruce shelly borrowed this zany plot and gave us essentially the same story, only on the other side of what had become the cold war, proving that people in high positions can be equally dumb no matter what their loyalties may be!

i went to see this film out of curiosity, and to settle an argument. the film is now best known from the suite of music sergei prokofiev extracted from his incidental music to the film, the troika movement even turning up in pop arrangements. the general outline of the plot is well known from the sleeve notes on various recordings. a clerk accidentally generates a non-existent lieutenant kizhe in a list to be presented to the tsar. the tsar is interested in this person, and rather than tell him he doesn't exist, the courtiers and officers maintain the pretence that he is real. kizhe is exiled to siberia, recalled, promoted, married, promoted again, dies, is given a state funeral, revealed as an embezzler and posthumously demoted to the ranks.i had heard conflicting stories about how the clerk invented kizhe, involving ink blots and sneezes, but i'd heard the film was lost, so there was no way to find out what happens. then the film turned up at the barbican in london as part of their prokofiev festival. for the record, it turned out that all that happens is that the clerk confuses two words whilst writing an order and turns kuzhe into kizhe. as the tsar is in a hurry to see the order, there's no time to correct the mistake.having gone expecting an historical curiosity, i was pleasantly surprised. the film is very funny, and the audience, myself included, laughed continuously. although most of it is filmed straight, set mostly in the palace, there are a few "trick" shots where multiple images appear on the screen. for instance, the tsar's army is represented by a small group, repeated across the screen. four identical guards perform perfect drill in perfect unison. two identical servants scrub the floor.one slight drawback was it was very difficult to work out who everyone was. there were two women who might have been the tsar's daughters, or a daughter and a servant or something else. and very few people were named. but all in all, an enjoyable film and i'm surprised it's not seen more often.

ray is one of those movies that makes you pause. you actually think about what you heard or think about what you read about this man and it doesn't even come close. during my first viewing of ray i forgot i was watching a movie i felt like a peeping tom watching this man's life thru a window. this movie is so compelling it drags you in and it involves your every emotion you go thru a emotional roller-coaster ride and when it's over you don't want to do it again so soon because it has that kind of emotional punch that other movies are lacking. jamie foxx deserved his oscar and quite rightfully so his performance is spectacular and it should be held up as the standard for anybody wanting to do a bio pic anytime soon. this movie is as good as it's subject both deserved the titles classic and legend.

a masterful performance by jamie foxx is just one of the highlights of "ray," a 2004 film also starring kerry washington, regina king, curtis armstrong, richard schiff, sharon warren, patrick bachau, and many others, all giving excellent support to the film.the film has several main focuses: the first is charles' childhood - the drowning of his brother george which haunted him for years, the glaucoma that blinded him, and the strength taught him by his mother - don't bend, don't break, don't ever be a cripple. she eventually sends him to a special school where charles' gift of music is discovered. the next focus is charles' artistic evolution as a nat king cole-like singer, to his arrangements of gospel music, his foray into country music, and the unique sound that became ray charles. the third focus is charles' personal life - his marriage to bea, his many affairs, his heroin addiction and eventual rehabilitation.because charles lived a packed 74 years, there's a lot skipped. though charles was orphaned while in his teens, the death of his beloved mother, his rock, isn't in the film. while he is shown on the chitlin circuit and refusing to play in segregated clubs, his near-starvation as a musician isn't covered. at one point, he found a jar of jelly and attempted to eat it, but the jar broke. he was that down and out. bea is shown with him when the state of georgia, which banned him, adopts "georgia on my mind" as their theme song in 1979 and welcomes charles back to his native state, yet he and bea were divorced in 1977 which isn't mentioned. she probably was there, however. also, she wasn't his only wife - he was married once before he met her; that marriage isn't covered. in the movie, we're told of one illegitimate child - there were 12. it would have been impossible to get all of that and more into a film.what isn't skipped is his glorious music, which seems to go on constantly throughout the film, continually reinforcing his genius and artistry.charles' story is compelling and holds the audience's interest throughout. those who scoff at it as a made-for-tv movie don't give it the credit it deserves. taylor hackford's direction gives "ray" a good pace, and the movie has a lot of atmosphere and evokes the various decades beautifully.as ray, jamie foxx inhabits the character and makes one forget he's a comedian playing a part. foxx wore prosthetics, did his own piano playing, and spent a great deal of time with charles preparing for the role. he nails him, but it's not an impersonation - he's a flesh and blood man with hallucinations of standing in water and finding his brother's body; a man full of denial about his addiction, hating the word junkie and believing he's not hooked; and he's in denial about his home life, thinking that his wife doesn't know about his various affairs and illegitimate children (in the movie, child); and a man taken terrible advantage of early in his career because of his blindness who refuses to be walked on later on. he demands to be paid in $1 bills so they can be counted; when he discovers he's a gravy train for a club owner and her partner and was nearly cheated out of a record deal, he makes his own deal and leaves his job.one doesn't so much marvel at foxx's performance as accept him as ray from the first time he appears on camera.this is an excellent biography, which, like "walk the line" is punctuated with the fantastic music of the artist. whether or not you're a ray charles fan, "ray" is something to experience.

i agree that this film was spectacular. the way in which jamie foxx captured, not only the impression of ray charles, but the essence of ray charles really made the film. his life made a great story and it is good that it is finally being told. i also found a great interview with jamie foxx about this role by ernie manouse from innerviews on kuht, houston channel 8. the link is http: //video.google.com/ videoplay?docid=-3001837218936089620&q =innerviews+ jamie+foxx&hl=en . i encourage everyone to check it out, as it gives in depth looks into what went into his role and his personal feelings about ray charles. the only problem i might cite with the film is that the shotting style was rather bland at times, but in the end i think it helped make the story more realistic and keep the focus on the person, ray charles, rather than the film ray.

recent years have seen a number of biopics of famous singers, and "ray", the story of ray charles, has much in common with "walk the line" which was made the following year and told the story of johnny cash. cash and charles were near-exact contemporaries, both being born in the early thirties and dying in 2003/04. both grew up in poverty in the american deep south. both lost a brother in an accident during childhood. both achieved success in the 1950s. both experienced problems in their marriages, and both were addicted to drugs. all these matters are emphasised in both films. there are also similarities with ron howard's "a beautiful mind". although that film was about a mathematician rather than a musician, it, like both "ray" and "walk the line", stressed the part played by its subject's wife in helping her husband to overcome his problems.ray charles was born to a single mother in a poor black community in georgia in 1930. (his original name was raymond charles robinson, but when he was starting his career as a musician he dropped his surname to avoid confusion with the boxer sugar ray robinson). in some ways charles had an even harder time than did cash, having to cope with two additional disadvantages in the shape of his blindness and of the racism which affected all black americans, especially in the south, during his lifetime. charles had a particularly traumatic childhood, witnessing the death of his younger brother george in a drowning accident and going blind about a year or two later. he appears to have been haunted by nightmares and feelings of guilt over george's death throughout his life.the first half of the film is rather slow moving and is a standard rags-to-riches showbiz biopic, telling the story of how the young charles is taught to play the piano, becomes a nightclub performer and then rises to fame as a major artist, falling in love along the way with the beautiful della bea. the best scenes in this part of the film are the flashbacks to charles's childhood. there is an effective recurrent image of coloured glass bottles hanging from a tree in front of his house; perhaps this was one of his few visual memories of his life before he went blind. there is also a memorable scene in which the teenaged charles shames a prejudiced bus driver into letting him on the bus by pretending to have lost his sight on omaha beach (in reality he would only have been thirteen at the time of the normandy landings).the second half of the film becomes more interesting as it moves into more controversial territory, focusing on charles's drug addiction, the problems in his marriage caused by his affair with margie hendricks, one of his backing singers, and his battles against racism. in the early sixties charles caused a sensation by refusing to play in front of a racially segregated audience in georgia (although, contrary to what is stated in the film, this did not result in his being banned from performing in the state). he also fought against racial divides within the music industry itself, performing not only traditionally "black" styles of music such as gospel and rhythm and blues, but also traditionally "white" ones such as country and western (regarded by many black americans as the music of choice of the redneck community).as peter bradshaw, film critic of "the guardian", noted "ray" is a sunny film which diplomatically turns away from the darker side of things. it omits any mention of such matters as the death of charles's beloved mother aretha during his teenage years, his brief marriage to eileen williams in the early fifties and his eventual divorce from della bea in 1977. it also plays down the extent of his womanising and the number of his illegitimate children. there are similarities here with "a beautiful mind" which also omitted a number of controversial details about its subject's personal life, including a divorce.fans of ray charles will no doubt enjoy the film for the music, but it is worth watching even for those who do not know much about him, chiefly on account of jamie foxx's oscar-winning performance in the title role, reproducing charles's mannerisms so exactly that we think we actually are watching a blind man, even though foxx himself is sighted. (unlike joaquin phoenix in "walk the line", however, foxx did not do his own singing- doubtless charles's distinctive singing voice was too difficult to reproduce). he receives good support from some of the other performers, particularly sharon warren as aretha and kerry washington as della bea. the film is uneven and overlong, but nevertheless rewarding. 7/10

the famous french detective henri cassin takes his first vacation in 11 years in st. margot where he meets nanette, the daughter of the vacation spot proprietors. despite nanette being promised to childhood sweetheart leon, henri and nanette fall in love and decide to marry, despite nanette's father objecting due to henri's age. on the day of their wedding, leon returns and nanette runs after him. nothing is heard of the two until both are found dead, and henri swears he won't rest until he can find the killer. the only clue henri has to work with is a footprint found by leon, but he is also getting written warnings that others will die soon. soon nanette's mother is found dead and henri has no idea as to the identity of the killer. thinking himself a failure he returns to paris, then he realizes (and fears) that the killer can be only one person, even though none of his colleagues can believe his explanation. out of the ordinary murder mystery that doesn't really follow the formula in other of the genre by columbia or other b studios. credit to that certainly goes to director lewis who does manage to turn this into a noirish film despite the setting of the film, also aided by the use of good camera-work and lighting. geray turns in a very good performance in probably his only lead and the rest of the cast is able to carry their performance. rating, 8.

i first saw this one when it was first shown, so i'm not too objective about it. it really managed to scare me, partly because it was so late at night, but partly because of that whole feeling from a videotaped suspense story (the same thing that helped dark shadows itself). and the casting was so right. i hardly know shane briant from anything else, so it might not be so right to call him "well-cast," but to me, he is dorian gray. and as far as the other male actors, the one who fit his part so well was nigel davenport (who's so good at "larger than life" characters) as sir henry. and john karlen, a sort of dan curtis "repertory player" at the time, because of dark shadows. as one poster points out, this version manages to include the involvements with men, in a fairly subtle way. the scene where dorian recites a list of men's names to john karlen's character, as a way of blackmailing him, and the look on karlen's face, were very well-done. (if that scene were done now, it would probably be done in a too obvious way, and be bad by comparison.) i saw it when "dorian gray" was barely a name to me, let alone more, so even more than the famous 1945 version (which is rightly famous), this is the version to me.

this is an excellent james bond movie. although it is not part of the original and more famous series, and it is a standalone film, it is very well done. enticing sean connery to return to the role he made famous was a stroke of genius, as was titling the movie in a way that references his past vow to not play bond again. connery was as great as he was in his earlier 007 appearances. the script is outstanding, as are the photography and the performances. it's the earliest movie i recall with kim basinger, who became much more famous after this film; barbara carrera was excellent; and klaus maria brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain. the frequent references to the aging of bond and the changing times and attitudes of the british secret service were most humorous. the 007 gadgets equaled those of the other bond films. the only thing missing was the famous 007 music theme, which, of course, could not be used by this competing production. it was rather amazing to me to be able to see two excellent james bond movies released in the same year, this one and octopussy with roger moore. an interesting aspect of the film is an emphasis on video games and computer graphics. the early 80's were the first heyday of such things, and the use of them in this film made it a very contemporary movie. the film is actually a different version of thunderball, updated with newer technology. regardless of the repeated theme, there are sufficient differences to make it most entertaining. i will watch this one frequently.

i've always liked sean connery, but as james bond i've always favored roger moore. still it was connery who set the bond standard and while he had by 1983 established himself as something other than james bond, the money must have been irresistible for him to make one more appearance as 007 and save the world from the evil designs of spectre.and what designs they are in never say never again. spectre with the help of a foolish young air force officer who happens to be kim bassinger's brother stole two nuclear missiles during a war games exercise and now spectre headed by blofeld, played here by max von sydow is threatening blackmail of the world.von sydow's operations guy is klaus maria brandauer who is also courting bassinger and is a bit on the crazy side. and he's got a female assassin working for him in barbara carrera who makes angelina jolie as nora croft look like mrs. butterworth.but before sean connery can even get started he's got to deal with a new 'm' running things at british intelligence. edward fox thinks connery is old fashioned in his methods and costs the british taxpayers too much money with his violent ways. i really did enjoy fox's performance, he's like the great grandson of colonel blimp.i also enjoyed carrera, she's something to look at and quite resourceful in her methods. when she's scuba diving with connery in the bahamas, note how she puts mr. shark on 007's case.will connery do james bond again? he was widely quoted as saying who would they cast him as at this point, roger moore's father? but i think connery would still be formidable in a wheelchair.

when i first saw this on tape, about 10 years after it had been released, i thought it was one of the better james bond movies. however, after seeing it again around the turn of the century, i was disappointed.i think it's a bit overrated only because critics were so happy to see sean connery end his 12-year hiatus from playing bond that they didn't dare criticize the film. i guess what disappointed me was the ending. after investing two hours into the film, you expect a less-hokey, more satisfying ending. and, it may be nitpicking, but i was disappointed in not seeing the regular actors in the supporting roles such as miss moneypenny, q, felix leiter, etc.on the positive side, there was plenty of unique action scenes, particularly early on, and the two villains were interesting. i thought klaus maria brandauer was the more intriguing of the two because he was so low-key and looked the "nice guy next door." he wasn't your normal bond villain.this had plenty of "skin," for a pg movie, especially with kim basinger starring, never being an actress known for hiding her figure. the language was very tame, but most bond movies are pretty good in that department.all in all, it's a "fair" bond and nothing else. just because connery is in it, it doesn't mean it's automatically good. roger moore and pierce brosnan have proved they could play the role well, too.

only connery could bring that particular style with a line like that fatima crashes into bond's arms when she water-skis up to the super agent in nassau and apologizes, 'oh, how reckless of me. i made you all wet.' the super agent replies, 'yes, but my martini is still dry.'barbara carrera makes a great villain, stealing the show as spectre executioner fatima blush fatima is number 12 in the spectre chain of command, and is a gorgeous assassin who takes intense sensations of pleasure in killing fatima assumes all the deadly characteristics of fiona, proving to be one of bond's toughest adversaries she is a victim of her vanity she's good at what she does, and wants the world to know it but her vanity is her downfall using every possible approach to eliminate 007, fatima is a wild and cunning woman who makes love to the man she is about to kill austrian actor klaus-maría brandauer (largo) does not make a very formidable opponent for 007 referred to as number one in the spectre chain of command, largo resides in the bahamas, and travels aboard his super yacht, the flying saucer max von sydow becomes the fourth actor to appear as spectre chief ernst stavro blofeld, once more plotting to put the world at ransom kim basinger takes the part once owned by the lovely french actress claudine auger she is domino, the mistress of largo, who soon falls deeply in love with her rescuer black actor bernie casey becomes the sixth actor to play cia agent felix leiter after jack lord, cec linder, rik van nutter, norman burton, and david hedison...edward fox portrays the new, unsympathetic 'm.' pamela salem is the third actress to play miss moneypenny. lois maxwell was the first and barbara bouchet was the second.valerie leon is the sexy lady in the bahamas who fished 007 out of the blue water and saved his life by making love to him in her own room valerie was the sardinian hotel receptionist in 'the spy who loved me' when bond and anya arrive seeking strombergprunella gee is shrublands physical therapist patricia saskia cohen tanugi is nicole, bond's secret service contact in the south of france gavan o'herlihy is jack petachi, the u.s. air force communications officer who duplicates the president of the united states' 'eye print' and arms two cruise missiles with nuclear warheads rowan atkinson is the bumbling foreign officer nigel small-fawcett; and alec mccowen is algernon, the armorer who provides 007 some formidable items if you like to see connery playing a tense battle of wills, disguised as a masseur, attacked by robot-controlled sharks, giving away a considerable amount of money for a tango dance, thrown into a medieval dungeon, don't miss this second of only two "unofficial" james bond films

the filming is cheesy. some of the actors overact. some of the actions are unexplained and unexplainable. but...this movie is in the mode of the psychological dramas of the 50s.it is a morality play. similar to the movie in which a "method" actor becomes the evil character he portrays on stage, ed is forced to watch slasher movies because he is the film editor. it gives him a nervous breakdown which leads to a complete psychotic break.

on monday, earlier this week, sometime in july, i happened to be under the influence of the sweet leaf, and me being a horror fan, wanted to see something scary. i was thinking of the ammityville horror 2, but i got something way better. i was at my friend's house, and he had the vhs evil ed. no cover or anything, he didn't even see the whole thing himself, but he told me it was about "a guy who goes crazy and kills a lot of people." well, this movie was very shocking,i've never seen the actual brutal nature of sadistic violence until this movie, it buries ted bundy and ed gein both! it is pretty funny too, with references to the evil dead trilogy( and plus the evil dead 2 poster is everywhere in the movie!) the movie is about edward, a obsessive-compulsive, nice guy, who happens to be a film editor. he is then lent to another department in the building, and he is sent to the posh yet violent world of sam campbell, the splatter and gore department. sam campbell, eddy's new boss, is telling eddy about the big break on his movies, the gruesome loose limbs series, and he needs eddy to make the movie somewhat less violent so they can be shown all over europe. eddy has his regrets soon, as the images and scenes that are displayed to him from the lonely suburban house he is sent to work in, and then, what happens from there is truly nightmarish. imagine yourself in his place! the acting is great, the overdubbing is little funny (sam campbell's voice is often found funny, same with the other actors). however, the overdubbing job was done pretty good, i give this movie a 10/10, and it's a good introduction to the gore sub-genre to horror. very good, nightmarish, bloody.......you just have to see it for yourself.quote from movie: "where in the f**k is my beaver rape scene?!"

it's not citizen kane, but it does deliver. cleavage, and lots of it.badly acted and directed, poorly scripted. who cares? i didn't watch it for the dialog.

this has to be my guilty pleasure. i am a huge fan of 80's movies that were designed to entertain and they didn't care if they offended anyone. this move has no meat, not substance, no deep thought provoking scenes. just plain old college kids having fun and if a few breasts have to be shown, then so be it! this movie is for when you just want to relax and not think. viva la nudity!

h.o.t.s. is proof that at one time, the movie industry said "f-off" to the censors, and made movies with whatever they wanted! in today's world, this movie would be too "over the top" and "extreme" for it to be anywhere than behind a velvet curtain. although, bestbuy had several copies on their $5.99 rack (in case anyone wanted to get a copy)! the movie was brilliant in its own way, in that it blended humor into a t&a movie loaded with playboy playmates! unlike most skin flicks, it did have a plot. that, however, is not exactly why you would watch h.o.t.s.h.o.t.s. is a college movie that reminds me of the revenge of the nerds movies, in that it takes a group of "average people" and puts them against the elite rich preppies that most people can't stand! the only difference is that the "nerds" in this movie have a much better shot at getting laid! i notice that there are some people who would rate this movie low, and to me that is ignorant! obviously this is not intended to win oscars or break barriers in film. if you are looking for that, then go watch what ever the critics pick for you! you have to appreciate the fact that this movie actually had a funny plot, decent acting (for the most part given the genre), and plenty of girls getting naked! h.o.t.s. is one of those movies you watch to get your mind off of modern day problems and daily stress, and instead, laugh and have a good time! if you are looking for a funny college-based movie that has enough skin to turn a pink miata straight, then you should really check out h.o.t.s.!

i remember hearing about this movie and how it played at nearly every drive-in theatre here in toronto. it's about a group of girls that are not accepted by the other sororities at their college, so they start up their own, and of course call it h.o.t.s. it's a fun movie, that is just bursting with drive-in nostalgia! lots of fully endowed t-shirts, vans, fighting, and a football game showdown like no other! it's been compared to "animal house", which is a good movie in it's own right, but to me nothing compares to h.o.t.s. it has it's own brand of fun & character. if you are looking for a classic t n'a movie, look no further because the h.o.t.s. girls are to the rescue, boom-boom shorts & all!

h.o.t.s. is a fun film for a trip back to when skin flicks had a more positive fun-filled agenda. they were made simply to titillate and have a few laughs. everything seems less cynical and jaded. the girls all have natural figures and some are playboy playmates. the simple plot deals with a group of young women who open a non-sanctioned sorority house to get back at the snooty sorority girls who spurned and insulted them. instead of the mean spirited tricks of today, most of the hijinks are simply innocent fun. the women are decent actresses for this genre and are mostly very attractive. to keep our attention between the topless scenes, we have mafia henchmen, a stolen bear, a hot air balloon, a funky house mother, and the cheapest robot ever seen. there's even danny bonnaducci of the partridge family. if you have a sense of humor then let yourself go and enjoy some light entertainment.

this has to be my guilty pleasure. i am a huge fan of 80's movies that were designed to entertain and they didn't care if they offended anyone. this move has no meat, not substance, no deep thought provoking scenes. just plain old college kids having fun and if a few breasts have to be shown, then so be it! this movie is for when you just want to relax and not think. viva la nudity!

topless touch football!! a wet t-shirt contest!! a jockstrap raid!! this "sheanimal house" has it all. except a plot and good actors. the film consists of several pranks and catfights between the h.o.t.s. girls and the bitchy pi house. the dialouge is a scream and the soundtrack is sublimely brilliant. over the past couple of months it's been popping up all over cable, so do yourself a favor and watch out for it. h.o.t.s. is so bad it's good!

i'm grading this film on a curve, in other words, it isn't the greatest film that has ever been made but it does exactly what it set out to do. this is an excellent t&a film. i have no idea the count of how many t's or a's were seen in this film but i did see one shot that had 16 bare t's at one time, just to give you an idea. there are topless girls all throughout. there is a wet t-shirt contest scene. and the climax involves a game of touch football between two all-girl teams and every time one scores a touchdown the entire opposing team losing a piece of clothes. i don't know why this gets such a low rating here. perhaps the people who gave it low scores thought they were going to see citizen kane. i love this movie and hope to find more similar ones. if you are looking for a good campy t&a film i'd recommend this one.

if you watched this film for the nudity (as i did) you won't be disappointed. i could have done without the bumbling crooks or the bear though. some bottomless nudity could have be shown but for what it was i think h.o.t.s. has to be the best of its genre.it is not the sort of film that could have been made today which is a pity because it is the sort of film that is worth watching in these times.i would take mindless nudity over pivotal plot points any day.it is a shame that the dvd doesn't have any extras but as they didn't have dvds when this was filmed that is understandable. i would have like to know more about the shooting of the film especially where they shot the football match at the end.

man this movie is awesome especially the part they show the italian chick damn shes incredibly hot shes not your average italian. mna i would go see that movie over and over just to see that chick. i really enjoyed the movie really hot girl shes steamy sexy. also the actor are really good but the girl is better. i think the actor played a better part in pride and prejudice so i don't think he acted in his highest level but yeah back to the girl i mean shes gorgeous perfect and i could only wish her luck in her future movies yeah also her acting skills in such young age was awesome i was just amazed wit her performance. what a great actress so yeah i recommend everybody this great movie

i like breillat's movies, but this one is the best i've seen at balancing animal warmth with sexual intelligence. anne parillaud is electric, and the script is amazing - especially considering it's supposed to take place on the set of another of breillat's movies. you don't have to agree with her take on everything to get a lot out of this. it made me think a lot about vulnerability and power. try to imagine a male director with jeanne's openness - not impossible, but a little mind-bending. the unannounced sexual undercurrents that are always present when humans get together to make anything is held up to bright light here, but not a cold light.

this film was very interesting to me, virtually a film within a film, which is about a very whimsical director who cleverly persuades an actress and and actor (who happen to dislike each other) in producing sexual chemistry on film. the director is faced with a fusillade of obstacles as she tries to get the two individuals to perform beautifully on film. sex is comedy is much more than a comedy, packed with uncomfortable quirky moments the movie also addresses the psychological and innate instinctual behavior of men and women in regards to the sometimes controversial act of sex. i loved this film, the character jeanne played by the beautiful anne parillaud performs wonderfully on screen as you share in her struggle to produce a motion picture work of art.

catherine brreillat is a french director who loves to provoke her audience. she takes us along to witness how a film is done on location. the movie in production seems to be based on herself, since the person at the center of the story is jeanne, a woman director, much like ms. breillat. jeanne acts as the alter ego of the real director.jeanne reaches an impasse at the start of filming. not only has she picked the wrong time to photograph this movie during a cold spell, as it involves beach locations that are obviously too cold for the actors and extras. jeanne has problems with the two principal actors, especially, the male lead who has problems accepting the way the director has decided to show him in the movie; the lead actress is no angel either.movie making, ms. breillat tells us is a process like no other in a creative work of art. first, there is the writing period, in which, in this case, jeanne, has written a screen play, that when it goes into production reveals problems the writer/director didn't think about. there is the problem of how she wants to photograph a love scene in which the young woman of the story has her first sex contact. what appeared clever in the written page, doesn't necessarily translate into an easy time in front of the camera. the actor is made to wear a false penis and has a lot of problems accepting the fact that a make up has to touch him in ways he never thought he would ever be touched by another man.the luminous anne parillaud is marvelous as jeanne, the director. she makes observations about the production, the actors, and the crew that fit well into the story being told. gregoire colin and roxane mesquide play the lead actors, with all the insecurity that some actors bring to a movie set. jeanne has to massage their egos in order to get what she wants in the end. ashley waninnger plays leo, jeanne's assistant."sex is comedy" allows ms. breillet to give us her own take on films in general. this is a great look at the way movies are done in a typical breillat style.

another fabulous movie from catherine breillat, this time about the difficulties of shooting a sex scene in a movie. using comedy  a new genre for breillat  we get a backstage view of filmmaking but in documentary style. the character who plays the director in the movie is based on breillat, the sex scene in question is taken from her earlier film a ma soeur' as is the main teenage actress. but the film, like all of breillat's work, is not entertainment alone. it is peppered with philosophical observations on the nature of sexuality as well as demonstrating a devotion to purity' (as opposed to pornography) that is a cornerstone of breillat's work and a devotion to real emotion. we see the director character harangue the young lead actress and actor to bring the best out in them, hypnotising them into the parts they need to play, bringing out part of themselves that the director can see in them but they cannot see in themselves until they achieve the heights of acting that she demands of them. she makes meaningful movies, not titillation, but she shows the work that is needed to produce this, and so gives us insights both into the (decidedly french) film making process and the psychology of male  female sexuality.

the accounts seem real with a human factor added to the mix. a lot of sadness. i'm sure glad that i wasn't him....another thing to add is that all the women in this show were not really pretty accounts of the real women. but, i don't think that it was about the women, although it was to jfk jr's passion. what a shame. any loss of life is a real shame.seemed like a good account of his life. i recommend it if you are into biographies and melodrama!

i must say this is the best movie i have ever seen. i know that on this website it's received only negative reviews, but for once i'd like to be the good person who gives the worlds best movie a good review. i find the movie to be extremely funny, and it has the perfect mix of everything. it makes me feel all sorts of emotions when i watch it, and i can't get enough of it. the soundtracks brilliant. i love it, i understand why people may not love it as much as i do, but i don't understand how people could hate it. the movie is 100% brilliance. blurred is amazing. i never realised that aussie movies could be so good, and i also never realised i could watch one movie, so many times in a single day without getting sick of it. i think that everybody should watch it, whether its to get a feel of what life was like in the younger days, or if its to see what your in for when you reach the end of year 12.

of all the 48 films of brigitte bardot, "une parisienne" is widely regarded as (one of) her best. what we see is special: for once the plot has a value of its own, does much more than only providing a cheap vehicle for bb's sex-charged appearance.this film is your true & well worked-out light comedy, with a good and coherent story. set in france's government circles in the late 1950's, it entertains from beginning to end. providing many amusing twists & turns and some slapstick -- all acted out by at least three starring leads, including bardot."une parisienne" (= french for "female inhabitant of paris") focuses on telling a story, not on showing brigitte bardot. brigitte serves the plot very well by using her talent for acting in light comedies.when you settle on your couch on a friday-night, tired and weary from a week's slaving away, just turn on "une parisienne". this film will make you feel better.

bridgette bardot, looking as sexy as ever, plays a spoiled but innocent daughter of a french ambassador. she cons one of her father's top aides (womanizer michel) into marrying her and it turns out to be the best thing for both of them. michel is soon flirting with his old girlfriends and in order to teach him a lesson, bridgette flirts heavily with a married prince charles. michel is surprised by his jealousy. a cat-and-mouse game ensues between brigdette and michel ("i'll have an affair"..."no you won't"...) and finally michel realizes she just might and vows to give up all the other ladies in his life. bridgette and michel settle comfortably into their happily-ever-after while prince charles jets home to england.it's an admittedly light piece but it's incredibly charming. while some may fault it as a product of it's time, i found that completely enjoyable. worthy of a rental.

most of the brigitte bardot movies i've seen have failed to take full advantage of her captivating screen presence. unfortunately, she was given few really good roles in movies of undeniable quality, which was a real oversight. she deserved them and was able to demonstrate her full cinematic power when they came her way. as genevieve in "love on a pillow" we had a clear exception to the trend of light, fluffy vehicles, for it was an interesting, artistic film by any reasonable measure, and in it, a 28-year-old bb was at her most alluring. "une parisienne" is another, featuring an extremely captivating brigitte in an interesting, well-crafted comedy that explores how an ambitious lady's man can be convinced to remain faithful to an incredibly beautiful young wife. there are several good performances here. her playboy husband, michel, is one, "the prince," played by charles boyer, is another, with entertaining efforts by a good supporting cast. as for brigitte bardot, the way she looks in this movie is the way i remember her as a kid in the fifties. she was 23 in 1957 and way ahead of her time, more beautiful than any other actress of the period, including marilyn monroe. her curvy, coquettish sexuality, amply displayed in several bosom-baring, skintight dresses, simply jumps off the screen. she was more hip and cute than the women of america are today, nearly fifty years later. obsessed with their careers and still desperately clinging to feminist politics, they come off like a bunch of clueless lesbians. in stark contrast, the sex kitten was sexually liberated, intelligent, and clearly independent long before it was fashionable, yet while fully understanding the power of her exceptional femininity, she used it for a higher purpose than mere self-interest -- she believed in love. a still photo simply could not do her justice. you had to watch her slender yet voluptuous form (with its 20-inch waist) lightly cross a room. you had to see that wild blonde mane, gaze into her big, brown, seductive eyes, and listen as her full, pouting lips spoke french. in a closeup at the end of this movie she winks and flirts with the camera, her beautiful orbs twinkling. what a babe! for fans of brigitte bardot, "une parisienne" is not to be missed.

i have to agree with all the previous commenter's--this is simply the best of all frothy comedies, with bardot as sexy as marilyn monroe ever was, and definitely with a prettier face (maybe there's less mystique, but look how marilyn paid for that.) i don't think i've ever seen such a succulent-looking female on screen, so perfect that even a gay man like me got excited by it--and not just for purely aesthetic reasons (if the idiot evangelicals really want to do their 'convert-a-queer' number, they are really going to need to up their standards, as no church mice need apply here...)her breasts, the rest of her figure, her adorable voice, the hilarious way she shakes as she walks across a room...only to arrive in front of a man, breasts literally pointed as if in exquisite confrontation...i think boyer is one of the greatest leading men in all of film history. no one played opposite more great female stars than did he: garbo, dietrich, k. hepburn, colbert, and here bardot, among many others. and he was also in 'fanny' with leslie caron, and had small parts in 'how to steal a million' with a. hepburn, as well as being in the deneuve movie 'the april fools' (although not opposite her.) the only thing i could disagree with in remarks is that even the loud, obnoxious music over the opening credits is appropriate--i mean, bardot is not meant to be subtle on top of everything else, and her essential loudness (i don't mean her voice) is part of her irresistible and, one might even say, exemplary charm.vidal is thoroughly handsome, even if pouty brigitte says toward the beginning 'i don't know why i am in love with you, you're not even handsome.' dear, dear bardot! truly one of the wonders of the 20th century, not to mention the joy that she is still with us, when so many of the truly characterful are passing away so fast, in all her eccentric glory.

vadim changed brigitte's image and way of life from that of the young society beauty he had married to that of a rebellious and challenging teenager of the 1950s "une parisienne" succeeded in launching her ravishing figure as the teenage goddess, the casual sexuality, the provocative gaiety in confrontation with men charles boyer  as prince charles  was the perfect, ideal choice of those magically romantic moments his deep and vibrant voice spoke a promise of new adventures in love his deep, wondering eyes bespoke a worldly knowledge untarnished by cynicism he had the boudoir grace of valentino without the hysteria or the sometime effeminacy of the great lover under michel boisrond's direction, boyer was an old-style romantic without the grand manner

i was lucky enough recently to see ingrid bergman's name attached to a film i had never seen (or even heard of) on amc. what a stroke of luck.to marvel at her flawless and seamless performance isn't the only reason to stay up late and watch this movie. the writing is wonderfully comical and the performances are excellent.walter mathau (not my favorite) was nearly perfect and goldie hawn (suprisingly) was fabulous. tender at times, demanding, then just plain goofy. there are times in the film that even the most hardened film viewer will get caught up in the story and forget that it is a movie.that bergman can steal a dance scene among a crowd of 20 year-olds was amazing to watch. she is effortless in her return to the screen (at age 54?). the supporting cast was great and the lines... the lines are exquisite.a top 5 romantic comedy of all time.

another "oldie but goody" from about the same time as "out of towners" is "cactus flower", with a great cast: goldie hawn, in her first film appearance (pre-facelifts), ingrid bergmann in one of her later ones, and the ever-funny walter matthau. the story is about a dentist who pretends to be married in order to have an excuse for not marrying his girlfriend, leading to the need to come up with a fictitious wife for proof. he cajoles his spinster receptionist (bergman) into taking the role, leading to multiple comic disasters and surprising romantic turns. it's in the same vein as the doris day/rock hunter comedies. fans of those - as i am - will like this movie; if not, don't bother.

swinging bachelor matthau, a successful dentist, is stringing along his blond mistress hawn, having told her that he's a married man with three kids. after she attempts suicide matthau decides to get responsible and marry the girl. worried that she's going to be a "homebreaker", bright eyed hawn wants to meet his wife and explain everything to her. matthau employs his faithful nurse bergman to act his wife and that's when things really get complicated.a farcical comedy with irresistible leads quite often hits the mark but isn't for one second believable. the script asks us to believe that us men are such one-dimensional turds that it's truly beyond belief. but maybe this comedy doesn't need to be analyzed too deeply, just sit back and enjoy the ever so funny matthau, the ever so charming bergman and débutant hawn, who here basically created the dumb-blond girl role.

aside from the discotheque scenes that epitomize the swinging sixties (especially with everyone dancing to instrumental versions of monkees hits), i am surprised how well this lightweight farce holds up 37 years later, but indeed it does thanks to the breezy execution of its deception-based plot and the sharp interplay of the three leads. directed by the redoubtable stage-to-screen expert gene saks, this 1969 comedy is about julian winston, a successful manhattan dentist and confirmed bachelor, who pretends to be married in order to avoid long-term commitment with his young girlfriend of a year, toni. in response to toni's half-hearted suicide attempt, julian agrees to marry her, but toni first insists on meeting his wife to alleviate her conscience. enter julian's devoted nurse stephanie to play the wife, and the inevitable complications ensue with white lies growing into major whoppers that lead to presumed couplings and de-couplings.as julian, a relaxed walter matthau dexterously plays the deceptive dentist in his typically sardonic manner, but he lets his two female co-stars walk off with the picture. in her big screen debut, a pixyish 24-year old goldie hawn is still retaining her giggly "laugh-in" persona but provides unexpected savvy and depth as toni. she and matthau have great, unforced chemistry in their scenes together. screen legend ingrid bergman, still serenely regal at 54, is obviously having a ball playing stephanie, initially starchy and quick-witted but blossoming into a liberated spirit as the story evolves. i particularly like how casual she appears after her overnight romp. there is nice supporting work from rick lenz as toni's bohemian neighbor igor and jack weston as julian's smarmy actor buddy harvey. billy wilder's longtime collaborator, i.a.l. diamond, provides the sparkling screenplay and opens up the story beyond its stage-bound origins for saks, who is not the most cinematic of directors. other than a couple of trailers, there are no significant extras with the dvd.

what an absolutely charming movie. the cast is wonderful, and the story is witty and fun. an all around pleasant movie experience. although the plot is somewhat predictable, it doesn't make the story any less enjoyable, in fact i didn't want it to end. i've always been a ingrid bergman fan, and i was interested to see her in a comedic role. she didn't let me down, ingrid bergman's performance as ms dickinson is fun to watch. i loved her interaction with toni at the music store as well as her dancing and doing "the dentist". it only further proved what i already knew, that she is one of the greatest actresses of all time. goldie hawn is also delightful to watch. her fun, gentle-hearted and lovable toni is the driving force of the movie. you don't even question why she would be so concerned about her finacee's wife, you just accept that she's just that type of person who wouldn't be happy unless she knew everyone else was also. and walter matthau is great as julian. his actions never create a feeling animosity for the viewer, in fact they almost make him more enduring. there wasn't an unlikable character in the bunch. this movie has definitely with stood the test of time, i watched it just last night and i think it's one of the best romantic comedies i've ever seen. if you're looking for a fun, lighthearted, romantic comedy look no further.

as much as i like walter matthau, i felt that the majority of his roles were tailored towards his personality. this role is one of the exceptions. he plays a dentist who is both charming and dishonest. this role does require much more acting than in most of his other roles. i liked the fact that the movie was honest about how a professional can be dishonest in order to avoid commitment in a relationship. his whole aim was to find a way to be in a relationship with a much younger woman, but not to be committed in any way. the alibi - using his secretary (ingrid bergman) to pretend to be his wife. at some point in the movie, the pretend mr. and mrs. actually are deluded into believing that they were actually really married. the ending was good, because a middle aged man found that pursuing someone in his own age group was more worthwhile. the movie was funny, entertaining, and didn't sell out by being preachy.

i knew next to nothing about this movie until i chanced to rent it. it was a very pleasant surprise. the cast is excellent including matthau whom i do not normally care for. he makes a credible romantic lead. hawn is a sweet kook and bergman is touching as a woman coming out of her shell.

well i would say that this is a very enjoyable and somewhat touching movie despite its flaws. i didn't believe for a minute that matthau knew the first thing about being a dentist. also, hawn's character seemed to recover from suicidal depression rather quickly at the beginning of the movie. not to mention the entire thing seemed rather ridiculous. however, the film does succeed due to a good pace, humor, and its stars. matthau may not have been a dentist, but he was as amusing as he usually is. bergman brought a great deal of sensitivity to the film (especially during the scene where her and matthau go out for a drink after work) and also a good deal of humor. i believe it was her performance that made my brother take notice of this movie after overhearing a couple scenes. hawn's performance is noteworthy, although an oscar may have been over doing it a bit. basically, don't take this movie too seriously and you will enjoy yourself.

goldie hawn, in 1969, was best known for playing in television comedy shows - in particular rowan and martin's laugh in, where she was the giggly cookie young blond. she did make movies before cactus flower, the most notable being a walt disney feature, the one and only genuine, original family band. but cactus flower picked up on her character from laugh-in, and (due to a good script by i.a.l. diamond - billy wilder's second partner - based on an abe burrows play) she was able to develop the television character so that a real performance was fleshed out. as a result ms hawn won an oscar for best supporting actress in 1969, and her career took off to such future hits as private benjamin and the first wives club. although other stars of laugh-in did well on television (henry gibson has a recurring role as a judge on boston legal) only goldie was able to have a career as a bonifide movie star.on laugh-in goldie's personality would show a naiveté that would be embarrassing. occasionally she realized it, and would laugh loud to cover, but sometimes she just did not see her error (example: goldie is introduced to the 1950s variety show host gary moore, and is told, "goldie, this is mr. gary moore." she shakes his hand and says (much to his confusion), "i've always wanted to meet mr. john gary moore!"). but as toni simmons it is quite different. she is desperately in love with dr. julian winston (walter matthau), a successful dentist, who can never marry her. julian has told her that his wife (with whom he has had two sons and a daughter) will never give him a divorce. so at the start of the film toni tries to commit suicide by the gas of her stove. but she is rescued by her neighbor, igor sullivan (rick lenz), a struggling dramatist, who breaks into her apartment and turns off the gas. toni is resigned to live, but she has sent a suicide note to julian. igor tries to deliver a message to ignore the note but julian's receptionist/nurse/assistant, stephanie dickinson (ingrid bergman) won't stop julian's work schedule to pass him the phone when igor calls. instead julian finds the letter and races to toni's apartment, only to find her alive. when igor supports her story that she tried to kill herself, julian realizes the depth of her love, and decides he must marry such a woman. unfortunately toni has swallowed julian's lies, and believes in his wife and children. you see, julian has no wife and children. since toni is a firm believer that she can't marry a man who would lie to her julian is stuck on a weakening tree branch.julian comes to solve it by getting stephanie to pretend she is mrs. winston. stephanie is opposed to it at first, but on her own, on her first free saturday, she confronts toni at the record shop toni is at. they talk, and toni notices all the fine strengths of character and personality of stephanie (and since stephanie has her two nephews with her, toni thinks they are julian's kids). toni tells julian they have to see who is the man that stephanie is supposedly going to marry. so the lie starts spiraling for julian, stephanie, and toni. soon a lover is given to stephanie in the form of julian's friend and freeloading patient harvey greenfield (jack weston). greenfield is so sleazy (stephanie loathes him) that toni feels that he is unworthy of stephanie.and so it goes, with one complication (most caused by the well-intentioned, misinformed toni) following another until the conclusion. the script is full of first rate situations and one-liners (example: julian to reward stephanie for lying about their marriage, buys two record albums from toni's store. he has given a mink stole to toni, but she decides to send it to stephanie with julian's card. stephanie is quite happy at getting the mink, but she does not say a word about the nature of the gift she got - when she profusely thanks matthau, he says the thought she'd like horowitz - meaning vladomir horowitz. but stephanie thinks horowitz is the name of the furrier!). bergman must have enjoyed the filming, as several scenes shows that earthy radiance that was a trademark for her in the later 1940s films. but there was also the resemblance to her 1958 film comedy smash hit, indiscreet. there cary grant lied to make sure the pair would concentrate on the romance of their affair without having to think about marriage. when grant's lie is revealed to bergman she decides on a lie of her own to convince grant that she was making him a cuckold. here, instead of being the passive lover believing matthau is telling the truth, bergman gingerly tries to get matthau out of his mess by little white lies, only to find one leads to another to complicate everyone's lives. bergman is seen as a nice woman who becomes part of the problem, despite trying to be part of the solution.all the leads perform well, in particular bergman, all business thoroughness at first but gradually reclaiming her sexuality. matthau is delightful as a man who finds a useful lie is an impediment that just can't be kicked aside. the supporting cast, especially weston as the mooching and sexually slimy harvey, and vito scotti as the u.n. ambassador who actually has the hots for bergman. it was a clever comedy, and a really good way for goldie hawn's movie career to push forward.

goldie hawn's depiction of a simple young lady caught up in a love triangle with an older man, a dentist, played with such relish by walter matthau, that she won the best supporting actress oscar for 1969.the film, however, is another tribute to ingrid bergman. rarely, did we ever see her in a comedy and she literally kicks up her heels here as a dedicated dental nurse who is thrust into a scheme for matthau to tell hawn that they're married.it is such a joy to watch matthau and bergman fall for each other here. theirs is an accidental love affair in the making.as matthau's friend, jack weston is fabulous as his partner in the scheme as well. rick lenz gives ample support as hawn's newly-found boyfriend as well.

anyone who has ever doubted ingrid bergman's ability to play comedy need only look to "the bells of st. mary's". ok, so she's a nun with tb who's probably in love with fr. o'malley, (think what luis bunuel could have done with that), but she also displayed a wonderfully sly sense of fun that made you wish directors had cast her in comedies more often. in "cactus flower" she's a starched dentist's nurse, (walter matthau is the dentist), in love with her boss but keeping it buttoned up. when she's forced to act as his 'wife' in order to hoodwink his mistress, (don't ask), she lets loose and the buttons pop. and she's a joy to behold.the movie itself is a hardier than usual translation to the screen of a broadway hit, (you can see it's three acts). it's a french farce, (it was originally; it's taken from the play 'fleur de cactas' by pierre barillet and jean-pierre gredy), and it hits all the right spots. matthau uses his great hang-jowl expression to wonderful effect and a klutzy blonde newcomer, as she was then, called goldie hawn almost steals the film as the dizzy mistress who decides to give up her meal ticket because she feels sorry for 'the wife' even though 'the wife' is having a ball. hawn made such an impression in the role that what she did steal was the academy award for best supporting actress.

i am surprised by the relatively low rating this film has. it is a screwball comedy & romance film rolled together by someone besides billy wilder but it does a really good job & even won an oscar.it is ingrid bergman's first film in the us since the 1950's & even though she is no longer the young bombshell she was in her early films, she brings off a difficult role quite handsomely. this film proves she had multiple talents beyond her good looks.goldie hawn who won an oscar in this, her first film, as supporting actress is very good as the modern sophisticated yet quirky latest mistress to dentist playboy, love them & leave them walter mathaw. goldie is delightful to all the senses in this role which with a great cast set her up as a slam dunk for this early career award.this film is not real deep, but is a gem that has stood the test of time very well. not sure why it's average is so low as i give it a solid 8.

far more sprightly, and less stage and set bound than gene saks' previous efforts barefoot in the park(67) and the odd couple (68), cactus flower is not a work of art, but compared to most of the tired farces from the 60's like the apartment, how to murder your wife, goodbye charlie, a guide for the marrried man, divorce, american style, any wednesday, kiss me stupid, boys night out, it's a masterpiece. director saks and writer i.a.l. diamond have effectively "opened up" abe burrows' broadway hit, and the film benefits greatly from new york city location shooting and excellent performances from ingrid bergman and goldie hawn. bergman is charming, looks great, and demonstrates a flair for comedy. hawn in her oscar winning role has never been better or more appealing. matthau is ok though it's hard to believe that hawn's character would be so enamored of him. and in retrospect, hawn's attempted suicide at the start of the film is out of character and unbelievable. nonetheless, the film has a plausible farcical set up, and once it gets going it generates laugh. rick lenz, jack weston, eve bruce, and vito scotti provide good support. the film is likable and fun, and hawn and bergman make you care.

i was very surprised to learn that goldie hawn won an oscar for this film. she seemed very lifeless and completely schooled by the 54(!) year old bergman in the scenes where they are side by side. if it had been written today, i think that bergman and the young man ivan would have wound up together (ingrid is so much hotter than goldie...) and the two self-absorbed characters played by matthau and hawn would be left out in the cold. but it was written at the end of 60's and feels like plaza suite or barefoot in the park. however, matthau's one-liners, hawn's innocence and bergman's classy performance make this quite pleasant to watch.

cactus flower was a delightful 1969 comedy based on a neil simon play about a dentist (walter matthau) having an affair with a young free spirited woman (goldie hawn), totally unaware that his devoted nurse/assistant(ingrid bergman)is in love with him. matthau can play this kind of role in his sleep and he doesn't disappoint as the philandering dentist, dr. julian winston, who is dating one woman but really has no clue that he's in love with another. goldie hawn won an oscar for her sparkling performance as toni simmons, the aging flower child who slowly comes to realize she is trapped in a dead end affair and is not as dim as she appears on the surface. but the real pleasure for me in this film was the performance of the legendary ingrid bergman as stephanie dickinson, dr. winston's completely devoted assistant, who is willing to to bury and sacrifice her own happiness as long as dr. winston is happy with tony. bergman is luminous in this film, looking absolutely beautiful (though the camera has always loved her) and showing an unforeseen knack for light comedy. yes, the dialogue and the settings are slightly dated, but the story is timeless and the performances by the stars make it imminently watchable.

i've been playing this movie incessantly this month, and i just love it. i was around in the 60s (oh dear), so it is nostalgic in one sense. however, it's the funny premise, the snappy dialogue and the great performances that keep me watching.dr. winston's reactions to stephanie at the end of the movie are priceless. (i'd be more specific, but don't want to spoil it for anyone.) who other than matthau can play a man not entirely on the up-and-up and yet have us still love him? as for bergman's costumes, i think she looks as dowdy as she's supposed to. i think "she was robbed" the one time that she appears in an evening gown. it doesn't suit her at all, which is too bad. i never liked it when i first saw it on her and i still don't.goldie won an oscar for her role. people thought it was a groundbreaking performance at the time, and yet it's the one performance that i don't love as much as the others. she does have the right amount of sweetness and likability, however, which is important for this role.and i agree - i thought rick lenz was great in it and it's too bad that his movie career didn't take off after this.i hope more people watch this movie ... they'll love it!

when i saw lauren bacall do cactus flower on broadway, i never dreamed that one day i would see an actress like ingrid bergman playing the bacall role on screen. but here ingrid really lets her hair down for some good comedy moments as the dental nurse pretending to be walter matthau's wife so he can go on with the fib he's told goldie hawn.it's a story played for laughs from beginning to end, good-humored stuff that never runs out of dry humor and wit throughout its running time. there are plenty of one-liners or gags that are way above the usual situation comedy stuff one hears on tv--the lines ring true because they blend so well with the characters and their motives.as the daffy girl who contemplates (in the beginning) committing suicide over her unhappy affair with matthau, goldie hawn (fresh from her days as a star on tv's "laugh in") does a dumb blonde role to perfection. easy to see why she won that supporting actress oscar.ingrid is surprisingly fetching in a rare comedy role, although there are times when she seems just a bit too matronly for the part. at any rate, she's a surprising choice to play the nurse who puts on a freeze act at the office but is considerably warmer off duty.as goldie's next door neighbor, igor, rick lenz acquits himself admirably, and makes a suitable match for her in that final scene.matthau plays the kind of character that became his stock in trade in all those neil simon roles he had--a lovable cad who gets caught up in his own messes when he tells lie after lie.it's the kind of rib-tickling comedy that'll have you laughing out loud at some of the amusing lines that abe burrows and i.a.l. diamond have managed to scrap together, based on a french farce.

everyone told me to see "cactus flower," and i finally did. what a wonderful movie -- the perfect pick-me-up for a sunday night/dreading monday morning. matthau and hawn were good, but ingrid bergman really made this movie -- after all, it was really about her. the truly great actors can do anything, and miss bergman proves it. she shows us -- in the course of one film -- a range few people display in their entire career. the scene in the dance club was as hysterical as it was touching. even as the film drew to its obvious conclusion, i found myself cheering for miss dickinson as if she were the boston red sox. thankfully, she made out (no pun intended) much better. ;)

i discovered this late one night on turner classics. i kept saying to myself "i'll turn it off as soon as it stops being funny", but needless to say i watched the whole way through.i am a movie junkie but i had never even heard of this movie (or if i did in 1971, i forgot). it's worth watching just for the performance of goldie hawn as the tart-tongued ingénue. her acting is a revelation in this movie. yes, the script is sharp and excellent (when was the last time they made a hollywood comedy with a smart script?) but her acting is extraordinary. i never realized how funny goldie could be, and it makes her later appearances in roles such as laugh-in and private benjamin a little sad. in her later career she is far too over-the-top compared to her minimalist, wickedly funny appearance here.it's a pleasure watching the young matthau, the great bergman and the stellar supporting cast, but it's goldie hawn that will make this movie worth watching again.

walter matthau is wonderful as the "philandering" dentist dr. julian winston whose frequent fibs to girlfriend goldie provide textbook proof of the dangers of lying. goldie hawn's touching kook toni simmons certainly deserved to win her oscar. ingrid bergman's work as the stiff-as-starch nurse stephanie is also touching to watch as she comes out of her shell, slowly and nervously. this is a great movie to watch in the springtime, or any time for that matter. it's very underrated; i never heard about it until i found it in the video store, and what a find!

cactus flower is what i call a "pizza movie" -a personal favorite that never fails to satisfy. perfect for an evening at home with a pizza. knowing all the lines (and what lines!) by heart only enhances the enjoyment.since so many others here have retold the plot, i'll simply add the correction that bergman's character, miss dickinson, was a nurse-receptionist, meaning she was a skilled nurse -and therefore an educated person -not "just" a receptionist.bergman's performance in this film -and the film itself- was largely dismissed at the time, but today's audiences will marvel at her range; not just the impeccable comic timing, but the ability to make us believe her character is unaware of her own feelings while revealing them so clearly to toni and to us. while the general plot stretches credibility, bergman's performance is compelling: honest and utterly believable.also a standout is jack weston's performance as the matthau's old friend and co-conspirator, harvey. no one could deliver a zinger like weston, and i.a.l. diamond's script gives him plenty. for example: "that's such a big, dirty, rotten lie it has class." weston excelled at slightly seedy characters because he exuded a warmth that allowed you to forgive his characters' flaws. the film is a fairly straight adaptation of the abe burrows play (which was itself adapted from a french play by barillet and gredy). on broadway matthau's role was played by barry nelson. bergman's by lauren bacall, and hawn's by brenda vaccaro. it ran for 1,234 performances (three years) and was nominated for two tony awards (vaccaro and burt brinckerhoff, who played igor).for me, the film's score, written and adapted by the legendary quincy jones is another highlight. the main theme (a time for love is anytime) is performed by sarah vaughn over the opening and closing credits. it is also insinuated in different arrangements throughout the film, most notably as the romantic piano music underscoring berman's speech to hawn in the record store. jones also created covers of popular songs from the period (to sir with love, i'm a believer) for the night club scenes. as with all of the film's elements, there is a tremendous amount of talent, taste, and professionalism evident. in my opinion, few modern romantic comedies can hold a candle to this classic. it's great to finally have it available on dvd. time to call for a pizza...

ingrid bergman, playing dentist walter matthau's faithful receptionist who harbors a little crush on her boss, is absolutely wonderful in this film. she handles the witty repartee in the script with aplomb and steals a terrific scene where she and goldie hawn talk in a record booth (ingrid's monologue is a front, but her face tells you she believes in it with all her heart). matthau is an odd choice for the leading man (he's too old for goldie hawn and too unrefined for bergman, not to mention too unfocused to be a dentist), but i liked the way he tries hard to please goldie and stumbles around trying to free himself from a lie. hawn (who won a supporting oscar) is just as fresh and bubbly as she is today. this bedroom farce isn't terribly sophisticated (and faintly reminds one of "any wednesday" besides), but it's a welcome relief from the noisy, teen-oriented comedies they turn out today. "cactus flower" is a lovely sigh! *** from ****

this film has not exactly remained fresh in the minds of film buffs, and it's a crying shame. its witty screenplay adaptation should have netted oscar nominations for the great screenwriter i.a.l. diamond's adaptation, and ingrid bergman's flawless performance. it must have been an honor for goldie hawn at such a young age to work with bergman, looking more than a decade younger than her 54 years--fifty four! when she's on the screen, it positively twinkles.this is a film which may appear dated at first, but it actually made me wish i was around during the swingin' 'sixties. hawn's fashions are as tacky as bergman's are chic. (that's one minor flaw--isn't her character a little too soignée for a gal who still lives with her sister? but then again, would we have ingrid any other way?) and who wouldn't want to hang out at a nightclub called the slipped disc?the best compliments i can pay to this film is that it somehow made me nostalgic for a decade that i never saw, and that it left me wanting more. speaking of wanting more, i wonder what ever became of sexy supporting actor rick lenz? (he resembles griffin dunne in this film.) this was his film debut, and i don't see any other major roles in his filmography. as for goldie hawn, she's done so much since then it's easy to not be impressed, but i can't imagine any other actor in the role, either.since the movie is based on a play, the line delivery may seem a bit stage-y, but it did not inhibit my enjoyment at all. in fact, i am amazed at how funny it still is after over thirty-five years. because this film represents a bygone era, it has unjustly slipped from the consciousness of film buffs. it is more linked to the era films that came before it than the ones that followed. but don't let that stop you from savoring the delights it has to offer. grade: a

starting on or around 1965 american movies took a turn for the shocking and the iconoclastic which was great for the times -- sort of the seeds that would pave the way for grittier, daring dramas. however, because the very decade that gave birth to these films was so ruled by its own convictions, most all of the films released at this period have dated. cactus flower is no exception. its very title suggests a "sunny" romantic comedy with occasional lapses into the risqué. this is not to say that it's a bad thing: quite the contrary, films about risqué subject matter have to begin somewhere and america being a culture rooted in specific traditions, themselves laced in deep hypocrisies, shocks itself for the sake of it when seeing an indirect reflection of the mores of the time. meanwhile, european films address these same situations, walk off looking like a million bucks, and have a longer shelf-life because what we consider scandalous, they shrug off, say "next," and move on. toni simmons (goldie hawn in her breakout role), a young, very sixties bright young thing, is carrying on with a much-older dentist named julian winston (walter matthau), who has commitment issues. he can'r marry her: he's already married. toni decides instead of wilting away she actually wants to meet his wife and "set things straight." into the picture comes his assistant, stephanie dickinson (a luminous ingrid bergman, returning to american cinema after a twenty-year absence), a woman closer to his age who acts as if she and he had the perfect marriage and household. there is a reason for this: she has harbored quiet emotions for julian, emotions he is unaware of, even when he asks her to play his wife to ward toni off from wanting to step their relationship further. and then he steps it up a notch when toni's blissfully innocent actions veer the action off into the unexpected and he introduces harvey greenfield (jack weston) as stephanie's "lover". by the way, harvey is also an older gent who is having an affair with a much younger woman (eve bruce) whom he also lies to in one very funny scene.it's funny how the person whom we're looking for is the one who's always been there. what could have been a thankless role for rick lenz who plays igor sullivan, toni's next door neighbor, turns into the man who not only sees the true beauty in fellow outcast stephanie but the one who saves toni at the start from killing herself. (not the stuff of comedy, suicide. then again, this is not your average comedy.) and needless to say is ingrid bergman's subtle, poignant portrayal of a woman who's somehow missed her chances at love, who's become prickly, who due to a lie said to another she becomes the real person she was always meant to be. i can't imagine anyone else in this quiet but deep role.movies like these can be enjoyed at face-value and seen as escapist fun -- a product of its times -- or be viewed for the deep symbolism that, like its title, it carries deep within. it's a tricky film, the same way hawn's and bergman's performance are equally tricky because in seeming so simple, devoid of flourish and pose, neither come out and proclaim what they are about. their acting becomes "not really acting" but playing real people, warts and all. cactus flower is a story that never appears to take itself too seriously, but reveals itself to be deep and very human after all.

in a phrase, moral ambiguity. in the soderbergh remake, there are good guys and bad guys. benicio del toro's character is clearly the good guy, morally clean and uncorruptable. his counterpart in the bbc original, fazal the farmer turned dealer, is realistically flawed and conflicted over his fate. the two relentless cops are similarly different. in the american one, they win our hearts. in the bbc original, they are over-zealous, nearly obsessive.the best moment for me in soderbergh's was when the college student rhetorically asked the drug czar, "what would you do if you were poor and black and rich white people came into your neighborhood looking for drugs?" that point was insinuated throughout the bbc show, and crystallized in jack lithgow's final speech. both are excellent, but the bbc towers over the remake. my conclusion after seeing both shows is that dealers are innocent pawns who are only supplying a demand, and it is the demand that causes so much suffering.

this movie has made me a rugby -- and coach larry gelwix -- fan. the story's characters slipped and fell before they begin to grow as they struggled through incredibly strong conflicts. those were understandable and completely believable. like life, there were no easy answers for the problems facing them all. superb actors and an excellent script brought this true story to life. i wish there were more movies like this one. these days, i watch almost exclusively, worthwhile true stories because they are typically far more interesting than fiction. additionally, this one is inspirational and it teaches us to not to give up on anyone too quickly.

first, let's call this movie what it is:1. it's a feel-good movie with a message.2. the acting is just okay, dialog slightly better, production value pretty good.3. rugby scenes...just barely passable.but here's the trick: this isn't something hollywood contrived, and it isn't trying to be a ferociously accurate portrayal of the sport. it is instead a pretty good representation of mostly real people, in real circumstances, and a real storyline. sure, they could have done a better job actually rep'ing the sport, but my vote: it does a pretty good job at what it sets out to do.(and fwiw, i can't think of many football, baseball, hockey or soccer movies that are true to the sport either. c'mon...bull durham?)i'm not a rugby player (i was a wrestler) but i graduated from highland, attended '86-'90, and occasionally trained with the rugby guys. my brother-in-law david, however, was one of the original founding members of the highland rugby club in 1976. (his younger brother, billy, played the next year, as i recall. if you're interested, there's a highland rugby site at highlandrugby.net that addresses the history of the team.) by the time i was there the club had been in existence for about a decade, and had long since built a reputation for excellence. it's a fact that they focused on "broad" training topics: devotion, honor, discipline, effort, not tactics. i thought the rugby guys i knew were a little 'off' in the head, but i think i might have just been a little jealous. they were hard-core dedicated to the belief system that gelwix promoted.with regard to the "cultural mixing" issues that have been brought up, it might be interesting to note that while i was there in the 80's, one of the larger schools in the city was shut down - south high school - and its students distributed among the other 3 primary slc schools. to be honest, highland pre-80's was pretty whitebread...i've got a picture of the team from (i think) 1977 that shows an *all* white club. south high, on the other hand, was a much more racially integrated school before it closed: i had a pair of friends from south who joined the team, one tongan, one samoan, and as i recall there were a bunch of island-nation players that joined up '88-'90. i don't think anyone questioned the credibility of the team in adopting maori (or other cultural) traditions: if there was one thing that was obvious about these guys, it's that they walked the walk. and as to the strength of the team when compared to the best highschool-age teams in the world: yeah, it's true that us-rugby, on average when taken as a whole, does not represent particularly well against the best elsewhere. there are exceptions, but hey - it's a simple fact that rugby doesn't have the prominence or exposure needed to develop the multiple traditions of excellence in the us that arise in other countries.with that said, judge highland on its merits: - the *only* team to qualify for the usa rugby national championships every year of that organizations' 25-yr history.- a win record of 392 wins, 9 losses. read that again...winningest coach in any us sport in history.- regular international tours. - some compelling wins against some legitimate international teams.are they the world best? maybe some years, probably not most...but they're pretty good on a consistent basis. and it's disrespectful to the game to blow them off, when highland rugby may be the best ambassador to the sport in the us.

i think a several of america's baseball movies are among the best movies ever made. when this movie was in production and heard it described as a rugby movie. i'd read about the highland team in the newspapers, but didn't have high expectations for this film about a sport that didn't interest me.last night i viewed it "on-demand" and loved it almost as much as my favorite baseball movies. ryan little and the cast and crew did an amazing job. neil mcdonough was especially convincing. as the "bad dad" he displayed fine range and a subtle, but moving character arc.i also enjoyed the pacific islander actors. i've been fortunate to know many of these fine people and this film captures their wonderful spirit and culture. a flashback showing how the islander culture became such a key element of highland's team would have been a excellent addition to the film.some pretty tacky movies have been shot in utah recently. it's good to see a quality film like this from the beehive state.

i just watched it last night and it was great.i can see why some ppl have ill feelings towards it from a rugby fan and maori culture point of view but other than that i have no idea what's so negative about it. the movie is great. it has a lot of heart. very inspiring and encouraging to all ages. great family movie! they did a pretty good job considering that it was a budget movie. i love movies based on true stories/events. i was raised around rugby all my life, it is a great game but i was never really taken to it because (please forgive me if i offend anyone, nothing personal this is just how i saw it) i thought, their trainings are not as ruthless or hard, the players are not as disciplined and don't seemed as serious like other sportmen and it looked like it's all just muscle and blooming tackling each other etc. but after watching forever strong, i was like, wow! i was proud! it did good things for rugby (well it changed my view of rugby) and also the new zealnd haka. i actually cried. i am not even new zealander and i was proud of their culture. didn't even know what the chant meant until this movie. the movie is not about rugby techniques or rugby, it's not even about new zealand all blacks or the haka or etc......mother of pearls!!!!! hahaha shux!so to all you beautiful negative ppl, you are missing the point! i am sure if they had the means, it would have been better, the haka is in there because that was part of highland rugby culture, tradition or what ever you want to call it. so any new members on this site such as myself, please don't be put off by those negative comments. see it for yourself! must see movie! there is a lot you can learn from this movie, ppl of all ages. it definitely makes you want to be a better person and be humble! this movie reminded me of a lot of things that i already know and was raised with but i kinda lost along the way! loved it! happy reading ppls and all the best!muawha!

when i first watched flatliners, i was amazed. it had all the necessary features of a good movie: the cast was superb, the plot was superb, and in the case of thrillers, there was genuine "thrills" throughout.keifer sutherland offered a marvelous performance as the male lead in the piece, portraying a scientist who believes he can find the answers to life and death by killing himself and then coming back to life, essentially "stealing" death's secrets away. kevin bacon offers an excellent performance as the more morally decent counterpart to keifer, while julia roberts offers her most convincing role. william baldwin portrays a student who excels in class and, apparently, intercourse. and oliver platt, in another outstanding performance, portrays the voice of reason for the group and the most innocent.the story is relatively simple, yet original, and the acting is refreshing-- definitely a stand out film for the genre, and one that has set the standard for measuring other thrillers for me.8/10.

i've been intending to write a review of this film for some time, but only now have i actually managed to get my thoughts down for the perusal of others.i never had the pleasure of seeing this film on the `big screen' which is a shame, as it is often visually stunning, but i have revisited it on video numerous times over the years, enjoying it immensely every time. it definitely is on my personal list of favorite movies, and for more than just starring kiefer sutherland and kevin bacon, two of my `actors to watch.'perhaps i appreciate this film so much because it appeals to my slightly off-kilter taste in entertainment. i like my movies a bit left of center - unpredictable and fresh. and whether or not you `believe' the story line of the film, you have to admit, it is different!everyone has different tastes and opinions, but my impression of some of the negative reviews of this movie is that the viewers never really saw past the surface level of this film. they got caught up in technicalities, `why would there be green lighting in a subway?' or `why would medical students pull such a stupid stunt?' and failed to see the artistry and psychological depth of the piece.yes, there are some medical and technical aspects that do not make logical sense, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief just a tad, this can be a very engaging film.first, a note about the artistic quality of the movie. some have complained about the murky lighting, and the illogical nature of the sets - but for me, the use of innovating lighting techniques, the plastic and sheet draped sets, the unusual settings in old buildings and dank, dripping tunnels, the use of statuary, rain and billowing curtains - all add a poetic flavor to this film, a haunting beauty that suits the dark nature of the questions being asked about life, death and forgiveness.i will focus on just two examples; in an alley scene, a change in lighting allows for certain elements of the set to come dramatically into focus, then to fade away once lighting returns to normal. it is an innovative means of conveying a shift in the `reality' of the moment, and works beautifully. we are also allowed to see the interior of the character's apartments - contrast the warm wood, bright colors, golden lighting and cluttered comfort of labraccio's rooms with the stark, white void of nelson's. both are reflective of the characters themselves. nelson's lack of `objects' reflect our lack of knowledge about his past. and his carefully constructed mask that keeps his companions at a distance. his past, we come to learn, is one of chaos and conflict. he has determined to leave that behind in favor of an uncluttered emptiness. unfortunately, the emptiness is also reflective of his relationships with others, a realization he comes to along his personal journey of self-discovery in this film.flatliners is not your typical horror film. nor is a typical drama or suspense movie.it is rather more of an amalgamation of all, having the best elements of all genres intertwined in a complex, suspenseful plot.this is an ensemble piece, and the cast does an excellent job of breathing life into their individual characters. your immediate impression is that the characters are each representative of a well-established `stereotype': the female ice queen, the slightly neurotic 'physician', the playboy and the socially conscious `nice guy' etc. however, as the film progresses and the characters are further fleshed out, they take on multiple dimensions and depth.most interesting of all is sutherland's character of nelson. nelson is not a character that is easy to like - indeed he is a bit of a b**tard, a master manipulator who definitely places self-interest above all else. yet, sutherland plays him with a hint of insecurity that lends him a certain appeal. as events unfold, you come to realize that much of nelson's unpleasant personality is a smokescreen, a protective mask behind which hides a very uncertain and vulnerable young man burdened by a terrible secret.by revealing bits and pieces of nelson's complex personality throughout the film, the writers, directors and cast gradually lead you towards a greater understanding of and sympathy for him. the character who started out as a `jerk' becomes important and valued in his own right - as you learn to `forgive' his previous behavior in light of new information. your journey of discovery with nelson reflects the characters own journeys towards self-understanding, as they too come to realize that everyone has value, and `everything we do matters.'which leads to my final comment. although many of the posters here have picked up upon the theme of defying death.. few seem to have touched upon what i see as the main premise of the movie - the importance of forgiveness, and the need to be cognizant of all you do, because it does `matter.'

this show is sheer entertainment and doesn't try to be a greek drama. it certainly contains elements of one what with all the plot twists, but it's immensely engaging and fun. las vegas is the perfect setting for a show and they will certainly never have a lack of material to work with! anything and everything does happen there! the actors in this show are extremely personable and you really do want to see what they are up to and into each week. the show is also very funny. the humor arises from the characters and situations. not just thrown in gratuitously. it's a well-crafted show in that regard. it certainly makes me look forward to friday nights and i'm glad i now own the first two seasons on dvd!

i don't usually comment on films or tv shows but had to post a comment about las vegas.naturally here in the uk we are about 2/3rd's through the 3rd season and though i have managed to watch the last series of season 3 ( via other means ) i'm still glued every friday at 9pm.from the very first episode of season 1 i have been a big big fan of this show and own all 3 seasons on dvd, yes i cannot wait for season 4 to start in october.so why do i love this show so much, well i have to agree with the last poster.... james caan, i know one person cannot make a team but big ed deline was made for caan or maybe it was the other way around, i read that the producers were considering martin sheen for ed deline.... do'h no way!!! i also agree that caan's character is getting very soft, i also preferred the tough take no sh*t big bad eddy d that we saw in season 1 & 2, he seems to have mellowed out.as i said no one person makes the team by themselves's and of course the other cast members josh duhamel/danny, james lesure/mike, vanessa marcil/sam, nikki cox/mary, molly sims/delinda all contribute well, even outside cast members such as cheryl ladd as jillian deline, harry groener as gunther, dean caine as casey, mitchell longley as mitch who may feature 6 or 7 times during a season can fit in just as well as if they've been in every single episode from day one.this show has everything, drama, action, suspense, laughs, romance, glitz's, glamour and big time celebrity's who often play themselves's.many may disagree but this is one of the best shows on digital tv and i hope it may long continue after season 4.

when i was a child this was the movie i watched. i think it is a great movie for the kids to watch and parents don't have to be afraid of any violence or obscene images. rainbow brite is a cheerful young girl and she is trying to make the winter go away. she finds that something or someone is trying to steal the source of life and keep it for themselves. i love this movie and i think that even adults can enjoy this movie.

i first saw this movie when i was very little. i was born in 1985, so it was around the age when 80s cartoons were big. my mother taped it one day thinking i might like it. i had never even heard of the rainbow bright tv show before i was introduced to the movie. when i saw it (on one of those old beta tapes...) i loved it. i became addicted to it. there are people who say it's badly written and all that, but it's a kid's movie, and things like that don't matter much to children. i loved the story, and especially liked the songs and all the female characters. of course i pretended to be them, and in the scene where rainbow first met krys and they were repulsed they had to work with the opposite sex, i could totally relate. the story was the basic good vs. evil that children enjoy, and there were enough happy moments to balance out the scary ones. the world is a fantastic place that would stimulate the imagination of any young child. i am very glad i had an opportunity to see this movie when i was little. it made a big impact, and watching it now brings back happy memories of childhood. i would recommend to any parent with young children to rent this movie. it will trigger their imagination and provide plenty of entertainment. you're only a child once, so don't let them miss out on this one!

after watching "a texas tale of treason" you feel a renewed disgust for the nature of the hollywood beast. inside the interviews and conversations of all involved with the project there is a common sense of comradery and rebelliousness that spans backgrounds, social classifications, and even geography. this can be attributed to hard work on the entire production's undying commitment to the project and the love the of the story from the original film, and the complete creation of vacuum that is it's creator. the scale of people involved in "waldo's hawaiian holiday" was amazing to me, at a no budget, no glory production. there were no trailers or craft services, no amenities at all, and yet everyone involved stuck right there with it. if nothing ever comes of this project, antstuie productions have laid their foundation for being a serious, honest company that's never going to lay down and take it or sell out and make a movie just for the money. i'd like to see any l.a. director go through the guerrilla process to get a shot. more realistic true to life cinema is lacking in this time of cg and green screens. the masses may enjoy their entertainment spoon fed to them in nice bite sized censored calm bits, but there is a large group of people out here in the world that share the opinions and insights of the filmmakers that still make films for the love of the material or love of storytelling, not dvd sales or box office. i loved this documentary, and i hope that ifc has the cahones to pick it up and air it so that maybe, just maybe, one more person will decide to pick up a camera and film some real life so we the viewer can have even a temporary understanding that everyone everywhere is the same, and anyone anywhere can be a true storyteller.

this film would be particularly fun for anyone who has been in the film industry, especially in any indie capacity... those whose inheritance includes a film introduction may not appreciate it quite as much. i am hard to please in the documentary category. this doc is different though- its pleasure comes from an earthy realism of indie filmmaker punks who are a hoot to be around and watch. whether you've ever wondered what it is like to be in films, in front of or behind the camera, or whether you have worked your way through the sometimes painful and hard but rewarding indie world, you'll certainly get a kick out of this film.

watch this movie. it's truly a good ride through the difficulties of making a indie movie, and what happens when it blows up in the film maker's face. there's a lot of stuff about punk rock, and the philosophy behind that movement and it's relationship to this project. so if you're into old punk, american punk, you'll dig it.... but, beware, there's a ton of bad acting bits from the failed project that are incorporated... yet they do come off funny at times. and, actually, some of the best parts are listening to people who have never been involved in movie making pontificate and what they went through in the three year period that it took to put this together. so anyone out there that's about to make a film, especially if you haven't been to film school or worked in the field, you should watch this and learn from the film maker's mistakes.

after seeing a texas tale of treason, the measly correspondence efforts by cox could not even afford the massive collusion stu directed with no budget. it tells a story about dedication, sweat, whiz, fire and punk rock. i love it! my favorite parts are the interviews with marci (she's such a hot baby babe and she digs me but she just doesn't know it yet). the japanese clerk muffing his lines, that cracked me up. the sex scene was really cool. i am going to see if stu will come over sometime and do the box light wave thing when i'm doing it with my woman. the intro and of course my 5 seconds during closing credits. i know thats going to get me some chicks. i hope to see more from antstuie because i know i can expect the unexpected.

a very funny look at some of australia's current affairs and political goings-on. the chaser boys really seem to have fun with this show, and what i enjoy is that they all have their strengths; some are brilliant (chas) at making complete idiots of themselves, whereas julian can pull off the whole "i'm interviewing a famous politician and i'm about to suggest that he disguise himself as a pot of jam" type of humour.they have great segments in the show taking the mick out of all sorts of aspects of australian culture such as our current affairs shows, our adverts and early morning tv programmes. some material is a bit tired and predictable, but overall it's a lot of fun to watch, and will leave you with a smile on your face.

everyone is a genius in something. albert einstien was a genius in science, william shakespeare was a genius in literature and the boys from the chasers war on everything are truly comedy geniuses. their satire tv show is a constant hit on the australian broadcast commission ( abc ). after a small start as a satire newspaper, the chasers popularity skyrocketed when given their own television show. never short on controversy with the cast members will do everything some of it even being arrested for. chris taylor going on sunrise, a very popular live morning television show and telling his partner to f***k off, creating a fake motorcade and driving into apec high security area and doing a very funny satire of a australian ad about nicotine by following smokers around yelling out "no gary no no gary no". while controversial the show is increably funny and worthy of running for years to come.

this show is non stop hilarity. the first joke will make u wet your pants. and thats probably the weakest joke of them all. i started watching it when the second half of season 2 started airing. and straight away. i'm hooked. only 2 weeks after i started watching. i've downloaded episodes and bought the dvd's. reoccurring clips such as "the ad road test" and "current affairs" are quiet hilarious. then there's the ad's they take off "use emo. use your own tears for more effective use" also funny in the politics side of things. nothing is wrong with them doing this. it's funny. any australians who don't find this funny. don't complain and don't watch it. all australian tune in wednesday at 9 on abc

when you think of brilliant australian comedy you don't think of skit shows (although i'm quite partial to a bit of 80's and 90's full frontal) or even sitcoms - you think of satire! something that we australians really know how to do well. (eg: front line, the micallef program) we know how to take the pi$$, and the chaser's war on everything, is a classic example of how to do it, and how to do it really well. i've been a huge fan of chris taylor and craig reucassel for a long time. i remember listening to them on triple j's afternoon show. they were, and remain, two of the funniest comedians around.although i was sad when they left triple j, i was excited to find out what they were investing so much time in that made them have to leave. (they were doing cnnnn and triple j at the same time, so i figured this was something much bigger) and what an amazingly hilarious show chaser is. biting political and social satire at it's best.i'm also pleased to say that it has recently received a much better time slot than friday nights and has been moved to wednesday nights right after spicks and specks. thank you abc!! finally i don't have to tape it! :)

sherlock holmes (basil rathbone) and professor moriarty (lionel atwill) engage in a battle of wits for control of a switz inventor's newest bomb-sight creation. holmes wants to safeguard it for the british while moriarty isn't above selling out to the nazis. while no doubt many fans will be disappointed to see holmes updated to the 1940s war-time setting, this particular film proves light-hearted fun which doesn't wallow in wartime propaganda as it might well have done. dennis hoey's inspector lestrade and nigel bruce's dr. watson do tend to steal the show as their characters bumbling methods consistently provide delightful comic relief. the sparring between holmes and moriraty is colorful and well thought out to boot. atwill does well enough as moriarty even if he's not as memorable as some others who played the role. while this provides nothing especially new or thrilling for fans of the series, it is a wonderful escape from reality, somewhat appropriate for 1942 in my opinion, that mirrors many movie serial adventures of the 1930s and 1940s but boasts a more compact, less repetitive plot. and all this is done while still remaining true to the basic spirit of sherlock holmes.

for the sake of propaganda during world war ii, sherlock holmes was moved into the then-present. one of the results is "sherlock holmes and the secret weapon," starring a top holmes, basil rathbone, along with nigel bruce, lionel atwill, dennis hoey and kaaren verne. it is holmes' assignment to deliver a scientist, dr. franz tobel (william post jr.) and his weapon design to the british government before the germans can get him. once the man reaches england, however, his troubles are just beginning. can holmes decode the message dr. tobel left before falling into the hands of the vicious moriarity, save the weapon and possibly the scientist too? this is an effective holmes story, set in the atmosphere of switzerland and blackout england. the series worked just fine in the present day. it was not without its problems, but those problems had nothing to do with the time period. whose idea was it to make watson an idiot? nigel bruce's characterization - aided and abetted by the scripts - has always been the false note. i much prefer the characterization of edward hardwicke in the jeremy brett sherlock holmes series - there, he's attractive, intelligent and a believable companion for holmes. in the rathbone series, holmes is often condescending and treats watson like the bumbling fool that he is. however, in this particular film, watson has a chance to be quite helpful in several parts.i admit to being a complete sap for rathbone's recitation from richard ii - "...this blessed plot, this earth, this england" - i can't imagine how much it meant to the brits watching the film in 1942. sherlock holmes really served his purpose.

in the universal series of modern sherlock holmes stories with basil rathbone and nigel bruce, sherlock holmes and the secret weopon is not one of the top films - although it is entertaining. i think the problem with it is that much of the film's "dueling" between holmes and his nemesis moriarty (here played by lionel atwill) seems to delay the actual point of the professor's work.moriarty appears in three of the holmes films with rathbone. in the adventures of sherlock holmes he was played by george zucco, who gave real relish to the love of villainy for its own sake to the role. for my money zucco's performance as the professor was the best of the three (there is even a brief moment of comedy in his performance, when he's disguised as the "sergeant of police" towards the end - like he's preparing to sing "a policeman's lot" from gilbert & sullivan). next comes mr. atwill's performance here - more of that later. finally there is henry daniell's intellectual moriarty in sherlock holmes and the lady in green. it's a typically cool, classy performance by mr. daniell, but his confrontations with holmes seem to be a tedious bore to him. they keep him from completing the main plan. in the stories that the professor pops up in, he really senses holmes is a nemesis who will remain a danger as long as he is alive. yet, because of the intellectual tennis match between him and rathbone, rathbone (in his autobiography) actually felt daniell was the best of the film moriartys.if zucco captured the love of evil in the professor, and daniell seemed to demonstrate the tired oxford don (in the stories the professor is a well regarded mathematician, whose volume on the binomial theorem had a "european vogue", and who wrote an intriguing book, the dynamics of the asteroid), atwill demonstrates the professor as pragmatic businessman. first of all, he's sold his services (apparently) to nazi germany. this is never gone into, but one presumes (as this is before the nazis began to really collapse) he figures they will win the war. secondly, he is not a fool. when dr. tobel (william post jr.) has shown he is a state of near physical collapse due to the torturing of moriarty's gang, the professor decides to kidnap one of the other scientists who are assisting tobel, because he's as good a scientist as tobel and would be able to put together the bomb site. i somehow can't quite see zucco making such a sensible decision on the spot, and if daniell had to make it, he would seem annoyed that there is yet another delay to his plans.by the way, one trick used in all the holmes series regarding the professor is how to rid the film of him. if you read the holmes stories, moriarty appears as the villain three times: in the memoirs of sherlock holmes' last story ("the adventure of the final problem"), in the return of sherlock holmes' first story ("the adventure of the empty house") and the last of the four novels/novellas (the valley of fear). it's amazing how much mileage the professor got out of so few appearances (he is mentioned in two or three other stories as well - in passing). but because of his fate at the reichenbach falls in "the final problem" and "the empty house", we always see him fall to his death. zucco falls off the white tower on tower hill. daniell (with more imagination) tries to flee gregson and the police, but is shot as he jumps, and wounded fails to hold on to the wall of an adjacent building. atwill (here it is not seen, but heard) seems to fall down a trap door he's planted in an escape tunnel). it is really tedious after awhile to see the professor always fall in these films. one turns to the gene wilder comedy (admittedly a comedy) sherlock holmes' smarter brother, wherein leo mckern is a wonderfully wacky and villainous moriarty (complete, finally, with an irish accent), who is not killed at the end, but just left mulling - in a rowboat - over how his careful schemes did not work out. i rather liked that better.the use of the "dancing men" code here, like the use of the "devil's foot root" in dressed to kill, snags a part of a mystery from a short story. "the adventure of the dancing men" appeared in the return of sherlock holmes, and deals with a client of holmes whose wife has been getting weird, blood-curdling messages in this code. charles higham, in his biography the adventures of conan doyle suggests sir arthur may have picked up the code from a magazine game in the 1870s, but we really don't know. the code is basically one of letter substitutions for the figures of the dancing men. the story in the short story is dramatic, but deals with a triangle. the only innovation in the film is that tobel makes a slight change that confuses both holmes and moriarty. the film will entertain, but i still think the house of fear, the scarlet claw, and sherlock holmes faces death are better films.

dr. franz tobel, a swiss scientist, is smuggled out of his home country by sherlock holmes in order that the nazi agents spying him do not get his invention of a new bomb sight. arriving in london, he takes residence with holmes and watson, but goes out for a visit with his girlfriend, charlotte eberli, where he leaves a clue for holmes as to the locations of his bomb sight, which he has divided into four pieces, but holmes' eternal nemesis, professor moriarity, is also seeking the bomb sight to sell to the nazis, and abducts dr. tobel and the clue left at charlotte's, a code series of dancing men, which both holmes and moriarity are both unable to decipher completely. holmes eventually discovers the clue to the code and get the location of the fourth piece of the bomb sight, but moriarity has the other three and a showdown is inevitable. very good entry in the holmes series with plenty of mystery and guesswork to go about. atwill's portrayal of moriarity is more sadistic than the cunning sort described in the doyle stories (or george zucco's performance in the adventures of sherlock holmes), but atwill's skills as an actor makes his moriarity quite the benevolent fellow. the script and direction both make this entry more of a cat and mouse game between the two characters and that is one of the reasons this entry succeeds so well. great job on the cinematography as well. rating, 8.

not too bad entry in the series, heavily ladled with war propaganda, but rathbone & bruce's sincerity keep me happy.it's a rather fantastic story from start to finish, just how many mcguffin's are there? holmes (and moriarty independently) reeling out the dancing men code uncoded so fast was amazing watson - so why weren't you amazed! the post explaining the bomb-sight/enlarger tickled me, it was just the kind of cheap trick universal would play - once again reminding me that they didn't expect people to be critically watching this over 60 years later. this (and i think every other potboiler from universal at this period) were meant to be viewed the once or twice and forgotten. they perhaps should have realised that basically people don't change, that what was entertaining to ordinary people in 1942 would still entertain a select group now (2005) and tightened up on the script and sets!lionel atwill was going through his hollywood rape court case at about this time, i wonder if it was that or particularly effective make-up that made him look so haggard as moriarty?the important thing about sw though is that this was the first holmes film roy william neill directed, i think he directed all of the rest and produced all but one, thus establishing a marvellous ambient continuity.

this jingoist outing concerns the usual battle holmes vs. moriaty,but this time in an effort to save the british war against the nazis.sherlock holmes(rathbone) and watson(bruce),the detecting duo living in 223 baker street,again are up against their old enemy dr. moriarty(lionel atwill).the film starts in switzerland where holmes saves from the nazis to an inventor of a bomb-sight,named dr. tobel(post).back in london,tobel hand over four parts of the device to diverse scientist.but doctor tobel is kidnapped by moriarty.sherlock must to solve his disappearance and some vitally important.holmes only holds a clue left his girlfriend(kareen verne),the detective with an extraordinary mechanism get decode it.but dead body scientific are accumulating but have appeared murdered and moriarty knows the keys ,as well.holmes disguised as sailor goes out to investigate ,finding the moriarty's shelter .the picture is based on¨ the dancing men¨by arthur conan doyle.this is a rathbone-bruce effort for the wwii along with ¨the voice of terror¨ in which we are asked to believe the magnificent detective could have lived in this century. both stories are completely patriotic and flag-waging movies.in fact,on the end there's an advertising buying of war bonds with evident propaganda.the movie is an excellent holmes thriller with gripping wartime setting and unanswered mysteries and unstopped suspense.in the film appear the habituals from holmes series.his nemesis moriarty,,mistress hudson,inspector lestrade( a funny dennis hoey) and of course the bumbling dr. watson.basil rathbone performance is splendid ,he's the best cinema's holmes similar to television's peter cushing and jeremy brett.rathbone as whimsical sleuth is top notch,he's in cracking form,intelligent,broody and impetuous.he's finely matched in battle of wits with moriarty,his arch-enemy,a first range villain: lionel atwill.nigel bruce plays watson with humor,jinx,goofy and mirth.he's the perfect counterpoint of holmes.besides appear briefly distinguished secondaries as paul fix and whit bissell.this classic gets an atmospheric black and white cinematography but available colorized in a horrible version.adequate music score fitting to suspense by frank skinner.the motion picture is professionally r. william o'neal,the usual saga director and habitual in the monsters movies universal.

sir arthur conan doyle wrote a fair number of sherlock holmes accounts but the popularity of the famous detective insured that sequels in both print and on film would extend far beyond the author's works.in "sherlock holmes and the secret weapon," holmes, basil rathbone, patriotically serves british intelligence in order to secure a swiss scientist's desperately needed bombsight. the film is from 1942 and i wonder if the producers and writers realized how vital bombsight secrets were (the american norden bombsight was guarded almost as zealously as the new radar sets that would change the course of world war ii).holmes and his faithful but expectedly bumbling companion, dr. watson, nigel bruce, battle dr. moriarty, lionel atwill. as evil as moriarty has always been it's a bit of a shock to see he's signed up with hitler. has the man no vestige of decency? i guess not. but atwill is deliciously evil.the story is reasonably fast-paced as holmes and watson seek to recover stolen bombsight components before they can be delivered to a u-boat. rathbone is his usual suave self and several holmsian disguises are well carried out.this and other 1940s holmes stories are now available on dvd and oldies.com has put out a very nice four-disc set in a wooden box: this film is included along with a bonus cd of an interview with the aged doyle. the set retails for about $26 in major dvd and cd stores but i found this and other sets from oldies.com at a warehouse club for $14.98. the transfers are very good.very nice and relaxing late night viewing.7/10.

the evil professor moriarty plots to gain control of both sherlock holmes and the secret weapon which could win the war for the nazis.basil rathbone & nigel bruce return to the screen as sir arthur conan doyle's beloved detective and sidekick, sherlock holmes & dr. watson, in this entertaining little mystery. universal studios wasted no money on either fancy production values or a sensible script, knowing that its two stars would be all the attraction an audience would need. indeed rathbone, as the cerebral ego, and bruce, as the bumbling id, seem to actually become the characters they are creating, gleefully keeping their faces straight while engaged in the most utter nonsense.dennis hoey makes his first appearance as the dogged inspector lestrade of scotland yard; teamed with bruce, these two good-hearted but pedantic fellows actually get to save the intellectually superior holmes' life twice. lionel atwill, a master of the sinister who deserves more recognition for his talent, does a fine job as moriarty, making the wicked rascal a foe worthy of holmes' steel, relishing the scenes in which he gets to inflict torture & pain.william post jr. and kaaren verne play the swiss scientist and his girlfriend who are at the heart of the mystery, but they're not given much to do. sweet mary gordon makes a token appearance as holmes' landlady mrs. hudson.rathbone spices up his already classic interpretation of holmes by getting to appear in disguise three times during the story, thereby revealing to the viewer that the great sleuth was a bit of a ham actor at heart.this film--which is based very loosely on elements in sir arthur's short stories 'the dancing men' and 'the empty house'--followed sherlock holmes and the voice of terror (1942) and preceded sherlock holmes in washington (1943).

sherlock holmes (basil rathbone) and dr. watson (nigel bruce) have been hired by the british government to protect a swiss scientist dr. franz tobel (william post jr.). he has a bomb that the british want to win the war. unfortunately the evil dr. moriarty (lionel atwill) is working with the nazis and will stop at nothing to get the doctor--and his invention.moving sherlock holmes to the 1940s sounded like a stupid idea but it does work for one reason--basil rathbone. arguably he is the best sherlock holmes ever put on the screen. he plays the character so well (and accurately) that it doesn't matter what era he's solving crimes. as for nigel bruce as watson...everybody has problems with it. he plays watson as a bumbling old fool...that is not the watson of the books. you seriously wonder why holmes puts up with him. still, he does grow on you (in a way). then there's atwill having a whale of a time playing moriarty--the discussions and battle of wits between him and holmes are just great! i've never liked dennis hoey as inspector lestrade--he's such an idiot. makes watson look like a genius. and post jr. is pretty good as tobel (even though his accent amusingly keeps changing!).this movie is done elaborately and runs only a little over an hour. still, it does have it's slow spots and i never understood the secret code section.still, worth catching if just for rathbone and atwill.

sherlock holmes (basil rathbone) begins this story in disguise, helping to smuggle famous physicist "dr. franz tobel" (william post) out of switzeralnad and under the watchful eye of the nazis, who want his bomb sight plans. the allies obviously want it, too, and sherlock is there to help. dr. tobel has invented an instrument which greatly aids in the accuracy of aerial bombardment. holmes and dr. tobel arrive safely back at baker street but the scientist would rather be alone, for some mysterious reason, although he had promised the english to help them, not the germans. he stays true to that promise but there are some desperate moments for holmes and the english along the way.it's an entertaining film and one in which our famous detective uses not one but three different disguises. he needs all the help he can get when he goes up against his arch-rival, "professor moriarity." one complaint: if moriarity was that evil, he would have dispensed with holmes without batting an eyelash, instead of giving him openings to escape. it's pretty sad, too, when the usual dim-witted dr. watson (nigel bruce) has to rescue his boss from certain death a couple of times!yes, there are some credibility issues in this story but if you can put your brain on hold a few times, it's a fun film to watch....and it looks beautiful, thanks to the great restoration job done on this dvd. it makes the old print come alive with some wonderful visuals, particularly the night-time shots.one other note: whoever did the english subtitles in here misspelled or misinterpreted at least a half dozen words. it's very sloppy work, and not the first time i've encountered this watching the entire series on the restored dvd set.

do you like explosions? how about fighting? well, this movie has both of those. you know the other thing you can't have a movie without: a kick ass motorcycle, the type that bounces off someone's head and knocks them out at the same time. you bet the stabilizer has one. there's even a classic cliff scene.all in all, i'm quite proud that i have even seen this movie...and even prouder to have my review be the first one...yes!

i would like to start by saying i can only hope that the makers of this movie and it's sister film the intruder (directed by the great unheralded stylist auteur that is jopi burnama) know in their hearts just how much pleasure they have brought to me and my friends in the sleepy north eastern town of jarrow.from the opening pre credit sequence which manages to drag ever so slightly despite containing a man crashing through a window on a motorbike, the pitiless destruction of a silence lab, the introduction of one of the most simultaneously annoying and anaemic bad guys in movie history and costume design that jean paul gautier would find ott and garish. make no mistake; this is a truly unique experience. early highlight - an explosion (get used to it, plenty more where that came from!) followed by a close up of our chubby heroine and the most hilarious line reading of the word "dad" in living memory. and then... the theme song...yeah, this deserves its own paragraph. sung by aj, written by people who really should wish to remain anonymous, it makes the songs written for the rocky films sound like schubert. this is crap 80's hero motivation narcissism at an all time high, with choice lyrics such as "its only me and you, its come down to the wire" and much talk of having to "cross the line" (it'll make sense in time - our hero cares little for the boundaries of bona fida police work) abounding. not to mention the indonesian supremes cooing the film's title seductively. at this point anyone wishing to switch off officially has no pulse.our hero is semitic cop peter goldson (essayed brilliantly by intruder star peter o'brien), the "stabilizer" of the title. the man's bull in a china shop approach to crime fighting and particularly his less than inconspicuous undercover work truly leaves much to be desired, but he is without question an entertaining guide through the mean streets of downtown jakarta, with local sleaze ball connection captain johnny in tow, as well as peter's own waste of space partner in fashion crime sylvia nash, who does little. so many highlights, so little time - the "slide please" arrogance of peter's not all too convincingly argued case against chief baddie greg rainmaker (intruder fans will know hirsute slimy bastard craig gavin as the monstrous john white - helluva name eh? no! oh well...), the x marks the spot location map stupidity, our hero taking horrible advantage of heroine tina probost during a moment of weakness on her behalf, the latter turning up at a sting operation dressed like a member of a particularly flamboyant dancing troop. and believe me that barely covers it.there wasn't even time to go into the plot revolving around the hunt for a drug detection system and a kidnapped professor with an alarming but commendable amount of national pride. or our hero turning up at a funeral dressed as if an extra on boogie nights. or the absolutely hysterical craic between captain johnny and goldson - two guys have never made more heavy weather of buddy buddy shtick than these clowns. the trowel was possibly too subtle me thinks.ah it tails off people, and you never thought scenes of wanton destruction and general mayhem could be so unbelievably boring, but the character interaction is stupendous, the dialogue truly priceless and the incompetence on show somehow endearing. oh and the shoes people - watch out for the shoes!

what's the most violent movie of all time? rambo iii? commando? robocop? add these three very violent together, and you still won't equal the carnage in the stabilizer, the wildest, silliest, craziest action movie i have ever seen. for one hundred minutes things blow up and people die in dozens of strange ways. it will make you laugh and cheer, and when it's all over you'll be more than a little exhausted. this movie is a buried gem, a cult classic sadly lacking a cult.the stabilizer is the nickname of our hero peter goldson (peter o'brian), a large oily man with a curly mullet. he arrives in indonesia on the trail of the villainous and mean greg rainmaker. we know he is evil because he is only referred to by his full name ("i hate scum like greg rainmaker!") and utilizes a method of killing that is so horrible i can't even utter it here. wait, yes i can. he steps on people in spiky shoes. greg rainmaker: cleat killer.when greg rainmaker isn't pouring alcohol on women for their sexual pleasure, he's kidnapping important professors and heading a huge underworld empire. it's up to goldson (a jewish action hero? gevalt!) and his motley crew of sidekicks to stabilize the situation by killing everyone and blowing lots of stuff up. maybe "stabilize" has a different meaning in indonesia.and the violence, oh the violence. this is a film unwilling, nay, uncapable, of letting five minutes of screen time go by without some sort of explosion, knifing, car crash, or squib interrupting the dialogue. the violence is extreme; not graphic and bloody, just really weird. for example, the stabilizer & company invade one of rainmaker's warehouses (by driving through a solid concrete wall on a motorcycle, of course). when perched on the balcony, with heavy fire coming from below, the stabilizer does the one thing he can do. he drives off the balcony into the guy's head, his front tire bouncing off it like a basketball. astounding.from the overly-gratuitous love scenes (both major female characters hop in the sack with the hero of their choice not two minutes after they speak to them alone for the first time) to the poorly dubbed dialogue ("victor, you talented bastard!") the stabilizer has it all. this is a film for the ages, right up there with citizen kane and gymkata. it is not widely available in release. if you find it anywhere for any price, buy it and relish the insanity.

rose and the good doctor find themselves in a space station that is on a planet that's quite impossibly hovering in orbit right below a black hole. the crew of the station is just as perplexed at that as the two new inhabitants are. suitably spooky in it's atmosphere and gets better as the doctor and rose find themselves stranded due to circumstances out of their control and speaking through the submissive alien race of the ood, something quite dark is coming from below the crust of the planet. not haven seen the second part of this two-parter i can't vouch that the end is as strong yet. but it does make for one hell of a beginning.my grade: a

oooooh man was i pleased i didn't miss this. i wanted to post this review as this episode in particular does what a certain recent movie did not. it pays true homage to the game doom. its plot is different yes, and the characters are obviously set in an entirely different universe (obviously the doctor who universe) however the feel, the pace, the references and the location are perfect. and for all original doom fans listen out for the door opening and closing sound effect, it was the icing on the cake for me.please all doctor who and doom fans alike, check this one out. its a gem!

if you want to really terrify people, choose the devil as your subject. after all, a good deal of the population believe that he is real. therefore you are plugging into a whole meaty swathe of pre-existing religious and mythological imagery. and bound to cause quite a few nightmares in your young audience.this episode had all the appearance of a hollywood blockbuster. in fact, having finished watching it i flicked over to another channel which was playing a recent bond film and quite frankly couldn't split a hair between the differences in sfx. with a minimal cast, restricted by its situation on a space station; complete with overwhelming panoramic views of an imploding universe, it was as claustrophobic and intense as alien or event horison. the black hole outside made it feel as if the black hole's weight of dark matter was pressing the station onto the planet and to whatever was sealed inside. and as the horror is intensified by the knowledge that the dr and rose are stranded, the sinister ood start channelling a disembodied voice and then the characters start being picked off one by one...this has all the best qualities of the cream of this new dr who endeavour; girl in the fireplace and the empty child. emotionally engaging, frightening and humorous all without seeming cheesy. this is far scarier than any amount of flying daleks. but it has to be asked, is this really suitable viewing for children? this is not a family friendly episode. pity the poor parent who has to put their kids to bed after this one. i'm not sure i even want to see what happens next!

even an old cynical doctor who fan like myself can be left breathless by watching an episode of my favourite show . it happened previously during eccleston's finale and it happened watching this episode . it doesn't happen often though but the impossible planet is an example of both the show and of television at its very , very best . this is stunning television the doctor and his companion land in a mysterious place where they see strange writing on the wall and the audience ( many of who will be moving behind the sofa ) are instantly transfixed . a door opens and horrible monsters start stalking the time travellers . this might have taken up an entire 25 minute episode in the original show but all this takes place in he pre title sequence . you may miss the longer drawn out format of the original show but at least this new series is tightly plotted and if we're treated to a disappointing story then at least it's usually only for one week there is nothing to disappointment a viewer here . it is doctor who at its most traditional best . writer matt jones and director james strong have gone out of their way to make a story that will be regarded for years to come . they do this by constructing a doom laden narrative . the doctor and rose lose the tardis and they're stuck with the protagonists in the far flung future . it's interesting how many stories never feature this type of plot point where the doctor and his companions no longer have access to the tardis which makes for a more intriguing type of story . without doubt the highlight is the scene where scooti goes to look for toby only to find him standing on the surface of the planet where he turns and beckons her outside . everything from acting , make up and murray gold's music makes this a scene that genuinely shocks its audience i can imagine immediately after this episode the bbc switchboards received a tsunami of complaints for distressed parents saying how traumatised their children were . that it took them several hours to get them from behind the family sofa and that they're now refusing to sleep with the lights out . to do this complaining would be to deny the magic of doctor who . yes it can terrify and yes such images will burn themselves in to the mind of a child , something they will never forget even if hey live to be a hundred . but i will bet my life that these same " traumatised " children would have spent the week begging that no matter what they'll be allowed to watch the next episode

this has got to be one of the best episodes of doctor who that i've seen since it came back last year. there is a brilliant mix of amusement, fear and tenderness all mixed up which equals one amazing episode. the ood were brilliantly designed and i'm pretty sure there' going to be a lot of ood jokes in the next few weeks. i myself am guilty of that already.i particularly liked the way that we saw a different perspective of rose's and the doctor's relationship and the ending;well, it's the first time i have ever hidden behind a cushion! i cannot wait until next weeks episode to find how they get out of this mess.

i loved this movie so much. i'm a big fan of amanda bynes's recently ended show. i admire her(besides her body) for her acting capability. she is a good actress.the movie was great. its about a girl named viola who wants to play soccer, but when her school cuts the girls soccer team she gets upset. her brother is set to go to a prestigious school and he decides to leave to england. so viola wants to make an impression by playing on the soccer team at the boarding school. she goes to the school and tries out for the soccer team. she gets in. meanwhile she meets duke who is a sensitive guy who plays on the soccer team. he really likes olivia (laura ramsey) who likes sebastian-who is really viola. sebastian is dating monique and suspects that sebastian isn't being himself.this is certainly not a chick flick and i enjoyed it a lot. its so funny and lovable. i don't think i have seen amanda act better.

okay, so i don't understand why people are getting so aggravated over this movie. so i thought it was going to be the usual amanda bynes movie, but it wasn't. it was great.okay, okay, so the acting wasn't the best, but i thought the performances were still overall great. also, you could tell that the actors were having fun while doing this movie. in other movies, that have surprisingly won awards, where the actors didn't like working on the film, you could tell. all of the actors had chemistry, and that also showed.a ton of people are ripping on the soccer skills that the actors have. yah, so they're not perfect...get over it! they are actors, not soccer players. i have been playing soccer for my whole life, and trust me, it is hard to learn, so stop ripping on the level of skills they have.i thought this movie was going to be stupid, but it was really funny. the way amanda bynes and channing tatum can make a situation funny without even saying anything is funny. i found myself laughing a lot in this movie.overall..i love it!

she's the man was the funniest movie i have ever seen. i laughed so hard that i was crying. it was also very romantic. channing tatum is absolutely gorgeous and can really act. it sure doesn't hurt that he has quite a few shirtless scenes either. channing and amanda have amazing chemistry and were absolutely wonderful together. i love this movie. when you watch make sure to watch the last deleted scene. it was a huge mistake to cut that scene because it is one of the best scenes in the movie. i highly recommend this movie. amanda has never been funnier. and channing is going to be a huge star. this is just the first of many for this bright new star.

i think this movie is amazing but there is one problem. there is one song that i want to find but cannot find it. it starts on about 18 minutes just after the coach has said "what are u the runt of the family", and then looks at the fat kid takes his hat off then he says go, the song that starts there, i would like to know what it is? does any 1 no email me please or add a comment.it starts zaga zow, ziga zow something along those lines. i just think it is an amazing dance track i would love to have that song so that i could use it in my break dancing lessons. it starts when they are jumping and running over the orange fast stepper things which are used in football training to help you run faster

this is a classic american movie in combination with comedy, romance & dream. you may say:' there have been lots of these kind of films already. but just believe me, you'll find this a good one because it's well directed, scripted and played. amanda bynes's just crazily amazing! she's humor, cute & charming both inside & outside the screen. she's the man indeed!!! the message i get from it is to pursue your own fairy tale. what i mean by'fairy tale' is not the one with prince & princess, but indicates 'faith'. namely, it tells us to hold your faith, dream & things that make you regret for your whole life if you don't do that. one of those movies you can't miss out in your life.

well,i'm not a movie critic or something like that.but i have my opinion for this movie.i think that the best in this movie was amanda bynes,she played her roll for my look very well,i have watched many her movies,this i liked most!when you are watching this movie,you just can relax,come down,and watch it.you don't have to try to look for subtext or something like that.you just watch it. movie is really great. maybe i liked it for actress,maybe for all the scenery,but i liked it.the whole atmosphere that was created.in one moment i just felt like i was in that university,in that room.it is not another drama movie that is made to win oscar,it is just nice movie to watch in your free time.

this was a fantastically written screenplay when it comes to perceiving things from another perspective. the comedy was timely and not overdone, the acting was generally terrific, and the plot line served a greater purpose of generating misconception when we think about people solely based on their external appearance. the plot twists as the brother/sister character of amanda bynes tries to play soccer on the boys team finding instead a new love interest along the way. tatum channing is where the real misperception lies and he does a fine job of acting disinterested at first, later coming to realize the most important thing in life is friendship, not attitude.

i just rented this movie from the video store last night. it being new and not released long ago here, the rent was only overnight. me, my little sis, and my older brother who usually hates watching these kind of movies sat down and watched. once the movie started and after sitting there watching it for a while we were all laughing historically. even my brother. this movie is hilarious, i actually laughed. no matter how funny some movies are... even if i think its funny i sometimes can't seem to laugh. but this movie... i laughed. my brother ended up thinking it was the best "that type of movie" he had seen. i ended up watching the movie again about 2 or 3 hours later.

the movie was great and everything but, there were a lot of mistakes in the "soccer" scenes, i wonder if any of the guys who were working on the movie have ever seen a soccer match before..? first of all, i don't understand how she wanted to try for the boys team? in soccer boys and girls cant play in the same team and these are the fifa rules. and don't get me started on who when they found out that she was actually a girl they let her continue to play...!! second of all, players cant paint their faces with colours and play like that, again fifa rules not mine.and don't get me started on the way they scored goals its was ridiculous completely unrealistic. and all the players seemed like they didn't know jack about soccer.and when duke was training viola why did they only concentrate on shooting what happened to passing and dribbling. or was shooting her only problem?! and why the hell were all the posters on the wall in their room were for players from chelse ?! don't they like any other players from any other teams.? it was like this was the only team they know...! but other than that the movie was good and i enjoyed the rest of it, just the training and the game scenes were unrealistic for me. they really should have consulted some one a bout them...!

i thought that this movie was going to be totally lame based on the advertisements that i saw in theaters. when my sister borrowed from a friend i decided to watch it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do. . .needless to say ten minutes in the movie and i loved it. amanda was a great actor in the movie, her comedic timing was perfect. the guy who played duke was hot, plain and simple. my favorite scene was definitely when amanda walks by the gardener and a fellow student who is suspicious of her and she is talking to her mom about dresses--as she is pretending to be a guy! i re-watched this part over and over... to make a long story short, the movie i thought was going to be lame--i now own it.

if you haven't seen this movie than you need to. it rocks and you have to watch it. it is so funny and will make you laugh your guts out!! so you have to watch it and i saw it about a billion and a half times and still think it is funny. so you have to. yes i have memorized the whole movie and could quote it to you from start to finish. you must see this move. it is also cute because it is half a chick flick. if you don't watch it then you are really missing out.this movie even has cute guys in it and that is always a bonus. so in summary watch the movie now and trust me you will not be making a mistake. did i mention the music is good too. so you should like it if you enjoy music. this is a movie that they rated correctly and it will work for anyone.

when i saw the first preview for this, i nearly passed out from excitement. i have long been a fan of twelfth night- it turned me on to shakespeare, so to have a modern adaption is a dream come true. my anticipation was not disappointed.the plot basically follows the original storyline and that means: complicated! i don't want to even try to relate it, the plot summery will probably cover the basics. just imagine having a girl pretend to be a guy at a boarding school and think of all the possible situations that would create. i will not even pause to question the plausibility of such a plot; reality is not the point of the film.what it is, though, is absolutely hilarious. nearly every scene nails the comedic set-up. kudos to the writers, director and actors on that count.amanda bynes is the star of this film and she carries it wonderfully. she's super-cute, not a vixen and can do faultless comedy. i admire her so much for not going full-on tramp in her films or public life like so many starlets today do. i'm glad there is at least one decent young actress left in hollywood. ok, i'm off my soap-box...channing tatum, yeah he's hot and built like a flippin gorilla, but he really makes me laugh! my favourite scenes in the whole movie are when he's trying to converse with olivia first by talking about cheese and then later about his workout regimen.the rest of the cast did not fail to perform either, with marvelous additions to the characters in the forms of the inane débutante mother and monique, the classic evil girlfriend.overall, lots of fun, loooots of laughs, and a highly attractive cast. maybe not on par with the original, but it beats out modern versions of other plays, including the much-touted 10 things i hate about you.

gloria swanson (as leila porter) is an understandably bored wife. workaholic husband elliott dexter (as james denby porter) has "lost his romance" along with his waistline; he also smokes cigars in bed, eats onions, and snores. he can barely remember his own anniversary - which is attended by caddish lew cody (as schuyler van sutphen); the younger man eyes ms. swanson's voluptuous figure, and flirts unabashedly. soon, swanson is drawn to mr. cody. then, mr. dexter decides to try and get her back. who will win? the three principals are fine, with swanson most impressive in the pivotal role as the woman torn. julia faye grabs supporting honors as cody's other interest, "toodles"; off-screen, she tempted director cecil b. demille. the demille touch is evident; especially in an imaginary sequence wherein cody promises swanson...

don't change your husband is, on the one hand, the beginning of a series of lightweight marital comedies from cecil b. demille. on the other it is his first picture to star gloria swanson, probably the greatest actress of the silent era, and is the film which made her a star.although the old demille formula was beginning to change, and his films were becoming wordier and less purely visual, with such an expressive performer as swanson we regain much of that silent storytelling style. her character does very little, but conveys volumes through subtle gesture and facial expression  with a particular talent for looks of disdain. in real life swanson was herself coming towards the end of her disastrous marriage to wallace beery, and it's possible that this fact fuelled her convincing performance.as if to best complement his leading lady's talents, demille's use of framing and close-ups is particularly strong here. he uses cinematic technique to show off the acting  often holding swanson in lengthy close-ups at key moments  and also to clarify the story visually. for example, when we are introduced to the character of toodles, she is shown reflected three times in a dressing table mirror. her character disappears from the story, only to become important towards the end. that attention-grabbing first shot of her helps us remember who she was. later, at the anniversary dinner, swanson and future husband number two lew cody are framed together in one shot, while elliot dexter is isolated in his own frame. also  and this is a sign of the increasing sophistication of cinema in general  there is much use of reaction shots  for example the disapproving glance of the bishop when cody acts out his intentions with the wedding figure dolls.in contrast to demille's visual narrative method was the increasingly verbose screen writing of his collaborator jeanie macpherson. as i've remarked in several other comments, macpherson could put together a strong and dramatic story, but like demille she tended to state her themes in a somewhat pretentious and flamboyant style. and so we get these very long quasi-philosophical title cards about the pitfalls of married life which, if they improve the story at all, it is only because they are unintentionally funny. for example, only jeanie macpherson could come up with a line like "fate sometimes lurks in christmas shopping". fortunately though in this picture these titles mostly introduce scenes rather than break them up.although the pictures he made around this time tended to be small scale, it is at this point that demille seemed to develop his taste for the spectacular. you can see him start to sneak in excuses for a bit of razzmatazz like the little fantasy scenes of swanson being showered with "pleasure, wealth and love". it wouldn't be until the early twenties after the unofficial embargo on historical pictures was lifted that he would get the chance to go all out with the grand spectacle.all in all, don't change your husband is a fairly decent demille silent picture, although to be honest it is only really the presence gloria swanson that lifts it above the average. it's curious though that this is supposedly a comedy, and swanson was cast at least in part because of her background at mack sennett's slapstick factory. she hated comedy acting, and here gives a dramatic rather than a comic performance. it makes sense then that the only straight drama she did with demille, male and female, was by far the strongest of their collaborations.

no more corned beef and cabbage for her!this little romantic comedy clips along from scene to scene with a few exotic twists (some imaginary scenes and a costume party). all of this is centered around the wife of the husband(s) who is looking to break out of the doldrums, played by gloria swanson (she is twenty here!). both the leading men have a natural air that is convincing and of course swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods, from frivolous to worried to hopeful. behind all the games and apparent lightheartedness is that old serious problem of staying in love and not straying in love. there's a little corniness, but director demille is on top of keeping it snappy and believable in all. as with many films from this period, the subtitles do not just tell what they are saying (or thinking) but often give a kind of philosophical insight, as if to justify the tragedy (or raciness). and there is that higher purpose here, probably better without the instructional text, but it's part of the narrative style, and it's kind of quaint. if you are looking for visual or formal amazement, you won't find it here. but as a story, well acted, and filmed with precision and economy, it's really a great example. the events might not come as a total surprise, but it's such a modern love story, set almost a hundred years ago, it's a gas. and did i saw swanson was perfect?

cecil b. demille directed a series of domestic comedy-dramas in the late teens and early 20s. he found his perfect leading lady for these provocative pieces in gloria swanson. in don't change your husband, swanson plays a bored housewife whose wealthy businessman husband (elliott dexter) pays more attention to work than to her. she is chased by a handsome roue (lew cody) until she relents and divorces the boring husband for the new lover.things soon become familiar and swanson discovers the new husband is as neglectful as the first. to make matters worse she discovers cody has a woman on the side (julia faye). after several confrontations and convenient meetings, things are resolved.this was a smash hit in 1919 and helped make gloria swanson a major star. although she was only 20 when she filmed this she is very good as the maybe foolish wife. she looks great and wears some stunning gowns.there is one memorable scene that is 100% demille in which cody is luring swanson with promises of wealth, pleasure, and love. as he coos to her she imagines the scenes. pleasure is a fantastic scene of swanson in a spidery hammock swinging out over a pool while people dance around. wealth is a scene in which swanson is gowned like a babylonian queen as servants bring her chests of jewels, which shes tosses aside. love is a scene in which she is a wood nymph making love in a forest glade with a pan-like character (ted shawn). pure hokum but very entertaining, and swanson looks great.dexter is very good as the bland husband who shaves off his moustache and starts to work out in order to win his wife back. cody is also good as the fake charmer who is a liar and cheat. faye is funny as the bitchy other woman--named toodles no less--who gets hers. sylvia ashton plays mrs. huckney. ted shawn was married to ruth st. denis and together they were groundbreaking and influential modern dancers (of the denishawn school).swanson impresses me more every time i see her. she seems to have been such a natural actress and yet there is a way that the camera captures her expressive face that is just mesmerizing. she's a joy to watch.very entertaining film with lots of color tints in varying scenes to keep things lively. and a lot of the furnishings are back in style 86 years later.

i know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious; it's not like american pie or something. i know not why people are offended by the universal plugs; since it's part of the plot, the advertising is excusable.this is a funny movie with good dialogue, good subtle wit, a good story, a good moral (that thankfully doesn't get too sappy), great acting, and a cheesy ending.(minor spoiler) the basic premise here is the classic story of a shepherd boy (muniz) who lies so much that no one believes him when the wolf (giamatti) comes along. so he gets his best friend kaylee (bynes) and they go and drive the wolf crazy.frankie muniz can be annoying in other roles, but not as jason shepherd. he handles the suave confidence of his character perfectly well, and what appears to be a lack of expression at first glance is really a perfectly executed nonchalantness.amanda bynes. what more can i say? the girl's got the gift. she's funny, talented, versatile, and very, very attractive. (i'm only 6 months older than her. i need to get to california sometime soon.) in fact, the 'best-friend' part was originally a boy, but became a girl as soon as the makers saw amanda's interest. which works out pretty well, since the part would've been pretty dull without the blessing of bynes's abilities.paul giamatti is a very talented man. while some would play marty wolf as evil and diabolical, giamatti made him-not just a jerk, mind you, but a likeable jerk, a jerk that livens up the screen, rather than intentionally dimming it. and i doubt many other actors could pull off the psychological breakdown that wolf undergoes as well.all in all, great movie. loved seeing jaleel white able to mock himself. loved seeing all the little references & such built into the film. (one of the guests in the party scene is the director, shawn levy, another is bynes's former co-star kenan thompson) loved seeing amanda in those outfits........ get the dvd if you can. it's got all kinds of great extra stuff, and the lovely ms. bynes is your guide through the menus. :)

who said it had to be believable? do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to view this film. you'll enjoy the experience much more. you'll find yourself forgiving some of the movie's more outlandish plot set-ups, and simply accepting it for what it is--a great family film. i appreciated not having to be concerned about "questionable elements" in a children's film for once. that, to me, is worth the price of the ticket. and it manages to maintain its wholesomeness without being obvious about it--older chidlren will enjoy this film. enough good humor to keep adults interested. very good film.

fun movie! great for the kids - they found it very entertaining. somewhat predictable, but there are a few surprises. great movie to watch if you're looking for something just to entertain (don't expect to be seeing a classic!)

with all of the "r" movies out today, it's hard to find something you can take the whole family to see. my kids loved it. it was good clean fun. i would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to take the whole family out for a nice evening at the movies.

i wasn't expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a movie script.. who then he travels to hollywood to get even.. but.. hey.. it's still a fun film. frankie muniz of "malcom in the middle" fame stars as the kid and is fairly good and amanda bynes as his friend is also very good. yea the film does work as an advertisement for universal studios theme park and is really kinda a silly kids film.. but i enjoyed it anyways. grade: b-

spoiler alert!!!! this was my son's review of the movie, which he wanted me to post.he wrote this, i swear.with malcolm in the middle's frankie muniz, and nickelodeon's amanda bynes, they get to go to show business. they team up on the actor paul giamatti. he stole jason shepherd's essay on big fat liar, and makes it in to a movie. jason (frankie muniz) and kaylee (amanda bynes) have to go to l.a. to get it back. jason's dad does not believe that he wrote that essay. so every time they see each other jason asks wolf (paul giamatti) to give jason's dad a call because he wants his essay back!!!! wolf does not make the movie but the president of the company makes it. at the end the family and kaylee see the movie, made by wolf pictures and based on a real story written by jason shepherd.

after seeing big fat liar, i think jason learned a lot more. when he told the truth about marty stealing his story, it was like the boy who cried wolf. people heard him, but they didn't believe him. nobody did anything to help him. besides, not only marty's movies stink, so does his advice. the truth is not overrated. i am so glad he got exposed for what he really is. everyone found out that he stole from that boy, including his parents. not only he stole from that boy and lied about it, he gave them someone else's work and tried to call it his own, which is plagiarism. doesn't he know that it is illegal to plagiarize someone's idea? another reason why he got fired. he is not trustworthy. he's a liar, a cheat, a thief, a crook, and a plagiarist. you got that marty? you're a plagiarist. plus, you got everything that you deserved.

big fat liar is a pretty funny movie. but as i was watching it, i thought about something. some of the events that occur in this film are unbelievable. so really, the film is kind of a big fat lie. there is no way that he could've gotten away with all of this. here are all of the unbelievable stuff.1. when he fakes his father had choked on a meatball, and acts like he is the father. jason(frankie munez) couldn't have gotten away with that. well, luckily for us, he didn't. so it didn't stick with it, the outrageous.2.even if the grandmother was blind, she still could've figured out that that wasn't her granddaughter. 3.they couldn't have gotten on the plane, flown to l.a., acted like they were coat salesmen, sneak into the studio, and then, and then... well, some of the film is a little unbelievable. but it doesn't hurt to tell a little white lie. trust me, i do it all the time.big fat liar, though unbelievable at times, is fun. it's also very funny. but let me just say one thing before i continue this review. if paul giamatti wasn't in this movie, it would really suck. it would be horrible. big fat liar is also pretty funny, though corny at times. i give it a thumbs up.big fat liar:***/****

seth mcfarlane is a true genius. he has crafted a show that is witty, culturally sharp and just downright hilarious.for those that think its 'offensive' take on social or cultural topics makes no meaningful comment, just causes 'offence', can be pointed to this quote:peter (coming out of the stem cell lab): how long was i in there? // guard: five minutes. // peter: why aren't we funding this?!?why indeed.thanks family guy, for being not only the funniest show on tv (with the possible exception of the much loved, much missed futurama), but for also being pretty clever to boot.

family guy has to be my all time favorite cartoon.it is definitely the funniest tv show ever made and is better than the simpsons.i have never laughed so hard at a tv show in my life the things that make the show so funny is the plot,characters and themes that are dealt with in the show.there are very few themes that have not been dealt with on family guy.i have seen just about every episode of family guy ever made and would have to say that the show was better in the first two seasons.my favorite characters are peter because he is very funny and is the best character of the show.my second favorite character is stewie because he is the funniest villain to be on a tv show.if you love family guiy you should check out american dad because it is just so similar and is created by seth mcfarlane.i hope this show never ends because it is a comic genius! 10/10

i own all family guy seasons so far and i have to say vol. 6 has been the biggest disappoint of them all. there are still plenty of laughs to be found here but i think vol. 6 like the last few volumes is slowly providing less and less laughs. at least for me.the biggest annoyance i had with vol. 6 is it seems to be very heavy in left wing politics. i'm a big believer in if you can laugh at other people you should be able to laugh at yourself but this volume really seems to shove their political view points down your throat and i think it takes a lot away from the show. insinuated all conservative sates are horrible places, insinuating we need more gun control, insinuated school are under funded, insinuated religious people are crazy, bush is friends with the devil.. i could go on and this is just from the first three episodes.sure some of it was funny but there becomes a point when you're not making a comedy and you're really just shoving your political views on other people.

this is one great show, that it makes me wonder why it got pulled off the air so many times. but i believe its now here to stay! this show cant compare to any other, before simpsons was pretty "on the edge" and than came family guy, and they are stretching it out to go off the "edge". the things this show gets away with is incredible. totally work the watch! if you like the simpsons you will love family guy!

family guy is the best show on tv. ever. it has achieved great things that no other animated sitcom, or any show, has even come close to achieving.in terms of animated sitcoms, this era should be referred to as "the era of animated sitcoms" because there are so many of them, and almost every one of them imaginable is being released on dvd. there are some good ones (i.e. south park, futurama, and the simpsons). every animated sitcom has its own style/technique of creating humor. for instance, futurama is funny because it always comments or acts on what just happened with a touch of humor. the simpsons is also a great show because it uses the same comedic technique and style that futurama does, but the simpsons deserves the credit for it since it was on the air way before futurama and still remains on the air using the technique. south park, in my mind, is the funniest show next to family guy, because it uses a smart blend of vulgarity and silliness as it's technique of creating humor.but enough about other animated shows. let me tell you what makes family guy so funny. family guy uses a comedic style that no other show has ever used before. it uses a technique of having flashbacks occur after every joke. this not only reinforces the joke, but makes it seem funnier. it also moves at a very quick pace. these two criteria make it the funniest show on tv. you have to see the show to believe it, but once you see it, you will most likely agree. (fyi, the two funniest moments on family guy were: 1) the 5 minute chicken fight in "da boom", and 2) the dick van dyke spoof in "holy crap.") also, in my mind family guy is a very modest show because while other shows create humor by getting familiar with their shticks/routines and characters, most of family guy's jokes are based on the silliness of current events and pop culture. this also shows that family guy is intelligent, in addition to being modest, because it reveals that the show has insight. and this technique is extremely effective because they relate their pop culture references to the particular plot of the episode they are found in.family guy can be enjoyed by all ages, because while younger children may not understand the pop culture references, they will be amused by the hilarious, silly antics of the characters, especially peter. the show is, however, a little bit more vulgar than the simpsons and futurama, but it is less vulgar than south park. so, in terms of vulgarity, family guy would rank somewhere in the middle when associated with the above shows, but it would rank no. 1 in terms humor and intelligence!!sadly, it was cancelled last year, not because it wasn't popular, but because fox kept changing it's time slot, so no one ever knew when it was on. luckily, we've got the dvd box sets (which, by the way, are selling like crazy) and reruns on cartoon network's adult swim available to us.

when i first saw this show, i was 9, and it caught my attention right away when stewie was trying to call lois on the phone in the hotel. i laughed and kept on watching. when the episode was finished, i wrote down the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly. this separates itself from the simpsons and other shows on say, cartoon network because the jokes are more mature, not too much, but it's tv-14 for a reason. the quick film cuts after each punch line and cute, funny movements and behavior of the characters make it special. talented seth macfarlene is the creator and the voice of quite a lot of characters in the show. a good theme song, and a crazy family that there's always something funny, makes this my favorite cartoon along sealab 2021 and aqua teen hunger force. check it out it's funny stuff.

i absolutely love this show!!!!!!!, its basically fox's improved version of the simpsons (cau'se lets face it the simpsons are very dry if you're above the age of 9. it's political, irrational, and irresistible. anyone who says they don't like it is lying, there is a character for every one. peter, stewie, & quagmire are my favorites. peter because he is rude, obnoxious, and just doesn't give a crap. stewie because of his amazing intelligence and how he hits you with something an adult would say when you least expect it. and quagmire because one of guilty pleasures is dirty jokes. also there is an episode for everybody too. if you're the political type there is mr. griffin goes to washington (vol.2 season 3). if you like more of the sexual and bodily humor there is emission impossible (vol.2 season 3.). or if you like any other kind of humor there is dammit janet (vol.1 season2).basicly what i'm saying is that when you watch this show there is side splitting humor for everyone. giggity giggity gooooo!

if family guy offends you or you simply don't get the humor, unfortunately this show is making fun of you and the masses of overly religious, dull, and politically correct people in america. so put your morals aside and have fun with this show. fg is a hilarious mind opener on the reality of today's society. whoever said this show is for a young immature audience is very mistaken. with all the references to old movies and politics 10-80 years ago, i couldn't imagine any young immature kid finding this funny. family guy is definitely for a mature open-minded audience who are not afraid to criticize american society. hats off to seth and the whole crew who were able to make this show happen.

big fat liar is a great watch for kids of all ages, even adults. i had a great time watching this movie and recommend this to kids of 10 years and under. the laughs never end and the adventurous plot is pretty good too! frankie muniz is funny and marty wolfe is hilarious! overall, a nicely made film for kids to enjoy and just have a great time.

being a russian myself, sometimes it's hard for me to get the reference jokes about american tv personalities or celebrities. apart from that, family guy is the smartest, funniest and most politically incorrect shows seen on earth. the voice acting is excellent and sounds clear enough even for a non-english speaker as myself to comprehend. animations are good too, maybe even too good for a tv-show. here we have the equivalent of the adult swim channel, but nothing there simply compares to this gem. not even simpsons or south park. hope the creators will continue to entertain and amuse us. don't want to see the whole thing spiraling down into mediocre entertainment.

family guy has been hilarious for so long but i feel like it lost it's sharp and random humor at the start of season 6. although i enjoyed blue harvest, it felt like the remaining episodes were "wrapping-up" - episodes where the producers made little attempt to fulfill family guy's reputation of american social satire.i have seen all the episodes from season 7 and i was utterly surprised and happy that family guy has found their true colors again. season 7 delivers a lot of fantastic episodes and with a lot of jokes about the current situations in america which is exactly what we need right now - more fun.i feel that the simpsons has lost its spark all together, this show, however, has made a terrific recovery from going down to proving how perfectly satirical they can be. great job!

"family guy" is probably the most ballsy sitcom ever produced. it relentlessly skewers everything it can think of, from tv shows to family drama. best of all, it's one of the few tv shows on today that's actually funny.the show revolves around the griffins: peter, the obese father whose schemes are limited by his lack of intelligence. lois, the mother who is more or less the head of the family, even though peter considers himself to be that. chris, the fat teenage son who has just as few brains as his dad. meg, the black sheep of the family that is the but of everyone's jokes. stewie, the baby who has plans for killing his mother and taking over the world. and brian, the family dog, who is frequently the voice of reason, but is frequently corrupted."family guy" employs many tactics to get laughs from the audience. most notable are the frequent cutaways that spoof what has just been said. they are effective because of the impeccable timing, and in how they play out. "family guy" uses spoofs to get humor as well, most commonly from 80's tv shows. what really makes the show so great is that a person doesn't have to be familiar with what it's spoofing. i'm sure it would help, but the material is funny enough in its own right. but the show doesn't stop there. not only does it spoof just about everything, it skewers its own spoofs! the show is filled with off-color humor. the only reason why people aren't up in arms about the show is probably because it makes fun of every race, sex and other generality equally. there is nothing sacred here, and no one and nothing is immune from "family guy's" satirical jabs.putting on musical numbers in a film takes a lot of time and effort, and it's a very big risk. but "family guy" contains some great songs. all well-written and performed, and of course they are hilarious (perhaps the most famous one, "the freakin' fcc" is both catchy, and hysterical because it hits the ratings board where it hurts).the voice characterizations are right on the money. seth mcfarlane is tremendously talented. he provides the voices for peter, brian (which is his own natural voice), and stewie. not only are the voices consistent and creative, he can alter their pitch at will, so it really seems as if they are spoken by three different actors. alex borstein brings a nasally drawl to lois that is perfect for the character. seth green is unrecognizable as chris (had i not looked on imdb, i would have never known that it was him). lacey chabert originated the character of meg, and while she was good, mila kunis really elevated the character with her sharp voice. kunis gives meg a new, sharper edge that she didn't have with chabert."family guy" has been compared to "the simpsons," and that's entirely understandable (and not just because they are produced by fox). both are satires of blue-collar life, and while "the simpsons" is good, "family guy" contains are sharper edge. the show is utterly fearless. there is no real sacred cow. the show lampoons handicaps (physical and mental), ethnicities, tv shows and movies, celebrities, politicians, religion (especially catholicism), drug use and addiction, sexual humor of all kinds (including s&m), and some that's just beyond description. not everything "family guy" throws at the audience works, but as a whole, the show is consistently amusing and frequently hilarious.if there's any flaw with "family guy," it's that the jokes run on far too long sometimes. particularly with the "awkward moment" jokes, the sequences are stretched for so long that not only does it cease to become funny, it becomes so irritating (and long) that a fast-forward button is warranted. these can be effective at about 10 to 15 seconds, but the show sometimes stretches these to beyond two minutes. one could argue that the show rewrites its rules to suit the plot, and it often does (for example, brian frequently acts like a person, but he still acts like a dog when the story requires it). but that's not a problem because the show still works.some people have argued that the show has stopped being funny. while i agree that it's not as edgy as it used to be, i think the blame lies with fox, not mcfarlane and his crew. the show originated with fox, but after some lackluster ratings and viewer turnout, it was canceled. however, dvd sales were large enough for it to be picked up by adult swim. the show became an instant success, and it was once again bought by fox. however, because the show is so big now, fox is afraid to let the writers experiment and try new things. while it's still funny, the humor is not as fresh and edgy.definitely check this show out. it's awesome.

despite the apparent structural similarity with the simpsons - loud fat dad, housewifey mum, 3 children, a pet, typical suburban home, family guy is actually functionally and stylistically opposite to the simpsons. its avid use (and sometimes too much) of cutaway gags has been its main stay since the first season. while some hit the nail on the head (the rhea perlman and danny devito bit in season 5 is spine-snappingly hilarious), others are less successful, coming across as contrived. and they can be annoying, especially when they don't advance the story line. (the jesus bits are entirely unfunny and insulting)the chemistry between stewie and brian griffin lends itself to pure comedy gold, so much so that chris and meg only manage to fulfill the role of the obligatory teenagers in your typical dysfunctional family.however, the feature film stewie griffin: the untold story, is mindnumbingly horrible. thank goodness it went straight to dvd.contrary to tiresome comparisons with the perennial simpsons, seth macfarlane's approach with family guy is actually very different - it's much more politically incorrect, and amazingly, a lot more brazen.creator of ren and stimpy, john kricfalusi, famously criticized family guy for having "extremely low" graphic standards from a cartoonist's standpoint. i don't think it looks that bad though, the detailing and accuracy of some of the spoofs are quite successful.all in all, a great series to go with a great big bowl of chips smothered in ranch sauce and ass jokes.

i love everything about family guy.my favourite characters in family are brian and stewie and i like the episodes when it mainly features them such as "road to rhode island" (season 2), as they interact very well. the comments they make just have me in stitches. peter's behaviour is also very funny as some of the things he does "are just so brilliant they're retarded." the voice acting is excellent, especially seth macfarlane as he provides the voices for half of the griffin family as well as their perverted neighbour glenn quagmire and how he manages this range (particularly with singing) i just don't know. he deserves his two emmy's for providing the voice of evil baby genius stewie. adam west also steals the show with his funny and completely insane regular character the mayor of quahog. what i like about chris (voiced by seth green) is the things he says show that he takes after his father when it comes to intelligence and common sense.the only thing i have found annoying is that in the uk fox has decided to change the seasons to increase dvd sales, which in no way reflect the programme itself but rather the marketing.if you enjoy family guy then i would thoroughly recommend seth macfarlane's other project american dad which uses a different style of humour but is still extremely hilarious.

this movie was borderline in crude humor....i utterly can not believe that these people can get away with this. johnny knoxville didn't cross the line...he was stomping all over it! this was better than the first...all tha way! the thing i found about the 1st movie was that the shenanigans were somewhat as if it was on the t.v. show. not this time!!! they completely made a 180 degree flip...the whole cast is so outstanding in what they do and not were the stunts crazy...but the music basically fit every situation...good work!!!! when you go see this be sure to use the bathroom before going to the theater, maintain a strong stomach and rememba to not let your beverage spray out your nose....

....but at the same time part of you is thinking "am i ready for what i am about to see?" in the end, you are happy you saw it. i was, at least. jackass number two has twice the laughs and twice the action. some stunts will leave you breathless. besides little miss sunshine, i think it was the best movie i saw this summer. maybe even this year. the entire cast returns, besides a few such as chris raab and rake yohn. i don't think any of the cast members had a dull moment. each and every stunt was either funny or dangerous or a combination of both; stupid. the beginning was just as funny as the first one, and the ending was interestingly hilarious; the cast performing a musical number. jackass number two is the perfect movie to see with your friends. stay during the credits, there are some pretty funny moments. one involves luke wilson.

if you're a fan of jackass, viva la bam or the cky videos, then you already know what you're in for. but this is one of those rare happenings when a sequel is better than the original! and man does this movie pack a mean low blow. but i mean that in a good way. it's the same type of death-defying, gut-wrenching insanity that we have all come to know and love and expect from bam, knoxville and co. but this time with even more laughs than ever before! with johnny knoxville's insane tolerance for pain, bam margera's love for harassing his friends/family and steve-o's gross-out factor, you have one hell of a funny film. the bar for the stunts, skits and general mayhem of the jackass crew has been raised. jackass 3? doubtful, because it's nearly impossible to improve on perfection.

this movies had to be the funniest movie i have ever seen in my entire life. i laughed so hard i almost puked. after the movie was done i laughed for about an hour just thinking about the very last seen in the movie. its is definitely 100 times better than the first jackass movie. i loved seeing all of them back together again. if you are squeamish or don't like raunchy childish humour you will not like this movie. if you can go in with an open mind and not take it so seriously then you will laugh your ass off. its amazing no one was killed in this movie. every seen in this movie is so original and so different from the next you will not know what to expect. mike webber

seriously people need to lighten up and just accept that funny is funny, and this movie is f**king hilarious. better than the first and knoxville really grew a pair for this film and did way more crazier stunts then the first. if ebert and roper(not saying that i'm a huge fan of theirs) can look past the pure idiocy of this film enough to give it 2 thumbs up then i think other people can to. i wasn't sure what to expect from this but i was floored and it is rare when a sequel is better than the original. this new one i believe exceeds the first big time. so do what i did,just relax kick back try not to barf at some points and laugh your ass off.

big fat liar, in my opinion, is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it. when jason (frankie muniz - "malcolm in the middle") and kaylee (amanda bynes - "all that") played those tricks on marty (paul giamatti - doctor dolittle), i really smiled and felt good. that's what i liked most about this movie. as a matter of fact, everything that happened after jason's essay erroneously ended up in marty's hands was hilarious. i especially loved jaleel white's cameo. when i first saw him, i couldn't be certain, but, when i asked my mother if it was him, she said, "of course!" before i wrap this up, i'd like to say, "like i said earlier, there is a moral to this story, and that moral is, always tell the truth." now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of frankie muniz, amanda bynes, or paul giamatti, i highly recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it.

jackass number two is easily the most hilarious film of 2006, beating the also hilarious clerks ii. it is one of the best sequels in recent memory, beating jackass the movie in every way. now, this film may be the funniest, but it is also the most offensive, appalling, and utterly disgusting. you will find yourself feeling sick several times throughout the film. i'm completely serious when i say don't eat anything before watching or during this film, because chances are that it will literally come back to haunt you. keep the drinking to a minimum as well. you've been warned, because, just like the tagline says, it will make you beg for mercy.jackass number two follows the crazy men from the hit show jackass, johnny knoxville, bam margera, ryan dunn, steve-o, chris 'party boy' pontius, preston lacy, ehren mcghehey, dave england, brandon dicamillo, and jason 'wee man' acuna (chris 'raab himself' raab is absent) as they perform the most outrageous, life-threatening, and revolting stunts imaginable. i'm not going to tell what the stunts are, but i will warn you that any scene with an animal will be sickening or psychologically frightening, and that one cast member (once again, not telling) will flirt with death several times in the film.what makes jackass number two so entertaining is not the stunts themselves, but how the cast reacts to them and to doing them. to put it simple, if they loved doing it and had a blast, you will too (this goes for 99% of the stunts). all the stunts are very original, and 90% of them are never-before-seen. you will witness a few recycled ones, but they're amped up. you wouldn't think directing really factors into a movie like this, but it does; jeff tremaine's direction makes the movie so much funnier, because he provides guidance for the gang in their comedic timing, which is simply brilliant on his part. he could have just sat back and slept throughout filming (actually, you'll see in the film that he did sleep through some filming), but he went out there and helped these crazy guys make the stunts as funny as he could. i give mr. tremaine two thumbs up for that. another great thing about jackass is its bonanza of celebrity cameos, and this time they include bmx legend mat hoffman, skateboard god tony hawk, director/actor jay chandrasekhar (super troopers & beerfest), actor luke wilson, miami dolphins star jason taylor, and director/actor mike judge (office space). the scenes with hoffman, taylor, and chandrasekhar are among the funniest in the film, as it's even funnier to see these men as a part of the film.jackass number two is one of the most politically incorrect, morally degrading, and just plain wrong movies of all time, if not the most. despite this, it is so original and so hilarious that you won't care about that. you'll be gasping for air, laughing so hard you'll be crying, and jumping out of your seat laughing throughout the entire film. due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film, no one under 18 should watch this film. you've been warned. i hope you enjoy jackass number two as much as i did.10/10 --spy

i would give this movie an 8.5 or a 9. i thought it was just straight up hilarious i don't know how you could not think this movie was funny but the only thing that disappointed me was that there was alittle bit too much gross stuff because personally i think when they fly off of bikes and stuff like that is much funnier but i'm sure there are people that think the other things are very funny so that is not my desicion but anyways great movie go see it and after that you should definitely go buy it also if you do not like this movie that is fine because i'm sure there are many people who think that this movie shows how downgrading our society is or whatever this is just my personal opinion and you have yours. also the jackass box set is definitely something worth downloading or buying or whatever you do to get your videos

first off i want to say most of the people who give this a poor review don't like this kind of comedy, the movie is great if you have an open mind and aren't afraid to laugh at some stupid things.this movie is shot just like the tv show with a lot of short clips compiled into one long movie. some of the scenes don't even have dialog someone will just come out and do something unexpected and it is funny!! the only negative i had is i felt like i wasted money on my popcorn and icee, there was no way i could eat or drink anything during this movie i was constantly laughing. i was honestly nervous of drinking some icee and seeing something that caused me to laugh and shoot it everywhere.if you don't mind some male nudity, and you enjoy jackass the movie, jackass the tv show, and viva la bam, then for your sake go see this movie.and if you don't like the first movie, or the tv show. don't see it, and if you do see it don't post a bad review about it. hardcore christians who see this and bash it just doesn't seem right to me.

this is not the kind of movie that really merits critical attention. it's not going to win any oscars - it's really not a very good movie at all. heck, it's not even really a movie - just a string of short disgusting, gross-out skits strung together in an effort to make entertainment. and as much as every critical bone in my body cries out to give this movie a failing score, gosh darn it, i'm going to give it a much better score. the kind of people who are going to enjoy this movie are not the kind of people who really care what critics have to say, so i'm not going to give some snobby critique of jackass's quality of surreal existentialism that permeates and commentates on how our society....oh forget it.what's to say? there's no plot development, no character development - no real beginning - there's a semi-enjoyable end that's not nearly as funny as the skit that precedes it, and everything in between reeks of improper, bathroom humor that junior high kids laugh at. it's actually pretty funny.leave at the door all your preconceptions of a good movie. jackass: number two is just gross-out crap. that's really all it is. i do give the filmmakers this, though: they come up with some pretty imaginative stuff. you'll probably cringe several times throughout, want to throw up a couple times, wiggle and shift uncomfortably as the people on screen do death and vomit-defying stunts. vomit, crap, urine, semen....virtually every bodily fluid can be seen in jackass: number two. there's nudity, sexual humor abounds, and so on and so forth.it's entertaining. if you're the kind of person who finds this stuff enjoyable, then you will probably really like jackass: number two. i laughed several times. like i said, it's pretty imaginative stuff. i never once wanted to vomit - though i do have a pretty strong stomach. just accept the movie's premise: a bunch of idiotic guys do weird crap for fun. once you get past that, accepting it and going with it, you'll enjoy it. the only flaw in the movie is the sheer excess of all the weird and disgusting stuff. there are several very imaginative, very disturbing skits, but it drags in many places as they do ones that are less interesting. towards the end things pick up, but in the middle of the movie the drag hurts the overall film's quality. in a half hour tv show this isn't a problem, but with film length celluloid, it's inevitable that boredom will ensue at some point. after awhile the gross crap just becomes desensitizing.on the whole, though, number two is an entertaining, imaginative, and above all, disgusting comedy that will leave you with a feeling of pain, nausea, and hilarity. go see it if you must, but hey, if you know you don't like this kind of stuff, don't bother. you'll just be disappointed.

i shouldn't like jackass number two. no one should. there is and never has been anything particularly redeeming about jackass. and yet...it's one of the funniest things i have ever seen - and i simply cannot explain why.this new movie leaves the first one in the dust. it's so funny, so horrible and so wrong. the whole team give their all - with jackss in chief knoxville leading the charge. he's nuts. i adore him, but he's insane. and more power to him. with his burgeoning film career he could have sat back and just let everyone else do the dirty work, but the fact that he threw himself, almost literally, back into the world of the 'ass so wholeheartedly makes me oddly respect him. more kudos must go to bam margera who previously seemed content to sit back and just make sure everyone around him did pretty much what he wanted. here bam isn't the tormentor but the tormented and is all the better for it.i simply can't say what my favourite part is because i laughed the whole way through. admittedly i viewed much of the movie from between my fingers, but there hasn't been a 'real' movie i've seen in a very long time that made me feel as invigorated as this did. love them or most probably hate them, the jackass team have delivered above and beyond my expectations. but i do agree with bam. there can never be a jackass number three because someone will die and i want these guys to stick around.

does exactly what you expect, and then some. the first movie, was a step up from the tv show with sicker stunts airing uncensored and a gnarly factor that had increased. surprisingly, jackass number two is even more twisted.the stunts have become more dangerous and spectacular, with some mind blowing painful antics sprinkled with good fun skits to keep that smile turning into a curl of disgust.knoxville, like always, dominates the proceedings, but this time he has reason to take centre stage as he volunteers for the most dangerous and idiotic of all the stunts, with bam magera also proving himself as wild as ever, despite having had his image toned down in 'viva la bam'. surprisingly, the infamous wild boys (steve o and chris pontius) seem to take part in fewer of the skits, despite being focal in the previous outings.if you like jackass or dirty sanchez then you will definitely enjoy this film, and will laugh your guts out for the 100 minutes of its duration, if you see it as childish, disgusting or a sad snapshot of the youth culture of today, you will find it as offencive as ever. so f**k off.

i've always been a fan of jackass, as well as viva la bam and wildboyz. and when you're a fan of something, your expectations are high to whatever your "heroes" might star in. and if there's one thing i've learned about expecting a lot from the people you simply love to watch and listen to, it's never to expect to much, 'cause in 99 out of a 100 times, you'll get disappointed.although, when i heard there was a jackass 2 coming up, i thought "not even i can turn down my expectations for this movie", and as a result of that i sat down today, ready to laugh, but also ready to say in the end "well, it was ok, but i'm a little disappointed". how wrong was i! every single member of the jackass crew brings this movie way over the first one, showing you the one crazy ass stunt after the other, making the whole world see that there's nothing they wont do to try to harm themselves - and that's what we love! i cried my eyes out laughing from the first minute and till the very last second of the movie, at some times even shouted in laughter, not able to control myself! stunt after stunt, prank after prank, and hilarious comments on the flow - it can simply not get any better than this! amazing from start till end, guaranteed to make you laugh your ass off. i've got two things left to say; watch it, and please god, let there be a jackass 3 - these guys clearly has a lot to offer!

this movie was hilarious! it occasionally went too far, but isn't that what we expect from them? the theater roared with laughter and ooooooed at all the incredibly crazy stunts. it's rude, crude, and occasionally frighteningly intense. the whole gang is back and even more out of their minds, which in turn provides for some great entertainment. i don't want to give anything away, but the little snippets of clips going around the net are nothing compared to what comes after. this is a great movie to go see with friends. try to see it with a big crowd. you will not be disappointed. just don't go with anyone who can't take it (see above). it will not go over well, you can be sure of that. but that's pretty obvious in the first place. if you enjoyed the first one, you will loooooove this one.

all you could ever hope for if your a jackass fan.as always knoxville & his crew risk life & limb just for our viewing entertainment. if you are fan of the series & of the first movie you won't be let down like most sequel often do. the jokes they pull on each other as twice as funny,cruel,crude as ever before & the stunts & dares are twice as rough as any jackass episode you have ever seen. if your a fan don't waste time go check it out for yourself because on jackaass standards this movie is an easy 10 out of 10 just for the opening credits alone, i can't go into detail without spoilers but you've got to see it to believe it.

this movie is hilarious. i would say much more painful & disgusting than the previous movie. the entire cast from the previous movie & series is present.these kind of movies are great to watch in the movietheater cause the whole audience is crying with laughter, especially at the terrorist part that was damn disgusting. i wish they made more of these kind of movies.strong stomach required! they got some insane stunts this time around. warning: includes a lot of snakes! i would love to write about it but i just can't spoil the fun. go see it!!!

spoiler warningwe've all heard the "boy who cried wolf" legend. but what if the wolf was a person in the modern world. well it might be something like big fat liar. fourteen-year-old jason sheperd ( frankie muniz from "malcolm in the middle" ) is always lying to keep himself out of trouble. one day he is pressured to write an english essay, but it winds up in the hands of sleazy film-maker marty wolf ( paul giamatti ) who plans to turn jason's story into a hollywood blockbuster. no one believes jason when he for once tells the truth and he ends up in summer school. however jason is determined to prove to his parents the truth and travels to l.a. with his friend kaylee ( amanda bynes ). when wolf refuses to admit he ripped off his story, jason plans to make wolf's life a living hell. b.f.l. is no masterpiece but it's a nice way to spend 90 minutes of you're time. i wished they could've made it a bit longer though and there aren't that much pranks although they are clever enough ( i like the pool-dye the best ). i might not have liked this as much as i do if it weren't for paul giamatti. he is simply hilarious in this. if you have 90 minutes to kill try this out. you might just enjoy it.

we've all see the countless previews and trailers. if you enjoyed knoxville getting flipped by the bull you'll take great carnal pleasure in the opening "act". i must caution the masses however, i considered taking my (under-18) son with me but am relieved i did not. this compilation of obnoxious skits contains a few that albeit as hilarious as they may seem to the adult community, a few are not for the immature. these guys must get paid a great ransom to tolerate some of the devious stunts, sometimes played at their expense. in particular, bam margera and ehren mcghehey are slighted by the group in a few particular stunts. enjoy

i love this movie. yes, the main character lies, but that's why it's called "big fat liar". even though this kid runs away to hollywood, it doesn't give kids the idea that they can. besides, he doesn't just do it for fun or to get away from anything, he does it to regain trust. i don't think it was just one big ad for universal studios, because i liked how it gave an inside view of what it's like for kids who don't know how cool movie-making is. it has good music and fun characters. this family/comedy is totally fun for kids and parents alike. it has humour, excitement, and real life difficulties like lying.in the end, "big fat liar" sends out a moral: don't expect lying to be easy.

this isn't a life-changing movie; it's not an epic, or anything like that. but it's entertaining, and it's fun. it's a film that the whole family can watch together, and at the moment there are precious few kid-suitable films that don't have a love story in them! it tells a good story in a lighthearted way without trying to dazzle the audience with over-the-top special effects, like lots of films these days are. it's got some fairly good acting in, and all the music that's been used fits in pretty well with the movie content. the acting is quite good too, the actors look comfortable and believable in their surroundings and most importantly the jokes are actually funny. i'd recommend it for people of all ages - it certainly made me laugh. :)

this is one of the funniest movies i've ever saw. a 14-year old boy jason shepherd wrote an english paper called "big fat liar". when his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to the college on time and he hit a limo. when he went into the limo, he met a famous producer from hollywood, marty wolf. when he left the limo, he forgot one thing: his paper! so marty wolf took it and he turned jason's english paper into a movie! when jason admitted that he left his paper in the limo and marty took it, his parents and his english teacher didn't believe him! so jason and his friend kaylee had to fly to los angeles to go to hollywood to make marty admit he stole his story to jason's parents. when jason told marty to call his dad that marty stole that paper, marty tricked him and burned his paper! jason got so angry that marty burned that paper so marty called security to get jason out of his site! jason and kaylee realized marty isn't going to admit the truth. in order to take marty down in phase 2: the takedown, jason and kaylee put permanent blue dye into the pool and when marty jumps in, his body turns all blue and it wouldn't come off! then they put permanent orange dye in marty's shampoo and when he uses it, his hair turns all orange and it wouldn't come off too! finally, they put lots of glue on marty's earpiece to make him call jason's father and when marty uses it, it sticks to his ear! it was funny when marty's hair and body turns all blue and orange and his headset is glued to his ear! after that, they tricked marty by telling monty, who is marty's assistant, that duncan moved to a house where there's a party going on. when marty went in to see duncan, he was at the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him up! when marty was in the house, jason and kaylee switched the controls of his car. when marty drove his car, he knew all the controls were switched and he didn't know which button to push. he's stupid enough to fall for it. when marty hit the rear end of the masher, the masher wrecked his car! it was so funny. so marty starts to call jason's dad and tricked him again! he was on the phone, but it wasn't his father, he called security! after the security got jason and kaylee out of marty's site, they suggested them to go home. monty was going to be on jason and kaylee's side cause she knew that marty was a liar and a jerk so she told rocco, who is one of the security guards that she will take care of the kids. jason told his father the truth of what he's been up to for the past 2 days and had his parents come to l.a. when monty came to the kids, she's going to help the kids move into phase 4: the payback. jason splits the crew into 3 teams for phase 4. one team will distract and trick marty until jason's parents get to the set. marty first rode with frank jackson, but his car broke down so he rode with jaleel, but he took him into the desert and leave him there. when marty was in the desert, a helicopter came to rescue him. after that, one of the blades are jammed so marty and the pilot got off the helicopter. after that, he was on the way to the set and when jason saw him, marty stopped and saw what jason has: his monkey! so marty went after jason and kaylee and when they saw lester, he released the water and when the water came, it pushed marty away. marty was still after the kids and when kaylee went the other way, jason led marty to the top of the apartment building. at the top, jason was challenging marty by making him admit the truth and marty will never ever tell the truth. when the crew caught marty in surprise, all the people including jason's parents who were at the set knew what marty did. marty was going to kill jason but the only way for jason to escape is jump down from the top! after that, his parents believed him that marty took his story. when the people who were on the set left, this is the end of marty. at the end, jason's story, big fat liar was a movie. i cant get enough of it.

i could watch this movie all day! i love it. probably my all time favorite movies. but, by the way, "badger1970" there are a few parts with bad language, not too bad, but it's not exactly g rated. great movie!!!!! i recommend it to everybody. any way, it's making me type 10 lines of text, so i am going to keep typing until it will let me post this comment. okay... still typing... this is getting annoying. ugh. i still have four more to go. anyway, watch this movie! even if you have already seen it. i don't care! has it been 10 lines yet? nope. only 2 more lines left. i don't even know why it wants me to do this. i think i am done. wait a minute, i'm not done, sorry, people. i know it's torture listening to me. well, i suppose that you don't have to read this comment... but you should, because i wrote it. i am probably done now. finally, bye.

much better than expected. good family flick - catch it on reruns. the whole is more than the sum of its parts. paul giamatti chews up the scenery - he has way more talent then the role deserves. a treat to watch inspector uhl from "the illusionist" go over the top. the blue man scenes had my 11 year old in stitches. the cameos were particular fun for the parents - nice to see lee majors and urkel (umm, jaleel) again. it's going to be tough to think up 10 lines for this film , but let's hear it for a movie that promotes honesty between a child and their parents! amanda bynes does a fine job when she gets to be part of the sting. i normally can't stand frankie muniz but he is just fine here. hats off to the casting director - if only for hiring giamatti!

i can't understand why imdb users would rate this movie 5.2/10? it really is great, very funny. i would strongly recommend this movie for all of you, adults, teenagers and especially children! the story is about a 14-year-old kid who always tell lie, at home and school. one day he had his homework of writing a 1000-word-story. but he didn't, so the teacher told him to write it and gave her in 3 hours, or he would have to go to summer school. yep, he wrote it in 2:45. "big fat liar", i think it was a story of himself. on the way to the school he hit a limo of a famous hollywood producer, and he gave him a ride. but the kid forgot the story in the limo. he told his parents and the teacher, but of course, they did not believe him. and the movie producer, he took the kid's story as his new movie, "big fat liar". when the kid saw the trailer of the movie, he told his parents he had written it, but they didn't believe. so, he and his friend had to go to l.a to prove one thing: the truth is never overrated enjoy this great movie, you won't be disappointed. don't trust the 5.2/10 rate, it should be 9/10! believe me! p/s: so sorry, my english isn't good enough to make a better comment!

i just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one. paul giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot. he would probably say it was easy, but he really does a great job and should have won something for it. we've had the dvd for several years and my kids (boy now 4 1/2 and girl 9) will watch this one over and over, and the humor is adult enough that i don't mind having to hear it in the background (and i do run to the tv for the really funny parts). simple moral message, lots of decent action and slapstick, "bad" grownups acting goofy to take the edge off, minimal bad language and minimal potty jokes make it hard to beat for a family standard.

this movie was fun! especially if your between 8 and 15. frankie muniz and amanda bynes make a believable team of 8th graders getting back at an adult who really deserves it. paul giamatti makes a great adult who you really want to 'get'. my 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it. parents: no really bad words or any sex to worry about. recommend it for the 'right' crowd. ap

simply an amazing bittersweet movie that portrays a side of life often skipped over in feel good movies. i saw this as a child and came back to it very recently and fell in love again.as a child it sparked my interest purely for the building of a plane, as an adult it captured me in the dark world and a young mans escape from that world. the portrayal of the king was great, the camera style chosen with low shots and shots focusing on actions and hand movements was i thought well done, i personally can not recall anything quite done in that style and adds to the character and portrays him as a force almost not human (which may not be far from reality) it makes for interesting developments worth a watch any day

everything about this film is simply incredible. you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.i do feel it is important to note this tale is about child abuse. don't rent it for your kids thinking it is a fun, disney-esque film.

in reply to "state of confusion" the dogs injuries do seem to disappear rather abruptly, but that may have only been an error in continuity. but, as for the kids trying to build a plane out of junk, it's just a simple matter of imagination. these are two very young kids who have extremely active imaginations and they must rely on those imaginations to keep themselves from being exposed to the reality of the level of abuse that goes on in their home from their stepfather. as for the stepfather, it's very interesting that the director chose to no show his face. that makes him seem more monstrous. if you show his face, then that character becomes a person and not just this "monster" who is terrorizing the childhood of these two innocent children. by showing only the concequences of his abuse and not focusing scenes on the abuse itself, the children then become the main focus of the movie. this film has no loose ends, but runs just as a father's tale to his children would. it has embelleshments. this is a fine american classic.

remember - before there was sidney, there was dudley.dudley digges is barely recalled today - because his heyday as a fixture in sound movies was the late 1920s and through the 1930s. except for one major performance: the ship's good natured, if tipsy doctor in the 1935 mutiny on the bounty, most of his films are barely revived. more's the pity because he was a wonderful actor. in 1931 he played casper gutman (the original actor to play that villain) opposite ricardo cortez's sam spade in the first the maltese falcon. similarly, about the same time, he played the recording angel in leslie howard's version of outward bound - the same role that sidney greenstreet tackled in between two worlds a decade later.digges could be likable and lovable (that ship's doctor again), or detestable (in china seas, as the judgmental first mate sneering at poor lewis stone but then proving he's as big a coward in a moment of crisis). he held his own against paul robeson in the emperor jones. he is the chinese freedom fighter working with gary cooper in the general died at dawn. digges could do anything. here, he is mr. thompson, the hypocritical and thieving warden of a reform school that frankie darro and his friends are sent to for committing a robbery and injuring a greek-american store owner (it is the latest incident for most of them). digges is as bad here as in china seas, but it is a close thing to totally dislike him. he's able to somehow transcend his roles...more later about that.darro has a gang of urban delinquents (including a jewish boy and "farina" from "our gang"). as pointed out in another review, it is a prototype of the bowery boys. we see them shake down car owners to pay them to "watch and protect" their autos. when one guy won't do it, they calmly wreck his car. the snatch and grab robbery at the store of the greek-american is also rather graphically shown - his skull getting fractured when pushed. the boys are rounded up and brought before stern but decent judge arthur byron, who realizes that he can't leave the kids with their parents: the parents are unable to watch them, or are incompetent. unfortunately there are three racial stereotypes in this sequence: a jewish father who is more concerned with his business than with his son, farina's stereotype "yassum" father, and the an italian father whose willingness to cooperate gets his son out of going to the reform school.once there the boys find the regime oppressive. occasionally one of the guards or the nurse (madge evans) tries to speak up for them. but digges has no time for coddling. his is a regime determined to break the boys so they behave themselves. unfortunately, digges and his bookkeeper partner are greedy. they have been serving inferior food to the boys and pocketing the profit. one day a new official comes from the state to look at the reform school. it's jimmy cagney, who is a hack ward heeler whose gang got the vote out for edward maxwell. as a reward (he could not get the park commissioner post) cagney was made an assistant school inspector. he is supported by his hanger-on pal and factotum allan jenkins (in his first warner brother film). the irony is that if digges were a bit more careful, cagney would probably have let him continue running things. but cagney arrives to see darro brought to digges for fighting. the warden and darrow have had problems about respect earlier, and digges now intends to punish darro who flees - but get seriously injured by digges' barbed wire fences and his free use of a whip. cagney stops digges and lets evans treat darro's injuries. and she explains the reality of the situation to cagney, and her own idea of real reformatory reform of the boys by building up trust in them with responsibility.the film follows this to the end, showing that cagney and evans are on the right path, turning the reformatory as a "republic" for the boys to run properly. this leads to conflict with digges, whose profiteering is reduced as he is no longer getting supplies. but the scheme is derailed when cagney himself finds he may be in serious trouble with the law. digges sees his opportunity and fully takes it. but then he goes too far...far more than he ever bargained for.the 1930s had many films showing kids taking steps to right wrongs and change things. darro appeared in such as wild boys of the road. cecil b. de mille did this day and age, where the kids teach a lesson to a gangster played by charles bickford that scares the hell out of him. so it went in the 1930s. the mayor of hell reaches a similar intensity of vengeance and juvenile justice seeking. but that's the one problem of the film. digges' character is a knave and hypocrite, so we never really cheer for him, yet if he wasn't a thief we might go along with his view (even if it is counter-productive). the scenes at the start of darro and his gang preying on people actually make the harshness digges would follow seem fairly understandable (even if his thieving ways are not). also he has one moment when he's justifiably angry at cagney - at that point in hiding from his own clash with the law - giving orders over a phone from long distance to a befuddled digges. when digges learns what's actually happened he is justifiably furious at cagney lecturing him about proper behavior. it is the closest thing to making mr. thompson sympathetic in this fine movie.

this one of those social dramas that wb knew how to put together and were guaranteed boxoffice hits in the thirties. this early "dead end kids" are sent to a reform school where they are mistreated. cagney, a gangster as part of a deal is appointed as the commissioner of the school. he doesn't take it seriously at first but he changes and makes the necessary changes to improve the lives of the boys. the idea is to let the boys rule and administer their community. whether this is sound social reform is beyond my belief but it's a movie. it's a lot like boys town with a slight darker tone. a useless happy ending deluges what impact the scene prior hard but is still good. wb would later make this same movies with bogart in the cagney/fatherly role.

james cagney (the yankee doodle dandy boy) was just starting his career and was able to perform as a gangster and also a social worker for a boys reform school which is being run by corrupt politicans. the reform school inmates are underpriviledge minors from the streets of new york, like the "east side kids" who were poor and uncared for during the great depression. in the final scenes, there is a trial held by the reform school boys with flaming torches and a barn which is set on fire and a big leap by the corrupt warden. i noticed that they did let the horses out of the barn first. this film is not shown very often and i really can understand why!

james cagney, racketeer and political ward heeler, get to become a deputy commissioner of corrections and visits a boys reform school. the catch is that cagney is not in it for the graft, he genuinely wants to make a difference in the lives of the kids there because he comes from a background like their's.the villain of the piece is dudley digges who is a grafting chiseler and a sanctimonious hypocrite to boot. one of the subtexts of the plot of the mayor of hell is that these kids are mostly immigrants and those that judge them and are in positions of power are those who are here a few generations. note in the mess hall scene as digges offers a prayer of thanks for the food they are about to receive, digges is eating well, but the kids are getting quality you wouldn't feed to your pet.cagney has his own troubles back in the city with some of his henchmen and he has to take it on the lam. that puts digges back in charge and setting up the film for it's climax.the mayor of hell was a typical product from the working class studio. and because it was pre-code it gets pretty gruesome at times. a later version of this, crime school, with humphrey bogart and the dead end kids, was a more sanitized remake.although cagney is fine in the lead role as is madge evans the school nurse, the acting honors go to dudley digges. hard to believe that the same man could portray the drunken, but kindly, one legged ship's surgeon in mutiny on the bounty. but digges is a fine player and a joy to watch in every film he's in. this film is not shown to often because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes it portrays. a whole lot of minorities would be offended today. still it's a fine film.interestingly enough a few years ago the film sleepers came out and it touched on some of the same issues. i guess films about reform schools don't change in any time.

this is a typically fast-moving entertaining movie of the early 1930s. when you have james cagney in the lead, these "pre-code" films are even better: just fun stuff to watch. usually, when films are "dated," it's a negative but not so with films from 1930-1934. yeah, with the slang and the attitudes, dress, hairstyles, etc., they are dated but that's a big part of the fun. these films have an edge to them that almost always are fun to view.they also have a corniness which is appealing and fascinating. you see people - like the juvenile delinquents pictured in this film and their goofy parents - that you just don't see in any period but this one (early '30s). early on this movie, the kids go before the judge and you sit and just laugh at these crazy characters that appear in court on behalf of their kids, one after the other. yes, we get the stereotypical emotional italian father; the jewish dad; the anglo-saxon mom and a few other moms who all, in dramatic form, plead theirs is "a good boy." even though things are predictable in some cases, you don't mind because everyone in here is so much fun to watch.this also teaches you that kids were punks 75 years ago, too, stealing, robbing, mugging, lying - hey, that's the human condition. this movie debunks the theory that "people were nicer back in the old days." no, people have always been rotten or good. the degree was aided by their environment, parents, financial situation and other things. here, we get a bunch of "dead end" kids who wind up in reform school.the ridiculous and stupidly-liberal storyline has kids acting immediately like angels once they run the show at the reform school; not punished in the slightest for causing a man to fall to his death and setting the institution on fire (the explanation: he was a meanie and deserved it. so much for real justice and reform.); and "patsy" shooting a guy bit never having to even be questioned by police because he's the good guy! notice the subtle anti-religious dig in which the only guy seen praying is the evil "warden." that's no coincidence, no accident. that sort of negative-association things has been going on ever since the hays code was canned in the late '60s and was seen, as you see hear, in the pre-code early '30s.dudley digges, by the way, is outstanding in his "bad guy" role of "mr. thomson." i especially his voice was very effective and could picture him playing one of those similarly-evil roles as an institution boss in a charles dickens film adaptation. cagney played his normal role, the take-no-guff tough guy who gets the pretty girl, "dorothy griffith," played by madge blake. frankie darro also was effective as the leader of the boys, "jimmy smith." just the looks on darro's face alone made his character believable. some thing he was the real star of the film, but i'll still go with cagney. the rest of the reform school kids weren't too believable and they were really ethnic stereotypes, but they were all fun to watch.i thought the most interesting part of the film was the first 20 minutes when we saw how bad these kids were and witnessed the good and bad and stereotypical parents in the court after the kids were arrested. those scenes are pure 1930s dead end kids stuff. they always showed the kids to be bad news at the beginning of the film, but by the time the story was over they all looked acting more like wally and beaver cleaver - hardly rough "delinquents." it's very far-fetched but it works, entertainment-wise.overall, a hokey but very entertaining movie, typical of cagney films and those of the early '30s. almost all of them rate at least eight stars for their entertainment value.

the great james cagney, top-billed in big letters, doesn't show up till the movie's second third, and probably has less screen time than dudley digges, who plays the eee-vill reform-school potentate. but when jimmy arrives, as a deputy commissioner of something-or-other out to reform reform schools, he slashes the air with his hands and jumps on the balls of his feet and spits out punchy warners-first national dialogue with all the customary, and expected, panache. the psychology in this crisp antique, one of warners' many efforts to assert its place as the "socially conscious" studio, doesn't run deep: digges is bad just because the script requires him to be, and there's the quaint notion that juvenile delinquents will turn into swell kids if they're just given a dash of autonomy. but it's made in that spare, fast style that the studio specialized in, and it never bores. frankie darro, who got into all kinds of onscreen trouble during a brief tenure as warners' favorite rotten street kid, is an ideal jd -- a handsome, charismatic toughie with a pug nose and a hate-filled stare that could wither steel. no kid actor today can touch him.

it is the best movie on acting i have ever seen. all the artists are old turkish theater actors, they are magnificent in this movie.it is sometimes said that "they do not act, they live it", you can really see this in this movie. the director is also competent, you cannot see lots of moving cameras around but the positions of the cameras are also good. but after the acting, the most outstanding part is the content of the movie. it gives happiness, enthusiasm, desire to live, importance of real friends to people. we all started to live individually nowadays, in this film you see that there are someone other then us. and most importantly, you see that the most honorable feeling in the world is love, loving your friends, loving your darling. all people should see this movie...

i mention that there may be a spoiler here just to be cautious because of what i discuss, although i don't really think i am giving away anything important. any "suprises" are really unimportant to this film's success or a viewer's ability to enjoy it. while not without some very minor flaws, this is a beautiful and very moving film about friendship, time, uncertainty, and the choices people make about their lives. yet, at the same time, it is also a very humorous film, with small, mostly understated bits of comedy woven in throughout. for much of the film, it progresses at a fairly leisurely pace, but it does not seem slow at all since the film draws one into it and into the lives of the characters, and at first it is mostly rather light-hearted. some have commented that much of the film seems slow, but it is such a wonderful portrayal of the lives of such sympathetic characters that one could watch it almost endlessly. as it progresses, the film becomes more emotional and moving up to the very end and the progression is handled wonderfully. eventually, some of the characters decide to rob a bank and although it is perhaps somewhat hard to believe, that is beside the point. it is a wonderful addition to emphasise the love that these friends have for each other while at the same time it accents the humour and adds a little more irony to the film. and, although hardly original to have a bunch of old guys rob a bank, the context and details are quite original and they do it wonderfully, making it really quite funny as well, such as when ismet (if i remember correctly) exaggerates his aggressiveness to "disguise" the fact he's old.as i said, most of the other comedy is rather low-key but still very humorous so i was constantly chuckling throughout. the actors are probably the real key to this film. they imbue the characters with deep personality and sympathy and portray them with great care and warmth. there are some small transformations or tiny details of the characters' personalities which are pulled off smoothly and beautifully. of course, the film is about the personalities of these very characters and how they care for and interact with one another. it succeeds so well because of them and if lesser actors had the roles the movie could well have failed.gule gule is not without sadness, but that simply provides the full range of emotions and provides a more powerful experience. in fact, the film is so moving and filled with so much love from such rich characters that it is in the end a very heart-warming, satisfying, and even happy film despite its sadness. i could watch it over and over.

peak practice was a british drama series about a gp surgery in cardale  a small fictional town in the derbyshire peak district  and the doctors who worked there. it ran on itv from 1993 to 2002, and was one of their most successful series at the time. it originally starred kevin whately as dr jack kerruish, amanda burton as dr beth glover, and simon shepherd as dr will preston, though the roster of doctors would change many times over the course of the series.the series was axed in 2002 and ended on a literal cliffhanger when two of the series main characters plunged off a cliff. viewers wrote to itv in their thousands and a petition for one last episode was set up by website peak practice online. however, all pleas were unsuccessful and itv said they would not make any more episodes.peak practice was replaced by sweet medicine, another medical series set in derbyshire. it lasted a few episodes before it was dropped from the schedules.cardale was based on the derbyshire village of crich, and the series was filmed there and at other nearby derbyshire towns and villages, most notably matlock and ashover. after the end of this programme, itv attempted to launch a follow-up series called sweet medicine, which extended the stories of different characters from the original show.

if you have not heard of this film, it follows two sudanese refugees from a refugee camp in africa to america, where they convince themselves they will find success and riches. life is harder than expected in the states, and this film beautifully captures the frustration felt when things are not going right. the lives are captured so well many moments seem scripted because they're so perfect. whether it be on the job, at school, or the time in between, the two boys, peter and santino, are very honest with the filmmakers, and make some very thought-provoking comments about life in the states. it's one of the only documentaries i can recall that, when it ended, i wanted it to go on for another two hours. it might be difficult to find this movie cause it didn't get great distribution, but check your local "art house" or independent theater and give this one a go (side note, if you're reading this when it's already on video then definitely it's worth a rent). rating: 28/40

well made documentary focusing on two sudanese refugees who get resettled in the united states. it's your basic fish out of water story with a non-fiction twist. i found it fascinating to see how peter and santino lived prior to coming to america and how they adapted once they arrived here (in houston, texas.) they expected a sort of heaven but found out that it's a lot harder than it looks to cope well in the states. they go from hopeful idealists to somewhat more realistic skeptics. everywhere they go they meet bureaucrats with paper trails that most citizens may take for granted. they fret that they are blacker than the african-americans here and don't feel accepted because of that. one of the "lost boys" manages to leave houston to go to olathe, kansas, where he finds conditions slightly better but still less than ideal. there are people that try to help them as well as try to hurt them in this film. not shown, but talked about, are those who put a gun to their heads and robbed them, leading one lost boy to comment negatively that "all black people in america are no good." i found it interesting, too, that they arrived in houston in august 2001, a month before the world trade center was attacked by terrorists. i had hoped to see their reaction to this tragedy but it's not mentioned at all. still, all in all, a really well done documentary with no narration. none is needed really. the "lost boys" do a fine job expounding on the events going on around them without any help at all, thank you very much.

i've heard about this documentary for so long i knew i needed to take the time to watch it. as a documentary it's very well done, in that it takes a neutral observant view of their experience. there are no voice-overs, or interviewing. it is honest. it is true. it is also humbling. two comments really stayed with me after the film was done. one was how the boys are told to not to become like the american boys who wear the baggy pants, and how in africa there is time but no money, but in america there is money but no time. the biggest impact was how the boys hungered for education, and how one of the boys totally relocated himself so he could go to school. i watched this film with a high school sophomore who said it upset him to see how the boys were brought to their new life without any real orientation to america. he also said he knew so many american teens who simply cannot appreciate howblessed their lives are in america. i would agree with him on both accounts. a strong film that will leave a person thinking about many things.

in sudan, the arabs rule and are constantly at war with the christians and animists who inhabit the southern portion of this east african country. this film follows a group of of dinka boys, a tribe of cattle herders, whom were left orphaned after their village was destroyed and their families killed in a brutal attack carried out by the arab forces. most of these boys are now teenagers and have been dubbed "the lost boys".the filmmaker follows a group of the "lost boys" on their journey, as they have been accepted as refugees in the us, where they will land in houston. those who've been accepted as refugees gain celebrity status, as they feel (from what they've heard) that america is amazing. making a trip from sudan to america is like "making a trip to heaven" says the one young man. a huge party is thrown for their departure, and they are told to do sudan well, and once they have been educated, to return to sudan so that they can contribute to dinka society. they are also warned not to be like "those with the baggy pants" whom are responsible for the negative stereotype of black men, and also, no matter what happens, not to forget the dinka culture.you watch as the boys come from a third world country into america and how they attempt to integrate into american society, as they have gone from a place with practically nothing to this plentiful world where everything is massively overproduced and overconsumed. they are taught about cleanliness and how to use all the utilities that we take for granted on a daily basis. it is humorous at times, humbling at others.listening to the comments they make about black americans and american society/culture are quite interesting. as the film progresses you see how american culture begins to corrupt their previously humble ways of thinking.one of the boys, peter, is not content with working and making just enough to survive, so he up and moves from houston to kansas city so that he can pursue an education. when the other boys visit him, they talk about how they cannot get into any schools. the main reason they came to america was to get an education and the media is saying that the boys have been brought from sudan for an education. this is occurring because the boys were given arbitrary ages, making them older than they actually are, preventing them from being able to enroll in high school.the film juxtaposes images from houston to kansas. we watch as peter enrolls in school, where he befriends a group of christian conservative kids, and as santiago attempts driving school(even though he drives without his license anyways), and works at walmart. we see peter struggle with high school life as he strives to make his schools basketball team, and as santiago has trouble keeping up with work, the rent, appeasing tensions back home in sudan, and most of all, coping with loneliness.it comes to the point where the boys want to return to sudan, and tell them that everything they are taught about america there is lies. "you must make it alone here, do everything alone" one of the boys says. a damning message to a liberal capitalist lifestyle, showing how it causes people to become radical individualists (a trend which led to the creation of both the neo-conservative and radical islamist movements). their biggest beef with america though, is that there is no time; time is money and we don't waste a second! despite all this, the boys never lose their sense of dinka culture. they celebrate southern sudan liberation day, which marks the day which the spla began to fight in sudan, a fight which continues today. they also meet with other "lost boys" on the anniversary of their arrival in america, where they discuss their experience in america as compared to back in sudan. when asked, one boy says that if he were able to make a living he would much prefer to live in sudan. it is much too lonely in america he adds. they never lose their sense of community, which has been conditioned into them as part of their culture!this film makes us question the way we live, makes us question the artificial happiness that materialism and the nature of our societies has created within us. it will also change the way i look at refugees, i will never again take for granted how hard they must work and what immigrants mean for a country such as my own, canada. this is a wonderful film. i laughed, i cried..a very emotional journey, and a very well made documentary. 10 out of 10.

this documentary is not only one of the best documentaries i've seen, but also one of the most moving and quietly beautiful movies i've seen period. it follows the lives of two sudanese young men, peter and santino, as they try to make their way into the american culture. peter and santino are friends at first, but they gradually drift more and more apart, as peter goes to kansas city, and santino stays in houston ("a land called houston"). santino's beauty is in his eyes. he takes people onto his back, he supports an apartment full of other sudanese, paying the rent, doing everything for other people. he is a quiet sufferer. peter looks out for himself, getting a high school education while playing basketball and making christian friends. it seems that director megan mylan did not know what she was getting herself into with the beauty of this tale. peter and santino are amazing characters that move you. but the real strength in this movie lies in its commentary on american society. it is not judging. it shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world, and how difficult it can be to outside people. i suggest you find this film, and look at america through the lives of these two fascinating and beautiful people.my grade: 10/10

what a crazy film!it lasts 12(!) hours and you don't understand who these people are and what are they doing!the main plot is about a bunch of clueless actors trying to bring on scene "prometheus",but there are lots of sub-plots,like the disappearing of thomas and a crazy guy looking for monsieur warok....what's the meaning of all this???

i loved this movie! so worth the long running time. i need help with the ending though....*spoiler*the final shot of marie at the end - is this to suggest that she is still searching for renaud? or possibly that she was the one who wanted to reinvigorate the 13? (she seemed to be the one who delivered the initial letter to colin in the first place) i don't quite understand it, but i know i really liked it. so if anyone has seen this and remembers it or has just seen it, please elaborate on the ending.thanks

one has to be careful whom one tells about watching 12-hour long films. it could become easy for people to assume that this is some kind of regular occurrence - in fact, even in the world of 'arthouse' cinema, such mammoth running times are extremely rare, for obvious reasons. this is one thing that hollywood and art cinema share in common: the generally accepted running time of 90-120 minutes, with a minority of movies that dare to approach, but rarely exceed, the three-hour mark.for this reason, a film like out 1 (runtime: 729 minutes) is a challenge for even the most hardened cinephile, and it goes some way in explaining why it has only ever been screened on a handful of occasions and remains extremely hard to find.originally devised as a tv series by maverick nouvelle vague director jacques rivette, it raised little interest from the french networks, and wound up being given a brief theatrical run instead (peter watkins was forced to do much the same with his brilliant nuclear war pseudo- documentary the war game, although that had more to do with state censorship than issues with running time). shown a couple of times in 1971, out 1 has re-emerged at a handful of rivette retrospectives over the last two decades, and many who have seen it, including esteemed us critic jonathan rosenbaum, have acclaimed it as one of the greatest films of all time.is it? well, yes, if you like rivette. that alone is a big 'if', as jacques rivette has never been a commercially successful director. only two of his films were hits (celine and julie go boating (1974) and la belle noiseuse (1991), both superb), and many remain difficult to find on dvd today (out 1 only recently became available over the internet after a rare videotape was uploaded). nevertheless, he is greatly respected within the film community, and with good reason - his playfully surreal narratives, sense of pacing and use of improvisation set him apart as one of cinema's most unique and satisfying film-makers.out 1 deals with a theme that re-occurs throughout rivette's work: the nature of acting, particularly in the context of theatre and improvisation. his fascination with acting make rivette's films a far more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries, as the improvisational aspects allow actors to have a far more active role in determining how the film comes together. out 1 is roughly divided into four major narratives, gradually intertwining and blurring as the film develops: two consisting of acting troupes, each trying to devise post-modern theatrical adaptations of aeschylus plays; the other two individual petty thieves (played by nouvelle vague icons jean-pierre léaud and juliet berto) pursuing eccentric methods of making money; and an overarching plot involving a mysterious balzac-inspired conspiracy centred around an organisation known as 'the thirteen'.as with any rivette film featuring a 'conspiracy' narrative, the mysteries and secret organisations are little more than a red herring. as the characters are slowly explored and revealed and their plans and interpersonal connections break down, the film becomes increasingly symbolic of post-1968 ennui and the decline of the ideals of that era. for a film made in 1971, these were remarkably prescient themes; another french director in jean eustache would tackle this topic equally satisfyingly in his 1973 masterpiece the mother and the whore. but this is not the limit of out 1's scope. comprised of eight episodes of roughly 90 minutes each (the beginning of each episode has a brief, abstract black-and-white still montage of the events of the previous chapter), out 1 is no less watchable than any quality tv series, and may even be better experienced on a one-episode- at-a-time basis. this is not to say that it doesn't remain challenging even when viewed in segments. like most rivette films, it uses the first few hours to simply establish the characters before embarking on the plot, of sorts, and some of those early scenes (particularly the sequences depicting the actors' heavily abstracted 'exercises') seem interminably long. these scenes are important, however, not just as an exploration of the improvisational acting methods that play both a literal and a metaphorical role in the film, but as a method of adjusting the viewer to the somewhat languorous pace of the film. paradoxically, long takes make long films far more tolerable for an audience, and this understanding of pacing has led rivette, along with more modern directors like michael haneke and béla tarr, to create films with less commercial running-times that nevertheless retain the capacity to leave viewers enthralled.in a film that is in many ways about acting, the acting is fantastic. many famous nouvelle vague faces appear, including the aforementioned léaud and berto, the outstanding michel lonsdale and rivette regular bulle ogier. even another legendary director in eric rohmer has a great cameo as a balzac professor who appears in a pivotal scene. the people and architecture of paris c. 1971, though, seem to have an equally significant role - the city landscapes, crowd scenes and interested onlookers freeze out 1 in time, a document of a place at a point in history.after a little more than 720 minutes, the film ends on an impossibly brief, enigmatic note; yet, the exhausting journey that the viewer has taken is so full of possibilities, intricacy and spontaneity, that one would be forgiven for wanting to start all over again from the beginning, or see the next twelve hours in the lives of these characters. for those who have watched many kinds of cinema and think they have seen everything the art form has to offer, out 1 is a reminder that cinema has the potential to be so many more things and diverge in so many more directions than current conventions allow. for film-makers, film critics and artists of all disciplines, this is something to be cherished.

this is the very la nouvelle vague.one of the best films of the new wave and i dare say one of the first ten ever made! why? the atmosphere, the story,the actors (actress) are all brilliant. this is the theater, a fairy tale, the life, the film.paris. thank you mr.rivette.

i think that pierre léaud, or his character, to be precise, is really outlandish but with grace: i also remember the chess player, and of the girl who seems to be appearing by chance in his home, something really curious...the woman acting as the lawyer, is to me one of the most beautiful actresses ever seen on the screen...but i must admit that the plot is too inconsistent to be taken seriously....the character who plays as the lead theater actor is really nice, especially when he's annoyed by the new actor, the one in purple t-shirt...also, the scene where the bearded actor - who belongs to another company - directs the stage is really fascinating and relaxing, as it often happens with this movie - for example, when they drink tea, they just make you want to have a cup...

the museum of the moving image here in new york recently put on a comprehensive retrospective of jacques rivette's films. having fallen in love with his "paris nous appartient", i decided this was not to be missed.largely through extended shots and flexibly structured scenes, the movie depicts two avant-garde theater companies preparing their renditions of aeschylus' "seven against thebes" and "prometheus". additionally, we are shown the directionless day-to-day lives of two individuals distantly connected to the companies: a working class woman named frederique who finds creative ways of hustling men out of their money, and a young man named colin who visits local cafés posing as a deaf-mute, and plays shrill harmonica at the patrons until they pay him to go away. the first four hours or so are devoted to establishing the characters and their patterns, before a somewhat loose, whimsical plot finally emerges involving a conspiracy and the decoding of clandestine secret letters.the film is largely about life on the fringe of society. the theater companies are a despairing affair, using their elaborate, emotionally draining exercises (which are really something to watch) to distract themselves from the fact that their acts are unlikely ever to be staged or even seen. colin and frederique both have very few friends, who only briefly find any excitement or purpose after the conspiracy touches them, as they are spurred to find out more about it. the film meditates on the consequences of rejecting normal society in several memorable sequences, including a long shot of colin as he wanders the streets of france shouting poetry to himself. as such, the film has been referred to as an analysis of 1960's counterculture.there is not a frame of the film that is not bursting with energy and vitality. the fact that much of the dialogue and movement is improvised makes the characters much more spontaneous, much more immediate. the camera also becomes an important character in this regard; throughout the movie boom shadows are visible here and there, or other similar errors, yet they seem natural and fit with the flow of the action because the camera is so important a player therein.more than anything for me, the film seems a great example of another way of making movies, a venue for film outside the usual pattern. for me it was a mind-opening experience, even more than "paris nous appartient", though the latter bears many similarities of theme and structure. a must-see for anybody pondering the nature of art.

ok, if you would judge the movie to now a days it wouldn't fit in to well.if you watched fi now the stage and everything was pretty cheese ( i agree)but weren't all the movies in the 80's like that(gilligan,wonderwoman,aso).but too the people born in the early to mid 70's or earlier it has a cult status. evertime the plane was on approach tattoo would run up the tower ring the bell and with his accent would yell "da plane boss da plane" and you would wonder what everybody's wish would be.people who are born in the mid 80's or later wouldn't understand the hippe because if you watched it now.it don't have a harry potter,jurassic park computer animation fx.it was just a stage where you probably could even almost see the wire attached to a guy who's wish was too be able to fly.but to us during that time it was a fantasy island.

after reading some of the earlier nasty remarks, i had to put in my two cents. this show was not, despite what that goon in essex thinks, the worst thing that ever aired on tv. i think most of today's tv is much worse (when is this stupid "reality" fad ever going to end??) and there isn't a current show i can stand to watch. gimme the stuff i grew up with. i'm a 1965 baby and not ashamed to admit it.this show has been my all-time favorite for almost 30 years. i was in high school when it originally aired and i think it helped me to hang on throughout those miserable days. i was such a misfit back then, and "fantasy island" appealed to my imagination. as i was a budding writer in those days, it provided incredible opportunities for me to practice the craft. what a wonderful premise! i won't say it didn't have its faults. sometimes the scripts were pretty bad, and some of the problems seemed trivial; but it could be good too, and it was a blast to watch and still is. as for the cheesiness factor, well, i think it's unfair to label every single 70s product as cheesy. there was a lot of great stuff back then and this was among the ranks. (btw, most of the seasons aired in the 80s!!) my favorite episodes came from seasons 2, 3 and 4 mostly.to those who disparage hervé villechaize for his heavy french accent and his short stature: grow up and learn something! it's so easy to make fun when you're "normal" and "perfect". that man made the best of what he was dealt in life, and if you don't like it, that's just tough. have a little compassion. he's been dead 15 years, and how easy it is to cut down someone who can't defend himself. there's just no shame anymore.i love this show. so it looks dated. hate to tell you this, but we didn't have splashy special effects and blu-ray discs. we were lucky to have vcrs. live with it. accept it for what it is, and that's just plain fun. "escapist tv" describes it perfectly, and that's what it was for me -- an escape from my rotten real life. and it's still a lot of fun to watch.

i must warn you, there are some spoilers in it. but to start it off, i got "spanish judges" on february i think. it was mention it was the last copy, but as i see, it wasn't back-ordered. but either way, i have it. i thought it was good. i wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor, matthew lillard (i'm surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar) although it is kind of low budget, getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending. man, what a good actor.the story it about a con artist known as jack (matthew lillard) who "claims" to have merchandises called the spanish judges. if you don't know what spanish judges are or haven't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read, i won't even say what they are. i figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was. he needs protection, so he hires a couple who are also crooks, max and jamie (vincent d'onofrio and valeria golino) as well as a crook that goes by the name of piece (mark boone junior). he has a girlfriend who won't even tell anyone her name because she's from mars, as she said. so they (mainly jack) call her "mars girl". everything starts out fine, but then it turns to one big game. a game that involves some lust, lies and betrayal.there was some over acting in it (matt and valeria, as well as tamara, were not one of them). there were some scenes they could've done better and the score could've been a little better as well. some of the score was actually good. the theme they used for the beginning and the end (before the credits) was a good song choice, that's my opinion. the fight scene in the end could've been a little longer and a little more violent, but what can you do? one more comment on matt: damn, he plays a smooth, slick con man.i know this is a review, but i need to make a correction towards necro, one of the reviewers: valeria golino is not a newcomer. according to this site, she has been acting since 1983. to me, and hopefully to others, she is well known as charlie sheen's italian love interest in both the "hot shots!" movies. but good review.although i think it's one of the rare films i've seen and it's really good (which is why i gave it 10 stars above), i will give the grade of what i thought when i first saw it.8/10

im a huge m lillard fan that's why i ended up watching this movie. honestly i doubt that if he wasn't in the movie i would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it but once i did watch it realize the story was pretty decent. a bad ending i must say but i did see it coming. it's a low budget movie and some of the actors weren't really good but all in all i rated this movie 7/10.the suspense of wondering what lillard was actually up to was what really keeped me interested in this movie.its a good rental!7/10

wow, i can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie.although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is matt lillard, granted most people probably either think he's too caffeine happy or just plain sucks but we're both the same age and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that he's one of my favorites now. this is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in slc punk, another great lillard film.baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything, which start to amount to craziness. also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincent d'onofrio, a very under appreciated person in the film industry. the woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isn't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)it's a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one. they all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. matt shows his true prowess as the scheming jack who initially starts the whole scheme. vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business. vince's character is a bit deranged and skitz's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film.the surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like. this movie kept me very interested besides the fact matt was in it, it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies. critic's probably won't like this movie, but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway.

this review is based on the producer's cut: 'halloween 5' was a major disappointment at the box office way back in '89. personally, i've always loved it and am proud to have it in my collection. but because of it's failure and also because of rights issues, it would be 6 years before we would see another installment. the film had the makings of being one of the best, if not the best in the series. a hardcore fan writing the script, the return of not only donald pleasence as dr. loomis and george wilbur as michael myers, but also the return of the character of tommy doyle from the first film, a major studio backing the project, and a fall release all made the film sound like a hit in the making. so what went wrong? i'll give you two good reasons: re-shoots and poor editing. due to a bad test screening and also the unfortunate passing of donald pleasence, the film was changed, and not for the better. the film, like parts iii and 5, tanked at the box office and earned negative reviews from both critics and most series fans. but then, thanks to the magic of bootlegging, the original cut leaked out and many fans, including my self, were very happy. i will end this portion of my review by saying this: this film is, so far at least, my favorite 'halloween' film and i'm not afraid to admit that.pros: the score is simply spellbinding. has some of the best writing and dialogue of the series. 'halloween 4' emulated the original in that it was more about suspense and mood instead of blood and guts, and 6 is the same way. great performances, especially from the late and very missed donald pleasence. moves at a breathtaking pace. an interesting explanation for michael's evil and why he won't die. some brutal kills. some pretty chilling moments, my favorite being the one involving kim darby's character. a lot of really cool nods to the previous films. some good surprises. like the previous two sequels, this one has an awesome cliffhanger ending.cons: though the explanation for michael's evil is fascinating, it does make him a little less scary. since when can michael move around from place to place so fast? final thoughts: this was the first 'halloween' that i saw in the theatre. i was so excited because i really had thought 5 would be the last and then i heard this was happening. i enjoyed it at the time, but over time i saw it for what it really was: a great movie trapped in an ok one with a terrible ending. why did the filmmakers have to listen to the people at the test screenings? if they had released this superior version it may have done much better and the series might not be stuck in the mess it's in right now.my rating: 5/5

i personally love this film amidst the halloween series. i've found, after watching it with many friends, that you enjoy it completely, or find it absolutely unbearable. personally, i've watched it dozens of times, and it never gets old. there is a great back story within the movie itself, and a lot of different things are finally explained. it's a rather short movie, at just shy of 90-minutes, but it's definitely a thrill ride.the shape seems to be pretty brutal in this film, but the acting is still there with the way he walks, stalks and kills. there are a lot of neat little screen shots with micheal appearing in the background, which adds more of a spooky element to the movie.

halloween:the curse of michael myers is probably the best sequel out of all of the halloween flicks. jamie, serial killer michael myers' niece, bears a baby who is then taken by the man in black from the conclusion of halloween 5. a kind nurse helps jamie escapes but myers quickly tracks her down and kills her. jamie's baby is found and rescued by tommy doyle, one of the kids jamie lee babysat in the original film, and myers arrives in haddonfield and begins to kill off the strode clan living in his old house. the film concludes with scenes revealing clues to michael's evil, the identity of the man in black, and a close to the whole dr. loomis/michael myers storyline. i highly recommend this brilliant horror masterpiece.halloween:the curse of michael myers is rated r for strong graphic violence, extreme gore, brief sexuality, language, and brief nudity.

although i brought this film by accident (i thought it was the original halloween(stupid eh!)) i was surprised by how good it was, many sequels just continue the events of the previous films, this however tried and succeeded in explaining the events of the prequels, why does michael myers kill people and how come he seems to have supernatural abilities. i thought this was a top horror film full of action, suspense and surprises, i'm very glad i brought it. i've given it 9 out of 10.

...dislike this movie and everyone would understand why. the plot is poor, so is the acting. but in my opinion it is better than halloween 5, although even this does not give many surprising moments. a few scenes are really well directed. but these few moments do not deliver the reason to rent it. i do not despise violence in movies, but h6 features extraordinary strong and bloody scenes which do not fit to the tradition of the halloween-movies. the most sucking aspect about h6 is the lack of tension. no comparison to the first masterpiece.halloween 6 only gets 4 out of 10 stars from me. if you want, rent it. but don't expect a great horror-experience....

i bought this in the budget department last week. i had halloween and halloween ii already, and since i aim to collect every horror film ever, i chose this. after all, the 1st two were good.this film is pretty intelligent to tell the truth. it seems to create the correct atmosphere, and has a nice "history of michael myers". it uses the old locations from the original, and the main character is the kid whom laurie strode babysat that fateful halloween in 1978...the climax also is fairly satisfying. anyways, it is a lot better than h20, which frankly, is absolute crap.

this sequel is brilliant and is the last film donald pleasance (dr.loomis) worked on before his death. i loved the new direction the film took with the story instead of just michael myers wanting to kill his family. i love this whole series and apart from the first and second movies this is by far the best.

i just saw this at the toronto international film festival in the beautiful elgin theatre. i was blown away by the beautiful cinematography, the brilliant adaptation of a very tricky play and last but not least, the bravura performance of al pacino, who was born to play this role, which was perfectly balanced by an equally strong performance from jeremy irons.the film deftly explores the themes of love vs loyalty, law vs justice, and passion vs reason. some might protest that the content is inherently anti-semitic, however they should consider the historical context of the story, and the delicate and nuanced way in which it is told in this adaptation.9/10

the inherent problem with any staging of 'the merchant of venice' has never been the pseudo-controversial anti-semitism, but the fact that there are two story lines wildly different in both tone and content; a frothy romantic comedy and a searing tragedy. while mixing genres was all the rage in the sixteenth century (and mocked by shakespeare in hamlet), it rarely fails to grate with modern audiences. as a result, most directors are forced to place an emphasis on one storyline at the expense of the other, and it is no surprise that the decision falls in the favour of shylock.like so many of shakespeare's great tragic heroes, shylock continues to fascinate after 400 years because he is such a difficult and complex character. pitiful, proud, angry, vengeful, weak, arrogant; his behaviour defies simply analysis and continues to be argued over. he is flawed not because he is a jew, but because he is human. rarely do modern screenwriters imbue their creations with such richly textured contradictions, and it is to everyone's benefit that we have shakespeare to draw on for inspiration.shakespearean language is wild and rambling, saturated in multiple meanings, word play and metaphor. to be understood it must be wrangled and tamed by an actor with the strength and knowledge to do so. when an actor fails, the words pour forth in a torrent of incomprehensible words, but when he succeeds, the english language springs to life with an immediacy and vibrancy that takes your breath away. al pacino is one such actor, and here displays an incredible level of clarity and control that, were there any justice, would sweep every award in the offering. he meets the challenge of presenting shylock head on, and delivers an extraordinarily subtle and nuanced performance. it would be a crime if we never got the opportunity to see what he does with king lear.the supporting cast is noteworthy. jeremy irons gives an original take on the familiar antonio, presenting an older, quieter figure that displays the unsavoury contradictions between medieval chivalry and ugly prejudice of the time. joseph fiennes is a revelation as he matures beyond superficial eye-candy to actually inhabit a character for once. lynn collins is the only disappointment. many of shakespeare's women are underwritten and require an actor to really work hard to bring them to life, and collins' gwyneth paltrow impersonation seems a little flat and unsuited to the darker tone that radford is aiming for.the design team must be acknowledged for creating a unique and thoroughly believable vision of late renaissance venice. the city has not looked this ominous since 'don't look now'. taking full advantage of extant locations and natural light, the film has an appearance of authenticity that is greatly enhanced by the dark and timeworn costume design. all, again, are worthy of award recognition.the financial backers of films such as this must be commended. with a budget of $30 million, they must go into such a venture in the full and certain knowledge that they will never make a profit, and yet they invest nonetheless. we can all be grateful for it, as the result is a remarkable adaptation that is sure to be a benchmark for many years to come.

michael radford has done an excellent job bringing this difficult play to the screen. he has taken a play with a reputation for anti-semitism, and shown us that shakespeare knew quite well the humanity of the jews. radford said after the screening, and i agree, that shylock is his first tragic hero, the first of his characters to be undone by a driving, compulsive need for revenge. he also points out, quite rightly, that a man who was anti-semitic could not have written shylock's speech of "if you prick me, do i not bleed?" radford is himself of jewish descent and he has picked out the good and bad of all characters with delicacy and honesty. no character is free from flaws; no character is evil. radford has placed the play in the 16th century, which gives a lush background of venetian politics and decadence on which to project shakespeare's words.if you get a chance to hear radford speak about the film, i highly recommend you take it, since he gives details about life in 16th century venice that illuminate a lot of the choices he made and give considerable extra depth to the viewing. i'm hoping that the dvd will come out with extensive commentary.jeremy irons does a gorgeous portrayal of antonio, a man who resigns himself to bearing the burden of his past misdeeds. lynn collins, a relative unknown, gives us an absolutely flawless, stunning, and detailed job as portia. not only is ms. collins beautiful - she also gives portia layers of intelligence and humor prior to the trial scene i've rarely seen in any production of this play. the rest of the cast also does a terrific job, with a notable performance by kris marshall as gratiano, and a beautifully subtle work by allan corduner as tubal, playing the foil to shylock. finally, while al pacino pulls out his usual strong (and loud) performance, his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he says no words, but you can see all the emotions and madnesses flowing into and out of him as he perceives his fortunes changing.if you like period movies, i cannot recommend this movie enough.

'the merchant of venice' is one of shakespeare's better-known plays and is still regularly performed in the theatre. incredibly, however, this film would seem to be the first-ever english-language version made for the cinema rather than television. there were a number of versions made in britain or america during the early days of the cinema, but these were all silents.the reason for this neglect of the play may be connected with sensitivities about the play's alleged anti-semitism, a subject which has been even more sensitive since the rise to power of the nazis in 1933. (this may explain why all previous versions were made during the silent era; in 1908 or 1922 it would have been easier to portray shylock as a straightforward villain than it would be today). yet in my view the film is not anti-semitic at all. it should be remembered that during shakespeare's lifetime there was no settled jewish community in england; the jews had been expelled by edward i in the late 13th century, and were not permitted to return until the time of cromwell, some forty years after shakespeare's death. as far as we know, shakespeare never travelled abroad, so it seems quite possible that he himself never knew any jews personally or experienced the effects of anti-semitism at first hand. the play is not simply about the jewish question, but is, among other things, an analysis of the corrosive effects of religious prejudice. it may, in fact, be a coded examination of the mutual antipathy between catholics and protestants in tudor england (something of which shakespeare certainly would have had first-hand experience) and an appeal for greater tolerance between them.then as now, traditional anti-semitic stereotypes had always depicted jews as avaricious, but shylock's principal sin is not avarice; if it were, he would certainly have accepted bassanio's offer to pay him six thousand ducats, twice the amount borrowed by antonio. rather, shylock's besetting sin is anger, and the root of his anger is the way in which he and his fellow-jews are treated by the christians of venice. not only are jews in general regarded as second-class citizens, but jewish moneylenders such as shylock are particular targets for abuse, even though the services they provide are necessary to the venetian economy. the play shows the corrupting effects of prejudice. not only do views of this sort corrupt the christians who hold them, they can also corrupt the jews who suffer abuse. shylock's vindictiveness is out of all proportion to the wrongs he has suffered. by spitting on him and calling him a dog, antonio behaves like a boorish bigot, but boorishness and bigotry are not generally regarded as crimes deserving of the death penalty. moreover, shylock seeks to revenge himself on antonio not merely for the undoubted wrongs that antonio has done towards him, but also for all the wrongs, real and imaginary, that he has suffered at the hands of the christian community, such as his daughter's marriage to lorenzo. it is to the credit of the film's director, michael radford and of its star, al pacino, that they understand all these issues. pacino's shylock has, initially, a sort of angry dignity about him that gradually gives way to vindictive rage and finally, after his humiliation in the trial scene by portia's reasoning, to pathos. we see clearly that he has been the instrument of his own destruction, but we can still sympathise with him. in my view, none of pacino's performances that i have seen have ever equalled those he gave in the first two 'godfather' films (not 'scent of a woman', for which he won an oscar, and certainly not 'godfather iii'), but 'the merchant of venice is the one that comes closest to those benchmarks. the other acting performance that stood out was lynn collins's luminous portia, speaking her lines with great clarity and simplicity and bringing out the intelligence and resourcefulness that make her character more than simply a romantic heroine. i was less impressed with jeremy irons's antonio, who seemed too passive. antonio is a complex character; part loyal friend, part melancholy contemplative, part religious bigot and part enterprising capitalist. although irons captured the first two of those aspects, it was difficult to envisage his antonio either spitting on someone of a different faith or hazarding his all on risky trading ventures. radford's interpretation of the play was attacked by the film critic of the 'daily telegraph' who, although he admired pacino's performance, disliked the period setting and argued that shakespeare needs to be placed in a contemporary setting if it is to have 'relevance' for a modern audience, citing a recent stage production which set the action in weimar germany. i would disagree profoundly with this approach. the theatre and the cinema are quite different media and, while there have been some striking modernist approaches to shakespeare in the cinema (trevor nunn's 'twelfth night' comes to mind), a traditionalist approach is often the best one. (i preferred, for example, zeffirelli's 'romeo and juliet' to baz luhrmann's). the idea that we can only appreciate shakespeare in a modern guise is sheer intellectual laziness; we are not prepared to make the effort to see our greatest writer in the context of the elizabethan society that produced him, but rather prefer him dressed up as an ersatz twentieth-century man.radford's traditional approach not only enables us to appreciate that bigotry and vindictiveness are age-old, universal problems, but also makes for a visually striking film. in the play, the scenes set in venice itself are characterised by turbulent action; those set in portia's country house at belmont are happier and more peaceful. in the film, the venetian exterior scenes were shot on location against a backdrop of misty, wintry grey skies, similar to the look achieved in 'don't look now'. the candlelit interiors, with faces brightly lit against a dark background, were reminiscent of the chiaroscuro effects of a caravaggio painting; i suspect this was quite deliberate, as caravaggio was a contemporary of shakespeare. by contrast to dark or misty venice, the belmont scenes (shot in an enchanting palladian villa on an island in a lake) were characterised by sunshine or peaceful moonlight. this is one of the best shakespeare adaptations of recent years; an intelligent and visually attractive look at a complex play. 8/10.a couple of errors. we see a black swan on the water in front of portia's house. these birds are natives of australia and were not introduced to europe until well after 1596, the date when the film is set. also, the portrait of portia in the leaden casket is painted in the style of the florentine botticelli, who was active about a century before that date. lynn collins may be reminiscent of a botticelli beauty, but it seems unlikely that a late 16th century venetian lady would have had herself painted in the manner of late 15th century florence.

this movie has a decent story in my opinion,very good fight scenes but i was a little bit disappointed by the end of the movie.i think that it was a way better if lydie denier knew karate also or if she knew to use some weapons,her character has become more interesting too and she was a decent opponent to cynthia.i think when the director filmed the final 'battle' between cynthia&denier he wanted to finish the movie earlier so he didn't care how the end was going to be.all in all i think that fans of cynthia rothrock will be very satisfied watching this movie.it's not like 'yes,madam'! or sworn to justice but it was entertainment enough and cynthia looks awesome in this movie so my rate for this movie is a solid 8/10

when you think of golf movies, you think of caddyshack, but what if there are kids around? go right to this movie! disney uses is proved formula to make a movie that the adults and the kids will enjoy. the acting in this movie, in my opinion, is quite good and the leading cast, for the most part, is very young! this movie is also suprsingly filmed very well and unique, seeing all the angles of the golf game. i think this movie should be up for some academy awards for film editing or something like that because the entire flow of the film is top notch. though the ending might be a little predictable, the movie does well on its own! it also shows that you do not need swearing, nudity, or violence to make a great golf movie!

when i first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video. i finally got around and rented it. i thought it was going to be bad because i couldn't see shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show "even stevens". when i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes. it started a bit slow and i couldn't understand the beginning because the years didn't make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that. all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it. the cast was top notch and even though i'm not a fan of golf it easily kept my attention with a good plot.

if you like your sports movies to be about dignity and the best values then this'll work for you big time. oversentimental in places? sure, of course it is - and proud of it. it is the biggest and best ride in the carnival and should be enjoyed as that. big production values, simple telling, with creative shots: it is not complex, is a very nice and remarkably sweet film. it really feels like a labor of love from bill paxton; and i bet his son gets that.the build-up is slow enough to be enjoyed, the conflicts feisty, and the british vs. americans handled with a degree of vaudevillian villainy, but the dignity between the two main transatlantic protagonists is always to the fore. i have minor gripes: the score wants to be james horner but is too overblown, and there are too many close-ups, and panning shots for 2005, but if you want a straightforward, decent, and good-looking sports film then this is it.so here's the thing, and i feel like i know my film, but i actually liked it more than seabiscuit: which is a better film, but greatest story is simply disney at its core and hugely enjoyable! thanks, bill.

rainy day with not much to do. we were surfing the movie network channels and found this one just starting, so we gave it a chance.the more we watched, the more we became engrossed in the story. its the old story of working class underdog trying to make it in a sport which at the time (1913 i think) was usually played by the wealthy upper class but this movie was every bit as interesting as seabiscuit and this is also based on a true story.the acting is believable and the casting is brilliant. and . . . . we are not golfers, so please don't miss this one just because its about golf. any individual sport would serve the plot, because it's about the people. golf works well for this story because of the class distinction and snobbery that seem to involve some who play the game.bottom line . . . . its a feel good movie. it's well put together and isn't it always fun to see those who think they are better than others get taken down a peg or two.

shia labeouf has impressed me before with his acting ability, but i can honestly say that i very much look forward to his next efforts...his portrayal of francis ouimet, a 20 year old caddy who ignores his father's insistence that golf is not his place in life and enters the 1913 us open tournament in his hometown...the beginning of the movie does drag a bit, but it's necessary to set up the underdog subplot that shia works so well...the entire cast is well-chosen and they work very well together in a story that, based on the actual event, has an ending everyone can discover before seeing the movie...but even knowing that information doesn't spoil the fun...josh flitter is delightful as eddie lowery, francis' caddy, who keeps him grounded and loose while at the same time proving to be an invaluable part of francis' effort...stephen delane is outstanding as harry vardon, the legendary british golfer who francis idolizes yet does not fear...and who knows the background francis comes from as he, too, had humble beginnings...bill paxton takes a formulaic movie and makes it worthwhile...bravo mr. paxton, and bravo to the cast...from the imagery to the story to the people who bring it alive, this is a movie to get, enjoy, and revel in...it's nice to have movies like this that we can feel good watching...
