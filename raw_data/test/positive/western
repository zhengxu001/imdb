was in the mood for a french film and saw this at blockbuster. what a little gem it turned out to be! not sure how i missed gregori derangere all these years, but he is fantastic. such innocence and grace! i love his face and the way he moves. isabelle adjani was hilarious--reminded me of nicole kidman's over-the-top performance in moulin rouge. she looks the same as 20 years ago...truly remarkable. gerard depardieu has not held up nearly as well, but his acting continues to amaze. he's perfect in this film. will probably buy this one, i enjoyed it so much. if you want to see another great french movie, rent joyeux noel. stunning.

even if it won't give one more than previous posts here (like ruby liang's very good one) i wanted to share my own point of view. hope my english is understandable.bon voyage is a rhythmic, light but deep presentation of the french unorganized come-down, but also courage and charm. all along in a brilliantly reconstituted 1940 france with many details (from bordeaux luxurious hotel occupied by government hq and attacked by useless high class french, to parisian coffees near le pantheon / rue mouffetard and 1930s cars) gérard depardieu and yvan attal give their second roles a brilliant taste;) isabelle adjani and virgnie ledoyen are very credible in their drastically different roles, and grégori derangère makes an bewitching performance:)much lighter than average (e.g. american) war times movies, and focused on the civilians, bon voyage shows a lot of things about french issues (even to a french guy like me), some of them quite deep.

one comment said it wasn't a comedy...mistake! it was a delightful comedy of a period of history that doesn't lend itself easily to that genre. very busy...and active film from beginning to end. often the shots out the window of the train, or car, were just beautiful. an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours in a theater. all the french historical figures, like charles de gaulle and petain and the some of the people involved in the french resistance were included in the script, which might send those who are unfamiliar with the collapse of france under the german invasion might want to research. the characters were engaging and the actors portraying them were excellent. recommend it, 9 out of 10.

just watched hair after a lapse of 20 years. it struck home. for those of us who tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight the rule of privilege and power; who resisted the fascism of the johnson/nixon administrations; who now as veterans of civil wars fought the war in vietnam every single day until finally the us beast died and fled; for all who said no in many different ways -- it's remarkable how unsuccessful we were. how large the real table was on which treat danced. how driven the wizard behind the curtain. we were 20, 22, 24. we didn't know the nature of the enemy. the size of the monster who for the next thirty years and counting would continue to eat the world. how could we? even with smoke and the bat (the bat!) in our hand, like treat, we were too young, too middle class, too invested, too much a part of the actions we hated.but there was a moment. as andre gregory observes in my dinner with. . . , there was a moment or two somewhere back there in the late 60's and early 70's when perhaps we could have found something besides the yellow brick road. something not fueled by bechtel, prisons, enron, and dick. something collaborative. something innocent and critical at once. something with dance.but we missed it. like kong bending a girder, the "revolution" was turned in on itself. into sexism. racism. homophobia. and class crushing politics. until we got to "w". treat would have hated "w". and iraq and the pathological lies. if they were in that film. then. but the moment passed and "w" was almost inevitable. comprehensive incompetence riding the drunken, raging bull into estuaries, children's lives, and china shops.we should have done something more. something better. but we clearly didn't know what.now what?

this is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person. the sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent. just a great movie for ever, to time limit, just for the entire live, you must have in your collection! this is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person. the sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent. just a great movie for ever, to time limit, just for the entire live, you must have in your collection! this is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person. the sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent. just a great movie for ever, to time limit, just for the entire live, you must have in your collection!

it couldn't have come out at a worse time--just as the nation was entering the reagan years, the boom-boom 80s, the time of no regrets, no concerns. it got no word of mouth, and opened poorly. the studio ditched it. but hair is possibly the best musical ever made--with forman directing and tharpe choreographing, it's a startlingly beautiful, well-acted, well-written triumph that few people remember. the casting is perfect, the musical numbers unforgettable, and even the downer of an ending doesn't diminish the film's indomitable spirit.if you haven't see this movie, you haven't seen the best musical of all time. seriously.

conventional and superficial ,claude´s portrayal was incomplete it is supposed that just a few moments with sheila , makes him win her love , but the story itself and the songs make it and enjoyable experience essentially the final sequence .altough i don´t know why it was given a pg rating .

i first saw this movie in the theater. i was 10. i just watched it a second time and i must say it was amazing. the music, the dancing, the acting. it is a great story and told extremely well. i fell absolutely in love with treat williams when i was a kid after seeing him in this movie. one of my favorite parts was when his mom kept yelling at him to give her his pants, and then finally said "how much do you need"? (money). that was classic. ; ). moms are the best. if you haven't seen this movie since it came out i say see it again. it's timeless. it will do what all great movies do; make you laugh, cry, and think.

thank god for this movie. it's a document of talent that, three decades later, seems even more unique and rare in retrospect.the music is just extraordinary, packed with so much talent in writing, performance, arrangement and production that it's absolutely infectious. the lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. the performances by under-appreciated talents like nell carter and ren woods uplift my spirit every time i hear them. while the film may be different from the stage version, i prefer the soundtrack to the cast album, which i find truly grating and under-developed. here the arrangements are filled out and expanded into dynamic pieces that couldn't have been produced in a stage setting.but the music isn't the only thing extraordinary about this movie. the juxtaposition of almost hyper-realist dialog scenes (reminds me of altman films) intercut with exuberant musical and dance numbers, really works. all the talent in this movie--directing, writing, photography, editing, music, choreography, casting, acting, costuming, art direction--merge perfectly into one of the best musical films i've seen.i think it's amazing how much we know about the characters in "hair," based on very little information or plot. they're not drawn as caricatures, but as realistic and very human people. we see little glimpses of where they come from, but the portrait is completed by vignettes that draw the characters to the surface through accomplished acting, directing and editing. there's an undercurrent theme of the misogyny of berger and hud which colors their characters by exposing their reckless macho-hippie ideology. the scene of berger's home life reveals important details about his psychology, and the brief glimpse of claude's home tells us volumes about his background through the simple, realistic and genuine interaction between claude and (presumably) his father.i love the fashion in this movie. it defiantly mixes sixties ideas with very seventies looks (one does have to overlook treat williams' hair extensions...). it's a document of how chic much of the late-seventies was, contrary to the conventional wisdom that the era was all about bad taste. claude's beige knitted tie was a hot trend of 1979, and the hair and clothing of the singers and dancers (particularly those in white during the central park scene) mixes up the decades in a way that suggests the timelessness of the musical's themes. these elements merge with twyla tharpe's extraordinary state-of-the-art choreography in a way that enhances the artistry of both."hair"isn't a film that rewards cynicism. if you come to it with expectations, then you're most likely going to be held captive by artists who aren't bound by your rules. for me, it opened my eyes and ears and spirit to an insightful and passionate musical dialog about war, friendship and family that transcends its time and is still meaningful and relevant to me to this day.

treat williams reached a degree of stardom with this movie, and really squandered it. don't be led astray by his poor movie choices since. this movie really stands out. "hair" is a musical that really deals with the attitude, and probably more so with the persona, of the famed peace movement of the 60's. there is a lot of spectacular music done in spectacular fashion. unlike the music videos of the late 70's, 80's, and 90's, the video flashes coincide with the subject matter of the music. in other words, the video makes sense when matched with the songs, so you know it never could've made it on mtv. the subject matter dwells on drugs and being hippies, but it mostly an anti war movie dealing with the senseless tragedies of viet nam. one of the protagonists is an oklahoma boy intent on making a difference, believing all the patriotic dribble he is spoon fed, and he happens upon a gang in new york, who are more or less glorified hoodlums; their characters are very unique, and probably wouldn't make sense today, but this bunch bands together by burning their draft cards. what ensues in some spectacular scenery and mesmerizing scenes involving not only the three leads, but the other 3 gang members, as well as a newcomer with a small child, whose entrance is easily one of the ten grandest entrances of all time in cinema, partly because she sings one of the greatest songs of that generation. despite their faults, you come to love these people, a cinematic triumph with a heart felt and grand finale.

i've avoided seeing this film for some time but finally picked up a copy. having been born too late to see 'hair' in its contemporary setting, i have just been familiar with the uk and broadway cast recordings for many years; and saw it on stage in the late 1980s where it looked a little creaky but still, great fun.the film. it drops some of the songs (the bed, my conviction, frank mills) and cuts others (walking in space). however, what is left is presented very well indeed. all the singers and dancers are excellent, and the key performers (especially treat williams as berger, beverley d'angelo as sheila, john savage as claude) are memorable.as a hippy celebration and anthem, 'hair' manages to be remain potent even in a film made ten years too late. it was no longer the era of peace, love, and biba, but the time of punk rock ... although watching this film now, in the time of iraqi problems, gives a new resonance to the vietnam issues of the 1960s.milos forman, who also made 'amadeus', did a good job on directing. in its scope and feel it reminds me of norman jewison's 'jesus christ superstar', especially with the joy of the 'aquarius' scene and the intimacy of 'easy to be hard'.i really enjoyed this film and consider it a good representation of a musical born out of the first truly hedonistic era.

i won't say anything about music, because this topic can be so deep that it can become one huge separate review, so let's concentrate on movie that is brilliant... no doubt, one of the best works of forman.the simple story about love, friendship, freedom and ideals... oh yes, the ideals for which even pacifists are ready to go in war...there is not a single fake word, single fake character, single fake feeling in the story, because the love, freedom and friendship isn't something complicated for the characters of movie. these things aren't something that "everyone can view from different angle" these aren't things that need much thinking to understand... their love is simple, their friendship is simple, their ideals are as simple as the word "simple" itself and that's why these characters are so deep.berger, the leader of a hippie played by treat williams is a guy who lives to live and that's the biggest happiness for him... he has his ass - (as he sings in one of the scenes in the movie) and that's enough to make him happy with his property...berger never accepts that something can't be done... and his right... if he wants to go to some rich guys' banquet in his dirty old clothes and huge long hair, he will do it... if he want's to go to another state to just see his friend, he'll do it... he never thinks twice... he just do it.how? why is he so powerful? the answer is simple: because he is free.just watch how the wind makes the hair wave in this movie and you will understand it all, maybe you will even free yourself too.

this is a cult film for many reasons. first because of the phenomenal success as a musical both in broadway and london, then as a musical film. the film is close to the play and some of the provocation of the play is no longer provocative twelve years later. the discourse against the vietnam war is no longer a protest song against the war itself, but a strong song demonstrating how the young people of these late 60s managed to bring the political establishment down. milos forman play with some situations at the end of the 70s like the narrow minded justice, the self-centered umbilical righteousness of the rich or of the little ones who have just one rank of power more than the powerless. he also heavily plays with the racial element and the sexual ambiguity he builds all the time. the film remains pleasant and thoughtful. and of course it is a tremendous thrill to remember these years when we have had the privilege, and that was not a chance, to live them. november 11, 1969, nixon ordering mass celebration for the 1918 armistice, which became the order for teachers at all levels to take their students to the celebration and the march, supporting thus the invasion of cambodia that was in full swing. and some dare give lessons in democracy to foreign countries. i also remember the long campaign for the impeachment of nixon in 1973-1974 that will eventually lead to his resignation and the swearing in of gerald ford, the first vice president, and eventually president, of the us who had not been elected, since he was appointed vice president by the senate after spiro agnew had to resign to face trial, conviction and sentence for embezzlement. of course that makes us think of today when in 2000 a president of the us was not elected by the people but by the supreme court, or of a war that was rejected by millions world wide from the very start, and even before the start, and was started against the better judgment of the united nations and of three permanent members of the security council. and some speak of a new world order based on the respect of others. modern western man seems to have some problems understanding that the world is changing and has already widely and wisely changed. modern western man seems to be kind of out of sync and to need special evening classes to learn that democracy wants the majority in the world to be the majority, and the west is far from that majority, and that if the soviet block had been able to understand that market economy is not capitalism but that market economy can be either socialist or capitalist the berlin wall would have fallen, but the other way round, and that china has learned that lesson marvelously well and is at the foot of the wall they have to climb over to learn that their socialist market economy has to lead to political democracy, but they will, just like vietnam was able to reconstruct itself after thirty years of vicious war aggression and damage. in other words, hair is a perfect food for thought.dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines

absolutely amazing! humor, up-beat music and an anti-war message make this probably the best movie i have ever seen.first of all, i love how clever this movie is, particularly in the vietnam part of the plot. it's interesting how they make the army officials enforcing the draft look ridiculous. follow that with the serious situation of the actual war, and then the conclusion (which leaves me seething with anger at the war); and yet there is absolutely no violence on the screen. wow.also, the music is really cool. but what is very unique in this musical (as opposed to evita, or wizard of oz, for example) is that the lyrics don't tell the story. the mood does (along with the visuals and between-songs-dialog): "donna" is an upbeat song which emphasizes the happy mood, whereas "flesh failures" has a driving, intense beat, in a minor key.also, i notice the lsd scene is not very flattering. now i'm definitely not going to do drugs (not that i ever intended to).all things considered, this is an amazing movie. the only negative comment i could say is that it's sometimes hard to hear the dialog. but who cares? 10/10 stars!

milos forman's original hair was the perfect movie that actually revealed how life was changing in those years, not only in the usa, but especially in this country. one of the plots in the film was to be used in other films to come after hair, for example, in american graffitti, etc. it was an original story with a touch of generational sadness in it. the characters in the film were like lonely "cells" in a "body" that was changing all over. overall, a very good film, perhaps a little underrated though. annie golden's role was minor but she acted very well. it was the film that practically launched john savage as an actor. one of the members of the chicago played his role well even though it was a minor role.

i watched it because my friend said we could try it, when my father asked if we'd watch it. i didn't want to because it was such an old film, how could that be good ? i finally did watch with that friend and my father. my friend and i loved the film. the songs are great, the actors were cool and we were crazy about it. i guess this shows even though it's from dad's time that doesn't mean it can't be a good film. i bought the film not so long after seeing it on tv, i put it on a lot and sang along with the songs. i even watched it with my classmates on my birthday party. it's a nice, good, and sometimes funny film.if you don't try, you can't say it's bad. even if you think no, i'm not going to watch a film from dad's time. try the first part of the film you can always stop watching if you don't like it. i really recommend it, it's great!!

hair is one of my favorite movies of all times. even not being part of my generation, i already watched this movie 9 times and i can't get enough with the beautiful message of understanding,passion,beauty and love. this movie is against the vietnam war and shows how people should be united independent of the color,origins, religions and classes. i love the characters berger and woof and i think central park of the 70's one of the most beautiful places i already saw in my life.by the way,i still have this music in my mind:when the moon is in the seventh house and jupiter aligns with mars then peace will guide the planets and love will steer the starsthis is the dawning of the age of aquarius the age of aquarius aquarius! aquarius!harmony and understanding sympathy and trust abounding no more falsehoods or decisions golden living dreams of visions mystic crystal revelation and the mind's true liberation aquarius! aquarius!ps: i am surprised to see that the director of this movie is the same director of amadeus. i just love both movies!

when i was younger i saw the end of hair on tv. i just watched the last 5 minutes of the film. and i was really impressed by it. i got goose pimples and i said to myself that i had to watch this film.and i did, and i've to say: this film is amazing. the songs are great, the actors are very good and the message... the message of this film is one of the most important ones: "make love, no war". this film is a real masterpiece. meanwhile it's my favourite film.the last song is one of the saddest and happiest i ever listened to. i nearly could feel myself joining the crowd. all i've got to say: "let the sun shine, let the sun shine in"

the antiwar musical "hair" is my number one cult-movie. i do not know how many time i have seen this film in the movie-theaters and on vhs, or how many times i have listened the cd with the stunning soundtrack, and now, this masterpiece has been finally released on dvd in brazil.the pacifist and touching story is still amazing, a hymn of freedom, friendship and liberty of choices, and pictures the resistance of a generation against the stupidity of war. i do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of the counterculture of the 70's and their dreams, since the present world is probably worse than in the 70's. i do not recall who won the oscar in 1979, but treat williams and john savage deserved at least a nomination for their awesome performances. beverly d'angelo is extremely gorgeous in the role of a hypocrite spoiled upper-class teenager. i have seen "hair" probably more than twelve times, and my eyes always get wet while berger walks to the airplane singing "that's me, that's me, that's me", and i start crying with his gravestone in the cemetery. i believe this is one of the most beautiful, sad and touching conclusions of the cinema history. my wife, my daughter and my son also love this film; therefore i can guarantee that "hair" is timeless and recommended for any audience. my vote is ten.title (brazil): "hair"

the songs are fantastic and the story-line is good. like many other acting schools, mine also produced hair. for most hair production it's a golden opportunity to do nude, but my production was fully dressed... i don't think full frontal nudity in a movie or a play guarantees artistic quality... and so did the creators of the movie. the movie version is great with classic hits following each other while letting the plot develop to the chilling climax. a great cast of actors, dancers and singers.

i'm not a big musical fan, but this is one of the few i really love. unlike many other musicals, such as "the sound of music," none of the songs are about gratuitous stuff. each song is social commentary, acumen on war, sexuality, recalcitrance, spirituality, and freedom. especially amazing songs are "easy to be hard," "age of aquarius," "hair," "flesh failures/3-5-0-0," "walking in space," and "hare krishna." totally revolutionary and wonderful. i can't wait to someday see it live!

'night crossing' is about an enormous barrier designed not to keep enemies out but to keep its own people in'night crossing' is about a very long border fencer equipped with silent alarms and automatic firing systems'night crossing' is about the denial of the basic human rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'night crossing' is about the fear and pain that afflict so many families'night crossing' is about one attempt to risk a crossing through the border zone'night crossing' is about a loving father whose only desire is to give his boys what should never have been taken away from them'night crossing' is about a disturbed mother who wants her babies and her husband alive'night crossing' is about a caring husband who wants his family to be together but in a better place'night crossing' is about children who want to be free to reach at anytime the sky'night crossing' is about a hot-air balloon handcrafted and built by two families 'night crossing' is about a balloon which could go just high enough to crash or catch fire and explode'night crossing' is about two determined men who want their family to climb into a hot air balloon and float away to 'liberty''night crossing' is about the fear of getting caught by an evil regime'night crossing' is about a sensible man who can't let bad dreams stop him'night crossing' is about an icy policeman who wants every lookout tower on full alertwith exquisite music by jerry goldsmith, delbert mann's 'night crossing' makes us realize the true value of freedomfinal thoughts: there are a few moments in everyone's life, certainly in public lives, that can define a person...for those of us old enough to remember the reagan presidency, seeing the clips again in the wake of his death makes it seem like those events happened just yesterday, or last week. the voice, the expressions, are all so familiar. but for a large percentage of people, these events might as well have happened fifty years ago, if not more. they are part of the distant past. president reagan is a name, and not much more. president gorbachev is another name, and not much more. so how can we remember these two men who had such a huge impact on their country?reagan and gorbachev worked together to tear down the berlin wall and to steer their superpower nations away from nuclear confrontation

ex-reporter jacob asch (eric roberts) is hired by an acquaintance (raymond j. barry) to find his ex-wife and son. asch heads to palm springs and quickly locates the ex laine (beverly d'angelo) with someone he believes to be the son (a young johnny depp). but things turn out to be a bit more complicated as asch discovers former white trash laine has definitely married up in the form of millionaire simon fleischer (dan hedaya) and her first son is nowhere to be seen.director/writer matthew chapman is channeling body heat here and this mid-80s neo-noir is watchable enough thanks to an all-star cast and nice locations. d'angelo was still looking good around this time, so she makes for a good femme fatale and isn't afraid to show some skin. however, the mystery isn't very compelling in the end. co-starring dennis lipscomb, emily longstreth and henry gibson. chapman made several thrillers in the 80s, but his "biggest" career achievement was co-authoring the screenplay for the infamous color of night.

this movie is a coveted member of my movie library. while not a mainstream film, it is, in my view, a highly effective film noir in which eric roberts is totally underrated as an actor. (i would qualify him as a much better actor than his sister, julia, who is overrated, but that's another review...) roberts plays the down-on-his-luck ex-reporter with the perfect mix of narrative precision and jaded idealism: two ingredients that are part and parcel of any effective film noir. the first-person narration by roberts enhances the quality of the movie, and keeps us guessing on the real motive behind the crime.set in palm springs, everything about the setting in the movie progresses slowly as a metaphor for the theme of oppression: asch (roberts) is oppressed by his past; the police are oppressed by the rich residents of palm springs who treat them as servants; the rich, meanwhile, are oppressed by boredom (watch johnny depp's classic performance as the insightful rich kid who only wants to be loved...); the isolation of each character is omnipresent and is further augmented by the heat and isolation of the desert.there is an audience for this film if they're looking for a more contemporary version of film noir. while there are elements of the film that might have been tighter, i recommend getting a copy of this film and putting it right between the big sleep and chinatown in your movie library. (the film is based on the arthur lyons book, castles burning, and if you like roberts's acting in this one, you may want to get a copy of the ambulance, in which he showcases his funnier, lighter side.) best line in the film: "careful? careful of what? i should've asked. only fools ignore the strange warnings of trailer park ladies."

this is one of those films that, for whatever reason, just clicked with me. everything about it is right. eric roberts laconic, nice investigator, his voiceover narration, the twisting plot, dan hedaya and denis lipscomb given good roles, the settings, the paintings in the artist studio scenes, the end credit sequence and the wonderfully haunting theme music that perfectly encapsulates the mood of the whole film. if i have any reservations it is about beverly d'angelo as the femme fatale, but she plays her final scenes beautifully. i think that director matthew chapman was trying for a sort of 'chinatown' feel to the whole thing. it didnt work. but as a murder-mystery its a gem.

richard norton really lights the screen up in this portland, oregon based martial arts masterpiece. norton, an aussie heartthrob, plays the evil mr. milverstead who runs a successful import/export business both smuggling arms and participating in the female flesh trade. usually the women are plucked from his favorite dance club with the help of a squad of goons the most well known of who is bolo yeung, playing the role of ice. trouble comes for milverstead when a new cop in town john kim (britton lee) is out to avenge his dead partners murder at the hand of milverstead's organization. if you have time to see only one martial arts movie this year, don't miss this classic.

i think that just sums up this film. watch it and you'll find out why. the acting of the lead character john keem is really, really bad and he has no on screen charisma whatsoever. it's very funny because of this thought, as is the ending where keem beheads the bad guy despite the fact he is unarmed and has surrendered. brilliant!

even though i saw this film when i was very young, i already knew the story of wild the thief-taker and shepherd who famously escaped from newgate prison.apart from the liberty taken right at the end, the film more or less faithfully follows the true story. the temptation to bend the facts which is the hallmark of so many so-called historical films is resisted in this film and the film makers must be praised for that.of the performances, there is scarcely a poor performance, and tommy steele is ideally cast. also good is stanley baker as the thief-taker and alan badel is good as always.because the film sticks to the facts, it makes it suitable to be watched by all the family.

this definitely the most tension filled x-files episode of the first season. this episode is what i think of when i hear "x-files". the plot is simple but exiting. our main cast plus a few scientist go to investigate an alskan outpost in which it's research team appears to have killed each other. it turns out a small parasite that got dug up from the ice, had infected the research team. the parasite attaches itself to the brain and causes paranoia and insanity. soon none can tell who they can trust, or who's infected or not.this episode was a direct tribute to john carpenters great horror film "the thing". the thing is set in antarctica and a team of scientist find a destroyed outpost in which it's occupant have been killed or killed themselves. an alien that had been buried in the ice for a 10000 years had been thawed out. it has the abilities to imitate any life form. therefore the main characters can no longer distinct friends from foes.believe me the thing is one of the most exiting, and tension filled horror movies you'll ever see. if you liked the episode ice i advice you to see it. or if you have only seen the thing i advice you to see ice.ice is the best direct tribute/homage to john carpenter's the thing i have ever seen, and it lives up to it's inspiration as one of the best x-files episodes. i give it a 10/10.

this is one of the best episodes from the entire x-files series, creepy beyond words. the tension and suspense in this episode is very well executed, in its entire 45 minutes it managed to be almost as scary as an entire movie. this episode joins the ranks of best episodes with such greats as "home", "humbug" "bad blood" and "milagro" for being the best in their respective season.mulder and scully's growing relationship is put to the test in this episode: can they really trust each other? this episode also contains a tiny scene that will leave romantic viewers smiling.mulder: "bring your mittens"

okay, that was just brilliant. i wish that the rest of season 1 had been this strong. it really needed more episodes like this. the cast worked perfectly, even though they were all nobodies back in the day. writing was fantastic and so was the editing. great job in all accounts. the episode was thrilling, suspenseful and just kept you guessing until the very end. which is what most motw episodes had tried, but failed until now. the first five star episode for me. really good, almost like a movie. i didn't even remember it being this good. i think it's even better than the great horror movie called 'the thing'.

fbi agents mulder and scully get assigned to probe the mystery of what happened to an arctic drilling team, in this early 'x-files' episode that david duchovny himself considers one of their first "rockin'" episodes. it pays loving homage to the much lauded john carpenter 1982 theatrical feature "the thing", and one can see the similarities. visually, color and lighting schemes combine to give the story a hellish quality. production design / art direction are especially impressive; the shots of the exterior of the arctic camp are so reminiscent of the earlier film as to automatically create feelings of deja vu for some viewers. naturally, our heroes are threatened by the weather, so the sound design, involving wind, evokes memories of "the thing".the culprit is an ancient worm that had been exposed to the team; once inside a host, it stimulates aggressive behavior. this allows the paranoia aspect to take full hold, and the way the script is set up we can't be too sure of who's infected and who's not. this gives rise to the inevitable scene of testing. this episode certainly works at portraying the way that tensions can cause breakdowns in groups. it even allows mulder and scully to have moments where they're not sure if they can trust each other.guest starring are a good small group of actors: xander berkeley, felicity huffman, and steve hytner as the scientists obliged to accompany mulder and scully on the mission, and jeff kober as the pilot who takes them to the camp. you can also see one time jason voorhees portrayer ken kirzinger as one of the ill-fated original team members.incidentally, there's one direct link between 'ice' and "the thing": art director graeme murray, who worked on both projects.8/10

this was truly a tense and dark episode. excellently executed, wonderful acting and atmospheric directing, 'ice' is one of my favorite episodes. along with 'pusher' 'grotesque' 'wetwired' and 'home' (these are quite good in dark atmosphere in my case) it seem quite realistic to me, their paranoia, their suspicion and their ever growing rage was perfectly executed by the great actors. however, 'ice' had a problem that i got over after a few watches: it was too short! i wanted more!overall, 'ice' had what 98% of all x files episodes have: excellent acting, intense story-writing, gritty directing. all the works.10 out of 10

ice the limerick:a virus pulled out of the icejust didn't know how to play nice.if infected you'll killbecause you are ill.the cure is to be infected twice.ice is a great episode; one of the greats from season 1 that began shaping the show and if you ask me you really couldn't ask for much better throughout the entire series. it starts out with an awesome teaser which in my opinion is really one of the best teasers of the series also. a group of scientists in alaska have drilled something out of the ice core which has for some reason caused them to kill each other. now mulder and scully are sent with three other scientists to investigate what happened. as mulder says this is either because they are brilliant or expendable. i take this to mean that they had better be brilliant or else... the group soon finds out that the cause of mayhem is a small parasite pulled out of the ice core. a little worm that gets into the bloodstream and causes violent behavior. since the pilot is infected the rest of the show turns to a suspenseful sort of who-done-it paranoiac thriller as the others begin to suspect each other of being infected. this is not helped at all by an overly paranoid doctor hodge who is un-trusting of anyone which we learn early on by the first thing he asks: to see everyone's credentials to "make sure we are who we say we are". events lead to finding out the one who is infected and learning how to cure them.there are a number of things i like about the episode and of course certain characters that i want to smack in the face from this episode, as well as a couple loopholes but most can be attributed to heightened caution and not thinking clearly. i like bear from the moment i first meet him. its a shame he has to die. i also like the scene shown from the other scientist's point of view as mulder and scully argue in the other room. it gives an interesting twist to our typical perception as a viewer and for me seems to say maybe we shouldn't assume that just because someone is government means they know all sorts of conspiracy secrets. as much as hodges frustrates me in this episode i do think that mulder was as much to blame for some of the rash actions taken as any. i really like scully in this episode. first of all she can tackle like a frickin linebacker! second i really like the focus on her terror of what can happen to them out there and how she tries not to let trust and friendship of mulder keep her from biasing her judgment. i love the scene when she goes into the room to sleep and first looks as the picture of the previous group all hugging and the birthday presents from them to whoever used to sleep in that room and then how she suddenly freaks out and pushes the dresser in front of the door and in a final touch of subtlety as she sits on the floor with her knees pulled into her chest we see the bottom of a poster on the wall that says "bosom buddies". this is such great writing. a way to say without any words that scully is worried that she may not be able to trust even her very best friend.unfortunately this heightened suspicion leads the group to believe mulder to be infected since he discover's murphy's dead body even though they haven't inspected him at all to find out for sure. that was my main problem with the behavior of the characters is they could easily have solved all the suspicion simply by giving blood. but i guess i probably would have acted rashly in that situation too. but then stupid hodges decides that he has to assume mulder is infected even though mulder willingly surrenders and then is going willingly to be inspected and almost infects mulder in the process. luckily he sees that it is really dasilva that is infected and we finally reach a resolution. at least as much as you can expect from an x-file. the "government" wastes no time in torching the evidence as always happens in these cases and mulder is left with yet another frustrating "unsolved" case. in closing i give "ice" and easy 10/10 and i leave you with a haiku."we're not who we are. it goes no further than this. it ends right here right now."

wow! it's hard to put into words my feelings for this episode. ice is one of the best episodes of season one for sure. it's my favorite of the season. six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure isolated in the middle of the arctic with an unknown organism that causes murderous aggression, the drama can't get any better than that. paranoia reigns supreme as even mulder and scully have doubts about each other's sanity. i've heard people complain about this episode's similarities to the movie 'the thing'. i haven't seen it, so i wouldn't know. ice is more than worth watching just to see mulder and scully truly testing their still developing trust of one another. this episode is intense and suspenseful to the end. you won't be disappointed!

a true stand out episode from season 1 is what ice is.an artic location,claustrophobic conditions and a general feel of paranoia looming in the freezing air makes this is a must see episode from season one.the previous occupants of the artic station mulder,scully and four others go to have either killed each other or killed themselves.a virus is bringing out murderous aggression and is responsible for bringing out deadly paranoia and fear.mulder and scully actually begin to question each others sanity.tension is that high.the writers have to receive great credit for creating that sort of scenario where the atmosphere is so tense mulder and scully come into conflict in such a direct manner

a team varied between scully and mulder, two other scientists, a pilot, and the guy who plays bana on seinfeld, go up to an arctic research post where all members have died off by either killing each other or killing themselves. they discover there's a worm- a virus- that is parasitic to the point of madness and death. the problem is, after a certain dog lashes out, anyone could be infected, but who? this is not just my favorite episode of season 1, but also one of my favorites from the show. the arctic environment encloses the characters and, of course like carpenter's the thing, it's a lot of fun watching these even-tempered characters suddenly start to flip out in dramatic scenes. and the visual effects of the worm and its effects under the skin are cheesy, i didn't mind them at all. the drama between the characters ends up working more than it would usually because of the tension and because all of the actors (including the bana guy) understand what's going on in the story. and, as usual, i loved the ambiguity of the ending. highly recommended.

this isn't a bad tv movie. shtrafbat is short for shtrafnoy batallion, which means penal batallion. such battallions were formed due to the increasing demand for soldiers as the soviet union was taking heavy casualties all through out the war. these battalions consisted of convicts and dishonored soldiers who were given the chance to clear their names by proving themselves in combat. they were looked down upon as scum and were expended easily during combat without much regret, or much honor, on the part of military. they were often sent on suicide missions and suffered extreme casualties. the ones who refused to fight were executed on sight. needless to say, their lives sucked.there were some very nice performances by the cast, especially by yuri stepanov who played antip, aleksandr bashirov who played stirah, and roman madyanov who played major kharchenko. however the series isn't really that addictive, in part because it's too long, it could've a lot shorter and as effective.although it's about war, shtrafbat has very mild violence and pretty much no gore. it relies solely on the actors to make it work, and after all, it's a tv series, so the producers didn't want to scare off the viewers and the sponsors.shtrafbat explores the cruelty of the soviet regime, and explaines why so many men chose to fight the nazis instead of joining them. personally i'd rather be a fascist then a communist given the circumstances presented in the film. one character explains that the soviets stripped his farm clean and his family died of starvation. out of anger he burned it down which got him arrested for destroying kolhoz property and he ended up in the penal battalion as a criminal. antip reminisced on how his mother killed her youngest son to feed the rest of the family. both men explained that they fought for their motherland, rather than the for the soviets.the penal battalion had one marine(naval infantry) who raped a girl, killing his comrade in the prosess, threatened his other comrade to keep his mouth shut about both ordeals, and then feigned injury when it came to fighting. on top of all that the girl committed suicide due to shame. i imagine if enough marines watched this movie they'd pick up banners and riot on the streets calling for a boycott or an official apology from the producers.to say the least, i'd recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in the former soviet union or world war ii. i don't think i wasted 500+ minutes of my life.

shtrafbat - penal battalion is a moving, and mostly honest, look at the lives and deaths of soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash away their crimes with blood during world war two. one can almost call it the russian equivalent of highly acclaimed "band of brothers" miniseries.formed in july of 1942 on the eve of battle of stalingrad, the penal battalions were considered expendable units and suffered horrible casualties (sometimes as high as 90%). prisoners of gulag (political prison/concentration camps), deserters, soldiers who were captured by germans but managed to escape, soldiers accused of breaching protocol, were all given a chance to join the shtrafbat and prove that there were not "traitors of the motherland" with their lives. those who sustained injuries and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and were reinstated in the eyes of the law.this miniseries features a look at one such shtrafbat, under the command of tverdokhlebov - an honorable officer who was captured by the germans, was shot and left for dead. it features a colorful and varied group of people, thrust into a situation from which there is no escape. the authoritative yet honorable crime boss antip "kulak" (the fist) and his little gang of unreformed criminals, a young jewish intellectual who struck his anti-semite officer, father (orthodox priest) mikhail who joins the battalion when his parish is destroyed in the house-to-house fighting, political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to the gulag but who are nonetheless willing to fight one last time for their people and country, must all find their courage and their reasons to keep on living, and to keep on fighting.although set during a war, not every episode features combat, in fact what combat scenes there are, are often chaotic, sporadic, and short - which was probably the intent of the director. in between, the miniseries focuses on various relationships between the cast, their backgrounds, their thoughts and tragedies. the rape of a young woman by one of shtrafbat's soldier and then his execution, execution for supposed awol, periods of boredom on the march, the celebration (and subsequent consequences) of finding a german bunker stocked with food (and champagne), the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their men from their own superiors, cheating on a spouse, and other situations, feature prominently. the camera is unflinching - it does not turn away from the ugliness of war and the ugliness of human nature, nor from raw human emotions. the dialog likewise does not censor out the swearing.the acting is superb and deep, and the script is likewise well written. everything from rage, to weariness, to resignation, to finding a scrap of joy to hang on to, is rendered almost faultlessly. one complaint might be that some of russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by someone not familiar with the language and culture. because it is a history drama in a sense, some of the terms and situations (military rank, mention of other battles, certain historical references) may be lost on some viewers. this understanding is not needed to thoroughly enjoy shtrafbat, but these references are a nice touch of authenticity. another complain that could be levied, is an occasional anachronism and bending of history to suit the plot, but frankly this is such a riveting miniseries that one will likely forgive these slight mishaps.

shtrafbat is the story only russians could tell about the second world war. the largest front of the whole conflict has been, ironically, the least appearing subject on the silver screen after the war. while the western allies war-effort has been pictured in almost every possible detail and manner, the east has been left out or the job has been left to only some old propaganda movies of little else than historical footage value.there is no chance that shtrafbat could compete with band of brothers in every detail but neither you want to look at the screen with examining petty visual effects in mind. that the soldiers are russians is enough big reason to forgive the less eye-captivating battle scenes and you can concentrate on the story that is the most interesting. so much different was the war in the eastern front, and the nature of the russian army, that you might wish people to produce more dramatizations from the other fronts, and of armies.shtrafbat is no way perfect, but it has some rare specialties that augment the overall rating. it tends to crush myths people have about the second world war, the true heroes were russian people and not their leaders who sent them to missions where they could only perish. another great myth bust is that it presents the enemy, who does not pick up his gun, as an equal human being - an advancement that has been difficult to try in many acclaimed films as well. shtrafbat shows how the war in the eastern front was a war of survival and how the clash of the -isms grinds people into dust.

many experienced and excellent actors mixed together in an ongoing plot of an untold part of world war ii on the eastern front. characters well portrayed and unforgettable. one episode leaves you wishing for the next. pay attention to the closing credits were the thousands of shtrafbat battalions are listed. an untold story involving hundreds of thousands of individuals. sometimes brutal, sometimes romantic, always filled with real people and dialog. produced with excellent sets and camera work. heroes and villains, criminals and priests, patriots and traitors. portrait of people struggling to survive and overcome a most terrible time. i wish to buy a copy for my own collection so to be able to enjoy the series repeatedly.

warning - possible spoilers!'rock star' is one of the solid rock movies i have ever seen. the original idea of the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s, leading a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period. he is not only playing their music to the note, but also living the life of his idols. when his friends in the tribute band expel him, in search of some originality, the destiny plays him a good turn, and gets hired to replace the lead singer of the idols band. a dream came true? well, almost. while starting to live the life of the famous, including the drug and sex excesses of the rock scene of the 80s, he will also have to face the problems in relationship with his supportive girlfriend, and will be eventually need to answer questions about creativity and having a saying in the music of the band.i liked the film, one of the reasons being that it is one of the first times that the life and music of the hard metal rock bands is shown in a realistic manner. fans of the music genre will be satisfied by the soundtrack. the overall idea is original, and the issues of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are being rendered in a sensible and balanced manner. acting is quite good, with mark wahlberg better than in most of the other action flics i saw him lately, and jennifer aniston in tune with the nice-girl-who-knows-a-lot-about-life role. more problematic is the ending, which is quite conventional, and may disappoint. it looks like the main character after quiting the big and famous band has found his own creative path. however, in an ironical twist the music he is playing in the club at the end is the worst in the whole movie! 8/10 on my personal scale. worth seeing - however, expect exposure to a high dose of metal. if you do not like this kind of music, you may chose to avoid this film.

what to say about a movie like rock star? a lot actually! this is the type of movie that is almost tailer made for the critics to slam. it is also a movie i, as a major hard rock fan enjoyed-no-loved actually-while all the while being very consciously aware of its many flaws and that the movie, while a decent effort in some respects missed the chance it had to escape into greatness and become a rock movie classic. oh well....i loved this movie-and would see it again and again-but i know that's purely based on my own personal tastes-rock star is a movie that will appeal to anyone who has experienced elements of the rock or hard rock lifestyle and wants to go down the road to nostalgia. it was a great time for metal heads. and it's nice to have a movie that effectively captures that(long forgot by many non-rock fans.) time effectively, as i think that rock star has done. that is one of the film's strengths, the concert footage. you will feel like your right there with them and how could any hard rock fan not love that? as far as setting the atmosphere rock star gets a 10 of 10. it also gets a 10 of 10 for pure entertainment. if you want a movie to just let yourself go and free flow into some great memories of good times past, then this is the movie for you. it is also the reason why i loved this movie so.but it isn't a great movie. i understand that and were it my actual job to review movies professionally, i'd probably have to be a bit hard on this one. the problem with rock star is the character development.what is wrong with the character development is this, there isn't any. none. the movie has certain scenes-few and far between but they are there-that do touch on greatness:warning brief scene spoilers: 3 examples- 1)when izzy makes his debut on stage(including the fall he takes)2)the first "after show" party with emily(anniston and izzy.)3)backtracking a little-in the beginning when the original lead singer is casually dismissed(fired)-the whole "business as usual" tone sets the stage for what's to come. it's played very effectively.but the problem is, nothing ever does come. there is little to no character development of anyone in this movie, peoples' persona's are merely touched on, but never fully explored. i don't think that's the fault of the actors/actresses,particularly anniston who tries hard, they just are not given much to work with. it's just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the "formula" feel into true movie depth. rock star was so sugarcoated at times(including towards the end) it was almost ridiculous. and , though, those scenes i mentioned were outstanding and very believable, sadly much else in the movie wasn't.another reviewer mentioned the lack of buildup towards the end and i agree but there was actually a lack of buildup about anything. why does izzy leave at the end? because he misses his girlfriend and the band won't let him write songs? it tests the limits of believability. and, frankly the end was just corny. made no sense and had no reality to it at all.watching this, it's almost like watching a movie where the makers of it said: ok, this happens here and then this happens and then this etc etc etc. by the end it's no longer a movie about a boy who's dream came true, it's just another thickly formulated love story. and you wonder why so much detail is left out....i hope i'm not being to hard on rock star because i truly loved it-but not for the right reasons. i would have liked to love this as a great movie about the highs and lows of rock fame. instead i loved it for it's 80's period feel, the clothes, the hair, the lights, the life.... although many others loved it to, i suspect most are people who lived the life of a rock fan, like i did or some who play. i'd have liked to see the movie cross over and just be respected for being a good, well told movie, instead of a cliché. i think, one of the problems was the length. i myself, hate over long films but this was one that really should have been longer, if a movie is done really right, the length is not even felt-there is just to much to the story for it to be as short as it was-that's one reason why there doesn't seem to be much development of either the story or the human beings portrayed in the movie.so-to wind down-this is a movie you can greatly get into- but not a great movie. see it for fun. see it for entertainment. see it to go back to that great, great space in time when metal wasn't just a part of life, it was life-and for those non rock fans-see it to get a little glimpse into a life that meant and still means so much to so many of us.

mark walhberg in a great role, idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs, imitating him to perfection, and dressing like him. when the opportunity comes for him to take over his "idol's" role in the band, he jumps at the opportunity. however the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be... and relationships can change .... this movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it. overall a really good movie with great performances from all the cast as well as the two leads, mark walhberg and jennifer aniston. it did make me feel sad, especially when emily, (jennifer aniston), met up with chris in seattle and saw the depths to what he had sunk. if anybody ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle, although glamourous for a while, is very lonely and ultimately not what you may want.

if you like the 80's rock, you should definitely see this movie! i've only seen it recently and completely fell in love with it!overall, the movie is very entertaining, provides you with a great load of rock tunes and not a single second of the movie do i find boring! it was a great idea that some of the real-life musicians were in this, doing what they do best. i was happy to see zakk, as well as blas elias, they all delivered solid performances. i tend to agree with a lot of people saying that the first half of the movie was much better than the second one, specially in the terms of the script.that could have been worked on a bit better, but not a major biggie. one thing that did bother me a bit was jennifer aniston's performance. i thought she wasn't the right person for this role,i just couldn't see her as a rock star girlfriend.but as the movie goes on, you somehow realize that she did a good job with this.there is a certain amount of honesty and sincerity she delivers that just doesn't live you cold. to summarize, a good and a funny movie, that doesn't go deep into characters but provides you with a good fun, a sense of nostalgia and of course the mighty vocals by jeff scott soto and mike matijevic!

me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a friday night before going to the pub. it was the only programme that ever made us miss opening time. it is one of the best comedies i have ever watched if not the best. david jason was brilliant and was compared many times to buster keaton with his clever stunts that were pulled off so believably. i wish i could get hold of the series on dvd to watch again. he had an amazing ability to make stupid things look believable and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions. he is an accomplished "trip and fall guy" and i remember watching a trailer once where he showed people how to do this professionally. certainly he is the one to teach people this art. he only showed glimpses of it in other programs he did. pshaw, this program shows how multi talented he is. i am lost as to why david jason vetoed another series being made, as for my mind it was one of the best things he has ever done and i've been a fan of his since he did this series. it is said he did not like it because it showed the rawness of his early career. well to my mind, that might possibly have been the right decision when he took it, but now his career has progressed so far, i believe this would be a good time for him to do another series showing him looking back on his "secret life" full of blunders that he does not see. rod

as betty sizemore (renee zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband del (aaron eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen charlie and wesley (morgan freeman and chris rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. in a state of complete denial and delusion, betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for "dr. david ravell" (greg kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of "a reason to love", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in los angeles. immune to reality, betty arrives in l.a. and becomes "nurse betty" as she tries to belong in the hospital world of her dream lover. meanwhile, the angered charlie and wesley track betty down, convinced she is a dangerous witness who also knows about their compromising dealings with del.nurse betty creates comedy and suspense by contrasting its main character's extreme innocence and optimism with the evident hypocrisy and violence that surround her. by clearly defining the protagonist's difficult life, nurse betty justifies its character's tendency to turn away from reality. thus, while offering a comment about the popularity of the soap opera within the film, nurse betty also makes a comment regarding the widespread addiction to television and its celebrities. in addition, nurse betty benefits from the effective manipulation of its protagonist's mental state, particularly in those scenes where she cannot distinguish between "dr. david ravell", the character, and george mccord (greg kinnear), the actor who plays him. betty's incapacity to recognize george as an actor leads to funny misunderstandings, which stress the magnitude of her delusional state. however, in spite of these successes, nurse betty suffers from the troubling characterizations through which the narration evolves. for example, while charlie and wesley are consistently portrayed as a comical pair, the brutality of their actions undermines any sense of appreciation or acceptance the viewer might have initially experienced. similarly, although the initial scenes establish del as a detestable man, the humiliation and violence he experiences with his murderers surpass all the humiliation and violence he caused his wife betty.finally, toward the end of the film, charlie undergoes awkward transformations as he develops an obsession for betty; an obsession which results in noble feelings of love, and which ultimately destroys him. consequently, since the characters' roles as victims lack consistency, the story's victimization processes seem random and unsubstantial. all in all, nurse betty's indeterminacy --rather than creating suspense-- weakens its characters and pollutes its plot.

i'm not sure why i picked for a borrow from mom for "nurse betty". i think just because i had heard a little bit of this movie. but i'm glad i did. "nurse betty" is an original and clever movie that has humor and a darker side. this was one of renee's first big one's before hitting it major in hollywood. i can see why, she is an incredible actress. the scene where she finally realizes what had happened and she's on the set of her favorite soap opera, you can see pain, confusion, fear, and embarrassment on her face. just to let you in on the movie, she plays betty. a shy and insecure woman who stands by her abusive husband, she's a waitress, and is in love with soap operas, especially one where a certain cute doctor, dr. dave revell. when she happens to see her husband's murder accidentally in separate room, the murders she notices are two customers she just had, morgan freeman and chris rock. she then just looses her mind and leaves town after talking to he police and says she needs to find her former fiancée, dr. dave revell. so, she travels along the country to california to find dr. revell, and wants a job as a nurse to work with dave, she's seen the show so many times, somehow she's just awesome at being a nurse when she saves a woman's brother. despite everyone telling her that she is delusional, she just looks at them like as if they were the crazy one's. when she meets the actor who plays dave revell, george(his real name) thinks she's just a crazy fan trying to get on the show. she just looks at him with confusion and believes that he and her belong together.renee was terrific, she was so believable on loosing her mind in the movie. she has come such a long way, and wither you want to admit it or not, she's adorable and a great actress.morgan freeman plays one of the assassin's, charlie, who is the father of the two. he is so charmed and smittened by betty and while chasing her around the country, he becomes almost just infatuated with betty to the point where he almost falls in love with her. he and his son wesley must find betty when they find out she was there at the murder scene and could give away their identities. when charlie sees betty and catches her finally, she's scarred at first, but calms down and they know they have a real connection. it was a beautifully played scene, my opinion is that morgan gave a stronger performance. he's just great.a surprisingly decent performance by chris rock, the son, wesley. he is so "gun"-ho about just getting the job done in a rush and taking care of business. i loved his comedic performance at the end where he and the gang he's holding hostage by gun point are just watching the soap opera's together. classic. "nurse betty" is a great movie that i'd recommend for a good laugh and just in all a nice honest little movie i think anyone could enjoy.9/10

neil labute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, in the company of men & your friends and neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. when betty (renee zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (aaron eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. morgan freeman and chris rock are the hit men who follow her.what betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, dr. david ravell (greg kinnear). only problem: dr. david isn't real, he's a soap opera character on the show `a reason to love' and he's really an egotistical actor named george mccord.to say any more regarding what develops would be too much, but nurse betty is certainly original. its hit men are, like the hired killers of pulp fiction, are violent yet philosophical, its take on soap operas terrific spoof material, and its acting is the best feature of all. this has to be one of the best cast films in recent years. renee zellwegger is perfect for nurse betty, with the constant gleam in her eye that pushes her in her quest. morgan freeman brings his constant state of grace to the role of a killer at the end of his career, and chris rock is his partner, a man of rage and great impatience. greg kinnear is at his comic best as the vain actor/soap opera doctor. there are also great supporting performances from actors such as emmy-winner allison janney (the west wing), harriet sansom harris (frasier's agent bebe glazer), and kathleen wilhoite (chloe on er). actually, the supporting cast is a who's who of television best character actors.a unique film that is funny one moment and chilling the next, nurse betty is a mix of great acting, casting, and a terrific screenplay.

jacqueline hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is. everyone out there will like it! sandwiched between the amount of breast shots, the times jacqueline rubs herself, the various times jackie spends chatting to herself and the times spent heaving in the magdelena mountains, this could create one hell of a dishwasher if your career were to end.unlike most horror movies that take place in space or in some restless tranquility with ripe green apples, this one takes awhile to guzzle. the performing is good. other than great acting by dan the pizza delivery guy (must see), there are no standouts, but no notably bad outcroppings from my recent dinner either (and i do mean recent). excellent acting overall because there are no typically dreadful actors which you'd find in movies of the four "skin" related data fields or in the biological skimmer's found in any ibm shop. in addition if you see a female in this movie, the likelihood is that she will be butt naked by the next scene! now that i think about it, there is quite a bit of action in this movie. between the first and the second electro yank obtained from a hot chick and the time you observe her "buckets naked", keeps em' speculating. i loved it!

nurse betty is really an interesting movie. i guess we all know someone who is so convinced that the characters in a soap opera are real, that you can't explain them with any means that these are just actors and not real persons.'nurse betty' isn't a nurse at all. in real life she is an ordinary housewife who works at a diner. to escape from her awful husband and the problems in her miserable life, she has become a very dedicated fan of a soap opera. after she witnessed her husband being murdered, she goes into some kind of a shock and she loses all grip on reality. she thinks she's in love with one of the characters from the soap opera, a doctor, and decides that she'll visit him and start a family with him. the hit men however think that she knows too much and go after her to kill her.as i already said, the subject is quite recognizable (if you leave the professional hit men and the murder out of it) and the movie was funny. the story was well directed and the actors did a fine job. it had everything i always want to see when watching a comedy. i give it a 7.5/10.

with nurse betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker neil labute (in the company of men, your friends & neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (betty's $24 million as opposed to company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. while his cast is now composed of a-list hollywood names (renee zellweger, morgan freeman, and stand-up comedian chris rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing. nurse betty is one of the darkest comedies to be advertised towards a mainstream audience in years, and considering its moderate box office and critical success, perhaps moviegoers weren't as dumb and brainwashed as we though they were. the story follows (both figuratively and literally) a naive waitress (zellweger) who has fallen in love from afar with a handsome soap star (as good as it gets's greg kinnear) but is trapped in a loveless marriage to a slimy car dealer (aaron eckhart, who made his big-screen debut in company). when her husband is gruesomely murdered by two hitmen (freeman and rock), she's sent into shock and obliviously sets out for hollywood to meet her object of affection -- unaware that he's only an actor. when freeman and rock discover that the car she took contains 10 kilos of cocaine, they hit the road as well and outrageousness ensues. fans of labute's previous work might have a hard time figuring out how this could possibly be the same guy who directed in the company of men -- a tragicomedy about two cruel sexist pigs who play a practical joke on a deaf co-worker --, but when you think about it, the connection is rather clear: in company, a vulnerable woman is unaware that she is being ruthlessly taken advantage of. in betty, a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the man she's chasing thinks her genuine adoration is nothing more than a joke. some might begin to wonder if labute is really some sort of misogynist himself -- considering that his recurring theme involves the downfall of innocent women. but personally, i think he's coming to the defense of the fair sex and dealing far more harshly with the abusers in his pictures than the abused. one of the many charms of this film is that it's absurdity is full-fledged: most directors, when handling a script such as this one, would leave the story at two hitmen chasing a woman chasing a dream. but labute knows better, and has one of the hitmen (freeman) fall obsessively for betty as well. this was an interesting role for freeman to take, because it allowed him to play off of his trademark `this-is-the-last-time' character (see unforgiven, se7en, and 1998's stinker hard rain); the supporting cast also includes the likes of famed weirdo crispin glover (back to the future), allison janney, and `mad about you's kathleen wilhoite. the script, written by first-timers john c. richards and james flamberg, is deliriously over-the-top (honestly: have you ever seen a comedy -- or any movie, for that matter -- in which a man is scalped in his own dining room?). you could argue that the ending is a little too perfect, but it's really not worth denying everything that's great about the film for one trivial complaint. if nurse betty is any sign of what labute has in store for us next, you can bet that i'll be lining up for whatever he decides to follow it up with.grade: a-

honestly, when i went to see this movie at the rave theater in plainfield indiana, i did not expect much. i went to this movie only because i figured hey, it's a wwe movie it'll be good for a laugh. then i sat down and watched it and saw why they chose glen jacobs (kane) to play jacob goodnight. he is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than freddy or jason) and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie. it shows jacob goodnight as someone who is human. he has a heart, no matter how twisted and creepy it is. he feels pain, something that jason never does or appears to show. he feels sorrow and pleasure, though again both of them insane which you will notice if you see the movie. all in all, a different experience in my opinion than many slashers, and it surprised me in a few ways, as in who lived in the end.

my taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and i have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and see no evil happens to be exactly that and more!! i think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a wwe film and "starring" kane. wwe might have a big following but it's a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park "sport" and those who don't love it haattte it!! it would make them steer clear of an otherwise typical gory slasher flick that people would come out in droves to see. see no evil doesn't break any new horror ground, it's exactly play by play typical horror with some over the top, horrific bloody scenes that honestly make your screen crawl. they really drive it home and go for gratuitous violence just cause. there is no psychological aspect exactly although being chased by this monster has some fear elements to it.kane (the wrestler) also known as glen jacobs plays religiously and physically tortured man jacob goodnight. he's the ultimate cross between leatherface, and jason voorhees. he's not an original killer and even his kills don't really go for the unique or original with the major exception of choking a girl to death by forcing her to swallower her cell phone...yeeeeah!! he does a good job and the man is legitimately enormous!! he stands at 7 feet tall and without any special effects is monstrous!! tiffany lamb, penny mcnamee, samantha noble, michael j. pagan, luke pegler, christina vidal, rachael taylor all play the typical group of "think they are invincible" partying teens who will unwillingly become victim to the serial killer. the story is that in exchange for a month off their detention sentence for petty crimes ranging from theft to drug possession, they are sent to an old hotel to do "community service " by fixing it up. turns out a serial killer lives upstairs and he's removing his victims eyes to cleanse them of their sins. luke pegler stands out as a scum bag who in the end becomes a hero of sorts even saving his ex-girlfriend who he used to beat up on. the rest of them all play their perspective roles quite well but it isn't a great stretch of acting ability.sadly porn director...yes porn...gregory dark, does a good job putting together the modern day slasher flick. he even goes into a bit of history with the killer and although his back story is not unique either, in fact it's a little stale it's still interesting enough. and in the few shots where the film goer is actually seeing through the killer's eyes, it's interesting to hear the voices and see things distorted like he does. he throws in the obligatory soft core nude shot, and the grotesque, blood soaked scenes and turns everything up a notch. it fits nicely and for a horror fan like myself it's entertaining. kane's serial killer is horrifying and he stalks them all down with brutal intelligence and a silent horror. the film is being panned and crapped on and i don't blame anyone because it's pretty crappy but isn't that the point?? it's a horror film and i thought it was exactly what it should be. it made me jump, it made me cringe, it even made me turn away at several parts...impressive by any standards. it's entertaining, with a decent story, and plenty of set up to serialize see no evil until the 15th installment if they wanted to and i say bring it on!! it's true the film is full of plot holes, laughable details but the deadly gore and horror over rides it all. it all comes down to do you love horror films?? really love them?? if yes then you'll think this is a terrific slasher...if not...you'll hate it...plain and simple. 8.5/10

okay i marked this spoiler so don't be upset when i wrap this up. now i went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. and i was right, as almost every horror flick i have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. what helped was the story, i did not expect there to be a "why" to kane's madness. but there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for. but if your a fan of saw, or some other movies that claim their fame thanks to sadistic content this is a movie to watch. now where i really throw in a spoiler for a second warning. i give this movie a 9 perhaps because i'm a fan of the wwe and a fan of kane, but who doesn't like a movie a little bit better when it stars somebody we love. however this movie could have scored a 10 for me if. . . (spoiler)----> at the end of the movie when it showed kane dead on the pavement. while a dog pissing in his eye was "cute" it could have been classic with the kane/undertaker quick sit up and turn of the head. a perfect 10 would have been awarded if that would have happened. it was a perfect opportunity, but either the wwe didn't think of that or a future sequel will begin with that very sequence i mentioned. that's all. (9)

i didn't know a lot about this film going into it but i did find out that kane was a wrestler, which didn't exactly thrill me but hey, i liked "santa's slay" and that had a wrestler in it, so what the hell. the story begins very strangely and promisingly but after a while becomes not much more than your typical teen terror slasher flick, although the settings helped some. a bunch of criminal young folks get rounded up and taken to an old hotel that used to be a luxury palace but is now a dump, to clean it up to prepare it as a homeless shelter. the driver is a man with a prosthetic arm, being a veteran of the opening scene of this movie wherein he encounters this big galoot that had just killed his partner and blinded another woman. the teens, all being punk smart-asses, all of course object to having to do any real work, but they're part of some unique co-ed work program, yep, what a great idea that is, of course. little does anyone suspect that there is someone lurking there in the hotel that in his own little way will save the tax payers of that state some money. of course, it's the guy that likes to collect eyeballs, and he's got quite a collection going. there won't be a lot here that horror fans haven't seen before but there's a few brutal scenes and sufficient gore to satisfy the hard-core fan. the setting of the old hotel makes a perfect spot for a slasher flick too, and there's little sub-stories, like the search for an alleged safe full of money and the search for babes, since this co-ed work crew is evenly matched. most of the teens are deservingly killable too so that works well. not great but far better than silent hill or when a stranger calls, and perhaps better than some of the other crap that i wouldn't bother to see. 7 out of 10.

this movie was so cool! i saw it on a friday night with a couple of my friends. while the first credits were rolling, we saw that lionsgate films had made this movie. they are the ones that made that stupid movie wolf creek, which was totally gay! when we saw this, we groaned. we thought it was going to be like wolf creek, but we were so wrong! the movie was not only better than wolf creek (which really isn't that hard) it is one of the best horror movies i have seen in a long time! they really redeemed themselves with this movie. it was gory, smart, and scary, which are the combinations to an awesome horror movie. kane is awesome as jacob goodnight, and christina vidal, samantha noble, and luke pegler did pretty good jobs as part of a group of delinquents cleaning an old motel. it had some gross scenes, and you actually kinda feel sad for some of the people who die. all in all, a great horror movie to watch on a friday or saturday night with the lights off and with friends. just don't watch it in a hotel.

i liked this a lot. the camera angles are cool, it's not all jumpy like a blair witch. and i thought they did a great job with the sound when we see things from kane's point of view. lots of fun. plenty of people were shouting at the screen! kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions. he's a lot less one-dimensional than most horror heroes.kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos. it was not clear to me how he would react to various situations. there are not many twists here, but it is clever and original in it's own way. good, creepy, b-movie slasher fare.

anyone who critiques 'jacqueline hyde' as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that it's intended to be is just not playing with a full deck. just from the title, it's obvious that this low budget horror comedy isn't meant to be taken seriously... it's as tongue in cheek as a nympho's french kiss, and just as titillating. the female cast members are all great and fun to watch. check this out, rolfe kanefsky is the clown-prince of soft-core horror. unlike most soft-core horror flicks, this one is entertaining all the way through with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses. the movie doesn't even attempt to follow the storyline of the robert louis stevenson classic, but instead seeks out every way possible to create risqué sight gags and erotic situations. blythe metz, the brunette femme fatale who portrays the sexier, homicidal side of jacqueline, is a real knockout. watch and enjoy!

one thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun/exciting for the cast and crew; i could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm & dedication because they apparently liked the people involved. i tend to like b movies that are original and have heart, and i think this is one such work. the actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual, maybe because of some good direction from the lead actress/director, and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent, watchable piece of art. the critiques of this film that more or less say, "why not just rent a hardcore porn movie," make the point as to why they didn't like the film. going to this film hoping for a lot of t&a without patience for the material of the plot is why it is so unenjoyable for them. one could say the movie is more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie, even though i take it the star has done her share of soft porn. i think she graduated. in terms of the writing, the dialog is not a huge part of the movie, like in a tarentino film, but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun. particularly the ending is not a disappointment but a pleasure, with the villianess/heroine and the "leading man" learning from their complex web of feelings. i understand that the producer got a 3 film deal out of this. hats off for proving a few tens of thousands of dollars can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensibility and pride. gabriella and the other girls with scenes of nudity were likable along with being hot, not just airhead bimbos, so as an erotic science fantasy piece with some gorgeous nude art, even with the limits of b-movie land, not disappointing.

i have to admit that i had low expectations for this movie. but i was surprised to find it entertaining, interesting, and funny. it's an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror film. there were moments that made my hairs stand up! even better, though, were the highly amusing, occasionally hysterical, comedic moments in the film (you'll know which ones i'm talking about). there also are a few great special effects (and the humor and the special effects aren't necessarily separate).the acting, on the whole, is very good--way better than a typical low budget horror film. the lead (jackie), in particular, and many of the smaller, supporting roles (like the lawyer, the couple living next door, the pizza man) are well acted. if they hadn't been, the film wouldn't have kept my interest and i would have lost my belief in the story. this is a good, interesting low budget thriller and definitely worth a rental!

breathtaking at it's best, intriguing at it's worst, francis ford coppala's groundbreaking epic 'apocalypse now' is one of the most iconic and celebrated motion pictures of the 20th century, and in my opinion, the greatest ever film depiction centered around america's involvement in vietnam.what i like most about 'apocalypse now' is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre. growing up as movie buff, and with a particular interest in war films, i've seen many films, which have attempted to portray the 'images' and 'feelings' of vietnam but have been unsuccessful in doing so. films such as 'hamburger hill' and 'we were soldiers' fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of vietnam by depicting 'heroic battles' which are, more often than not, tainted by the zeal of hollywood film production.in 'apocalypse now' there are no battles, no heroes or villains, there is nothing in the film that suggests that it is intended to reflect the imagery of vietnam through the physical aspects of war. rather, it is a film, which powerfully investigates and explores the human psyche when it has been tormented by the absolute 'horror' of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous century.the sheer brilliance of the acting (in particular the interpretation of taciturn captain willard by martin sheen), along with the spectacular cinematography (filmed in the phillipines), which provides crucial realism to the backdrop of the film, makes 'apocalypse now' an unforgettable epic.evoking a myriad of emotions and leaving us with a maelstrom of mediation, 'apocalypse now' is not for the light-hearted moviegoer. it is masterpiece that demands multiple viewings to be fully appreciated.

this version of alice in wonderland is truly original. equal parts porn, fairy-tale, and musical-comedy - this film is definitely a strange bit of adult-film history.alice is a sexually naive librarian who ends up following the rabbit into "wonderland", where she meets all kinds of "experienced" weirdos like the mad-hatter (who likes to pull his dong out whenever possible), humpty dumpty (who broke his wiener along with his shell), tweedledee and tweedledum (a brother/sisters sex-crazed duo), and the bi-sexual queen - among others.this version of alice in wonderland is actually quite tame by the standards of the time - a time when a lot of porn was mean-spirited and nasty (as noted by the "roughie" sub-genre) - this one is actually quite funny and strangely endearing. it's the kind of thing you'd show your kids - if it weren't for the graphic sex. a little slow getting to the "good-stuff"...but genuinely entertaining. oh - and some of the musical numbers are downright hilarious. if you're a drinker - have a few, if you're a smoker - roll a couple and give this one a shot. 8/10

i remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in anaheim, california in october, 1976. while driving the tourist laden city streets , we saw a movie marquee advertising "alice in wonderland xxx." so before even checking out disneyland's version of the lewis carroll classic a half mile away, our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. i remember even before the movie began how surprised i was to see this kind of film appearing in staid, ultra-conservative orange county.thirty two years later, i came across alice in wonderland at a local video store. i wondered to myself if this was the same film until i looked at the back of the jacket and saw a picture of lovely kristine debell in the starring role and decided to rekindle some fond memories. subversive video, to their credit, has released two versions, x and xxx in the same package. as it turns out, the version my friend and i saw in anaheim was rated x in spite of the original xxx advertising at the there. seeing it the second time around makes me realize what a delightful romp director bud townsend brought to the screen. as an example of this man's scope behind the camera, in his salad days he directed two episodes of tv's death valley days.miss debell, appearing in the april, 1976 cover of playboy is ideal as alice. she brings a fresh all american innocence to the role as a librarian in her early twenties yearning for a better life. when her boyfriend is rebuffed from taking their relationship to the next level, alice reaches her turning point. this is a 'musical comedy' yet the melodies are quite catchy with appropriate strings and brass to offset the generally suggestive lyrics. miss debell has a pleasant singing voice as she trills about wanting to be free. that's when the magic begins. the pacing of this movie is surprisingly fluid, given the genre and the supporting cast of wonderland are there to enable alice as she blossoms into womanhood. special mention goes to tv veteran larry gelman as the white rabbit who seems to be the only character not obsessed with sex as he is always running late for an appointment.or something.special features include comments from noted feminist advocate lena ramone who imparts how viewing this movie while attending college influenced her in choosing a career as an adult film actress after graduation.what makes alice in wonderland such a delightful jaunt is its garden like setting. partly filmed in the lush, natural splendor of vancouver b.c.'s stanley park, the movie belies its pornographic roots. you don't come away feeling you've watched a sleazy skin flick. at this writing, i haven't viewed the triple xxx version. the extra sex footage tacked on afterward would, in all probability, disrupt the overall flow and remove the light, breezy atmosphere evident throughout.naturally, the lewis carroll version is the best way to curl up and explore alice's adventures in wonderland. however, for a time capsule representing 1970s' adult film archives, alice in wonderland is worth following that white rabbit for a ribald ride full of mirthful mayhem.

i only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much. pornography has a useful purpose in society(can't say i can always think of one)but it probably does.personal viewpoints set aside, i really thought this film was pretty funny. i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, i bought it because i am one of those 'alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'alice in wonderland'. i own just about every version there is on dvd so it was an obvious choice to complete my dvd collection with this. i must admit i was scandalized beyond my expectations, and the whole thing would have been thoroughly offensive if it hadn't been so damned funny. besides, the music is really good and i like musicals.not everyone can make a good nudie musical. anyone that has seen 'the first nudie musical' knows what a stink-bomb that was. considering what a low budget bill osco worked with, 'alice' is pretty remarkable as a musical(it's better than some musicals made on costly budgets).the film can't totally escape the dirtiness of porn. i usually watch the xxx version for full shock effect and some of those scenes are scandalizing(scandalizing because we are talking about lewis carroll). i found myself feeling very uncomfortable and embarrassed during the scene where 'alice'(kristine debell) starts masturbating. it made me feel like a voyeur. and the gratuitous lesbian scenes with 'alice' and the kitty-cats were a bit too racey.the film has a great sense of humor about everything however. there is one especially funny moment during the queen's orgy when one of the actresses gets up and says "who do i have to f---k to get out of this movie?". hilarious.i'm not sure i buy the whole sex is good for you ball your brains out philosophy here, but sex is human, and nothing human disgust me.(i don't know if i really feel that way, but i couldn't resist saying it)some people think everything should be about sex. i dunno. jeez, just show some frick'in responsibility and decorum. this movie definitely scores points for the sex-minded, but i wouldn't push your luck, next time you might really freak someone out. i mean we are dealing with children's literature here.

i so much enjoyed this little musical fantasy i bought a copy to share with my friends. it is a pleasant and diverting change from our mundane lives..... i believe that we can all benefit from an active fantasy life, one of joy and indulgence, i heartily recommend it!the performance is excellent, and the music uplifting!

what can you possibly say? this is the uncut hardcore, musical alice! it works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version, i guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. pretty much a delight throughout. there are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. it also could have been and today would have been too camp. no, a very fine effort that is amusing, tuneful and just sexy enough. fine performances particularly the kristine debell in the lead and was that an unaccredited richard prior as the prone knight being vigorously (if discreetly) ridden?

adult version of the classic lewis carroll tale is much better than you might expect. here alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image. made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes, this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day. despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. its an naughty little tale for adults. if you're wondering whether or not my recommendation is a good one or not consider that the film was pretty much only available in its non-hardcore version for the better part of the last three decades simply because the film stands up with out the sex, which is how i first saw the film years ago on cable tv. the relatively recent home video release on dvd put back the sex (in horribly grainy inserted clips) which makes it clear the removal of the shots was the best choice all around. if you're an open minded adult with a taste for something spicy i can heartily recommend this little film as a nice diversion.

alice enters in a world of wonder... but not the kind of wonder that you remember as a kid. the mad hatter, the white rabbit, the queen and others (even tweedledee and tweedledum) show alice some things about her body -- and other people's bodies -- that might be quite wonderful. a tale of love and lust the likes you've never seen.kristine debell appears as alice. i must say, by 1970s standards, this may be the most attractive adult actress of her day. i believe this is her only film before moving on to mainstream work, but it was pretty much the best possible one she could have chosen (my love for all things alice is no secret). even better than "fairy tales" (which isn't really pornography, so, much).the songs are cheesy, but fit the theme of the movie. one song, "what's a girl like you doing on a knight like this?" was pretty funny, and the others had similar themes going. the trial towards the end was well scripted, and fit very nicely into the world of alice. the logic and humor were definitely accounted for.what more can you say about a film like this? all i know is, for people who are used to adult films where it's just a 30-second lead-in to the sex, this one is going to overload you with plot and music. but, personally, i think there's something very special about this film and i hope it gets a nice dvd release with things touched up and special features (if that's even possible). i can see this being a cult film.

i agree that this is one of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of mark lenard as the romulan commander. my reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode, then you know mr. lenard as sarek, spock's father. and for the 2nd generation trekkie (or trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all. there are excellent points made by both sides about the cost of war vs.the price of peace and certainly does remind one of some of the best of the wwii and later era movies. those are not my favorite genre but i certainly would recommend a fan of such to view this episode through that filter. you'll see it holds up. i'll never understand why sci-fi gets so little respect--the best drama comes out of placing ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.

this is one of the best of the early "star trek" episodes, with kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded romulans are racial offshoots of the vulcans! young mr. stiles, well-played by paul comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the "star trek" universe. his barely disguised hatred of mr. spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many americans have of people of arab or middle eastern origin. the atmosphere of war-time paranoia is all too real. then there's the romulans: they're the ultimate federation nemesis. the klingons are nasty but basically harmless; more of a nuisance than a serious threat. the romulans, however, mean business: they're the ancient romans reborn in the space age; in spite of their vulcanoid features they're clearly meant to remind us of imperial rome, with names like decius and titles like "centurion" and "praetor." the chain-mail armor is really cool. familiar guest star mark lenard, who went on to play spock's dad sorek as well as the klingon commander in "star trek: the motion picture" is an appropriately grizzled, war-weary commander, a character who bears a striking resemblance to laurence olivier's crassus in "spartacus." also, his questioning of the empire's unquenchable thirst for conquest reminds me of the similar misgivings marcus aurelius (richard harris) expressed at the beginning of "gladiator." a must both for trekkies and sword-and-sandal epic fans.

despite all the hoopla about the trouble with tribbles episode, the balance of terror might just be the best episode of the series. and, while i have always loved a piece of the action because it is so much fun, i really do have to cast my vote as this romulan episode as being the very best.the movie, interestingly enough, is really like a wwii submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked romulan ship and the enterprise as it seeks to destroy the romulans before they sneak back across the neutral zone after a raid on federation outposts. in so many ways, the show is much like the film the enemy below--where the american captain (robert mitchum) and the german captain (curt jurgens) are shown in counter-point as they both try to outwit the other--and in the process develop a grudging respect for their foe.interestingly enough, only a short bit of the beginning of the episode takes place on a planet--and this is amazing because an episode on board ship could easily have been static and dull. but, because the writing was so fantastic and the main characters written and acted so well (shatner and mark leonard as the romulan leader). oddly, for the die-hard trekkers out there, they'll recognize leonard as the same actor who later played spock's father.the bottom line is this is simply a great and extremely engaging episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

the 20th animated disney classic is often criticized by many people as "mediocre" or poor in quality, but it is a great movie.too bad that "the aristocats" doesn't get the deserved credit. i personally see it as one of my favorite disney classics.despite being extremely underrated, it is one of the funniest disney classics. it is full of hilarious (some of them, hysterical) moments.edgar, the greedy butler, is the villain of the movie but he is a perfect comic relief. he's one of my favorite disney villains because he is so funny.every scene with edgar and the hound dogs napoleon and lafayette chasing him are among the most hilarious you'll ever see, especially the one when edgar drives his motorcycle into the river and around the bridge, with the dogs chasing him. that is hysterical!but the classic humor doesn't just come from edgar or the hound dogs. other characters have their moments as well.about the quality subject, it isn't perfect, but remains on a high level. even after walt disney's death those artists knew how to keep faithful to walt's spirit and "the aristocats" is one of those examples. they don't make them like this nowadays!as usual, legendary disney actors voice the characters. in this case, we have phil harris, sterling holloway, paul winchell, eva gabor and pat buttram.the characters are cool in general: thomas o'malley, duchess and her 3 kittens, the mouse roquefort, the alley cats, the english geese, the hound dogs and the horse. the human characters are included as well: the eccentric and kind retired opera singer madame adelaide bonfamille, the comic madame's old lawyer georges hautecourt and edgar himself!about the soundtrack, it has some nice and catchy songs such as thomas o'malley's theme (but i can't remember its name), "everybody wants to be a cat" and "the aristocats" (sung by maurice chevalier), for example.this movie takes place in paris (france), in the year of 1910. above all, this is a joyful, nice and very pleasant movie. a timeless classic which is often underestimated and forgotten, but very worthy.this should definitely be on top 250.

set in paris in the year 1910, a retired old rich opera singer decides to give her fortune away to her beautiful cat duchess ( voiced by eva gabor) and her kittens, but the jealous butler edgar comes up with a plan as he kidnaps the cats and leaves them in the countryside. luckily for them with the help of a streetwise and independent tomcat named thomas o'malley ( voiced by phil harris) helps them get home especially meeting some of his good friends like the swinging' scat cat ( voiced by scatman crothers) and try to foil edgar's plans.very entertaining and edgy post-walt disney's death animated movie with a couple of nice jazzy tunes like the memorable "everybody wants to be a cat", good voice acting and some terrific animation for it's time even in these times of computer animation. not one of the greatest disney animated movies but a cult disney animated fave and one of the few gems of it's day that works well, highly recommended.

no. i'm not kidding with this one. he was a guest reviewer for entertainment weekly and gave this movie positive marks. and who can blame him? this is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny disney movie. who doesn't love kittens? the music in ev'rybody wants to be a cat is jamming. it makes me want to snap my fingers or something. only years later when cats don't dance came out have i seen a movie that was that musically fun. what aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm. plus, everything moves at a relaxed pace, and even the villain isn't all that scary. it's perfect for the younger set while not being so sappy that adults can't like it. if snoop was here, i'm sure he would say the same thing. yeah. dig those crazy cats, man.

aristocats is such a terrific disney classic that i just loved so much as a kid. still to this day i can't resist watching it, it's just such a wonderful and charming film with great animation and lovely songs. i really miss the animation films like aristocats, they had perfect voices not to mention the hand drawn animation that makes it perfect for the family. aristocats is also very witty and clever, the story was just so wonderful. this film is just beyond irresistible, i think the most memorable moment for me was the cats playing the piano learning the appecio's, lol, it was just so cute with the piano playing and painting.douchess and her kittens are very pampered in their huge mansion, mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them like they were her children. but when the lady feels it's time to make her will, she leaves everything to the cats and not to her butler. the butler gets angry and takes the kittens on the road and abondons them in the middle of no where. douchess and the kittens wake up and with the help of a smooth street cat by the name of thomas o'malley, they head back home to their lady, but learn the coolness of being a skat cat.the aristocats is just a perfect disney movie that i feel is a bit over looked. i would always highly recommend this movie for kids or families, it could be enjoyed by anyone. the songs and story is just memorable. i will always join in for the movies best song "everybody wants to be a cat", such a great tune. i also love those dogs that guarded the farm where the cats were abandoned, they were just so cute. this is a terrific film, please watch it, you won't be disappointed.9/10

one of the intriguing aspects of this historical drama is the way the "tories" or british american loyalists are portrayed, and the sort of gloss given to their ardent support for king george iii. in many ways the american revolution was definitely a family affair, in that some of the wealthier colonial families were split asunder by it. if there is a strong criticism to be made of this film, it is that perhaps the people in this story are made out to be a little bit nicer than they were in real life.in some regards, the actions of the character of major boulton, played by cornel wilde, make him the least likable member of the cast and the flaw in the storyline. he seems to vary from being a prickly kind of patriot to being a kind of 'anything for the cause,' fellow. this film does concentrate heavily on the notions of personal honor and personal prestige which were a major social 'norm' in that day and age.in its subtext, the fact that about twenty-five percent of the colonial population was decidedly pro-british is glossed over, too. but the strength of the tory element is not obviously maligned, although the good doctor character is about eighty-five percent upper class twit ( to steal a fine phrase from monty python's flying circus ). anne francis does a whole lot with a rather thin section of the script, and it stands out. she was a good choice for the woman of divided loyalties, a 'gal' who was rather more modern than the social conventions of that day might have allowed -- if there had not been a life and death struggle going on.one good aspect of the film is the way the rivalries of the american revolutionary leaders degenerated into outright jealousies, and how these personal conflicts very nearly sabotaged the entire revolutionary effort. all in all, the leading characters are very well drawn, the minor characters are not just human "props" and the fight scenes are believable enough to carry the dramatic action.this is a great spy movie. it's not quite a great historical drama, but it does satisfy well enough. it rates a seven largely because cornel wilde is so deeply immersed in his role, and does it so well, and because anne francis makes the most of her supporting effort.the color print used on turner classic movies was very clear, as well, and so it was an enjoyable presentation in that important regard.hope it runs again soon.

scarlet coat like most revolution flicks wasnt well received but is nears perfection in the art of movie making. a great character study of john andre the heroic redcoat who is revered by both friend and foe for courage,,, scarlett coat also probes the duality of the undercover agent ,,, as a counterfeit traitor maj bolton befriends andre and undertakes a high level penetration of british intelligence yet he defends andre in andre's courtmartial ... the film captures the moral ambiguity of the spyhow much of the spy's world is real ,,, which reality does he belong to the reality of his mision or the reality which the cover story createsandre's capture and courtmartial is a success for bolton in his mission beyond that whch wahington would have ever demanded ,,, the mission was merely to identify the traitor in us ranks ,,, bolton has knocked out enemy intelligence as well ,,, yet bolton mourns the death of the man he was sent to destroyann francis plays a stock american character,,, compliant with the british but willing to engage them in a war of witsa movie well worth revisiting

i can't get this flick off my brain. it's definitely totally different than anything that's out there. i've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way blindspot did. there is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together. it's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f****ing hilarious black humour. franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes, like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave. i guess some politically correctos won't appreciate the vibe (don't bring your grandma) but it is totally awesome. the thing that's best is the kaliedescope style. there is some really serious stuff mixed with super interesting footage of the road. the movie really makes you sad and scared in parts but it also spins your head with what is happening and the way it is filmed. wtf is up with the world? sooo many critics are raving about all these supposedly revolutionary ground-breaking films and when you see them they're boring and predictable and not-all-that. i don't get it because there are a lot of other better choices. blind spot is really kinda great because it gives you thrills and chills and major upcoming star power but does it in a way that is completely fresh and definitely totally rad.

it reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. a brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. the landscape develops its own persona, paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. the stark void of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. the drama is compelling. james franco and his co-stars deliver deft performances. naive schoolboy, suicidal blonde, embittered car thief -- all converge with unexpected twists. together they create an explosive portrait of fractured love -- one that unwittingly conspires to mend amidst the hardest forms of adversity and illusion -- the blindness of human emotion.

blind spot's images are great. the action draws you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. by the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high-points. the lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. the story is heart-wrenching. the film score is nicely understated . completely moving in its own powerful way. not your standard melodramatic cuing. trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions. hope you get a chance to see this film. it delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light.

james franco is totally cool in this movie. not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. at the tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole james dean thing but i don't think this true. blind spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. in this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. it's a unique performance. bittersweet and really moving. the lines from his journal cut you like a knife. you sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words. the tone is everything. he carries it through the action and suspense as well as the grim bits of gallows humor. i like the other two actors a great deal too. the blonde girl is totally gorgeous and the man is hysterical in his twisted tough guy stoicism. some of the thugs seemed a little sketchy but this is a mini-point really. the film is totally solid and franco is way cool all around.

when i saw this film at a festival years ago i was very impressed and i started to looking for it. nothing to do, not in the cinemas, nor on dvd neither on blue ray. absolutely nothing!!! how it's possible this could really happen??? the direction is impeccable, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and james franco is hot as hell!!!please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life!!!!!!!!!! this is really a very great movie that people should see and it deserve another chance!!!!!! edvard

i recently saw blind spot in coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. i really admired the story and visual approach. the action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. there is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. not just in the desert but in the city too. my best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. you really feel for this guy. i never heard of the actors before but i liked all three very much. i think they did a terrific job on their journey to self-discovery. all in all, this is an amazingly cool and suspenseful suspenseful film. i still carry many of the images in my mind.

this is probably my favourite tv show ever. i love all the characters, especially alex, who is the perfect woman! always makes me laugh and feel good when i watch this show. there is just something about it that is amazing, hard to describe.it seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well. here are a few examples. (the episodes start again when they end - but don't play end credits until the very end, but always play the opening credits. with most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some go on further.)radiohead, pink floyd, bob dylan.2.02 'double bogey' kid a / ok computer (episode plays at least 4 times)2.14 'saturn' kid a / meddle / shot of love2.19 'world without alex' kid a / wish you were here / pablo honey(episode plays at least 4 times)there are clues in the episodes which tell you which albums synchronise. kid a may synchronise with every episode!

oh i remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days. it was not a pleasant experience because i remember watching it when i made my homework.still, the show caught my attention when alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems.but the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall.the lead actress (can't remember her name and i'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance. she made the show watchable.they just don't make shows like this one anymore...

these days, you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1) a preteen/teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2) involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy/girl every time 3) revolves around erratic yelling and unintelligible humor. about 95% of shows on disney, nickelodeon, and cartoon network fit the listed criteria. to put in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality, and good story telling. it as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail. they couldn't be more unaware. sure kids enjoy a good laugh and erratic behavior (if it's done to a conservative level and done right), but as they also want to enjoy a story, see drama, and see people being challenged. they don't want to see people living in a flawless world where they get everything they want. they know this world isn't all fun and games, they know it's not perfect. everyone has problems, and we all must learn to work around them. this show revolves around that kind of stuff. alex mack is an average teenage girl who seems to have everything going for her genius sister, annie. her mom works at some office but is sometimes a stay at home parent. her dad, george, is a top scientist at the plant, a chemical corporation that employs most of the town they live in, paradise valley. alex is unpopular and picked on by most of her peers. her only friend is ray (but she gets more friends as the series goes). on her first day of jr. high, alex walks home not too happy about school, but a truck delivering chemicals from the plant crashes into a fire hydrant trying to avoid running her over, dumping a strange chemical known as gc-161, where the chemical mixes with the water, covering alex in it. soon after, she starts to develop strange powers such as morphing into a puddle, shooting lasers out of her hand, and moving things with her mind. she also glows constantly when nervous (though we never see much of that later on). aside from her sister annie and friend ray, alex decides to keep these powers a secret from everyone, even her parents for fear of being kidnapped by the plant, whose corrupt owner, danielle atron has her head of security, vince, search for the mysterious gc161 kid. every episode then deals with alex trying to live a normal life as kid at the same time learning to live with her strange powers. the series may seem like a girls show, but it's not. as a boy, i liked watching this show because of its awesome effects and drama. the producers successfully add some elements of science fiction with the elements of teen drama. in fact, some episodes were quiet violent and a little eerie. the unfounded plant manager atron and vince make good antagonists for the series, for the writers really do establish them as a threat and give you that dreadful feeling every time they come on screen. also, smart move adding david, driver of the truck that spilled the gc-161, as vince's bumbling assistant in the hunt for comedic effect but also you get to love him towards the end. it was interesting to watch little alex try to live as a normal kid but struggles to perfect her powers. at times, you forget that these are kids who are battling a giant adult run institution, because you are drawn in to the story. the show does a good job of relating to kids by showing alex that she may have super powers, but she still is a kid, and must be careful. even some episode you'll find yourself distraught at alex's calamities. my favorite episode where alex wishes she was never born truly demonstrates most of these elements. as i said, the producers never hesitated to add in some laughs whether they come from ray's one liner or george's strange habits or david trying to be a nice guy. of course you come across corny moments and an entire episode that really has nothing to do with the series plot, but what good series doesn't? all in all great show. 9/10

***spoilers ahead*** my late childhood had two cinematographic icons: star wars and this film by czech genius karel zeman. a jules verne encyclopedia where xix century illustrations come to life in exquisite black and white photography, combined with stop motion and conventional animation. verne's spirit of adventure is fully present throughout the film, as well as a very modern questioning on the moral limits of power and advanced technology. in fact, it brings atomic energy into verne's universe in a very elliptic and elegant way. also elliptic and elegant is the demise of the villain, with a (probably nuclear) explosion sending his hat flying over the sea. the resolution of the film is symbolic and very satisfactory, something very rare today, when a lot of films don't seem to know how to end themselves.i was fortunate to catch this gem in reruns on local tv in the late 70s: it enhanced my enjoyment of verne's fiction and of cinema.10 out of 10 for karel zeman, under-appreciated master of imagination.

truly unique and stunning film of jules verne's "for the flag" by the czech master director karel zeman.although the story is enacted in a rather understated late victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of verne that the reader associates in his mind. the style resembles the steel engravings of dore and bennet and riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of georges melies added.photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a saturday morning variety. there are underwater sequences where the fishes swimming about are so accurately drawn they can be used in a field guide.there are images of ships ,submarines, flying craft, castles,and machinery that are drawn in such accurate detail that one must have a freeze frame on his vcr or dvd to pause the scene and study the remarkable detail that went into this production.the late victorian atmosphere is designed to look like this world that never was and delight us in the magic of science that made verne the great father of the genre. if this is not enough, there also is the film score that probably is one of the best ever created for a fantasy or sci-fi film.truly a forgotten classic, this one is worth hunting down and buying. always one of my favorite films of all times, it is sure to be one of yours too. and remember- this was done decades before cgi or computer animation. kudos to the great artists who obviously put their heart into it. it shows. jules verne himself would be proud of this movie.a film that deserves to be better known, but those who have seen it love it-and treasure it. an outstanding achievement , this remarkable film just gets better every time you watch it. a true cinematic work of art from a visionary director.

the movie is based on a jules verne book i actually have read once, about ten years ago. i remember i liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job in telling the story. the most important thing in this movie isn't the story, however, but the highly original visual look it has.the visuals are absolutely beautiful, and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie. combined by jules verne's own unique versions of airplanes and submarines and karel zeman's good directing results in a very well done and convincing visual style that manages to effectively hold one's attention until the end of the movie.there are some problems as well, one of the underwater scenes at the end takes maybe needlessly lot of time for example, as the story in the first part of the movie is rushed through quite quickly. none of this matters much though since the movie is always highly enjoyable. a gem that deserves to be more well known for today's audiences as well. a recommended movie for the whole family.

this is a charming movie to say the least. the main character, fanda, is an old man who refuses to be among the living dead by which he is surrounded. he and his accomplice go around pulling pranks and getting into trouble all over town. meanwhile his family is up in arms about what to do with him. from there you see fanda's relationships with his wife, best friend and son develop. it finally leads up to one of the best movie endings i have ever seen.the characters in this movie are rich and deep. they develop well through the course of the film. the movie has quite a range of moods. it goes from light and funny to grim and dark. any slow parts for you in this film will be made up for in the end.autumn spring carries a similar message like a lot of other european movies do -- don't lose sight of the small pleasures in life. if you enjoyed amelie, the eighth day or life is beautiful (all great films btw), you will probably like this movie.8.5/10

renowned czech actor vlastimil brodský, mostly known in north america for his leading role as jacob in the original est german/czech production of jacob the liar (jakob, der lügner 1974) gives us a last brilliant performance as a 80 year old prankster who refuses to admit that he is about to die.jirí hubac's screenplay is exquisite. funny, moving and well-developed. it explores well both the subject of advanced old age and the motivations of characters that are precariously strong and fragile, happy and unsettled.frantisek (vlastimil brodský) and his best friend eda (stanislav zindulka) are up to all types of shenanigans and are making sure to make the best out of their dying days. meanwhile, frantisek's wife is preparing for their death, saving up for funeral money and chastising frantisek for his endless childishness and irresponsible attitude. their son is about to take their apartment over and put them into a retirement home, but frantisek doesn't want to hear any of that. he wants to enjoy life and make people around him laugh. he wants to help and love and give... but at what cost?sure to captivate adults of all ages, this fine piece of film by talented director vladimír michálek is both touching and funny. it makes you think of how we live our lives and why we live our lives. it brings the simple story of a charming stubborn old man to the forefront and allow us to reflect and feel what life is all about.after an active career lasting more than 40 years, it is somewhat sombre to know that vlastimil brodsk died in april 2002, no longer in the grip of terminal cancer. it is however uplifting to think that he had the chance to be a part of such a moving script and to be the catalyst of this ode to joyful old age that has not even started to make the waves it is about to create in north american repertoire cinema.after the international success of jan hrebejk's "divided we fall (2000)", it is starting to be clear that czech cinema has indeed something to offer to the world. this film at least is a must see.

as a czech i am very pleased when i read these comments here. i am absolutely sure that this film is great. and what you maybe don't know is that story was specially written for mr. brodský. the man you can see is him and his typical attitude - to live and to resist death. he was one of great actors and we are very lucky that we he has made so many beautiful films during his life. you are lucky you could see at least one of them. enjoy.

up front, if you're tired, the first hour could be slow. the set up of the story has a natural leisurely pace, unhurried - giving us time to appreciate the kind of everyday life and situations the main characters are in. once you arrived at the climatic segment of the storyline, the turn of events will keep you hooked: how will things turn out, what will happen to our precious fanda (portrayed to utter quiet perfection by the veteran czech actor vlastimil brodský), how will his wife (wonderfully played by stella zázvorková) treat him, what happens to fanda's dear friend ed (played by stanislav zindulka - a matching sidekick to brodský), and jára the son with selfish hidden agenda, blind to the kindness of his parents (sigh!)vladimír michálek sensibly directed the film with sprinkles of humor, preserving the insightful script by jirí hubac. thanks to clear subtitling, i was able to notice for every 'complaining' phrase fanda's wife utters, there's a hint of 'caringness' showing/buried in between the lines - and so did the judicious lady judge observed. fanda is '76 going on 80' and the affection of their enduring (endearing) marriage manifests even in their bantering arguments. his playfulness can be infectious.this is 'growing old together 101' for (at least) the beyond fifties, and lessons learned to sons and daughters not to take parents for granted. one may need to rethink if assuming 'home for the aged' is a means to an end, so to speak. the film is gently shouting to us to live life to the fullest while we can. (hint: there's joy in staying on and watch the end credits roll.)we're fortunate to be able to see an occasional czech film. the sverák ("kolya") father & son's 2001 "dark blue world" was revealing with pathos. it's good to take it slow now and then and appreciate a foreign gem - its subtitles, scenery, melodic score and an engaging human story with elegant performances. "autumn spring" (aka babí léto) is available on dvd. enjoy!

i was delighted when i saw that my husband rented "labyrinth of passion". i love almodovar's films. we both loved the movie. we both couldn't stop laughing. we especially enjoyed the scene in which the transvestite is shooting a photo novel, and while supposedly being menaced by a killer with an electric drill, is told to answer the phone and say, "i can't talk to you right now, i'm being attacked by a sadistic serial killer. if i survive i will call you back". (that would make a great answering machine message come to think of it). we also loved the lady telling her new found beloved, "i went to an orgy after the concert but i couldn't stop thinking of you." (i'm waiting to use that line on twitter). "labyrinth of passion" is a rollicking farce with plenty of high jinks, hilarious dialog and eye candy for everyone. the film has aged well: the 1980s costumes and hairdos add to the wackiness. i would give it a 10 out of 10 rating but i am giving it a 8 for two reasons. the first is the scene which involves laxatives which includes a shot of a lady soiling herself: totally unnecessary, and it brings down the tone of the film to hollywood gross-out comedy for a moment. the second is the suggestion that queti is sleeping with her father: shocking, yes, but again, it ruins the tone of the film. still, i would recommend the film to anyone who wants a sophisticated, spicy, and fun time.

"labyrinth of passion"--with the possible exception of "matador "--is almodovar's best film. it displays his unique personality at its best and least-censored, before he started going more mainstream. almodovar is just about the only modern director that can approach preston sturges' wonderful brand of lunacy. it's pointless to try and explain what the movie is about, the real point being almodovar's willingness and skill in taking his situations to the outer limits of sanity, and sometimes of plausibility and taste as well.

very typical almodóvar of the time and, in its own way, no less funny than many of his later works. and why is that? there is nothing to be provoked or shocked about, and i guess any such effect is more coincidental than intentional. no, the great humor stems from an underlying, almost surreal, absurdity that is woven into the scenery: the characters' nearly complete lack of taboo. it's the same kind of 'comic suspense' you find in his later works, though you'll find it in a more rough version here. he's building up for masterpieces to come, but is not yet there.the sole reviewer who commented on this movie before i did, claimed that it had to be a "very select" group of people who'd find this movie hilarious. i do.

this movie was an amazing tribute to whoever has gone through this type of pain and suffering. the acting wasn't the greatest, i'll admit that, but it was passionate about it's message, sending people into prisons without so much as an attorney or some type of trial is cruel and unusual. they even had a damn trial for saddam, so why doesn't every suspected terrorist have some type of fair and justified trial or hearing as to why they were tagged in the first place? i'm getting off the movie, but i think it's worthy to note about this sick, twisted idea the government has. the movie's way of telling the story and the backstory was a great mystery. the whole movie, i was trying to connect the daughter with the plot and it's made very obvious in the end. there's no doubt that the directing was incredible, but the one thing i didn't care for was that there wasn't as much emphasis on reese witherspoon's character's interest and fight in the ideal she held, a lot of skipping. otherwise it was actually quite entertaining, and most of all it kept my attention and interest for the two hours it played.

when going to see rendition, i was expecting an exciting film on a controversial topic with big-name actors. i was not expecting a film that was so engrossing, exciting, poetic, and sad that picked me up from the very beginning and didn't let me go, even after i left the theater. a word of advice to anyone who hasn't seen it yet, don't let your politics come in the way of enjoying (or not enjoying) this film. take it for what it is. i saw this with my conservative jewish family (i'm the black sheep, the pseudo-liberal college student) and i thought they would write it off as "liberal propaganda". instead, they said it was a great film with excellent performances (they like to fancy themselves film critics).it's sad that a movie like this has to be marketed by its oscar-affiliated actors, while leaving out the constantly underrated sarsgaard as well as new talent like the truly excellent metwally. the entire cast gave good performances, with some standing out much more than others; my only problem with it was that there was a lot going on which didn't allow for much screen time for each of the characters. in fact, i felt like the "sub-plot" with fatima and khalid was just as prominent on screen as anwar's part of the story.the characters all have the potential to fall into stereotypes, but the actors do a good enough job to give them depth with the little screen time they have. streep is truly terrific, as a heartless senator, and as much as i don't want to see the actress in such a terrible role its impossible not to believe her. gyllenhaal, who will probably be one of the oscar nods for this movie, seems a bit unsure in his role at times. h's trying to portray his inner conflict but usually just comes off like he either forgot his lines or he doesn't know how he should feel. sarsgaard gave an excellent performance; his unforgettable confrontation with streep is easily one of the best parts of the movie. metwally, again, was terrific, and i hope to see him in more mainstream films. it's a shame that gyllenhaal with probably get nominated before him. yigal naor, as shown on imdb, has been is some films already but he is a newcomer in my eyes. he, along with mohammed khouas and zineb oukach, all gave great performances.the story of fatima and khalid was not given any credit in commercials, but it brings a sad humanity to the story. the narrative was interesting as i was trying to really connect the two story until it was plainly told to us at the end. i've read some comments on here that say the love story was useless, but i disagree. i think it definitely shows another side to the controversial issue as well as humanity in general. khalid was the real terrorist, but he was doing it to avenge his brother, and even though he is responsible for the attack, you see a humane side to him through the story with fatima. not that i think we should feel bad for actual terrorists, but i think the "we are all people" theme was definitely relevant.whatever your feelings on terrorism, politics, etc. leave it out of the theater. the bottom line is this is an interesting story with a message we all need to hear.

we start all of our reviews with the following information. my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! so we can see whatever we want whenever we want. the point of this is that critics count for zero. your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me. the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! we never ever listen or read the critics. we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. well enough about that. when meryl streep the head of the nsc in the movie says "the united states does not torture" it got a big laugh at this movie. it is of course a lie that the bush administration has denied time and again. it is a very good movie and it is scary in what they can do to us as we lose all of our civil rights. they can simply "snatch" you anywhere and tell know one that they have done it. in this case, they snatch a man who has a name similar to those who killed thousands on 9-11. he is of course just like you or i. and so they take him to a secret location outside of the us to torture and waterboard him. very frightening. well acted by jake and reese and the entire cast.

an arab american man is kidnapped from an american airport and flown to "somewhere in north africa" where he is tortured. the reason? his cell phone received a call from a known terrorist. the cia decides to avoid legal means to determine whether the phone call is implication of guilt or just a mistake. after watching this movie we can only but pray some terrorist doesn't accidentally punch in a wrong number!in addition to the rendition there are several related side stories. one involves the daughter of the chief of intel (secret police?) who is torturing the suspect, and her involvement with her lover who happens to be in night school for suicide bombers. this story is way too contrived, but nevertheless intriguing, especially when we see it's outcome. the director uses a neat time line switcheroo to hook the audience. the second side story is the attempt by the suspects wife to find out what happened to her missing husband. she gets an old lover to help. he (a muted saarsgard) is aide de camp to a senator (alda) and soon gets cold feet when he realizes that his job isn't worth uncovering the truth. witherspoon is wasted in this role. all she gets to do is look forlorn and pregnant, with one brief rage attack. streep is good and cold and stereotypical as the govt. (cia?nsa?homeland sec?) official who seems to be a cheney clone. gylenhall also is wasted as a minor analyst pushed into in area he's over his head in, although he gets to do the "right thing" in the end.i found the movie engrossing, if somewhat languorous, but thought it added little to the subject. it is certainly not to be viewed as definitive, and it certainly has an axe to grind. like "the kingdom" it scratches the surface of a very complicated subject.the movie tries hard to give us an idea about rendition, but can only end up by being a "cautionary tale" about one botched one. the whole point of rendition is not to "torture" but to get "terror suspects" to give intel by avoiding legal (therefore obstructive) barriers. torture, for sure, may be employed, especially if the rendition is out of our hands - although we are obviously not guiltless in this matter - but intel that can save lives is vital in this "shadow war."

rendition is a film not to miss with solid writing from kelley sane and with the direction of gavin hood that takes us on a story which is a ride through a man's journey through hell. once again, meryl streep in a convincing role of the cia today and great performances from a cast of superlative actors in reese witherspoon, jake gyllenhall and alan arkin, along with actors of middle eastern descent who add to the reality of the story.in rendition you see how "terrorism can breed terrorism" and as the film progresses tying the story to what is playing out in the middle east is reality brought to the screen. the external shots add to the intensity of the story and peter sarsgaard does a brilliant job of playing an assistant in the "ass kissing" way of how american politics are conducted. too bad there has not been a larger audience for this film, as along with the valley of elah and lions for lambs, rendition plays an important role in showing an audience how the fight for and the protection of democracy can go seriously astray.

i came out of "rendition" with a list of flaws a mile long, so how is it that my overall impression is that it was a pretty decent movie? it's definitely a film whose sum is better than its parts.those parts include a cast of big name stars, not one of them giving a memorable performance (omar metwally, a relative unknown, is the one you'll remember); serviceable if undistinguished direction; and a screenplay that's both too complicated and too simplistic at the same time. metwally is an egyptian-born american citizen who gets kidnapped by the u.s. government's rendition program, otherwise known as the process by which america tortures suspected terrorists into confessing information whether or not it's remotely true. reese witherspoon plays his pregnant wife, who calls in the favor of an old college friend (peter saarsgard), who works for a senator (alan arkin) and helps to track her husband down. meryl streep plays the head of the rendition program; jake gyllenhaal is a young agent assigned to the interrogation and whose conscience gets in the way. meanwhile, a whole parallel storyline follows the daughter of a top egyptian official who is allied to the american rendition program and her boyfriend, who's in training to become a suicide bomber.ay-yi-yi that's a lot of plot to pack into a two-hour movie, and i was about to wash my hands of the whole thing, especially the egyptian romeo and juliet subplot that felt like nothing more than a distraction. but then near the film's finale, a twist of chronology brings all of the plot strands together in a way that makes you want to reassess everything you thought you knew about the motivations of the various characters, and makes "rendition" a much more interesting movie than it seems like it's going to be.witherspoon, gyllenhaal and sarsgaard all look like high school students playing adults twenty years older than they actually are -- gyllenhaal in particular, usually a fine actor, looks so bored that you wonder if he's going to muster the energy to deliver his lines. and the screenwriter should be arrested for having an actress as good as meryl streep at his disposal and giving her nothing more to work with than this one-dimensional dragon lady. the movie of course strives for relevancy, but instead of addressing the tangled web of arguments surrounding the national security issue, it charges right down the middle of the debate in a predictable fashion. there are moments when you think maybe the film will veer off in an interesting direction -- what if witherspoon did actually begin to doubt her husband's past, for instance? what if metwally actually had been in contact with terrorists, as his interrogators accuse? but no, the movie takes the path of least resistance.but, like i said upfront, i recommend this movie. i know i've done nothing but list a bunch of its faults, but it's got its head in the right place, and it is entertaining, or at least as as entertaining as a movie about torture and interrogation can be.grade: b+

taut, topical political thriller, taking square aim at the controversial us policy of rendition, another appalling orwell-ian phrase (collateral damage, anyone?) for the illegal interrogation even torture of terrorist suspects by-passing due legal process. the inhuman interrogation is overseen by the egyptian chief of police, himself the target of a fundamentalist suicide - bomb plot, thus entwining the two main plot-lines of the movie. both work very well, the bombing set-piece graphic and chilling in its realism, with its denouement revealed in a stylish tarantino-type flashback and the torture scenes on an innocent man also unflinchingly portrayed in all their gory detail. the film scores telling points about the use of torture as a credible means of intelligence - gathering in the war against terrorists and against the unpoliced faceless bureaucracy (here personified by a suitable cold-steeled meryl streep, as the cia boss who casually gives the order for rendition) which can ruin innocent lives. never mind kafka's fiction, think more the recent killing of the innocent brazilian in london in 2005, with the head of the metropolitan police still in his job and no-one tried for the poor man's murder. the acting is excellent throughout - the two key roles of the innocent man and terrorist bomber are realistically and tellingly played by the unfamiliar actors omar metwally and moa khouas. similarly yigal naor as the intimidating chief of police and zineb ouhach as his idealistic lovelorn daughter ring true with their performances, their lack of familiarity (at least to me) adding to their characters' credibility. of the bigger hollywood names present, gyllenhaal's stature grows with succeeding films, here playing the initially detached but later conscience - stricken and anguished government man who does the right thing in the end. witherspoon plays her distraught wife part mainly in one key but is believable all the same, while david fabrizio and alan arkin convincingly show up self-serving senators and their lackeys who'll only go so far to help you until their career prospects are jeopardised. there are a few weaknesses plot-wise; there's little dramatic need to create the "suspense" surrounding el-ibrahimi's escape and streep's character is perhaps too obvious a bogey-man/woman. worst of all is the meaningless inclusion of gyllenhaal's on-the-spot girlfriend, around merely for decoration and a brief gratuitous love-scene. on the whole though, an engrossing thought - provoking cinematic experience.

is torture ever right? no the answer is simple and absolute with no qualifications possible. the reason as this film showed is the effect torture has on a society. the values that have been hard fought for in western society through centuries of revolution and struggle are for all men and women to be allowed to live in a free and open society. one where individuals are treated equally and with respect to their essential rights as humans. to protect this society institutions have been developed to deal with wrongdoing openly, fairly and honestly. these institutions have been adapted and honed through generations of hard work. one could argue that these are the true bedrock of democracy as they belong to us all, allow us all to be heard. if we allow undemocratic, inhumane acts to be committed in our name, if we split our society into those who have rights and those who don't then we undo the work of our ancestors. moreover we are all complicit and all guilty and tainted. whether those that we accuse are guilty or not is of no importance. we are defined by our attitudes and our responses.

the reviews for rendition generally haven't been favorable, so i waited until it moved to the local discount theatre to see it. the film tells the story of anwar el-ibrahimi, an american-egyptian scientist who is plucked from his international flight and hauled in for interrogation after a strange coincidence links him to a recent terrorist attack in an unnamed north african country. not as bad as i'd feared, it's an interesting and thought-provoking entry in the "ripped-from-the-headlines" thriller genre.the film ultimately asks tough questions concerning u.s. methods of prying information from political prisoners: is crossing the formerly-uncrossed line of (openly) employing torture on suspected terrorists something our country should be doing? does it yield useful information that helps save lives? if so, at what cost? what sort of monsters do we create when innocent people are taken prisoner and tortured? by sanctioning the use of torture, what sort of monster do we as a country become? it's always disappointing when a film with such provocative material is sloppy with some of the details that make good films great. for example, i'd like to have empathized with anwar's wife, who spends the entire film trying to track him down, but the only identifiable personality trait she's given is an advanced state of pregnancy. rendition also seems to imply that arab women who don't go along with their fathers' arranged marriages are only asking for trouble, and there's a poorly-conceived scrapbook kept by another of the film's main characters that too conveniently spells out in great detail all the information his love interest just happens to be in urgent need of at that particular moment. i laughed out loud, when the moment should have been filled with dread.the film features a good central performance by jake gyllenhaal and strong (but too brief) appearances by hollywood veterans meryl streep and alan arkin, as well as impressive turns by omar atwally as anwar el-ibrahimi and also by actors moa khouas, zineb oukach and yigal naor, all of whom i would much enjoy seeing in future films that have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism. good luck to them. the five or so stories rendition follows are woven together nicely, until the filmmakers insert a slight-but-effective twist that finally alludes to the never-ending cycle of carnage that violent attacks of terror beget.

this was an excellent movie with good acting and it keeps your attention through to the very end. maybe people are either tired or uncomfortable with the subject matter and that's why it's being trashing so much. it could also be too deep for many of the viewers out there who give movies like the american pie series higher ratings.jake gyllenhaal is a cia analyst, not an agent, who is to observe an interrogation of an egyptian man by moroccans, not egyptians. he's not supposed to be a hardened agent and so comes off as naive of the interrogation techniques used. this is more believable than if he were to come across as being an "old hat" at it.the story jumps around a bit and can be confusing, but it also makes you stay focused on whats going on until the end when everything comes together as the puzzle falls into place. the supporting actors did a good job of helping to carry the movie. i found the movie to be powerful and thought provoking.

to solve a challenging problem, you need to start by asking the right questions. without these, even the biggest library of information is useless. this movie does just that - where other movies guide your thinking along a story board, this film pulls at your emotions and your understanding of justice and what's permissible. these questions will tug at you throughout, challenging your assumptions as the characters develop. this movie is important. it's relevant, and a must see for anybody who stays informed of current affairs. the fact it's highly entertaining and includes a slew of movie stars only improves the execution. my advice: watch it with a serious crowd or better yet, by yourself, not unlike how you'd read an editorial from your favorite news magazine. in this case there is one difference: the answers will be your own.

very good political thriller regarding the aftermath of terrorism and the using of political torture to obtain one's objectives in flushing out the terrorists.the story is interwoven where two families are adversely affected by the terrorist events.this is one of meryl streep's best roles in years. she plays a cold, calculating, cunning director of the cia who allows these things to go on. she is out of the george bush-dick cheney school of handling the war on terrorism. had her part been expanded, miss streep certainly would have been up for an award at oscar time.jake gyllenhaal is our hero. a cia agent who really can't take what's going on.we have a terrorist who actually has a heart and it costs him his life in this well directed, finely paced film.alan arkin appears briefly in the part of a conniving senator. mr. arkin seems to get better with age.

i'm egyptian. i have a green card. i have been living in the us since 1991. i have a very common arabic name. i'm married (non-american but non-egyptian, non-arab wife). i have children who are born in the us. i have a phd in cell biology from the us and i travel for conferences. i make 6 figure income and i own a home in the washington, dc area. i pay my taxes and outside 1 or 2 parking tickets i have no blemish on my record since i came to this country in 1991. i look more egyptian than the ibrahimi character but my spoken english is as good as his.a couple of months ago i was returning from a conference/company business in spain through munich germany to washington, dc (home). i was picked up in munich airport by a german officer as soon as i got off the madrid plane. he was waiting for me. he was about to start interrogating me until i simply told him "i have no business in germany, i'm just passing through". he had let me go with the utmost disappointment. that was nothing compared to what happened at washington, dulles airport (which was not nearly as bad as what happened to ibrahimi in the movie). the customs officer asked me a couple of questions about the length and purpose of my trip. he then wrote a letter c on my custom declaration form and let me go. after i picked up my checked bag i was stopped at the last exit point (some homeland security crap). i sat there for 3 hours along with many different people of many different nationalities. i was not told the reason for my detainment. i was not allowed to use my phone or any other phone. i was feisty at first asking to be told of the reason or let me go but decided to suck it up and just wait and see. i asked if i can call my wife to tell her that i'm going to be late but was told no. when i tried to use my phone and as soon as my wife said "hello", an officer yanked the phone out of hand and threatened me to confiscate it. when i asked about needing to call home because my family is waiting, they said "three hours is nothing, we will make contact after 5 hours". when i asked to use the bathroom, an officer accompanied me there. it toilet was funny; i guess it was a prison style toilet that is all metal with no toilet seat. finally, they called my name and gave me my passport/green card and said you can go. i asked what the problem was, they said "nothing"!! i know it was only 3 hours but i was dead tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and kids.as for the movie, it was very well made. unlike most movies that involve arabs and use non-arab actors who just speak gibberish, this movie the arabic was 100% correct. i assume the country is morocco (north africa).

extraordinary rendition is a frightening practice authorized, surprisingly, under clinton, that allows the u.s. government to seize and hold anyone suspected, seemingly for any reason, of being a terrorist against the united states. this is a touchy issue, especially after 9/11, because supporters of the practice will always criticize the opposition as withholding vital power from the u.s. that it needs to effectively fight terror. fanatic supporters will label the opposition as terrorists in themselves. but like a recent film that lent a similar level of humanity to the death penalty, the life of david gale, rendition shows us a story of the misuse of extraordinary rendition, or at least the ease with which it can be exploited and falsely applied. the story involves anwar el- abrahimi, an american chemical engineer born in egypt who is seized on his way back to america from giving a lecture in egypt. the cause given is that he made phone calls to a known terrorist. no proof is ever given (or needed) that it was anwar that made the calls, that his phone was never lost of stolen. meanwhile, anwar's extremely pregnant wife, isabella, is back in the states frantically trying to find her husband, who got onto a plane to chicago but apparently never got off. the flimsy explanation that he was never there evaporates when she discovers that he made an in-flight purchase using his credit card. lately i have been researching modern chinese history, particularly that of the astonishingly selfish and brutal dictatorship set up by mao tse-tung, and it is more than a little frightening to see the similarities between extraordinary rendition and some of mao's brutal scare tactics, including his public executions (which the people were forced to watch), and extensive use of torture specifically used to extract "confessions." it is pretty disturbing to notice that mao specifically did these things to create an environment of fear in order to achieve obedience from the chinese people. to say that the bush administration has not created an environment of fear and continues to milk it for everything it's worth would be naïve in the extreme, and although extraordinary rendition was not created under bush, it is clear that it does more harm than good.adding to the thickness of the film is douglas freeman (jake gyllenhaal), who works behind a desk for the cia and has little field experience, until his boss is assassinated and he suddenly finds himself supervising the torture of a man that he quickly comes to doubt has anything to reveal. fatima's (freeman's boss) daughter also plays a pivotal role, as does a senatorial aide played by peter sarsgaard, who might have the most satisfying role in the movie. meryl streep is also suitably cold and clinical as a chilly senator with a dogmatic support of the necessity and practice of rendition. as a political thriller, the movie is remarkably well-crafted and paced. but the scariest thing about it is that this is all real. the movie's goal is to get people to really think about the things done in america's name, especially when they claim to be done to prevent those same things. conducting terror in the name of preventing terror will win no sympathy for us, nor will extracting confessions through brutal torture, which is the basest form of criminal investigation. unfortunately, we are gradually heading in that direction, of doing these things more rather than less. the frightening question is what is the event that is going to take place at some point in the future to convince us to stop and head the other way, toward civilization and peace, or will we just keep heading toward a military dictatorship until we finally get there?

cia analyst douglas freeman (gyllenhaal) gets to see his first secret location interrogation when anwar (metwally) is accused of having contact with a known terrorist bomb maker. anwar's wife (witherspoon) is frantic regarding the whereabouts of her husband .don't you just hate it when the title of a movie sends you to a dictionary? i must have an old edition as this rendition is not a musical piece. no, it's the government's way of legally taking a resident or citizen somewhere to interrogate him and possibly use some torture to get the desired information. while watching this movie i was reminded of a similar story line in the crossing jordan tv show (now off the air), and i expect we will see even more of these story lines. it's inevitable. the events of 911 are the catalysts. this is a tough one to watch because we don't like to see people tortured and our government not telling the truth about things. we like the idea that no matter what happens or happened that we can go somewhere to find answers, but when that door is closed to us, we are truly lost and without hope as anwar's wife was. performances by all were first class and it's possible we may see more of igai naor (i have no idea how to pronounce it) because he resembles and can act like telly savalas. no kidding. violence: yes, sex: no, nudity: no, language: yes

some films are designed to just entertain you, others to make you laugh, or cry, or uplift, others, like this, aim to provoke, to make you think, and to make you angry. i was angry during this film, not at the film, but at the fact that it was true, that america, the free, does torture in the illogical view that it is doing it for the greater good. the torture scenes in this movie were harrowing, the indifference of people was shattering, the film was compelling in its argument, and showed just how wrong it is to torture people. of course now that makes me a "bleeding liberal" labels shoved on people by others who shut their minds to the facts that this does happen and should not. people who don't realise that as the movie said, for every person tortured,you get ten or one hundred people rise up to perform acts of vengeance. you get an ever increasing cycle of violence. this film did not make me hate america, although i can see how it could do, but it made me hate the way that america has reacted in its post 9/11 world. there is a significant quote in the film, just after we have learned that 19 people have died and seventy five were injured in the bomb scene, the quote is "one american is dead" - that makes the difference. you cannot kill an american, america can kill thousands but you cannot kill a single american, or they will do whatever it takes, including torture to enact justice. this is the american way apparently. call me a liberal, call me naive (although i think the people who think torture is fine are naive) call me deluded, call me anything you like, but this film is a brilliant example of what is wrong in america and the west today. i wish this film would be shown to all school students, at a minimum. this film will stay with me a long time, part of me wishes i could forget it, because i wish this type of thing never happened, but i know it does, the other part of me wishes i would never forget, because we need to remember these shameful events to prevent them from happening again. whatever happens to me, this film will be with me for a long time, and i will be telling everyone i know to watch it, not to be entertained, but to be provoked, because sometimes we all need to be provoked.

the powerhouse cast pulls the crowd in the theatre, despite the ominous title. jake gyllenhaal guested on conan o'brien to promote the movie and explained that 'rendition' was a euphemism for obtaining information via torture. since 9/11, 'extraordinary rendition' allowed the government's intelligence agency to extricate people unquestioningly without due process and use any means necessary in exchange for information.gyllenhaal plays rookie cia analyst douglas freeman (note the irony) who is torn about his assignment which renders him as a mere observer to unorthodox interrogation proceedings at an underground detention facility outside the us. omar metwally plays the suspected terrorist anwar el-ibrahimi, egyptian national and green card-carrying hubby of american isabella fields el-ibrahimi (reese witherspoon). isabella and her son wait for anwar to come home from a scientific conference when he suddenly disappears from the plane's passenger manifest. she seeks help from her college friend who works in government and learns that the head of intelligence, corrine whitman (meryl streep) is behind it all. rendition is directed by hollywood newbie gavin hood (who is set to do x-men origins: wolverine), and begs the question of whether such 'extraordinary rendition' is exercised in real life. the movie was released locally in the wake of the glorietta explosion (bombing/mishap?), and a pivotal scene in the movie is when a bomb explodes in a public plaza, so that must have sent chills up every moviegoer's spine. seeing the exploding tableau with a lone red and yellow sign aajala (ayala?) on the upper right hand of the screen, plus the effect of silence and slow-moving images magnified the impact of the scene's real-life coincidence. there are lessons to learn from this movie and it all boils down to personal decisions we make, daily. we all have choices we can exercise at will, and we often do not always (want to) see how these affect others, who may end up as hapless victims of circumstance. what 'the greater good' is should not have to be a forced choice our leaders have to take if we each already decide correctly at the source. now that's a utopia worth building.

i first saw this in the theater in 1969 when i was 9 and immediately fell in love with it. i'm sad that sony has not seen fit to release this on dvd ("but one day, one day..."). i recently obtained a vhs copy of this on ebay and sat down to watch it 39 years later. i'm happy to report it still stands the test of time. the acting is spot-on, john williams' orchestrations are lush and leslie bricusse's songs memorable ("when i am older," "you and i," "fill the world with love," "london is london" are just a few of the standouts. and not enough can be said about peter o' toole, petula clarke, michael redgrave and michael bryant's acting. terence rattigan deserves an a+ for his update of the james hilton story. there really is nothing not to like about this film. it's a good cheer-me-up selection. glad they have released the original soundtrack as a three-cd set with lots of extras. wish sony would hurry up and do the same with the film.

i wish i was first exposed to this in a movie theater when it was first released, as some of the commentors had been. it really is a treasure. to be fair i have not seen any other version of goodbye, mr. chips and neither do i want to. to me this stands as a perfect version. i first saw it on tcm years ago and never forgot it. i had the pleasure of watching it with my girlfriend yesterday, although i had recorded it from tcm days earlier. there were portions of the movie in which both of us were teary-eyed, it really is a moving movie.and shouldn't that be what movies are all about?the music is beautiful, the film was shot wonderfully. the acting is top notch. and the story is delicate and timeless.one of my favorite movies of all-time.

i saw this film when it first came out, and didn't know what to expect exactly. what followed the overture was one of the most pleasurable filmgoing experiences i have ever had. a lush score of songs and music by britisher leslie bricusse (of doctor doolittle & wilie wonka and the chocolate factory fame as well as making his mark on the broadway musical scene), and scored by the incomparable john williams. there's not a bad song in the entire film. plus some of the most exquisite cinematography, costume design and filming locations i have ever seen in one film. not to mention the academy award nominated performance by peter o'toole, and the equally strong performance, in my opinion, by the wonderful petula clark. now, given that peter is not the same caliber a singer that petula is, he still manages to sell his songs to the audience, and that, after all, is what it is all about. this is a faithful adaptation of the excellent book by james hilton, and deserves to be treasured for generations to come. i recommend this film for family viewing, though most men will consider this a 'chick' flick. but if you like a truly great film musical, then this film is for you. but be warned that a standby box of kleenex is just as important as popcorn for your viewing pleasure.

peter o'toole, one of our finest actors, is magnificent as a reserved school master who is dedicated to teaching young boys. he meets a show girl and falls in love. the story is one of love and devotion. petula clark adds spirit and sensitivity, not too mention a remarkable voice. you will enjoy this film even though the ending might not be a happy one. i enjoyed it.

yes 1939/robert donat-greer garson version was the best...perfection..donat won the oscar in a very tough year..gable in gwtw & james stewart as mr. smith. were 2 of his competitors. .wow was that a rough year.. most critics in ny hated this version. so.didnt see in theatre! finally saw this a.m. on tcm & enjoyed..peter o'toole was excellent & glad he was oscar nominated for this,,& esp pleased oscar finally gave him a special award this past year... petula clark was good as mrs. chips but her character,i feel was poorly written...some good songs esp. you & i... sung by ms.clark & later recorded by many others including t.bennett/s. bassey & carmen macrae.... the b&w version was more authentic.. but this is a good film beautifully photographed in color & panavision... enjoyable worth seeing & bravo, again, mr. o'toole!

caught this 1969 film on cable tcm one night. i remember when i first saw the film in hong kong, i really enjoyed the songs and performances by peter o'toole and petula clark. i love clark best in francis ford coppola's "finian's rainbow" (1968) opposite fred astaire, don francks and tommy steele. simply ecstatic to learn that finally, this delightful irish-flavored pot of gold musical is released on dvd! ah, "it's that old devil moon (in your eyes)." peter o'toole as mr. chips - yes, he did sing - quite a deliverance. he may not be a veteran at musical like rex harrison, but he inhabited the role marvelously. the scene of him running across the lawn in his cape a-flying reminds me of the pbs series, "to serve them all my days" - a lovable schoolmaster and loving man, he is, 'mr. chipey.' clark and o'toole somehow gave us just the right mix of spunk and circumstance. the songs and lyrics by leslie bricusse are catchy as usual. the tunes of "you and i" and "walk through the world (with me)" stayed with me the most all these years. and there's "what a lot of flowers," "and the sky smiled," "fill the world with love" - not syrupy at all. sometimes i think if the world is immersed in bricusse's songs and words, we would overcome all strife on earth and 'lovely' will be all our days! yes, "talk to the animals," too. ("doctor doolittle" 1967) musicals are a blessing to the world of moviegoers, they are somehow larger than life. like the music and lyrics by the sherman brothers (richard m. and robert b.) who gave us "chitty chitty bang bang" (1968) and "mary poppins" (1964) - who wouldn't feel absolutely delighted simply uttering "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"? i was tickled by even just one featured song & dance number in the spanish film "km.0 - kilometer zero" (2000). my all time favorite is french filmmaker jacques demy's "young girls of rochefort" (1967) with colorful cast of catherine deneuve and (late sister) francoise dorléac, jacques perrin, michel piccoli, danielle darrieux, gene kelly and george chakiris singing, dancing to michel legrand's music. long live musicals.

i enjoyed the movie and the story immensely! i have seen the original(1939 i believe) and enjoyed them both. to really appreciate the story one must be familiar with english culture and customs. the prof.(peter o'toole) was dedicated to his school and "the boys" in that school. it was an english "public" school, which we in the u.s. refer to as a private school (e.g. andover). he is a very ascetic person and, on the surface, gives the appearance of being stiff, stuffy, uncaring, and weak to the point of being effeminate. he is strict in his educational standards because he does care for "his lads", i.e., he doesn't want them to get a cheap or weak education. he meets(through introduction) a "dance hall girl"(petula clark) and is totally smitten. in england at the time, the reference to "dance hall" carried the connotation of extreme sexual promiscuity and was definitely "lower class". we find that the prof. is in fact a very tough and courageous person as well as loyal to people and institutions that he loves and/or respects. clark becomes more than a lover and wife...she "leavens" his personality and allows him to grow as a man and a person, much to the benefit of his beloved school and his own happiness. the first movie was set before ww ii, this one goes through ww ii, also, it is 1969( we've had the "british invasion"...beetles, etc. clark had hits and was very popular then...still is to me), the music is great, color and photography excellent. i think o'toole played the character perfectly! there are dedicated people like "chips"...all around us but many do not receive the recognition. very enjoyable movie and story!

when it opened in london during the christmas season of 1969 this musical version of james hilton's famous story was drubbed by the critics. the same reception greeted it when it opened in the us, prompting mgm to withdraw its "roadshow" status and cut almost all of its songs. what a mistake!!!watched years later, when the trendy world of the 60's and 70's has turned in upon itself, this version of goodbye, mr.chips is a total delight. first of all, as "chipping", peter o'toole gives one of his greatest performances. to watch him turn from the hated, cold, emotionless latin teacher at a boy's boarding school, to a man who finally can see the colors in the world (after falling for and marrying musical star catherine briskit) is to see a genius at work. (if you can, watch lawrence of arabia, the lion in winter, my favorite year and chips back to back over a number of days or weeks. then you will see what a truly great actor o'toole is, and how magnificent he is in chips.) catherine, as played by the glowing petula clark, at the height of her popularity, is ever man's dream; beautiful, loving, understanding, with a great voice to boot. most of the songs are beautiful and fit the story perfectly, while the direction by the late herbert ross brings the proceedings wonderfully to life.okay, this film may be a bit too romantic for some people, but for those who are looking for a beautifully acted, sung, and directed love story, look no further. (if you can get your hands of the laser disc wide screen version, better yet. i am anxiously awaiting chips' debut on dvd.)

thirty years after the 1939 classic film won robert donat an oscar and made greer garson a star, "goodbye, mr. chips" overcame a multitude of problems before stumbling to the screen in this musical version. original stars rex harrison and samantha eggar were replaced by richard burton and lee remick, who in turn were given the heave-ho in favor of - thankfully - peter o'toole and petula clark. andre previn's score was rejected, and the one eventually used was composed by - unfortunately - leslie bricusse. first-time director herbert ross was handed the monumental task of transforming a simple love story - that of a man for both his wife and students - into a big-budget extravaganza. that it succeeds as well as it does despite the many obstacles in its way is a testament to its two stars.arthur chipping is a latin teacher at brookfield, a boys' school in suburban england where he himself was educated. introverted and socially inept, he is dedicated to his students but unable to inspire them. prior to summer holiday, a former student takes him to a london music hall to see an entertainment starring katharine bridges, the young lady he hopes to wed. the post-performance meeting is awkward for all, and chips - as he is commonly known - sets off to explore some of italy's ancient ruins. unexpectedly, he runs into katharine, who has booked a mediterranean cruise to allow her time to mourn a failed love affair and ponder the direction of her career. in the time they spend together, she discovers a kind and gentle man beneath the befuddled exterior, and upon returning to london pursues him in earnest. when the fall term begins, chips returns to brookfield with his young bride, and the two settle into a life of quiet domesticity. complications arise when aspects of katharine's past surface, and again when world war ii intrudes in their lives, but chips is bolstered by his wife's support, and his new-found confidence makes him a favorite among the students.aside from a couple of musical interludes - the delightful music hall production number "london is london" and katharine's declaration of love, "you and i" - most of bricusse's songs, some of them performed in voice-over as the characters explore their emotions, are easily forgettable and in no way enhance the film. eliminate the score entirely, and "goodbye, mr. chips" works quite well as a drama. terrence rattigan's script retains elements of the original while expanding upon it and updating it by a couple of decades. he has crafted several scenes between chips and katharine that beautifully delineate their devotion to each other, and infused a few with comic relief courtesy of katharine's friend and cohort, over-the-top actress ursula mossbank (delightfully played by sian phillips, o'toole's real-life wife at the time). he also captures life at a british public school - the equivalent of a private academy here in the states - with unerring perfection.ross does well as a first-time director, liberally sprinkling the film with breathtakingly photographed moments - the opening credits sequence, during which the school anthem echoes in the vast stone hallways of the school, perfectly sets the tone for the film. costumes and sets are true to the period. the students, portrayed by non-professionals who were enrolled at the school used as brookfield, handle their various small supporting roles well.highest praise is reserved for peter o'toole and petula clark in the lead roles. o'toole was long-established as a first-class dramatic actor, so his academy award-nominated performance here comes as no surprise. clark, a veteran of some two dozen b-movies in the uk and the previous year's "finian's rainbow," is absolutely luminous as the music hall soubrette who forsakes a theatrical career in favor of life as a schoolmaster's wife. her golden voice enriches her songs and almost allows us to overlook how insipid most of them are, and she more than matches o'toole in their dramatic scenes together. the chemistry between the two is palpable and leaves us with no doubt that this is a couple very much in love.this version of "goodbye, mr. chips" is no classic like its predecessor, but hardly the disaster many critics described when it was released. ignore the score, concentrate on the performances, and revel in the atmosphere ross has put on the screen. it's a pleasant way to spend a rainy afternoon with someone you love.

if you only see one ernest movie in your life, make it this one! this is by far the best in the series, with its nonstop laughs and clever humor that is suitable for all ages. the other "ernest" flicks were good too, but most people tend to get tired of him quickly (not me, however.).in this movie, ernest p. whorrel is assigned jury duty for a murder case. the murderer, nash, just happens to look exactly like our bumbling hero ernest. mr. nash finds this a good opportunity to escape from jail by knocking him out switching identities with him, and so we get to see how ernest reacts in the slammer.a great flick! if you haven't already seen it, watch it!

this is a good film. this is very funny. yet after this film there were no good ernest films!

this was easily one of the weirder of the ernest movies, especially in regards to the production design. what was up with the pink guard uniforms? sadly, this film probably destroyed the ernest series, turning the series into a straight-to-video series. however, jim varney gave one of his better performances by playing nash, his criminal alter ego. a misstep in the series, but wasn't too bad in most regards.(the electro man routine was classic)

this is an excellent movie. there were several parts to the movie i liked. this movie is very funny! visit the ernest fun club web site at www.ernestfunclub.com there are several movies such as the following: ernest goes to camp, ernest saves christmas, ernest goes to jail, ernest in the army, ernest goes to school, ernest rides again slam dunk ernest etc. i highly recommend these for family movies. all star jim varney again try visiting www.ernestfunclub.com which is the best ernest movie? in my opinion there are actually 2 ernest goes to camp and ernest goes to jail. so if you have never seen ernest p. worrell its time to go and see him. you will find him quite satisfactory "no what i mean"?

ernest p. worrell comes through with his third movie presentation. jim varney not only plays ernest, but doubles as the evil mr. nash. from start to finish this movie has some solid laughs and makes a good family film! rated pg for comic book violence.

this is a really good flick with awesome humor. jim verney as we know was very good with facial expressions and demonstrates a lot of it in this movie.this is definitely the best of the ernest films.i would surely recommend it to any ernest fan out there.i find myself to have great taste in movies and i'm sure anyone will enjoy this movie. in the movie ,(ernest) plays 2 roles, bad guy and good guy and plays them quite well. i really enjoy exaggeration type humor where things just seem impossible,like in the naked gun films for example, and there is plenty of it in this movie.i bought this movie right after i saw it. good directing, good script, worth renting.

this movie brings back so many memories for me! i was very young when it came out but i remember the first time i saw it! my dad and i would always watch the "ernest movies" together. we hadn't seen any of them in several years and i found a couple of them really cheap. we watched them and could not stop laughing. i love all of the "ernest movies," but this one is my favorite.spoiler part! the part i remember most is the "magnet" part. my dad still does the electric chair scene! end spoiler!this is a very cheesy movie...but a great one! it's perfect for families (it isn't like a lot of the trash out there) but at the same time adults can laugh too! if you like physical humor (like facial expressions and the way people move) then this is the movie for you!

i love ernest goes to jail. it's one of my top 3 favorite ernest movies. the others being ernest scared stupid and ernest goes to camp. in this movie ernest (jim varney) works as a janitor for a bank but he wants to be a bank clerk. soon he is assigned jury duty but soon winds up in trouble when the evil murderer felix nash (varney also) knocks him out and switches places with him! soon ernest is in jail and is forced to act like nash or else nash will kill charlotte ernest's love interest. when they take ernest to the electric chair thinking he's nash he gets so electrocuted he winds up breaking out and goes off and saves charlotte from the evil nash! filled with hilarious scenes and comics ernest goes to jail is a movie that'll make you laugh so hard! it still does to me! jim varney was such a fantastic actor! he did a good job playing both good guy and bad guy! varney was like his toy story co star tom hanks. no matter what role they played their roles were memorabilia and that's one of the things that varney's gonna be remembered forever for! r.i.p. jim varney 1949-2000. thank you for bringing ernest and other fantastic characters to life! 10 out of 10!

the last good ernest movie, and the best at that. how can you not laugh at least once at this movie. the last line is a classic, as is ernest's gangster impressions, his best moment on film. this has his best lines and is a crowning achievement among the brainless screwball comedies.

if i had to decide which was the best ernest movie, and don't act like that sort of thing doesn't happen all time, it would be this one.all of the ernest movies are entertaining, but the best ones are the ones that have jim varney doing a number of different characters. additionally, i am known to enjoy the comedy stylings of bill byrge and gailard sartain as brothers chuck and bobby tulip. "ernest goes to jail" contains all of those elements as well as a funny script and a supporting cast that features several beloved character actors.and that is why i have chosen "ernest goes to jail" as the king of all ernest movies. disagree with me if you must, but deep down you know i am right.

this time, the lovable dimwit gets summoned for jury duty, where a corrupt attorney notices that he looks like a jailbird who wants to break out, so the two get switched. of course, most of the movie is a series of gags; in "ernest goes to jail", most of the gags relate to electricity. i really liked the whole vacuum cleaner sequence early on. overall, the point of the movie is just to have fun, and i'm sure that you will. this is possibly the ultimate movie that you watch with a bud. it's quite safe to say that jim varney will truly be missed. knowwhaddamean? fyi: the only other cast member whom i recognized was randall "tex" cobb, who played lyle. you've surely seen him somewhere.

i watched this movie only because i didn't want to leave my 9 yo and her friend in the theater by themselves. honestly, i went in expecting to enjoy a good nap -- but found myself entranced by the movie. i'd recommend it to anyone who asks! roy's mom was on one of my all-time favorite tv shows years ago, playing a mermaid (maximum bob). she was really cute in this movie. the three main characters were all excellent young actors. also enjoyed seeing and hearing jimmy buffet. the movie itself was quite beautiful - showcasing some of what makes florida so great. i'm glad i ended up going to this movie. and to think, i was disappointed that i couldn't take them to see "stick it" -- i think this was much better!

this film was not great cinema, but definitely a good film to see with your family, especially children from 10-15. there are good topics of discussion brought up in this movie, such as bullies, the environment, and working to make things right. jimmy buffet's music was a plus, and the scenery was wonderful... the young actors were excellent, and this is a movie i would expect to see on the family channel or the hallmark channel. except for a few words in the dialog, a middle school could show this film to start discussions in the classroom. hopefully it will be shown in drive-ins this summer so that more people get to see it. it did follow carl hiassen's book well, and it was fun to see him in a cameo performance.

logan lerman & dean collins iii of jack & bobby fame provide a nice touch of familiarity as friends in this even if not maybe as close as they may be on jack & bobby but the expressions of young students taking their stand for a good cause is very well expressed in this movie.logan lerman may be seemingly typecast in roles of being "different" as thusly seen from here as is seen in this as well as in jack and bobby.the movie also opens up with a very nice tune coined as a lost 45 "and i'm wondering where the lions are?"a song which i'd always heard on the speaker @ my old job of christmastreeshops and got it played on my local radio show of the lost45s hosted by barry scott but the last time of which i suggested this with this movie as it's dedication but the dedication was left out.environmentalist demonstration is well expressed in this movie too for the protection of the ground owls as seen in this movie too.what a hoot too this movie is.hoot,sogive a hoot in the tradition of the woodsey owl commercials of the 1970s too. truthfully, stephen "steve" g. baer a.k.a."ste".

hoot is the best movie. go and see it if you haven't about these 3 kids that stand up to the right and the wrong. a perfect family film. the characters mullet fingers ( cody linley) beatrice leep (brie larson) and roy eberhardt ( logan lerman) are the three main characters. great movie the best!!!!!!!!!!! i love this movie and you guys should too, its a great movie i mean it a great movie. go and see it if you haven't. i like it because they stand up to the right and wrong, and it has cut owls and the hot cody linley.cody linley is so hot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i love him so much!!!!!!

i read the book before i saw the movie i knew the movie was going to be good because the book was great i seriously recommend you see this amazing fantastic movie. i know you will like it. when i went to see it i was there with my sister and there was nobody that was with us i was a little disappointed but nobody that i know has gone in to that movie and came out saying that was a horrible movie. nobody can it is so great i think everyone will like it (to bad nobody wants to see it) anyway i hope from what you have heard about this movie from me will make you want to see this movie i guarantee you'll like it as much as i do (im obsessed) literlly i am

the story is incredible, it begins with a new kid in town named roy, while on the bus to school, he notices a kid running with no shoes, and on that same day he breaks the big bullies nose who is trying to fight with him. roy soon discovers that kid is a runaway, and he and his step sister are trying to mess a construction sight, that could kill all the beautiful owls that live there. roy decides to help them him there fight, can they win this fight before the smart but bumbling cop dave delinko(luke wilson) stumbles on to them. an enjoyable film, funny and adventurous. i do admire luke wilson for taking this role. i don't think his brother owen would even take this role.

in "hoot", a new kid arrives to florida from montana. he first faces the usual problems of blending in and dealing with the local bully. soon, though, he becomes aware of a bigger problem: a franchise restaurant chain is trying to build a site in the town, right where a number of burrowing owls live. this movie has the look of a family film, but it is pretty more radical than it seems, as it shows sympathetically how roy and a couple of friends do not shy away from lawbreaking (including vandalism of private property and briefly kidnapping the manager of the chain of restaurants) in the name of environmentalism (to save owls, no less). now, one might agree or not with those actions, but at least the movie has the courage from not shying away from its convictions. a good, solid film, all in all.

i saw the movie "hoot" and then i immediately decided to comment it. the truth is that nature needs protection from us because we are the dominant specie of this planet. some people think that if they have money, they can do whatever they want to, which probably is like, but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful! this movie is not just about kids, this movie is showing us that the kids are usually the ones that care more about it then the adults do. when i was twelve, i saw some waterlilies and i knew they are protected by law and didn't even dare to touch them not fearing of the law, but fearing that i might harm them actually. (i am currently 15) what so ever, the acting was great, the 3 main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them. i hope you all think about what you saw in that movie!!! and enjoy!

this is a good family movie with a few laughs. i wish it didn't have too much of the school stuff like the bully in it to fill the movie up. also, it seems a little too easy to save a piece of land from being built. i mean, the it just flowed too easily. it does make you aware of the wildlife. it had a cute way of introducing the piece of land which the fast runner but a little too slow for me. a little too hokey for me and it reminded me of going back to school. oh, the dvd is chock full of goodies so don't miss out. 7 out of 10 for the movie 10 out 10 for the dvd with the extras that is well worth to watch. well worth your time to see this!

sweeping and still impressive early talkie western of pioneering days; other contemporary films in the same vein include the covered wagon (1923), the iron horse (1924) and cimarron (1931)  none of which i've watched, though i do have the latter on vhs. it was simultaneously filmed in the "standard" fullscreen ratio and in an experimental widescreen process called "grandeur", but only the former has been released on the bare-bones fox dvd; one can only surmise how it would look in a wider ratio, but the careful framing  not to mention the splendid cinematography  is evident enough even in the "standard" version.young john wayne is surprisingly commanding in the lead (a role which, however, didn't lead to the expected stardom  as he'd languish in 'b' westerns for the best part of the next decade, before john ford came to his rescue with stagecoach [1939]!); anyway, he and marguerite churchill (from dracula's daughter [1936]) make a nice couple  despite her somewhat tedious character. supporting characters include a variety of stock types: veteran westerner, comic-relief sidekick (with a penchant for making noises with his mouth!), burly and uncouth villain (played by tyrone power sr.!), his two slimy cohorts (a mexican and a southerner, the latter also filling in as wayne's rival for churchill's hand), etc. also among the members of the wagon party is a timid swede (full of optimism for the promised land, but who's continually put down by his irascible mother-in-law) and later wayne regular ward bond.the episodic narrative resolves itself into a number of alternately cornball, lyrical and action-packed vignettes  as we see the prospective settlers combating the elements, the indians and themselves; the film, however, has a completely authentic feel to it which smooths over its essentially dated and static quality. also, the editing is somewhat choppy (particularly during the second half)  little wonder, since the dvd edition of the film is only 108 minutes long against the complete 158-minute "grandeur" version!

anne (natalie portman) tells us about how much she hates her mother, adele (susane sarandon). that's how the movie begins. adele decided that her and her daughter were moving to california without asking anyone and leaving her husband without any reason. the story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter. it's really deep and touching, thanks to the great work of the actresses. natalie was nominated to a golden globe for that role. she is one of the most talented actresses i ever saw, and so is sarandon. they really look like mother daughter. the soundtrack is also great. the movie is incredible. *10 out of 10*

i was able to see "anywhere but here" last night as a free sneak preview. i absolutely loved the film! i was drawn to it because of the realistic portrayal of a mother/daughter relationship...there was definitely a connection between adele a and ann. i think that speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of both susan sarandon and natalie portman. sarandon was just the right actress to portray adele and after leaving the theater i could not think of another actress in the role. portman was also excellent as ann. she brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that i don't think any other teenage actress could. i think it would the academy of motion picture arts and sciences should give credit where it is due and nominate both sarandon and portman for awards in the "actress" and "supporting actress" categories. it would be a shame if they were overlooked.

my one-line summary hints that this is not a good film, but this is not true. i did enjoy the movie, but was probably expecting too much.adele, who is solidly portrayed by susan sarandon, did not come off as a very likable character. she is flighty and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter. this is the one thing she knows how to do without fail. adele's daughter, anna, is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mother's shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14-17 years old. this, of course, makes natalie portman the perfect choice to play anna since she never seems to be 14- 17 years old either. portman pulls this role off with such ease that you almost forget that she has not been making movies for 20 years. yet, even with the two solid leads, wayne wang never seems to quite draw the audience in as he did with the joy luck luck and even more so with smoke. though i have not read the book, the film feels as if it has made necessary changes to the story to bring it to the big screen, changes which may drain the emotional pungency of the story. i enjoyed the film for the fun of watching two wonderful actresses do their work, but i never got lost in the experience and i never related to their plight.

natile portman and susan sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about a young girl, who is sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the nuttest women you will ever encounter. sarandon has this ability, call it talent if you will, to play some of the most off-beat characters and bring their humanity to forefront of any film she makes. as the mother of this obviously brilliant and muture beyond her years young girl, sarandon alternates between being the mom and being the child with the ease of a ballet dancer. more importantly she does it with strength and flare without stomping all over portman's portrayal of the daughter. the question is always asked when we deconstruct the film plot, who changes? this film is certainly about the daughter, but if you look close at the dreams and sacrifices that mom makes you come to understand that she changes in step with her daughter. i am willing to bet this makes all of us in the audience change also. the hallmark of fine drama

being a freshman in college, this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mom. of course, my situation doesn't parrallel with natalie portman and surandon's situation; but my mom and i have grown up with the typical mother and daughter fights. there is always the mother telling you what to do, or not being the kind of mother you want to be. i was balling my eyes at the end of this movie. surandon's reaction of her daughter going to the east coast, miles away, after all they've been through reminded me of how i felt, being from a small city in the west coast, going to new york. the movie is meant for women who have children that are now all grown up. it is very touching, i was moved by the movie. every feeling out of the characters in this movie was utterly real, you didn't get any phony sentimentality. i was sitting through the credits at the screening of this movie, alone, wishing my mother was sitting next to me so i could hug her and thank her for everything. this movie is a bit corny of course, but everything is trully momentous. its all about what a mom can learn from her child; and what a child learns from her mother. 8/10

the interaction between portman and sarandon was quite interesting, and i was really sold on the mother-daughter relationship. it is a family story that isn't dulled down by frills and special effects; a story of how it really is. i couldn't help but give of a sigh at the end of this movie for alas it is a well told bittersweet tale of growing up and relating with family and friends. the acting was quite exquisite and i hope we'll be seeing both portman and sarandon in familiar roles down the road...

well, i have not much to say about this film except that it was a truly wonderful film. natalie portman is absolutely fantastic as the daughter in this lovely mother-daughter relationship film. beautiful film.

this film was a new direction for natalie portman. a much more adult role, though she comes to it from the traces of a child in the movie itself. ann,(portman) and susan sarandon, who plays her newly divorced mother, adele, travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to beverly hills. there these tortured souls try to come to terms with their new life and their new relationship as portman's character grows up. unknowingly at first to adele, she grows up and becomes a better mother for it.ann sees her mother telling her she wants to be an actress, or so she thinks. adele uses that crutch every time there are problems in their lives. we see their struggle as mother and daughter come to terms between themselves and with being alone, having left their old lives behind.the acting is top notch from both of them. they seemingly become mother and daughter before your eyes. you can almost feel there is a bond there beyond the actual movie.though this movie really doesn't take us to any new ground in these types of films, the fact that the acting is well done, and the story isn't too flawed, let's me recommend it.i will say however, it will probably go away soon, i don't believe it can have the staying power needed for a huge christmas season of movies starting in a week or so. see it now before this happens if you like either of these actresses.

susan sarandon and natalie portman play adele and ann august, a single mother who's the working definition of the word "dreamer" and her solemn, pragmatic daughter. adele, wanting to make a fresh start in a big city, moves them from wisconsin to california.decent, if not exceptional or particularly memorable, with some serious and sad moments. it pushes some emotional buttons, that's for sure. best thing it offers is a solid cast, and sarandon and portman are quite good in the leads - even if their characters are one-dimensional at times.could be better, could be worse.i gave this one seven out of ten.

wayne wang's direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than "slums of beverly hills", which covers remarkably similar ground. the interplay between susan sarandon and natalie portman is riveting. real chemistry there. this film succeeded in bringing me inside the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me down into depressed frustration. susan sarandon's character hammers at all the nerves which a narcissistic parent is capable of touching in an insecure adolescent. she amazingly manages to do this without coming across as floridly insane or intentionally sadistic. and, natalie portman deflects each attack on her character's ego with the resigned grace of an intelligent codependent child, untainted by the smug cynicism of the natasha lyonne character in "slums of beverly hills". portman's character is an adolescent with dignity under stress, an unusual creature in modern films. the film reaches a very satisfying resolution without trying too hard. i highly recommend this film to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained.

a must see documentary.-----this movie had so many things to consider while watching it. it was a great documentary of a trial of a 15 year old black kid named brenton butler. he accused of killing a white tourist in florida. it shows how the police took statements from the husband of the dead woman of the description of the man that killed his wife. the husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing. the police little to investigate the crime. brenton's lawyer patrick mcguinness is meticulous in getting information to help his client. he tells the viewers what he thinks and the strategy he will use on the police to show their incomplete investigation and beatings against his young client to get him to confess. the camera goes with mcguinness to where brenton was questioned. mcguinness also takes pictures of the room and how the audio is monitored. he questions a policeman on the stand and ask what the heard brenton say to one of the investigators and he challenges their own words. mcguinness investigates with ann finnell each place the police should have gone and the things they should have done but did not. the movie shows the butlers as a loving christian family who have faith in their son's innocence and faith that god will set brenton free. they visit him in jail and pray with him there to encourage him. there are scenes of group prayer for brenton, the lawyers, the judge and everyone involved in this case. i am a white and i was surprised to see how blacks in high police positions treat other blacks. it was very disappointing to see black and white police stick together when they think they got their man. police have a hard job and i believe most of them are honorable not like the ones in this movie. i think this is a great movie for anyone involved in the judicial system including judges, police and lawyers and even potential jurors to watch this movie and learn from it.

i saw this movie last night on hbo & didn't expect to get hooked - i usually fall asleep when i watch hbo. but it happened & you will too. it's a tragic documentary (2002 oscar winner) about a murder of an elderly female tourist in jacksonville, florida and subsequent investigation, arrest, & trial of a 15 year old boy.watch this movie today & get a feel for how we have progressed as a society. this film was most deserving of an esteemed oscar - you'll be moved to tears.

this is an extraordinary film. as a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the american justice system, it's frightening. for brenton butler the consequences of this system could be devastating. this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court. in truth, the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty, or a guilty man being free. every citizen has a right to justice, whether a perpetrator or a victim. but do they get it? the film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i've seen.

art imitates life imitates art. atticus finch is reincarnated into the d.a. in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who-done-it and how did it happen. the authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers. although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic, integrity, and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again. the music is driving but not obtrusive; the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience.

anyone that is looking for an episode of "law and order" or "csi" would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or forensics work were totally ignored in this case.a murder took place, and all the police did was to grab a 15-year-old boy off the street and take him to the only witness - a 65-year-old man - and say is this the guy who did it? sure, the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty. never mind that he looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently. he must have shrunk, reversed his age by 5-10 years and changed clothes.the police made absolutely no effort - and they admitted it! the did no forensics on any of the evidence, they questioned no other witnesses, and they beat a confession out of a 15-year-old.the saddest thing about this compelling look at the criminal justice system is that it occurred right down the road in jacksonville, florida. let everyone now start talking about "southern justice."

very good film. very good documentary.very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted, narcissistic, heartless swines their one eyed parents, community and environment raised them as.i tip my lid to pat mcguinness. can we get this decent human being on some kind of 911 commission or investigation? we need his integrity, endurance, intelligence, clarity and spirit fighting the rigged game that is world politics and big business.all the animals come out at night - whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets. pat mcguinness should be the first drops of that real rain. the people who control this earth are animals. they need to be drowned.i'm just in shock. walking the night is scary business. the inhuman howling and cackling is of detectives, in murder on a sunday morning. in pat mcguinness' blazing spotlight, they look horribly caught, horribly guilty, and ready for a just and horrible drowning.it is exceptionally satisfying, in a world in which the punters play a rigged game, to see justice done and to see every narcissistic felon drown like the pathetic human rats they are.how does it feel you railroading, abominable, snaky fingers of the law? how does it feel to have your rigged prosecution, your rigged confession, your rigged detective work found out for what it really was? how does it feel? i hope it twists like a knife you miserable, one eyed nothings.

you think the police are always right.you believe that "eye-witnesses" are always right.you believe the prosecutors will not take a case to court if lazy police have failed to perform 98% of a basic investigation.you believe a u.s. city might have a "few bad apples" in law enforcement, but that the "good cops" will quickly nip those who systematically engage in evil-for-evil's sake in the bud.you believe that the possibility of an ex-football lineman being instated as a detective solely because his dad is the county sheriff, and being allowed to beat "confessions" out of randomly-selected teenagers with absolutely no fear of negative consequences to himself could happen in the america of the 1930s, but not today.you believe a judge will not send a case to the jury if anyone with a brain in their head can see the defendant is a totally random passer-by nabbed by the police because it was hot, and they did not feel like working that day.you believe that all the innocent people imprisoned six months here or 20 years there are "exceptions to the rule," and an injustice like this could never involve your family member, someone in the middle class, or someone like you.you think that you are aware of every terrible, indisputable, 100% proved outrage of the last 10 years in america--yet you haven't seen this film.

i watched this on hbo because it won the oscar a week earlier. it compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas.the story is of a 15-year-old black kid placed on trial for the jacksonville, fl, murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victim's husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coerced.about half the footage is of the trial; it's supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers (two public defenders) explaining their case, interviewing witnesses, and visiting key locations. this is edited with a minimum of needless repetition, and placed in logical order. the camera work is pretty solid. and there's a mildly surprising epilogue.

with that, carry the same dark weaknesses we all unfortunately possess: lying, deception, laziness, the list goes on.however, as an american, i was shocked to see that corruption and racism exist in today's police force as is reflected with the duval county sheriff department's horrible detective and police work with the murder of a white female tourist and a 15-year old accused black youth. i shook my head in shame that detectives were protected from their abusive work while a young man's life hung in the crooked balance of justice.however, there is also a story of hope with our judicial system and how poorly-paid public defenders stuck by their guns (irony intended) and forced the truth from the detectives. i wanted to fly down to florida and tell anybody with influence what a great public defender team they have in duval county; those lawyers care about the "little" man and, most importantly, for justice.the other story line is about faith and family. praises to the accused's family and their strong christian (submit any dedicated religion) beliefs and wonderful family values. i hope they win their lawsuit against the duval county sheriff's department.bravo for justice!!! bravo for the little guy!!!

i watched this movie with my mother. she is 81 yrs.old and was raised to be a bigot. she even acknowledges this. i don't think she really understood what was happening, she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty. scary. i felt for this child and his family. what torture they went through and remained faithful. that is true faith. back to the movie. i was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude. i am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case. it was very fortunate for this family that they had a person that cared enough to see through the crap that was handed to him. i could tell when one the cops was lying. he would not look the defender in the eyes. his eyes moved to the side when he answered the questions. it is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished because of the color of his skin. i read the book about the black man being dragged behind a truck by three white men. they were finally found guilty after many years. i can't remember the title, but it was the same premise. whites doing whatever they want with blacks. i am sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. i pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white. no comment from her. i want to commend the director and producer of this film. i feel the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project. i am an avid viewer of indy films. i feel that they are well written and have substance. i am pleased that i happened to grab this movie on the shelf. i felt compelled to write a comment because of how strongly i feel about the film and the prejudice that continues to exist in our modern society.

i just saw the movie, through netflix. i was intrigued by the way the movie was described, but in the end, it was better. i was moved in many different directions while watching this movie. i was filled with hurt, hate, angry, bitterness,pain and finally relief. to look at the young man accused, would break your heart, and convince you that they had the wrong person. the smugness of the police, makes you cring, because just as the rodney king beating brought to light, the brutality of the police, this movie brings forth the total lack of moral fiber in these police. and the fact that they beat this boy, and got away with it, only infuriates you more.but, i have to tell you, i fell in love with the attorney, mc guinness. one of my favorite lines, when he was telling us what an a**hole on of the cops was... the cop told him, to go on, keep sucking on that cancer stick. mc guinness told the cop... 'i always have a cigarette before sex...' i was letting him know i was going to screw him"i have a new respect for some of the law in this country.

i've never seen a show with as much story, mystery, suspense, and hard-hitting excitement before. i barley watch tv anymore but i own every season of this show and it's amazing. every episode is extremely well-acted, written and plotted. towards the end of the show i felt that the stories were getting too far-fetched for being in a prison, but the actors pulled it off. sopranoes sucks huge compared to oz. in fact, any show that is on a cable network, hbo or not just cant hold a candle to oz. i wish it would come back for one more season. if it did happen, they would probably kill off every character on the show, but hey, we all gotta go sometime. as far as the characters, i'd say o'reily and alverez were my favorites. both were hardley in a scene together, but their individual stories i thought were the strongest of anyones, except beechers of course, but still... anyway, best show ever, best network ever, some of the best actors ever, period!

horror movie time, japanese style. uzumaki/spiral was a total freakfest from start to finish. a fun freakfest at that, but at times it was a tad too reliant on kitsch rather than the horror. the story is difficult to summarize succinctly: a carefree, normal teenage girl starts coming face to face w/ extremely disturbing events as the small town she lives in seems to come under the control of spirals. the spirals are everywhere, in the air, clouds, dirt and everyday objects. the spirals take control of people and bad things will happen to them. oh, another thing, people are randomly turning into snails. why? who knows or cares, people are turning into snails, that's enough for me. this wasn't as much scary as just creepy as it doesn't have a lot of suspense or jarring attacks as horror films often do. uzumaki prefers to creep and crawl (like a snail might!) rather than to jolt. a favorite scene: a woman lies sleeping in a hospital room when this long, thousand legged centipede creature makes its way into the room and slowly up the bed post, across the sheets, over the pillow and into her sleeping ear. i cringed and curled my toes. uzumaki has a handful of scenes really violent but that are sort of humorous as well. for example, a man is obsessed w/ spirals, he gets into his washer because he sees a spiral in it when it spins, he commits spiral suicide inside the washer. the last shot we see of him is w/ his body all coiled & rubber like, a human flesh spiral w/ a engorged single eye blinking in the middle of the washer. a bizarre image. uzumaki has a blatant psychodelic slant to it which adds to its charm and fun. i love horror movies like this. it's not about killing, a la slasher films, it's about a force of evil (the spirals!) taking over you and trying to kill you, force you to kill others. films like uzumaki prove that there are many ways to make a horror film and thank goodness for that

i'm a horror movie freak, and this has got to be one of the most phenomenal horror flicks i've ever seen. the plotline is totally original (who else would think up a town who gets totally obsessed with a certain symbol to the point of death and insanity?), the special effects are amazing, and the cinematography couldn't be better. some may find it disturbing, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. it also makes a good point. the spiral symbol is kinda ubiquitous. the spiral notebook, spiral seashells, spirals on cakes. of all the shapes they could have used (square, triangle, trapezoid, rectangle) this was one of the best choices. if you can find this movie, definitely see it. it's certainly unique, and quite unforgettable.

i thoroughly enjoyed this made for tv movie. i was channel surfing, and came across the start of the movie. boy am i glad i stopped. this movie has a real hot cast, as well as a semi-believable plot. there's drama, comedy, action, and best of all, the human nature aspect of this film is what makes it great. i hope it comes out on video, because i will buy a copy. rating...9 out of 10 stars

the original story and funny compelling characters went over well for a teen girls slumber party movie (2 times now). i loved it, it was fun and moved quickly, no boring drawn out scenes. it is violent and has a little language (though most of it is covered up). its a great movie. david strickland was a terrific actor. ron eldard gave a wonderful performance. i watch it with the girls every time.

this film is completely underrated.it's a film similar to will keenan and patrick hasson's waiting, as well as adrien brody's restaurant and the classic film breaking away, which are all about young adults who are stuck and know they're stuck, with little or no chance of breaking free.death by pizza (delivered) is about an intelligent, free-thinking, artistic young adult (will, played by david strictland) who is stuck and waiting, bitter at the world's hypocrisy and bitter at his own lack of direction and desire. will meets his nemesis, reed (ron eldard), another intelligent young adult who's so bitter, he's chosen the path of crime. both end up helping each other to free themselves of their bitterness, which enables them to get unstuck.for these young adults, getting unstuck, or, breaking free, can mean both forging ahead into life, and plunging downward into death.will's life is filled with the trademarks of a young "stuck" adult: a soul-sucking, sweaty, under-paying job, crude customers, an ex-girlfriend who left him because he was unmotivated, a partial college education with no degree, a house filled with self-made art, and of course the new friend whose ungodly choices help him to save himself.

first off- what are some of you thinking? this is the best movie i've seen in ages! secondly- i don't think of it as a british movie as it is set in dublin and has mainly irish actors- moran, gambon, aisling o sullivan(rita), deirdre o'kane etc.thirdly- i thought that moran was excellent. he was hilariously funny through out. micheal caine seemed only to be there to get moran context. each character he took on he perfected. abigail iversen i thought was better than any other child actor i have seen. she was believable as the smart kid and also as a kid and an adult(yes i know that sounds strange but hey...). even she managed to upstage caine. iversen and moran worked very well together and were very funny in the preparation scene.barreler(gambon) was very funny in his ineptitude.

this movie is all about entertainment. imagine your friends that you love spending time with, the ones that you know inside out becoming a bit silly and perhaps taking on a character or two. that's what this film is about. an inventive script and brilliantly performed. it's not about pleasing the masses with this one, it's about having fun with a bunch of brilliantly talented people. which is what i'm sure they all thought when they signed up for it. the above review sounds completely unfair and i think that the person who wrote that was in the wrong frame of mind when they watched the film. in a lighthearted moment, there is great dignity in it if you care to look.a job well done, i thought it was a great film. i'd watch this before the north american norm any day.in a nutshell, it's not the best film you're ever going to see but it has a hell of a lot of moments. i haven't laughed that long in an age.

tell you what that was excellent. dylan moran is simply the funniest actor on screen( and on stage) and with micheal caine as your partner ain't to bad either, both are great to watch in a really funny film. true, not all the gags come off but its worth sticking around for the ones that do, but come on its got micheal caine in a dress in it( the whole admission fees worth that) and every time dylan moran's on screen its more like bernard blacks movie. the story is two actors(moran and caine) who decide to steal money from a group of gangsters by acting out different persona's to fool them all but getting away with it's a different matter. basically "the actors" is a great british comedy that was somehow missed by many, seriously if your a moran fan(or want to see micheal caine in a dress) definitely see this

look as being anglo-irish i assure you this reviewer is anything but bias. but i assure you this is very much an irish film - and not english as the last comment seems to have suggested. this film was written by neil jorden and conor mcpherson and directed by conor mcpherson too - both irish. the cast is almost entirely irish - it was shot in ireland with an irish crew. even michael gambon was born in ireland - i remember him joking about it in an interview about this film.michael cane was evidently brought in to boost box office takings abroad.loved the film, i just wanted to correct a totally uninformed comment!now on with the review - i loved dylan moran, have always been a fan of his, himself and michael cane formed a surprisingly good double act. it was great to see morans range as an actor as he plays several different made up characters during the film. i would recommend this film to anyone with an interest in comedy - as it represents a fresh, quirky and inventive turn in irish feature length chuckle films. i laughed a lot. what more could you ask for?

this film is a joy to watch and should do well on dvd and video. i suppose you really have to be irish to appreciate the some of the subtlties such as accent, colloquialisms and the dress sense of some of the characters but let me assure you that when dylan moran impersonates 'barreler' the impersonation is quite familiar to most people from dublin because we have many characters in our fine city that look, act and talk like that! the sheer simple comedy employed and michael caines genius acting alone are worth the money but on top of this the plot is great, the script is fantastic and the dialogue fast moving and catchy. a perfect light entertainment movie without the madcap humour of jim carrey.

if you are going to watch this film because michael caine or michael gambon are in it then don't bother, it's not their typical role although i found gambon fantastic. instead watch it for dylan moran i am a fan of everything i have seen him in and this is no exception, i didn't even realise he could act but even the characters which he has to pass himself off as i found completely believable, which is impressive considering the audience knows they are fake.the plot is genius and although it is not constant laughs all the way through it has plenty of other charms. a great film for people with a sense of humour.

although the plot of this film is a bit far-fetched, it is worth seeing just for the performances of michaels caine and gambon. the latter delivers a truly wonderful dublin accent. caine hams it up...which is exactly what the character he is playing should do. entertaining and fun, this is a hour and a half of easy watching.

i know this film has had a fairly rough ride from the critics, but i have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed it. the real star here is the fantastic dylan moran. he never fails to be both hilarious and convincing in all of his varied disguises. he also manages to radiate a sweet charm that belies his outrageous pratfalls. special mention must also go to michael gambon who plays for laughs with a brilliantly accurate and yet comedic inner city dublin accent. the only weak link is caine who, while obviously having a great laugh hamming it up, plays the least interesting and most unsympathetic character. it probably won't play that well overseas but it's well worth a watch all the same.

a ham actor without a penny. who better than michael caine to play such a character? he is totally and utterly hilarious but, as in most of caine's performances, he goes for it for real. the film seems to be a showcase of dylan moran and he's splendiferous in his double act with caine. this, however, is where the script falters. moran's impersonations should have been incorporated in a rather more organic way. they are too much of an act on their own and makes the potential plausibility of the plot fly out of the window. never mind. get it if you can find it. there is enough in it to make it a pleasurable journey.

at first i thought this film was going to annoy me.it was as though i had seen this movie somewhere before. the disillusioned hero, the father figure and the 9 year old sister who is older and wiser than her years (see gregory's girl), but then, not 15 minutes in, it became a laugh out loud, comic gem of a movie. dylan moran (who i thought was just going to bug me) was excellent. as was mr gambon and the mad scottish hitman. lena headey was extremely sexy. for half of the film i was trying to remember where i'd seen her before. the parole officer. she has the most amazing smile. but clearly the true hero of this film is mr caine. this man should do much more comedy. this ranks alongside some of his best comedy roles (without a clue, dirty rotten scoundrels). he is a pleasure to watch in all of his scenes but especially the end.no one can quite say f**k the way michael can. 

i like dylan moran from his work in black books, although i found some of his stand-up to be really indulgent in terms of long confused gaps... however i was intrigued to see this film starring he and michael caine and curiosity got the better of me.i was stunned.dylan's vocal range and characterisation of the different people he was playing in the film was absolutely perfect, something beyond the skills of a mere stand-up comedian and really truly on a par with alec guinness, john hurt and the other greats- truly he was skilled in his portrayal.michael caine was a very convincing prima donna and the standard british film device of having a precocious child on hand to be overly wise and withering worked- the only aspect i didn't really like was the unbelieveable plot feature of the chemistry between dolores and the cockney gangsta's hard man played by dylan.other than that, it was great.i also like the non-cop-out ending where it did end up happily ever after, but with mc getting a beating. ok, it's not exactly being strung up by your goolies and beijng disembowelled (which is what a real crime boss would do to you if you nicked £50k off them) but it showed at least a small measure of reality in the story.i liked the film, and i would recommend it to anyone- but- i would also warn them not to turn it off after 15 minutes because it started a bit slow. if you stick it out, then it will all come back.and with regards to the swearing- well, they're in ireland. it wouldn't be real otherwise.

to surmise, this film involves two actors (caine and moran) trying to con a gangster. the plot is flimsy at best as several plot holes occur throughout. however this normally shouldn't matter as the comedy should carry a film like this. there are some genuinely funny bits (mostly provided by dylan moran). however, other times, there are long melodramatic scenes that fail to add anything to the movie. caine's character seemed overdone to me. especially at the start, he continually quotes shakespeare and acts like a pompous actor. one could say he was playing the part properly but the character seemed to me flat and unfunny. overall i would say see only if a fan of the actors involved. otherwise wait for video or tv.

i was at the world premier of this movie, and have even met todd a couples times around town (once at olive garden). todd isn't a bad guy, he is just a small time film maker with little to no budget and big dreams.as for the movie, it is good if you like zombie films with very little plot and lots of blood and guts. you get to see some kansas city locations and lots of raw meat, what could be better? :-) look for the same 2 dozen people playing different zombies (with just a change of clothes or hats). you can have a good drinking game with this movie, take a shot whenever you see the same zombie in a different shirt.

todd sheets has created one of the greatest low budget zombie movies ever. the story is great, the gore is grand, the psychos are wicked! yet the movie is flawed by its petty dialogue and sluggish imaging at times.despite this zb2 delivers what any zombie movie should, gore, good plot, fast pace adventure into the macarbe. if only mr sheets had been given a 100k budget this movie would out do every zombie movie ever even the almighty dawn of the dead.but as time goes by he gets better and as he gets better more money comes into his pocket. thus allowing this man this modern day genius to craft his vision better.just remember that zombie bloodbath 2 was just one of his great stepping stones when he is atop of gore mountain

i am a glutton for b-movies. i love the old drive-in fare like this movie. this film, made for very little money it seems, does do one thing that some bigger budgeted films fail. it is cheezy. it is gory. it has no real plot, but it entertained me for an hour and a half. i was either laughing or covering my eyes in shock. there are a few great effects like a shot from inside a guy's mouth when he gets stabbed in the chin by a knife and it pokes up through his tongue and slams into the roof of his mouth, and one gross-out with a guy getting his eyeballs yanked out. but there is also loads of zombies, and some psycho killers patterned after texas chainsaw massacre, and a demon possessed scarecrow. i loved the dialogue that the killers spout as they torture and kill people. it has great camera work, and some cool editing tricks. this one is more original than the first bloodbath, and the undead look better, but it is still patterned after those dubbed trashy zombie movies of the 70's and 80's and it still has a cheeze factor that ranks mighty high. don't expect romero, just second-rate fulci. i would say that horror fans will like it, and it is funny and cheezy and a fast ride through b-movie land.

just watched this one again. i wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time. this is why these kind of movies are made, to entertain people and zombie bloodbath 2 does that for me and for everyone i have showed it to.the story concerns a group of teenagers in a van that run into a group of escaped convicts who have taken over an old farmhouse. when a scarecrow (that is actually a demon i think) gets disturbed, it comes to life and re-animates dead bodies from the local cemeteries. this leads our heroes to escape only to land in the arms of two insane killers that are in the process of torturing some people in a deli in a small town. pretty soon it's a showdown with humans fighting zombies.i loved this movie! from it's different formats (black and white film, video and digital cameras) to the very fast pace and great music, there was always something going on and it never bores you! sure, it's cheap, but you can tell that a great deal of care and hard work went into this film. i have read other reviews and all i can say is that these people have missed the point. if you want 35mm full moon fluff, or if you are into modern stuff like urban legend, then i say pass on this. if you like low budget stuff like gates of hell and evil dead, i say buy this now.the make-up and gore is very good, the acting is uneven at times, but over-all it is pretty good and the editing is very impressive. there is enough going on in this one to fill two more films! it is actually one of the better b-movies i have seen in ages.

just finished with zombie bloodbath part one on the amazing zombie bloodbath trilogy dvd from camp motion pictures. zombie bloodbath 2: rage of the undead is next. now this one left me a bit puzzled due to a few plot holes and some confusing twists here and there, but it is a better film on many levels. director todd sheets truly shows a major leap in style and talent between the two films. again, this is not for people who want gloss and hollywood style horror films, this is for people who like their zombies bloody, raw and grainy. the story as far as i could tell, was basically about two robbers who in 1945 try and steal from an elderly couple only to find that the couple are members of a cult. one guy is simply killed and the other, the one in charge, is basically turned into a scarecrow and crucified and they stand him in the nearby field, still alive but dying. cut to present day and a van full of college kids break down near a farmhouse. at the same time a group of convicts escape from a nearby jail. both groups end up at the same house. the house was the one the elderly coupled used to live in and when one of the convicts knocks down the scarecrow and takes it's jacket, it causes the scarecrow to wake up and he in turn brings the cult members back from the dead. wow. and this is all in the first half hour. there is another plot also going on in town where a couple of serial killer types have taken some workers at a deli hostage. this actually works though, as the people trapped in the house finally escape and end up in the same deli. most of the twists work out pretty good, but it is obvious that the film was just too complex in some spots for it's own good. it all ends in a huge showdown with the remaining heroes finding a delivery truck or something full of flesh eating bacteria vials. of course they throw it at the undead and cause some major melting and a few heads to explode and then we get an odd, thought provoking ending. first, let me say, that while it was not always easy to follow, i still had a major good time with this movie. it was fun and the acting was pretty darn good for a low budget effort. it was obvious that todd sheets was truly trying to bring more to the table than a typical zombie film, and in that regard, he has succeeded. it had better special effects than the first film, great pacing and some cool music and visuals, plus there is a true show-stopper of a shot from inside a mouth as a knife is jammed through it. care was taken here and it shows. the weakness lies in the scripting and in a few of the lazier performances. again, i recommend listening to the commentary track. it was even better than the first one and i learned a lot. like finding out that some of the scenes were shot on super 8 film for effect and that the film came back ruined from the lab and they could nit use it. and they had already been editing the film by the time they got the film back, so some of the confusion is from a few scenes not being in the film. also, i learned that todd sheets truly has a passion and love for making horror movies. it shows. the film is a good example of no budget cinema that could have used one more rewrite, but still shines with more style than most dv films i see. not quite as fun as the first film, though a better movie technically. i really admire sheets as one of the true innovators and trailblazers in the area of dv cinema... and this one is a great addition to the cheapo zombie genre!

ok, i got the dvd set last week and i am finally getting around to posting my reviews, but i sure liked this sequel in many ways.zombie bloodbath 2: rage of the undead. ok. this one movies at a fast clip, has some really good gore effects and some really well done atmosphere and style. i would actually go on record as saying this may be one of the most stylish dv shot flicks that i have bought. most of the time, i get rather angry at dv movies for being boring and looking like soap operas. even a movie like bone sickness that i like, has incredible stretches of dull. not this movie. it never stops long enough to let you catch your breath. although i wouldn't say i liked it better than the first film, i will say that sheets certainly improved technically in the two years in between films. this one has better gore, the inevitable zombie feeding scenes, scumbag characters, and a few returning actors (although their roles are different) mainly jerry angell as a pretty good psychopath with a killer mullet from hell. the shots are more ambitious as well as the script this time around because you can tell sheets is trying to pull a lot more off than he did in the first film. some of it works and some of it doesn't, but i have to say that at least he wasn't just trying to do a larger version of the first film. there was no mention this time around of a power plant of chemical spillage, just satanism and the occult that brings the undead back to life. so i say kudos to mr. sheets for trying to do something different with this one. i give this film two bloody thumbs up!

"you can't take it realistically." -sheetszombie bloodbath 2 (zb2) is a world all of its own. i've really never seen anything like it. the only thing i can think to compare it to is psychedelic drugs. forgive the clichéi don't simply mean that it's incoherent and absurd, though occasionally it is. i mean that it takes you through such a broad range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly as to overwhelm you, and when it's over, you find that it's all happened while you were sitting on the couch.it is worth noting that it's extremely low-budget, as a disclaimer to those who, after seeing "shaun of the dead," consider themselves fans of underground zombie films. also of note is that it is much more "brutal" than you'd expect. children get disemboweled, and someone taunts a teenage girl before shooting her in the groin. her corpse is subsequently "raped." these are certainly not flaws, and indeed i feel it is to the film's credit. but if it doesn't sound like your kind of movie, don't waste your time.(i don't mean to over-hype it, regarding brutality. don't go in expecting "inside" or something.) i hesitate to give away any of the plot, because it's really full of surprises. even the opening scene, which has nothing to do with zombies, is at once a classic horror scene and something quite original.man, i'm three paragraphs in and i've hardly said anything at all. here's why i thought the movie was awesome: 1. it's big, and it keeps moving. at one point, you expect it to turn into another notld clone, a board-up-the-windows movie where everyone stays in a farmhouse and argues with one another. by the end of the film, however, the farmhouse scenes will seem like a distant dream. there are also a number of outdoor, urban scenes. these are rare in low-budget zombie films.2. the makeup/gore is much better than zb1. more convincing and more creative. something kind of funny: the early zombies look really lame. then, halfway through, they suddenly look really good, with prosthetics and everything. some of them look like fulci zombies, some are reminiscent of mr. tongue from "day of the dead." and it's got big scenes of dozens of zombies shuffling around. never gets old.3. there's something oddly emotional about it. one character asserts that heaven exists, and that our dead/undead protagonists are now in heaven. in the context of the film, we believe it to be true. though the characters behave with typical horror film stupidity, they genuinely seem to care about each other, and accordingly, i found myself caring about them.4. the pacing is great. there's hardly a dull moment.my only observation that borders on criticism is that todd sheets comes up with the most bizarre dialog i've ever heard. i personally feel it adds to the experience, but i don't think he does it on purpose, so i can't fairly give the film a perfect rating. (example: when a car breaks down, the owner yells at the passengers. then he says something to the effect of, "sorry i yelled at you guys. you don't know what it's like to have your dad standing over you with a straight razor when you're five years old." wtf?) at the very end, it gets to be more than i can handle. involves a montage with bill clinton, and then some preachy end credits explaining the zombie metaphor. really, by this point, i was firmly re-living my drug experiences.highly recommended. 7/10.

do-it-yourself indie horror auteur todd sheets returns with another entertainingly atrocious nickel'n'dime shot-on-video clunker that's basically just a feeble excuse to sling around a lot of watery blood and gleaming guts as often as possible. an evil demonic scarecrow resurrects the dead as ravenous rot-faced zombies so they can feast on the living. a bunch of bickering college kids, a trio of dangerous escaped convicts led by the vicious slade (byron nichodemus hamming it up to an outrageous degree), two equally savage sleazeball hoodlums, and a trio of hottie sisters all have to do their best to survive this harrowing ordeal. that's it for the needlessly muddled and convoluted plot, but fortunately what this hilariously horrendous hoot lacks in narrative coherence (plenty) it more than compensates for with a pleasing plethora of gloriously gross'n'graphic gore. disgusting highlights include a woman having her fingers chopped off, a fatal gunshot to a young gal's groin, attempted necrophiliac rape, evisceration, and, of course, more repulsive entrail eating than you can shake a pile of moist intestines at. moreover, we've also got rough, grainy cinematography that constantly alternates between washed-out color and grimy black and white, ineptly staged fight scenes, lousy acting from a uniformly pathetic no-name cast (jerry angell in particular cops the top crummy thespic dishonors for his laughably abysmal histrionics as slimy no-count psycho criminal joe bob), a grating head-banging thrash metal soundtrack, and a generic shivery'n'ominous synthesizer score. let's not forget the ridiculous ending in which several of our survivors stumble across a few vials of flesh-eating bacteria to use on the shambling undead hordes. sure, this flick is pure dreck, but it has a certain endearingly abominable quality to it that in turn makes it a great deal of so-awful-it's-awesome grade z fun for hardcore aficionados of bad fright fare.

governments are elected for three year terms, as reg whithers said in 1973, the liberals were determined to continue forcing labor to the polls until they were defeated. if you ask me, this is portrayed in the docudrama, but, anyone who says kerr acted properly in this fails to acknowledge the self-serving and costly strategy of the liberal party of australia. on the series itself, i though max phipps was a poor whitlam, his voice was too ghostly. also, more of the key political players on both sides should have been used, though this may have been a reflection of budgetary constraints at the time. nevertheless, i recommend it, with caution.

i first saw this docudrama in the uk in the 1980's, and found myself intrigued and then astonished at how such good intentions could go so wrong. previous commentators (who are australian) have explained the unfolding plot's detail better than i ever could, but i would like to make an observation about what may lie behind the governor-generals 'uk sovereign power'. all modern laws, as i understand them, need an ethical or philosophical root to exist in the first place and to become a law at all. that being the case, and if say the conner's/khemlani mess had been possibly set up,(just how many businessmen/millionares had been served by khemlani, presumably without complaint), then the labour government could have been victims of 'entrapment', which would surely have had to have been investigated' by the governor-general as or until he could see that the budget standoff was a genuine result of whitlam's fecklessness, and not elaborate entrapment, sponsored by 'person or person's unknown'! if its the case that kerr in effect didn't have to refer to the law because fiscal circumstances overrides everything, then 'royal power' borders onto unreason; the implications in any commonwealth country is that 'fiscal' rules literally, and that any person or organisation has carte blanche to break any other rule, physical or mental, so long as they have the control over the purse strings ultimately!

as a canadian, i didn't know very much about the whitlam dismissal. i had read the wikipedia page about those events, but that was about it. earlier this year, when canada went through a potential constitutional crisis (it fizzled out, thankfully) that might have led to intervention by our governor-general, the whitlam dismissal was mentioned in the press. in an effort to learn more, i ordered the dvd of this mini-series through ebay.i was greatly impressed by how interesting the account was. as dramatic as events were, this could have been a very boring political drama. however, it was a pretty suspenseful mini-series. i was also impressed by how understandable it was, despite my lack of familiarity with australian politics. it didn't take long to figure out who everyone was, and what their roles were.having said that, it is not an entirely impartial account. malcolm fraser is certainly portrayed as a rather machiavellian figure, who lets no person or thing get in the way of his quest to be prime minister. gough whitlam is portrayed in a more noble, almost saintly, light. however, the actor portraying whitlam channels the nobility in such a way that it comes across more as pomposity. i thought that sir john kerr was portrayed in a fairly sympathetic manner.i must warn people that the dvd is of very poor quality. i understand that it was made for television in the early 80s, but it would appear that no effort was made to restore the picture quality or sound quality. it was very disappointing that no extras were added either. a documentary, or even some interviews with the historical figures, would have enhanced the experience, but there is nothing.i highly recommend this mini-series for anyone interested in the real-life events.

in nineteen eighty two when it was announced that the dismisal was going to be made , there was a storm of controversy. this was an event which still left open wounds in the hearts and minds of the australian people. after some changes (listen out for the well timed telephones ringing to disguise names) the dismissal went to air. it was nothing short of brilliant. the leads were perfect. max phipps as gough whitlam lead the way, closely followed by john stanton as malcolm fraser and the evergreen john mellion as sir john kerr. the time was created well, the feelings of the people were well done and the political elements were not two dimensionally made into melodrama as in so many american series. the dismissal was a faithful re-creation of a time in australia which some would rather forget and which we cannot forget. it did not take sides and it pointed out the mistakes and lies of both sides. it leaves one wanting to maintain the rage and change the constitution which still allows for this to all happen again. the dismissal is now available on dvd in australia. watch it, learn from it and learn about our modern history.

although i lived in australia in 1975, i moved overseas not long after, fed up with constant industrial unrest, the general worship of mediocrity - unless one is a sportsman! - and the complacency of so many australians who chose to ignore the breakneck pace of change taking place in countries to their north. consequently i missed the dismissal, along with many other australian-made tv dramas of the '80s and '90s, such as the superb janus and phoenix series, which i have since seen, along with wildside.to me the filmed story of the dismissal is fair and, as far as i am aware, accurate. however, as to public "outrage" it only shows one side of the picture, not how families were riven by the controversy. i know, as my two brothers would not speak to me for months afterward. but the commentary is, in my view, very one-sided throughout. the inescapable fact is that, notwithstanding fiery expressions of rage from a substantial proportion of the community, the australian electorate chose - and chose decisively - in favour of fraser, as they did again two years later. this apart, a historically accurate and superbly well acted docudrama.

after traveling around the world, it dawned on me that australia really lacks one thing that other countries have: history.fortunately or unfortunately, australia wasn't establish following a war, it has not had a civil war and most of its political history is rather..... boring! nothing "big" happened to mark some sort of turning point in australia's history.... until the dismissal of the whitlam government by the governor-general of australia - john kerr.for those who are australian, you can skip this paragraph and move onto the next. this is for the benefit of curious non-australians! australia was colonised by the british. as time went on, it became apparent that australia was capable of standing on its own two feet. accordingly, the uk granted australia permission to establish its own parliaments, laws, courts and so on. the law and politics of australia would no longer be provided directly from the british; rather, australia would be run by australians in their own right, even though the courts, precedents, parliament and so on is largely modeled on the british system. this shift was codified in the australian constitution. despite the fact that the constitution lawfully establishes australian governments, law-making procedures, courts (but for those who are curious - no bill of rights), their are two "pro-crown" sections that were included and remain there to this day. these are more or less regarded as the "reserve powers of the crown (king/queen of great britain)." the first group of sections relates to the creation of the office of the governor-general. briefly, the governor-general is considered the queen's chief representative in australia and is described as the "executive" branch of the australian government. when a piece of law is passed by the australian parliament, the constitution states that it only becomes law when it is signed by the governor-general. as such, the govenor-general is regarded by some as nothing more than a rubber stamper performing an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function on behalf of the crown. theoretically, the governor-general can refuse to sign a law passed by australian parliament if he thinks fit. for instance, if parliament passed a law which allows the police to shoot dead any australian over the age of 50 (hypothetically of course) then the gg could refuse to sign it and it would not become the law of the land. however, this power is theoretical and has (to date) never been exercised. by "convention" (which is the buzz word of the events leading to the dismissal), the governor-general virtually acts at the behest of the australian government and therefore, if the government passes law and the prime minister instructs the governor-general to sign it, he will, almost always without question. in fact, by "convention" the governor-general acts in accordance with the advice provided to him by the prime minister of the day (and the prime minister alone). the second aspect is section 64 of the constitution which states that the government ministers hold office at the governor-general's "pleasure." now the events of 1975 - covered in this film - gave rise to a precedent on this particular section: if the governor-general is somehow 'displeased' with the government and/or prime minister, it would appear that this section allows him to lawfully sack the government (which happened in 1975... hence the title of the film "the dismissal.") whether 'at the governor-general's pleasure' can be construed as "the unfettered right to dismiss" is a contentious point though that led to rather heated exchanges amongst australians at the time - especially considering that the governor-general is not elected by the people of australia.now that this background aspect is out of the way, let's get back to discussing the film. it was well made. the pace was patient, but didn't drag at all. the drama was well contained and very realistic. it didn't over-dramatise the events and most importantly, it did not present its point of view from one political perspective. on the contrary, i felt that it was fair and balanced, even though concluding text before the credits indicates that the film-makers probably didn't approve of the governor-general's decision to dismiss the whitlam government. but i wouldn't describe the film overall as bias in one direction or the other.in terms of accuracy, it was virtually spot on. the film-makers certainly did their homework and evidently read the books and writings from all the principle players concerned. there were a number of finer details that were somewhat skipped over, largely because they took a long time to explain and ultimately had little impact on the events of 1975, so i forgive them for that. further, i think it was difficult to recreate the public sentiment of that post-vietnam war era, but noyce pretty much pulled it off.finally, i was pleased that the film attempted to raise individual policies of both sides without becoming analytical, obsessive or judgmental over them. moreover, any that we're raised, for example connor's pipeline, had a great deal of relevance to the story. the film makers realised that their task was to tell the story of the events leading to the dismissal and not to present a political endorsement or opposition in relation to policies and viewpoints. this was smart because it meant that the film can't be accused of misrepresenting one side's policies.the dismissal is probably the most incredible piece of political history that has occurred in australia in its short life. i am glad that it has been crystallized in celluloid. essential viewing for any australian.

kennedy-miller could hardly have done a better job at tackling a very challenging exercise: making dry political events work as human drama, and providing an even-handed representation of explosively controversial subject matter.the key to its success on the first count is brilliant acting, although i was less impressed by max phipps' performance as gough whitlam than some other commenters here. the clear standouts for my money were john stanton as malcolm fraser and bill hunter as rex connor. the latter must have been one of the easiest casting choices in history - hunter could not have been more perfect for the role. on the second count, the series avoids the "myth of objectivity" trap through a narrator who articulates the sympathies of the director (phillip noyce, who more recently demonstrated his left-wing credentials in rabbit proof fence), while being carefully even-handed and sympathetic in its dramatic portrayal of all parties. the adherence to the lady kerr/lady macbeth theme popular among labor partisans was perhaps a little partial, though not ruinously so. in particular, credit is due for the sympathy shown to kerr and the extraordinarily difficult position he was placed in, whatever one might think of his actions.however, there is one sour note for which the producers were perhaps not entirely to blame - the portrayal of the jim cairns/juni morosi affair. those who come to the series with no background to these events will get the impression that cairns and morosi were the innocent victims of a smear campaign by a prurient gutter press. the producers may have been restrained in this respect by australia's stultifying defamation laws, and the recently demonstrated willingness of cairns and morosi to use them against those who suggested their relationship was sexual (which cairns would eventually admit to a year before his death). however, more could have been made of the bizarre fashion in which morosi managed cairns's office as treasurer.speaking of defamation, there are a couple of disorienting occasions where dialogue is obscured due to injunctions taken out by offended principals - by a beeping noise on one occasion, and a very loud telephone ring on another. a further curiosity: the dvd release excises a line from the comic relief scene where a customs officer (played by the late paul chubb) serves tirath khemlani on his arrival at sydney airport. next in the queue is a dishevelled looking hippie, who now receives only a disapproving glare from chubb when he presents his paperwork. in the original version, chubb said something along the lines of: "drug bust in bali, eh?". obviously this line no longer rings true in the wake of the schapelle corby case, which dramatically illustrated that those busted for drugs in bali can expect far worse than deportation.

this movie is just great... it starts out real slow and boring but as the movie progresses.....well the fun keeps on coming. the power of the movie is perhaps in it's subtle references to a lot (and i mean a lot) of other movies. for me the best part was perhaps the bruce lee/crouching tiger, hidden dragon scene. how the two actors switches from french to chinese or whatever asian language it was, it was awesome. then the jokes with the names, they are hilarious but perhaps you won't understand all of them when your an american (no offense). overall a great movie

the french people are not known to be great movie producers.though their amelie scores high points at the oscars. asterix et obelix is a very different film of what i am used to from the french. it is a great movie especially for kids. the only thing that boddert me was that it was spoken in french and subtiteld. normally with the english spoken movies (here in the netherlands) i don't have to read the subtitles. but with the french language you just have to read to understand. the story it self is just great with obelix who doesn't recall him self of beïng fat, but there also nice details mainly in names like brucewillix and malcomix. you all know the story from the comic books and this movie shows all most slide by slide the book. every thing is in it, from the sfinx nose braking till pirate red beards lose of three more ships. i would say a great movie for the weekend with the children.

this movie is quite better than the first one "astérix et obelix contre césar", but it is far away from perfection. the adaptation of the comic book is good, some of the pictures and the dialogs of the movie are the same as in the book. but there's few things that made the movie not as interresting as the animated movie released in 1968. for example the fighting between numerobis and amonbofis. this wasn't necessary or even credible, either for the little love story of astérix. there were also some stuff missing, like the songs that are in the animated movie, and some other things... i am deceived by the movie because they cutted in the stuff i was expecting tho see and they showed things that i did not wanted or needed to see. i know that it would have been very difficult to make the movie exactly the same than the comic book or the animated movie, but that's what i expected. in conclusion, even if the movie is good, i still prefer the animated movie, wich is in my opinion, far better.

the above line sums it up pretty good. the best assets of the comics are it's visual gags and word-jokes (the latter of which are almost impossible to translate, which is why the comics are at their best in their original language).both are quite hard to capture in film, which is why those will never be as good as the comics. movies are simply a different medium than comics. with that in mind, this movie does surprisingly well in capturing the fun of the comic.the word gags are bearable, and sometimes even funny (debouze does an amelie reference!). i have to mention that i watched the french version. if you don't watch the french version or your lack of understanding of the french language limits you to the subtitles, the word jokes will probably suck.the slapstick is okay as well; it's a very simple form of humor, and not really funny when you're older than twelve, but it captures the spirit of the comicbooks. the other visual jokes are the movie's saving grace for the older audience, as their often quite funny.the acting is totally over the top, but again, that's not annoying at all as it captures the spirit of the comicbooks. only depardieu and clavier don't really overact, which might be the reason some people think they didn't enjoy their roles (i didn't notice a thing). on the other hand jamel debouze and especially claude rich turn overacting into an artform. it's actually fun to watch. again, i fear it wouldn't be nearly as funny when the voices are dubbed.overall not a bad movie at all, much better than the previous one. it's not a classic and it doesn't dethrone the twelve tasks of asterix as my favourite asterix movie, but it's still worth seeing. the french version, that is. 7/10

if you are french native, then you find this movie extremely funny. it's good, just good! can though imagine that subtitles or translations don't mean much in english.

i don't know about the english version of this movie, but the norwegian translation is the funniest movie i've seen in many years. the characters say so many funny things and make so many weird references to current events that i'm amazed they kept having more options, like the architect who can never say the name of the wizard miraculix correctly. it becomes things like malcom(i)x and "utenriks", which is norwegian for foreign affairs.like the word "utenriks", many of the translations does not give any meaning in english, and probably not in french either, so the translators must have made up their own jokes, and done so very well. of course, they have a very good base to build on, with a film that's simply comical from beginning to end!recommended in all languages with a good translation!

in the original french version, the jokes of numérobis (great, funny voice - jamel debbrouze) are very funny.but in translated versions (i saw the german & english version) it's not half good than the original.but: goof special effects, almost the full comic (with differences, like the figure of lügnix (german name) is placed in an other comic book.sure, the asterix comic book are cult, but when you watch the animated comic movies from 1968 to 1998 you will see much better jokes, better story and the old "charme" and "flair" of the cult stories.for french speaking people i suggest to watch it in it's original version, with or without subtitles, where available in different languages.

the second live action outing for asterix is far better than the glued together elements of ten different stories that was called the first film, instead staying fairly close to the original comic.in a nutshell, queen cleopatra has made a bet with caeser to build a palace in egypt to show that the egyptians are a great people. royal architect edifis seeks the help of asterix, obelix and druid getafix to complete his task. there are several laugh out loud moments, some jokes that only the french might get (jibes at the 35 hour week) while others that are more universal. the big budget special effects are spectacular but overshadowed by the jokes from the original comic.depardieu and clavier still work brilliantly as a pair while monica bellucci makes perfect casting as cleopatra. also, for fans of the comics the hilarious pirates get a look making up for their absence in film 1.

a great combination: - chabat's humor - uderzo/goscinny world and characters - limited presence of christian clavierthe original comics was great - one of the better of an overall great series - and alain chabat, one of the funniest member of the famous french group les nuls, was able to film, replicate and supplement, the great work done by goscinny and uderzo by cleverly enforcing the story, giving to djamel debouze his best role (at last a little bit far from his usual repeatable part), gathering a bunch of great actors (gerard darmon is wonderful, as often, chabat himself is a great cesar).in addition, while being obligated to keep on with christian clavier as asterix, chabat cleverly tuned down his role in the movie to give prominence to darmon and debouze... which is always a good idea!=> great environment, great scenario, great director, great actors, great humor, beautiful cleopatra... this movie would have deserved a 10 if clavier hadn't been involved.

i watched asterix and obelix in operation cleopatra, which was my first exposure to the live action version of the classic comic. like the comic the whole movie is full of jokes based upon puns, anachronistic jokes and slapstick gags which rarely fall flat.asterix and obelix are gauls who use a strength potion to fight the roman legions in their native gaul. here they end up in egypt helping a friend build cesar's palace (yes its puny) in three months to prove the egyptians are just as good as the romans.the reason i picked this up was because monica belluci is cleopatra. she's good but the role is little more than a cameo. however, even though she's rarely in the film i didn't care since its so clever and the jokes so funny i was in hysterics. i loved it. i loved it so much that i can't understand why the movies have never been released in the united states.the import dvd has the film in english dub- which is quite good especially when you consider that when you watch it in the longer french version the puns (and hence the jokes) are not always apparent since they are aural, so if you read the names wrong the jokes are lost. most of the jokes between the full french version and the shorter english dub seem to be exactly the same, though some have been changed sometimes for the better and some times for the worse. personally i'm gonna stick with the dub when i watch this again since its easier to pick up the jokes and enjoy the humor.you really will want to see this if you love puns and low brow, but clever humor this is a great comedy

it is the first time i can recall where an adaptation did exactly like the book... in fact, only jokes were added to the story rather than content blended or removed!such as the egyptian slave cellularis who had difficulty transmitting, um, communicating, lol! or when tidivinnus was played like a quasi-sith lord and got annoyed when the roman empire endured a blow, the general ordered for the empire to..? ah, watch the movie folks!i can easily believe that this picture was one of the most expensive in french cinema history and for my part it was worth it, depardieux was excellent as the roman bashing and boar chomping obelix. clavier playing the little indomitable gaul was perfect and a far cry from his days as the bumbling squire of jean reno in "just visiting."the fight-scene between artifis and edifis was hilarious and was nice to see the matrix theme was not borrowed to despoil an otherwise perfect battle!redbeard the pirate and his crew almost stole the picture, from scuttling their own ship to being the engine for otis' (edifis' assistant) invention used at the very end.i understand there's asterix and the olympics with many of the same team back, by toutatis, i plan to view that too!

i just managed to find a copy of "mission cleopatra," which is not as easy as you would think for someone living in the united states. so far, i have only watched about the first 10 minutes of the film, and i can safely say that i laughed more in those 10 minutes than i did watching the entirety of the *first* live action asterix movie.i am watching the dubbed version, and while the dubbing job is a little disconcerting, i have found the movie to be very funny and true to the book. i see that people on here have said that the dubbed version is very inferior to the subtitled version, that may very well be true, and after i watch the subtitled version (also on my dvd) i may have to come on here and alter my review. as it stands, though, i find it to be a very entertaining movie, and it more than makes up for the mess which they made out of the first movie.

i've read every adventure of asterix and obelix at least 5 times and i'm also a fan of "les nuls" and "les robins des bois" and jamel so i expected a lot from this movie.... and i finally got satisfied. unlike the first adaptation of asterix on the big screen (astérix et obélix contre césar) which wasn't a real success besides the appearance of laetitia casta, this one really captures the spirit of the comic (and we get the beautiful monica bellucci). in the first movie the director tried to be too realistic about the time where the story is set and it killed the whole spirit that made asterix hilarious. in this one all the clothing, the way of talking and everything is identical to goscinny and uderzo's work... more, it really stick to the original story with the downside that we know pretty much everything that's going to happen but alain chabat gave us a few surprises at the end. i really enjoyed that movie, and everytime that the first sign of boringness starts to appear, jamel comes in and makes us laugh like crazy. this movie is a big mix of all the kind of humor i really like, and even if maybe it's mixing it too much, i can't help but to like it. so, if you like asterix and the humor of all these young talents that started in "nulle part ailleurs" (a french mix of the tonight show and snl) go see this movie.

a wonderful little production. the filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-bbc fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. the actors are extremely well chosen- michael sheen not only "has got all the polari" but he has all the voices down pat too! you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. a masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. the realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears. it plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with halliwell's murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.

michael sheen shines like the afternoon sun in this brilliant portrayal of a comic genius. if you are familiar with kenneth williams' mannerisms and diaries then this drama captures the essence of them perfectly. when i read about kenneth hoovering in his swimming trunks i laughed and then it was brought to life on the screen, but this time i didn't laugh as it was put into perspective as the actions of a repressed and tortured man. it must have been such a lonely existence being in kenneth's skin, craving attention but shunning it when it truly mattered! the last 20 minutes are heart-breaking as you see kenneth gradually sink to the depths of despair and consider suicide as the only alternative. i have seen it a dozen times and still cry uncontrollably at the point where he bids goodnight to louie. i cannot recommend this drama enough. sexually explicit but it drives home the fact that kenneth couldn't let anyone invade his world and this is where the sadness of the man lies. for a genius who brought happiness to so many, it's such a shame that his private life was filled with such despair and sadness. pauly.

this is a "docu-drama" of (mostly) the later years of kw's life, with nearly all the parts played by actors (but spot which tv quartermaster plays himself!). it was made for the bbc4 arts channel but my guess is there will be syndication and dvd releases soon. kw is ably played by the excellent michael sheen, here repeating his previous stage role with great success. most of the supporting cast are also very good, and a nice touch is the recreation of period tv appearances with the new actors. this is not, however, light viewing - anyone familiar with kw's diaries and general unhappy demeanour will already know how twisted he could be in later life - so don't expect 80 minutes of carry on styled buffoonery, since the emphasis is decidedly downbeat throughout. recommended, but it's tragi-comic, indeed.

i would like to vent my displeasure at nbc canceling las vegas. the show had been top notch for the past 5years. tom sellecks addition was great. he really brought a nice fresh addition to the show. what does nbc have now? lame reality and night time game shows. i mean come on keep the old and tired law and order? not even putting jack mccoy as da can keep the show interesting. gee let's keep quality program like deal or no deal or ed? er should be put out to pasture to. nbc is worse now than it was in pre seinfeld cheers days. with cable and internet, nbc cannot afford to fall flat on its face.please bring back vegas! i remember when homicide life on the street ended the way it did. at least they had a two hour series final. hey cbs are you listening? please pick up vegas it is a great show.

i think that vanessa marcil is the best actor in the cast. she makes sam one of the best character on the show. james cann is also pretty good. i love it when he worried about delinda. one of my favorite scenes in when ed and delinda are beating the crap out of some guy. that was funny. nikki cox is also good and she has great chemistry with josh duhamel. lara flynn boyle was awesome in her guest role. i wish they hadn't killed her off. the show has a great cast with no bad actors which isn't something you often see on tv. i still think vanessa marcil is the best though. she should have got an emmy in my opinion. it's a shame the show was cancelled

very reliable entertainment, as las vegas amuses as well as intrigues, very light hearted and very much bolstered by josh duhanel!! i like this television show and i think that many people watch it as a form of escapist voyeurism...voyeurism in this case is very positive, and many females in this series are very nice to look at...this show incorporates las vegas legends such as wayne newton as intermittent characters to authenticate the las vegas genre!! there have been copious depictions of sin city, this is one of the better efforts...the producers and directors are lucky to have james caan in the show, as he is very much a totally accomplished actor!!! by and large, i like the t.v. show las vegas and i watch it on fridays, i watched it on mondays as well, but with monday night football, i could see why nbc switched it to fridays...nonetheless, i like las vegas a lot!!

just got into viewing program for the first time recently - the 2-hour "kidnapping" program. don't know why i didn't sooner?? james caan is outstanding and wholly-believable in the role as the chief honcho at the featured 5* vegas complex.so often, programs like this have one or more in the ensemble who are either outright annoying, or seem to have been picked because they must be related to the producer or director.that is certainly not the case with this program. along with caan, all of the primary and supporting cast are engaging attractive, and believable. the guest actors are well-chosen. the stories i've seen are interesting, and the show presents a good view of the city as well.this is an entertaining program, and one i hope will remain. i don't know how i managed to miss it for so long, but plan to tivo it from now on.

big fat liar is what you get when you combine terrific writing, great production, and an emphasis on clever ideas over adolescent pap. the two stars work great together, and--what can i say? amanda bynes shines. putting "irkel" and lee majors in the film were brilliant touches. watch this film with your kids. if you don't laugh throughout it, you must not have been paying attention.

i saw this movie on my flight from philly to denver. the screen was three rows in front of me and about 12" x 10". so i really wasn't going to watch it. but i like malcolm in the middle, so i thought i'd watch just a few minutes. next thing i know i'm sucked in, having a great time, and was pleased as how good it was and how fast it seemed to make the time go by. i agree with that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment. being one of the older baby boomers, i was also pleased to see lee majors with a role in the movie, as with a couple of other actors who were famous (jamiel?) "yesterday" but are out of the spotlight today poking fun at themselves.it's your basic "kid is wronged, kid gets even (and then some), and everyone enjoys themselves in the process". no heavy thinking, no great analysis needed. just a good fun way to pass the time.3.5 out of 5.

even people who dislike the film, usually because they find the ending confused, should appreciate the strong acting of elijah wood & joseph mazello who played the two young leads in this movie.spoiler warning: at a literal level, the ending makes no sense. people who think the ending makes some sense at other levels are divided between those who 1) think the younger brother was killed by the step-father either the one time mike (the older boy) was away dealing with the neighborhood gang, or flew off the wishing spot in his wagon to escape the situation through death & those 2) who think the younger brother is imaginary & his flying off in the wagon transformed into a flying machine signals his overcoming the abusive situation.i favor 2). it makes a lot of sense in terms of the way many children deal with abusive situations. it is not uncommon for an abused child to split his or her psyche & project the abused self into something else; a stuffed animal, even an imaginary friend. this way, it makes a lot more sense that it is always the younger boy who is abused & never mike. in reality, it is unlikely for one of two brothers to get all the abuse, although that does happen. also, it is bobby, the younger brother who is also the encouraging one, the one who insists that they can overcome the situation. also, the death of a real-life sibling through abuse would have been too shattering for an adult with this in his history to transform into as upbeat a fantasy ending as this.

i started watching this one very tensed because i heard so many different things about it. somewhere i read it was a drama about child abuse and rated pg-13 for violence. another critic said it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure of kids (and i thought it was also for kids to watch). well, now i've seen it so many times and still don't know in which category to put it. it is extremely funny at times but terribly sad and depressing the next moment. because of the nice relationship and the adventures i would like to recommend this film to all the youngsters i know but i fear the somber atmosphere is not suitable for children. because of the perfect performances and the magic of the film i must say this nevertheless: watch it, especially the kids! the last thing i have to say is that i hate the scriptwriter for letting poor bobby never see his family again after having fled from the king (who didn't even return to terrorize the remained mary and mikey). it is very good for this film not to have a perfect happy ending with everybody being happy - and i didn't expect it to - but this solution left me very, very sad!

"big fat liar" comes as a welcome -- shallow, but welcome -- breath of fresh air after one too many films featuring bathrooms, bodily fluids, pets on acid, gaseous jokes and crotch gags. after all, "see spot run," "max keeble's big move" and "snow dogs" had signaled the degenerative spiral of kiddie movie-making. worse is the realization that the young audience would later be satiated by the smuttier offerings of "not another teen movie" and "slackers." written by nickelodeon producers dan schneider and brian robbins (who coincidentally co-starred on the '80s sitcom "head of the class"), the film stars frankie muniz as jason, who's always ready with a good lie to get out of scrapes. (where's the english paper? dad choked on a swedish meatball.) his teacher (sandra oh) issues an ultimatum: turn in the paper by the end of the day or take summer school. jason whips out a story called "big fat liar" and is struck en route to school by a limousine carrying insensitive hollywood producer marty wolf (paul giamatti). wolf gives him a ride, but jason leaves his paper behind. no one will hear the truth this time, and dad tells him he's lost his trust.months later, jason and best friend kaylee (amanda bynes) see a movie preview for "big fat liar," and head off to los angeles to wreak havoc on wolf's life -- all to get a confession that he stole jason's paper to make the film. they even gain the sympathy of some of wolf's abused employees, including his assistant (amanda detmer), former chauffeur (donald faison), movie star (jaleel "urkel" white, playing himself) and stunt coordinator (a much-aged lee majors).because "big fat liar" is without the edge that his sitcom "malcolm in the middle" is known for, muniz is easy to root for but doesn't have much to work with. likewise for bynes, who headlines her own tracey ullman-like sketch show on nickelodeon. all the hamminess is given to giamatti, whose eyes bulge and cheeks wiggle with every sneering insult.the film gets snaps just by attempting the high road, and should be enjoyed by its target audience (especially since most of the high jinks occur on the universal studios lot). but here's one head-scratcher: the message is that it pays to tell the truth. but didn't we just see jason getting to his payback by telling white lies throughout the film? well, at least there's no poop.

spoiler nothing but spoileri have to add my name to the list of folks who feel that the other viewers just don't get it. but no one has even mentioned the "s" word so far as i have seen.while i agree that the kid died i think we can be more specific: he committed suicide. he races down the slope in an old wagon, shoots off the cliff and..."flies away". maybe the whole account of the form of death is allegory or maybe he does commit suicide in a wagon as laid out. in either case, he "flies away" (c'mon, not that tough a metaphor).maybe i just have a thing for tom hanks, but i was ok with the narration. besides he is raising $ for the ww2 memorial and you gotta love him for that.oh yeah, i loved the movie and found it incredibly moving.

i'm not sure as to call this movie a children's drama or a fantasy film. when i first watched this i couldn't really make out the ending and that's the only part of movie that's seemed to lack depth and left me a bit depressed for awhile. then i watched it a second time and realised how great the acting was and was clueless as to why it received the meager attention it did at the time.unforgettable performances by the young mazzello and wood should have made this film a classic.although the it was probably intended to be a fantasy/drama by the original writer/director (evans), once donner took over he presumably made it with a more dramatical outlook especially the ending, which left a lot to be desired as to what really happened to bobby - was he killed?, did he escape & really do all those fantastic journeys?, or was it just an imaginary story woven by hanks to prove a point to the kids?but in all it didn't provide the closure of a happy ending that we are so used to in a children's film. perhaps it's because it's not just that.to see what may have been a more classical ending check out the official elijah wood site where you'll find the first rough draft script of the conclusion of the movie(presumably by the original writer)also a note of the music by hans zimmer which is one the best soundtracks i've ever heard, a mixture of childish and dark sentiments throughout the movie. a great cd to get hold of if you can.

this movie is really an entertaining, good clean fun movie, for the kiddies. kaley(played by nickelodeon's talented amanda) is the sidekick to a rambunctious boy who has a hard time telling the truth. he eventually works this into a movie script that gets stolen. i won't bore you with the details. if you have children and want to see an entertaining if not thrilling kids movie, i highly recommend this one.

a hilarious comedy by the best director ever, oz scott. the list of eighties tv icons goes on and on. milano (who's the boss), yothers (family ties), stone (mr. belvedere), robinson (night court), jackee (227), d'abo (wonder years), walston (mr. hand!!!). it is one of the funniest movies ever. great lines, meaningless subplots, cheesy, bad acting. it is about a group of high school kids who need to pass drivers' ed. mac from night court needs them to pass their final exam, or he'll be fired. great performance by brian bloom as the jerk/kinda cool guy riko conner, but is nothing compared to b.d. wong's kiki (pronounced kee-chee). a great movie for all ages, so bad it's good.

this movie is well made, it is beautiful and wise. it is heart-warming. it is great. and again it shows how great peter falk is... he is fantastic and he even gets better, the older he gets! thank you, peter falk! thank you very much for this gem of a movie! this movie entertains. there is lot of wisdom in this movie. there is lot of humor in this movie. there is life in this movie... and meaning. this movie shows, how life can be.peter falk is in that movie. he is just great! where is the oscar for peter falk? he deserves it so very much.peter falk just turned 80. i do sincerely hope that there will be more movies!walter j. langbein

this film exhibits dear irony, shaggy-dog roundabout story lines woven with subtle cultural references, classic parallels, masterful use of rich saturated color, and fabulous rendition of chase scenes a'la keystone cops. the ensemble work of the cast and entire crew is charming. literally. how else could i go on so? this film speaks to everyone. the deft and poignant use of so many universal archetypes: that's what makes this film so deep down satisfying. as a mature student of film, i find checking out contains all the vital elements. sure and bergorra, it's not the godfather, but would serve perfectly as follow up; tragedy's mandatory satyr play that sweetly binds our collective cathartic wounds.get thee to a theatre and see this film, you will be treated to a unique masterpiece.

take someone you love or want to love and go see this film.it touches you in all the right places.all the other reviewers here have said it all.perhaps the cynical will not be impressed.they only seem to like the stuff that leaves you depressed for days.this film is ga-run-teed to stay with you for life.i am so gratified that the director is not usc trained.this validates my premise that there is too much mediocrity and conformity in film these days.it is because of the usc lockstep mentality and inbreeding.hooray for jeff hare and richard marcus, cast and crew. well done!
