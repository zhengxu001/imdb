end of days, starts off pretty well, arnie plays a down and out cop (a very similar character to riggs in lethal weapon) and the story looks like a kind of serial killer action thriller that will be good entertainment.sadly it fails to deliver, arnie is as good as we we have come to expect, but as for gabriel byrne i expect him to chose his roles more carefully than this. cast as the devil; this is probably the weakest portrayal of the lord of darkness ever.this movie gets a little too daft for me, and the end sequence, aside from being very weak, is visually one of the worst i've seen in recent years, cgi is have been better than this since the early nineties.quite simply not good enough. 4/10 (watch it if you have too, but don't expect too much, cause it won't deliver)

this is a really bad waste of your time. i would probably rather go watch some documentary than this; it's really that bad.the acting is really terrible, and you can tell that the producers had a low budget because of the terrible picture quality. it's by far on the low end of the scale; don't waste your money on it.i have a really hard time believing the person who made this movie that it would fare well. i had to watch it with the kids when my mother rented it because she thought it would be good for the kids. even the kids (3, 4, 6, and 8) all thought it was pretty boring.i agree with the other commenter, spongebob would be a lot better to watch than this.overall: just don't watch it. don't. don't.

first, i should say that i've seen the '39 version at least 100 times; know all the dialog, and have read the '36 play, which is different from the '39 and contains nuggets of gold of its own. this version is as flat as a lifetime movie on adultery. there's a reason you haven't seen an expensive campaign of tv ads for it. according to entertainment weekly, bening hated the catty tone of the original and how the women spent the whole time going to war on each other. guess what??! that was booth's intent. it was a slick, theatrical take on gossip, adultery, and back-biting among a set of well-heeled manhattan socialites. the crowd that made this new version had no intention of honoring the original source material. they pick at it weirdly, putting in half a scene here and half a scene there that come from the first version. bette midler (who is in just a few scenes and acts the old countess part in a broad, grinning style) doesn't have any context in this version. she mentions going after "buck," which is a key element in the original -- then he's never mentioned again. this movie is so dull that i'm not going to over-analyze it, but here are a few things that i found unbelievable: > mary haines bragging to her domestic staff: "i can suck the nails out of a board!" right. great writing. norma shearer could've done a line reading on that & gotten an oscar nom, right? > a compassionate sylvia fowler!!!??? annette bening got what she wanted, and the movie just sort of withers away. claire booth used sylvia as the comic engine that swept through the play. as portrayed immortally by rosalind russell, she was an ignorant, spiteful woman who rattled off reams of petty, ridiculous, irresistible dialog that is still classic and quotable. she wasn't above biting paulette godard's ankle. the 2008 filmmakers decided that this character had to die. in killing her off, they killed the movie.

i believe an entire book can be written about the odyssey to remake the classic film on which this film is loosely based. when hollywood first started talking about such enterprise, the reaction was always negative because there were just too many aspects that could have gone wrong, starting with the solid ensemble that made the original unforgettable, and that's exactly where things begin souring here, with the selection of actresses that otherwise can do remarkable work, but that are not suited to the parts, and sadly enough, have been directed with the heavy hand of a director that doesn't understand or appreciate the source material.it seems as if there is no focus or direction, or as if the direction that has been taken is to obliterate anything that was good about the original film. this is called an updating, as in let's drain the story out of humor, snappy dialogue, and any interesting premise. most of all, let's prove that women have come a long way, except that the problem is that we don't really get (at least by watching this film) where the women are truly going.for starters, casting meg ryan in the central role proves almost fatal to the movie because somehow she seems to have locked herself into some sort of limbo where women don't really change appearances, even after 20 years of working in the movies. her mary which proved to be a difficult role in the 30's, somehow grew from her interaction with the other stereotypes, like dorothy in "the wizard of oz" by learning, observing, and realizing that she had a choice in the matter. it might not have been a choice that women would celebrate nowadays, but it was fun ride, and part of the fun, was the catty, silly, sometimes slapstick routines that elevated that movie into the realm of the sublime. in here, we are down to earth with a thud. by changing the nature of sylvia, the film has lost a lot of its spark, and it isn't in anyway annette bening's fault. i couldn't help but admiring how she tried to save this sinking ship and got a sinking feeling as she struggled with the horrible lines she was handled. thankfully i entertained myself by looking at some of her terrific outfits and kept reminding myself how talented this lady really was. her sylvia is wise but flawed, and she could have been a great creation. unfortunately ms. english wasn't paying attention to her own work and loses control of the one character that could have turned the film into a fresh direction.yet that wasn't the biggest blasphemy of them all. in the original, we have joan crawford doing probably one of the best performances by a woman. her crystal is legendary, with conniving lines, incendiary moves, duplicitous maneuvers, and some very sexy poses. she was the link between the male and the female, and through her we knew what the whole catastrophe was about. she provided the tension between men and women. she was dangerous, sexy, the ultimate femme fatale. a woman of intelligence that we feared and admired, and most importantly, we wanted to destroy to save our heroine. eva mendes, as gorgeous as she is, is two dimensional in this outing because of weak writing, and once again, some bad casting.there are more atrocities in the film, such as the addition of a terrible role for mensing as the dedicated mother who lives for having babies, and the rather annoying lesbian turn by pinkett. then comes the biggest waste of talent in the movie, as bette middler, who is a little unrecognizable in her make up, shows the spark of what could have been. her acidic delivery reminds us of the contemporary angle the film could have taken. her words revive and put a big of much needed naughtiness in the film, and it is exciting to see that it could really fly, then she is gone. she is in the film all of six minutes, and she fades away in the middle of the muddle.here is a movie that raised our anticipation level and truly disappointed us, a film that could have joined the successful "sex in the city" who made an amazing transition to the big screen because it respected its source material and didn't compromise. it gave us more, bigger and better adaptation. it truly updated what had made it successful before. "the women" in its present reincarnation needs to go back and rework itself, much like "the hulk" did it this year, find more suitable performers, a really good writer, and most of all, someone who truly treasures what good movies are about.

as a spanish tourist in los angeles and a fanatic movie lover i committed a terrible mistake. i went to see "the women" the remake of one of my all time favorites. i've seen the original many many times, in fact i own it. my rushing to see the remake was based on diane english, the woman responsible for "murphy brown" my though was: how bad can it be? she must know what she's doing. well, i don't know what to say. i don't understand what happened. the botoxed women is a rather depressing affair. meg ryan or whoever played mary - she looked a bit like a grotesque version of meg ryan...another actress perhaps wearing a meg ryan mask - she doesn't bring to the character nothing of what norma shearer did in 1939. the new one is a tired, unconvincing prototype of what has become a farce within a farce. the "friends" annette bening, debra messing, jada pinket smith are as disconnected as anything i've ever seen and if this wasn't enough: eva mendes as crystal, the character created by joan crawford in one of her best and funniest performances. eva mendes's casting is really the poster sign for how wrong, how ill conceived this commercial attempt turned up. i didn't give it a 1 out respect for candice bergen and cloris leachman

insane really. even if you haven't seen the original george cukor movie with norma shearer, joan crawford, rosalind russell, paulette goddard, joan fontaine and a cast of a thousand other stars you may dismiss this forced, politically correct, depressing comedy. depressing for many different reasons. meg ryan for one. what has she done to herself? her face can hardly move. that alone puts her miles away from norma shearer. annette bening should be suing the dp and debra messing, what the hell was she doing here? actresses with no connection in the public's subconscious trying to pass for friends, totally unconvincingly. eva mendes in the joan crawford part is an outrageous piece of miscasting. what a terrible idea! her character is like a trans-gender performer without any taste or subtlety. bizarre to think that a woman adapted and directed this women.the only positive things i can mention are a short but very funny appearance by bette midler and cloris leachman as the housekeeper.

i'm sorry but i cannot even partly agree with some comments on this awful piece of sh...english is not my native language, because i'm a german citizen, so please do not blame me for inappropriate grammar structures or something *gg i cannot understand why this movie got such a high rating? 6.3??? are you kidding me? this movie has completely no sense, not even a seem of good acting...when i looked at the comments on the da vinci code, which has - i think - nearly the same rating, i had to bang my head on the table , because i watched 00 schneider directly after sakrileg, and oh my god , there are worlds between them.the majority of the posters in this board tears every hyped movie to pieces while rating this crime of movie making with a 6.3 and denominates helge as a genius. of course , he knows how to make money, but i think the main aspect of your opinions is the fact, that german isn't your native language and you just ignore - or rather don't notice the bunch of crap which is said in the sentences. ok , i must confess that some scenes are funny, but all in all , a 6.3 is just too much for my compatriot ;)

every once in a while, an indie comes along that has an awesome cast and a story that sounds really interesting and can't-miss, but the movie sucks. some recent films belonging to this unfortunate category are "levity" and "the safety of objects", and now here's "the united states of leland".said awesome cast includes ryan gosling, kevin spacey, don cheadle, jena malone, lena olin, michelle williams, chris klein, and kerry washington. gosling plays leland p. fitzgerald, the teenage son of a famous author (spacey) who commits a disturbing and unforgivable crime (murdering a retarded child), but doesn't remember it and doesn't seem to have any sort of motive. don cheadle plays a teacher in juvenile hall who is trying to understand leland (and also exploit him by writing a book about him), and jena malone is his ex-girlfriend. we see their deteriorating relationship (due to her heroin addiction) in flashback. sounds like an awesome little drama, huh? i thought so, too. the fact is that this movie is just badly, badly written. the dialogue and narration are painfully pretentious and laden with irritating platitudes about "life", the characters are all two-dimensional indie cliches, and while it does manage to make leland sympathetic in some ways, it glosses over his crime. for the most part, there's no problem with the acting. gosling (who was oscar-worthy in "the believer") is a tremendously talented young actor, but the way they're written, none of these characters (least of all leland) even feel like real people, so there's not much he can do but mumble his ridiculous lines and look sad. jena malone is the most memorable. she has one of the most expressive faces i've ever seen. even playing an underwritten character in a bad movie like this, she can break your heart with one look. when she's got good material to work with (as in "donnie darko" or "the dangerous lives of altar boys"), she's really amazing. but this is not good material. maybe after a massive rewrite it could have been something worthwhile, but as it is, "the united states of leland" is ponderous, inert, and for a movie that seems in love with how "deep" it is, it's really shallow.

how much do i love this film?! now i'm not a fan of bad films, but i do love a film that is so bad it's good. this is one of those. juan pablo di pace has a great butt, looks fab on screen, and definitely doesn't make a bad turn at his acting debut (i believe). billy zane is suitably mean and moody, though i still constantly feel that there is something more in him. i felt it in titanic, the look on his face when la winslet spat on him for example, totally broken, shocked, and put-down ... fierce! kelly brook is a pretty face ... no seriously, i think that's it! it's worth catching this to see one really hot guy, some big bra fillers from brook, nasty growling from billy, laugh at the dialogue, revel in the scenery and madness of the whole affair ... i'm gona go watch it again now - yes, i bought it!!!

first off, i just watched a movie on showtime called survival island. it says it was a 2006 movie with billy zane and since i like him and couldn't sleep i thought i would check it out. looked interesting. watched it, and decided to look up on the imdb who was this new face juan pablo di pace and omg i could not believe it, this movie has been renamed three and will be a new movie?? it is playing again in 1 hr and 30 mins on showtime channel again and this date is may 28 and edt or florida time. you can check your showtime listings by title and see it. i wont get into details so you can see the movie but at one point there is a lady in a white bikini that goes into the water taking it all off, you see her naked body.... when she runs back out of the water you see her bottoms on. funny, there are a lot of other mess ups too. i can't believe by coincidence i decided to look up this movie... go figure! wonder if the people renaming it sold it to some movie studio to put out but it is already playing on showtime, ha ha. good laugh. i give it 1-1/2 stars. c-, d+ movie.

"three" is a seriously dumb shipwreck movie. masquerading as a psychological thriller, it's closest relative is the monumentally superior "dead calm" (also featuring billy zane). "dead calm" provided well drawn characters to root for in the form of sam neil and nicole kidman's grieving parents attempting to re-define their relationship on an ocean cruise. they end up being terrorised by zane's adrift psycho-killer. it provided sharp, increasingly ratcheted suspense, a scary feeling of claustrophobia in open seas as the cat and mouse game of life and death unfolded."three" suffers from poorly drawn characterisation (the audience doesn't care what happens to any of them), a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device, a total lack of suspense or excitement and some thudding, hammy performances from the principal players. zane in particular goes way over the top in an irritatingly mannered fashion. in "dead calm" he was menacing, wired and seething with barely controlled sexual violence. here he is bombastic, petulant slimy, and unravelled. and where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars? and how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year? ms brook is very picturesque, stunningly pretty, but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly over-inflated by some sort of life-raft pump. they do, however, succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her. dramatic actress, in the purest sense of the term, she is not. the guy playing the voodoo-hexed manuel, the third component of this sorry triangle, could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood - no one would notice. in fact, judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way, driftwood represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes (excuse pun).plus sides: the scenery is nice and the cinematography (above and below the water) is credible.i'm guessing this had a very limited (if any) theatrical release or went straight to rental and retail dvd. the reason for this is it's not very good. if you want something decent along these lines, get "dead calm." it was made by people who knew a bit about cinema.

all those who are into the pc culture are aghast at the dogmatic christian view of this film, claiming it contains racist ideation and/or religious intolerance.those who don't care about this, but are oriented towards slick production values and competent acting are dismayed at the lack of such here.those who decry both of these are apoplectic that this production was let loose on the general public, as evidenced in comments here.what is an interesting premise, which isn't original, but is a combination of ghost and from beyond, is dealt with in a rather immature manner in this film, yet done with gusto. what the crew and actors lacked in sensibility, professional abilities and technical expertise is somewhat offset by the intensity they display.it isn't nearly as bad as many here think, and would have been fine in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense, and it is enough below mediocrity to elicit laughs and groans. however, it unfolds with enough intensity to keep interest throughout, and is close to on par with a corman-produced entry of his earliest period of work, or the material of arkoff or sam katzman. if you get it for $2 (or less) as did i, you won't feel disappointed, but will wish you could have had a say in how it was made.

i am completely into this type of story line but once the movie fired up, i honestly said out loud, " i just rented a two dollar budget christian pos". the only thing i could find to like about this film was it has a descent story but it was awfully executed. horrible actors, horrible direction and producing.the director and producer need to go watch the cube before trying to pull off a movie in a single room. there was absolutely nothing that kept you intrigued to the point that you didn't notice you were in the same room the entire movie. horrible! the two main actresses were very easy on the eyes and you could tell that was the director counting on to hold your attention. but these two and their bios can speak to this, are horrible in front of the camera.don't rent this. unless you are blind, because it might go up a few stars if you only listen to it.

the weakest of the 'old' crew star trek films, this film suffers from an awful script and obvious budget constraints, particularly in the mishandled finale. the bones of a good movie are here, and the directing from shatner is not as bad as is commonly made out, but the characters end up speaking and acting way out of the style that the previous 3 films had carefully established. lawrence luckinbull is convincing as the renegade vulcan with msyterious and mystical powers to influence people and these powers are responsible for some of the best scenes, particularly for deforest kelley who shines as 'bones' mccoy in this his second last movie. however, as good as those scenes are, they ultimately do not advance the plot, and end up feeling as more of a distraction. a great score from the ever reliable goldsmith and some funny scenes in yosemite between the main three are not enough to cover the gaping chasms in the plot, and the frankly embarassing attempts at humour serve only to alienate even die hard trekkies. all in all, a wealth of possibilities which although it fails to deliver, has its moments. watch out for the pool table in the bar brawl scene...

that's the only word i can think of to describe this movie. not waste as in a waste of time (any time spent with these characters is never wasted), but waste as in a waste of opportunities.when i see this movie, i think of all the star trek novels that were written which would have made a much better film than the story shatner chose. the setup was like an average television episode, while the finish felt like the climax (if you can call it that) of the first movie.nimoy, in directing ii-iv, focused on the character of spock--how he faced the kobayashi maru outside of the classroom, and how he handled his emotional live now that he had a chance to start fresh. shatner could have done the same with kirk here, but he didn't. we don't know much about kirk that we didn't know before. again, one of the novels would have been better--try "my enemy, my ally" for a very interesting character study of our friend james t. the minor characters are used mostly for cute bits, and the scotty-uhura subplot seems way out of left field, particularly since the subtext in the original series was sulu-uhura.even hardcore fans can't find much to enjoy here. sorry, but it's true.

the fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments (much less hundreds of 'votes') speaks volumes as to the decline of western (or at least american) civilization.read proust, you morons!! or at least dave barry or calvin and hobbes anthologies.chuck norris. wrap your brains around the fact that in order to rate or write about this series you'd have to have spent minutes..nay, hours...viewing this poor sod treading the boards and spewing lines with less emotional impact than the gal who used to call off the correct time on your local service.please don't watch this show!! spare your few remaining brain cells!
